0,pMD,Wonderful Humans Working Together on a  Strong Mission,2022-01-13,5.0,Senior Video Producer,"This company has a strong mission to help people. It feels good to do rewarding work and see the impact instantly. pMD is directly helping providers and their patients. Being a part of that is special. 

There are lots of travel opportunities which is a huge plus. I got to travel all over the USA and had a fantastic time with the team while doing so! 

One of the biggest pros for me is the team. Everyone is so welcoming! pMD actively works hard on building a positive working environment for its team members.",At pMD you will be asked to wear lots of different hats regardless of the role. If you are trying to focus intensely on one thing in your career this may not be the right fit for you.
1,pMD,Flexibility Matters,2021-10-17,5.0,Executive Assistant,"Reflecting on last year, the main thing that stood out to me was pMD's flexibility. 2020 was a year for companies to show their true colors and how they handle everything when challenges arise. We all know what a difficult year it was and how the pandemic affected all of our lives. For me, the one thing that felt stable was my job. I was grateful to be surrounded by this team and be working for a company that was doing something to help.

At the time, I was based out of the company headquarters in the Bay Area. After all that 2020 threw at me, I had decided that I wanted to move out of the city so I could be closer to family and start building a home (house, dog, etc). I expressed this to my manager assuming that it may not work but instead was extremely supported in this decision. I also saw this flexibility with some of my other colleagues. Some moved to different states and those who had to transition to having their children at home were given schedule flexibility.

What makes pMD feel so different from other companies is that the management cares about you as a person both in professional growth and personal happiness. As long as you are open and honest with your manager and team, you can have the life and career that you want.",The ever-present challenges of the healthcare industry require adaptability and tenacity. The mission of the company is bold and you have to want to make a difference in healthcare to work at pMD.
2,pMD,A real work family,2021-10-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture at pMD is really what makes pMD a great place to work. From the moment you start your career with pMD you know that everyone is invested in your success as all team members participate in your onboarding through 1:1 trainings, guidance, mentoring, or other avenues of support. Though there are many departments within pMD, it really feels like one big team as we all chip in where we can to ensure success. pMD is very fast paced. There is never a boring moment and the work is certainly not monotonous.
My favorite thing about pMD is how much leadership cares about the team and takes steps to show their appreciation each day. In turn the team works so hard! Everyone has a weekly 1:1 with their leader and this provides an opportunity to discuss areas of opportunity for improvement or advancement. Senior leadership is constantly communicating goals, feedback, and future plans to the team. Team members are treated like humans, with leadership not only encouraging, but making it possible to focus on your well being outside of work.","There are often competing priorities for different departments, which can be overwhelming at times as each team member has both core and role specific responsibilities. 
pMD would not be suited for someone who prefers one specific role or dislikes customer service as we are very customer facing."
3,pMD,Tech Company with its priorities straight,2021-10-15,5.0,Software Engineer,"From day 1 of working at pMD, it is always been glaringly obvious that the company has its priorities in order. The company shows excellent care for its employees through everything from the onboarding process they provide, to the way employees greet to each other, to the work/life balance that it encourages, to the rewards it provides for meeting company goals. Everything in pMD culture shows that it's life-blood is truly caring about people and its employees. This builds an absolutely stellar environment across departments, and really makes pMD feel like its own little community.","No matter how many times I've been asked for cons about working at pMD, I never can really come up with anything. The only thing I can think of is that I do wish I could spend more time with my coworkers, and since pMD is in large part remote, they are scattered across the country making it a bit hard to see them all during the current travel climate."
4,pMD,More than just a best place to work,2021-10-15,5.0,Operations,"pMD is more than just a best place to work, it's the best place I can imagine to build a career. In my years at pMD I've been provided with countless opportunities for growth and development, constant new challenges, and increasing responsibility. Every day I come to work and know that I am part of helping to solve problems in healthcare for our patients and providers. The team is a close knit community of colleagues, mentors, and friends. pMD embraces a family-friendly culture, and through every life change I've felt supported and cared for as an individual, not just an employee. If you want to work in an environment where you can grow quickly, will be challenged and pushed to be your best, and feel supported and invested in at each step along the way, pMD is the place for you.","If you want a job where you just clock in and clock out, complacency is commonplace, and each day is always the same, pMD is not the place for you. This is a highly motivated and driven team trying to solve big problems. Things move fast and you will be asked to wear many hats in order to best serve our customers, which is not for everyone."
5,pMD,The absolute best place to work!,2021-10-08,5.0,Marketing,"pMD is by far the best organization I've ever worked for! Amazing team, check. Strong mission and ethos centered on making a positive impact, check. Mentorship program focused on career growth, check. Great balance between autonomy and guidance, check. Clearly articulated business vision, check. Leadership whose number one priority is the well-being and happiness of their people, double-check.

You won't find a group of more talented, passionate, kind, collaborative, and hard-working people anywhere.","The fast-paced environment is not for everyone. The work is not easy and at times it can be hard to balance all of the different hats you need to wear at the same time. If you're looking for a role with a narrow specialized focus, pMD may not be the place for you. However, that being said, if like stepping outside of your comfort zone and find it exciting to work in a role that does not have as heavily defined boundaries, then this is absolutely the place to do so."
6,pMD,Impactful work with a great team,2021-09-21,5.0,Engineer,"pMD continues to impress! As we've grown, the company has changed for the better. The leadership team listens to feedback and has made great decisions in a difficult time as the pandemic has changed how we interact with our customers. I feel personally and professionally supported by my manager, and I know that if I have issues I can bring them up and we can work towards a solution together. That's pretty hard to find in a company! 

The work can be challenging, but the feeling of having a positive impact on doctors' and patients' lives is worth the effort. Even with the company growth and remote work over the past year, I still feel pretty close with my colleagues. The team is supportive and friendly, and I know we'll always have a good time when we have the opportunity to get together.","Rapid growth can be difficult & requires each employee to be willing to grow professionally and adjust to the changing landscape. For the right person, this is a huge pro, but it's not for everyone"
7,pMD,"Don’t walk, RUN the other way. Honest review of pMD",2022-02-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to work for Donald Trump, you’ll get a similar experience working at pMD. The leadership team and particularly the CEO & founder, Philippe d’Offay, are the real problem. They will always, without a doubt, put the priorities of the company over the people. Philippe surrounds himself with loyalists and sycophants, and there is no place for criticism or different ideas. They mask much of this with happy hours, prizes, and the narrative that you’re changing healthcare in the US. But it comes at a price - there is no psychological safety, they use cult-like tactics to get you to work long hours, and unless you’re on the leadership team you’re a pawn in their game. The company is eerily similar to a cult, and I truly don’t think Philippe would see that as an insult. 

Of course it’s not all bad - I’ve made some good friends at the company and the experience working directly with doctors is rewarding. But it’s simply not worth sacrificing your sanity to gain work friends and health tech experience. There are plenty of other great health tech companies in the Bay Area that have honest leadership and good perks. 

An important note if you’re reading this: the reviews on this page are NOT honest. The leadership team has an obsession with forcing everyone in the company to write positive reviews. If you include something negative about the company, they will track you down by process of elimination. It’s terrifying. Just look at all the Cons from the reviews - they all say the same thing. 
 
This is my honest review. I you’re considering a role at pMD - as an engineer, account executive, operations, or marketing, I sincerely hope you do your due diligence and strongly consider working for a different company.",See the company review above
8,pMD,pMD's Growth and Your Growth,2021-07-14,5.0,Sales,"One of my favorite parts of working at pMD continues to be that each day will bring something new and exciting. Even after years of working at pMD, I continue to learn something new each day, whether it’s how to be a better manager, or the technical challenges of insurance credentialing.

If you want, pMD will push you to develop your skill sets deeply and quickly, while supporting you along the way. pMD gives opportunities to those who want to work hard and want to make a positive impact on healthcare, providers and patients. The best part is pMD rewards those who put in the work and providers many mentorship opportunities along the way. 

I joined pMD because I wanted to learn more about how healthcare worked and the ever-changing healthcare environment, and I’ve gotten that and so much more out of my time at pMD. I’ve made amazing friends, been able to travel all over the U.S. and truly be involved in my learning of how practices of all sizes operate; whether it’s a large national healthcare organization operate or a solo independent practitioner. 

So if you want to be involved in healthcare, grow yourself and your career and have fun while doing it, pMD could be the place for you!","Working at pMD is rewarding, but challenging work."
9,pMD,The best people,2021-06-04,5.0,Vice President of Software Engineering,"I feel proud to be part of the pMD team. Every day I'm blown away by the talented, passionate, driven, fun, helpful, and caring people that I get to work with. When you're trying to achieve the impossible (solving the problems in healthcare for doctors and patients), it helps so much to know that these incredible teammates stand with you. It's honestly inspiring and motivates me every day to show up early and do my best work.

I've had a long and rewarding career at pMD so far, and I hope to continue at this company for the rest of my career. I've received exceptional mentorship from those I've work with over the years, and I try hard to pay that forward every day to others at pMD. I think we have a mentoring culture that helps each person accelerate their career development and personal growth, and I'm excited to see that culture flourish as COVID subsides and we're able to spend more time in person again.

pMD is not an easy place to work. We're trying to do something very, very difficult in an industry that is notoriously resistant to change. Personally, I think that's a pro, not a con. I had easy at a previous employer, and I got bored after 2 years. It's hard to imagine ever becoming bored or complacent at pMD.","It's not for everyone. Those who aren't passionate about helping others, or who want to coast, should look elsewhere."
10,pMD,Awesome Place to Work,2021-09-28,5.0,Account Executive,"pMD rocks. This is a company that is focused on building a strong community and is committed to each individual's career growth, not to mention the team truly cares about the product and recognizes the importance of a healthy work/life balance. My time at pMD has been nothing but positive -- the leadership is rock solid and is invested in the success of the employees as well as the company as a whole. Mentors are around every corner and are eager to help. You really have the opportunity to pave your own career path here. Each employee plays an integral part in every facet of the company which works well to sharpen and develop new skills. pMD is a challenging, but very rewarding place to work.","It's very fast paced and while each employee plays a role in every aspect of the company (customer success, business development, account management, etc.), that might not be a great fit for everyone."
11,pMD,pMD is the bomb!,2021-10-14,5.0,Chief Morale Officer,"pMD is a very unique company. Being privately owned gives us a huge edge. We can radically change direction at any moment without having to wait for outside approval. Not only are we a leader in the medical industry, but we keep gaining more and more of a lead. We also have a mission to save lives and that feels awesome!

We've been able to adapt to our record growth in these uncertain times with strong hiring, onboarding, mentoring and teamwork. Our ability to convert new hires into contributing team members is extraordinary.

Lastly, we are undergoing a metamorphosis at pMD. We've introduced a new service that is exceeding expectations. It has presented opportunities across the board for individuals to setup and fill leadership roles that didn't exist a year ago.",We've always prided ourselves on having an in-person culture. Transitioning from in-person to remote has been a challenge.
12,pMD,Lots of opportunity for growth and career development,2021-10-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Friendly positive team that truly cares and encourages your growth
- Pushes employees to create challenging stretch goals and take on different responsibilities outside of daily tasks; work isn't monotonous and you have the opportunities to constantly learn new things
- Cross-functional teams are heavily utilized and gives you exposure to other parts of the company that you otherwise may not have insight about","- You will wear many hats, so if you aren't comfortable taking on things outside of your primary role it might not be a good fit
- Every team member is customer facing and interacts with pMD users, so may not be a good fit if you aren't into that"
13,pMD,Excited for my First Year Anniversary,2021-10-14,5.0,Technical Lead,"My personal growth as well as the company's over my first year has been amazing. I have learned a ton and have not only been part of the company growing success, I have been encourage and supported in new developments to improve the company moving forward. My interactions with co-workers and customers has been extremely positive. I am so glad I made the career move to pMD!","The SF headquarters was less ideal than previously thought due to COVID as well as the building under construction, making it less and less ideal to work there. I am glad the company made the move to a new corporate headquarters and look forward to the is becoming another ""pro"" for the company in the near future"
14,pMD,Great Company with Fantastic Colleagues,2021-07-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"pMD is a great company for many reasons. The benefits are amazing and you spend your day surrounded by people that are at the top of their field. pMD gives employees ownership in projects that creates a level of team work and responsibility that is unheard of.

pMD also listens to employees and makes every effort to make the employee feel valued and in a good space. Just this past year alone in the pandemic, pMD has made every effort to make each individual feel secure .","I really cannot think of any downsides to working at pMD. The leadership and team is passionate about what we do and we all work very hard, but we play hard and have a lot of fun as well.

Working remotely and not seeing my team mates face to face on implementations and account management trips since the start of the pandemic has been a challenge but that is no fault of pMD. It is just the situation that we are in."
15,pMD,Exceptional Company Made Of Exceptional Individuals,2021-10-06,5.0,Lead Software Engineer,pMD has a dedicated team of highly intelligent and trustworthy individuals who really care about making a difference in healthcare. pMD has a strong culture of supporting one-another to help each-other grow professionally as well as grow the company. pMD leads by example and is dedicated to supporting its customers and users.,"Not a typical 9 to 5. You can be given a lot of responsibility very quickly, if you are ready for it. This keeps your days very interesting and provides a lot of opportunities for professional development, but can require managing multiple responsibilities at the same time."
16,pMD,"Change is hard, but change is also exciting... and good for career growth!",2021-11-05,5.0,Product Team,"Since I've worked at pMD, the direction of the company and the product has changed several times. Despite the changes in goals, the core values of the team and the family-like feel has remained constant. This is what I love most about pMD --- it stays true to its values of a customer-first and high growth company. 

Because pMD has always been and always will be a customer-first company, it doesn't always make for the easiest job, but it is rewarding when you can see tangible results in helping out a patient or provider. For me, doesn't get more rewarding than being able to help an elderly patient use Telehealth so they can to get the medicine they need. 

The hyper growth culture at pMD is demanding, and your experience is completely dependent on the ""you get out what you put in..."" mentality, which means it isn't necessarily for everyone. While I would love for all my friends to work at pMD, I also understand that it wouldn't be a place where all my friends would thrive (some friends would, but not all). Strictly my experience, but I love the hyper speed focus because doing everything all at once is inherently part of who I am as a person as well. 

There have been big product direction changes recently, especially in engineering that contributed to initial confusion and biting our own tail, but the new product direction is super exciting, and I can't wait to see it come to fruition! The new change in direction has exposed some tough industry-related problems to solve, but tackling the difficult problems is what makes pMD different, special, and on track for hyper growth! While you do wear more than one hat at times, it also means you have many opportunities to develop new skills that will ultimately contribute to your career growth (either at pMD or elsewhere).","The wear multiple hats culture is a core part of pMD, so if you like the freedom of working with other departments, outside of your main role, on projects towards achieving a common goal, you will love it here. If you prefer to focus on strictly just the role title you were hired for (nothing wrong with that), then you may find it more difficult to feel fulfilled and part of the team.

We do have some younger leaders, but all leaders started somewhere. pMD has started developing these new leaders and implemented consistent mentorship sessions between the newer leaders and the more experienced leaders."
17,pMD,Truly a best place to work,2021-09-10,5.0,Operations,"The pMD is made up of a team of amazing individuals who are truly committed to improving the world of health care and health care technology. As the company continues to grow in size and scope, we are able to partner with health care providers and health systems to create and implement provider, patient, and billing solutions and truly make a difference for the better in so many lives.

In addition to the work we do with health care providers, the pMD team itself is collaborative, supportive, intelligent, and fun! The sky is the limit in terms of career development and opportunities for growth.","Work at pMD is fast-paced, and employees are nearly always working on multiple high-priority projects at one time. This is exciting but can be overwhelming to some."
18,pMD,"Through a crazy year, pMD continues to shine",2021-08-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Last year was a trying year for everyone and pMD continued its reputation of being a great company to work for. Being here for over five years, I have seen a lot of changes and this past year was no exemption. We were challenged with a pandemic, remote work and had to pivot to ensuring our customers and employees were happy. pMD made every effort possible to ensure that we all continued to be as productive at home as we were in office. The company bent over backwards and provided any and everything we needed to be successful... and it showed as we had one of the most successful years in company history. I will always be grateful to work for pMD and look forward to our continued growth and success as we navigate the new normal.",Can't think of anything at the moment.
19,pMD,Fulfilling and fast-paced!,2021-05-03,5.0,Operations Coordinator,"I've really appreciated my time at pMD! I feel like because there is such an emphasis on all employees being customer-facing and taking on the same responsibilities, there is a real sense of collaboration and teamwork. I'd never worked with engineers who have social skills before pMD, it's so refreshing. This environment helps ensure that the employees understand their product, and know how to communicate and empathize better with our customer base. 

The supervisors I've worked with have been very encouraging and open, and take the time to make sure that I'm not overwhelmed and feel comfortable letting them know if I need to delegate. I enjoy the fast pace, and that my day is always changing, it keeps me productive and refreshed in a way that doing repetitive tasks doesn't. I feel that expectations are explained clearly, with metrics and documentation for everything. As someone who enjoys a challenge and keeping organized notes on everything I do, the workflow suits me very well.

Hitting my goals feels validating, and I'm happy with the incentives I receive. I genuinely enjoy interacting with clients, I feel very positively about this company and proud of the work we do.","You have to be adaptable and definitely a good communicator! Being comfortable coordinating with your teammates and interacting with providers is a must, ""lone wolf"" personality types would not excel here."
20,pMD,Not your ordinary company,2021-10-14,4.0,Billing Specialist,"I think the most important asset of pMD is the growth and mentorship opportunities. Leadership wants to see you grow, they also take the time to learn and acknowledge what attributes you bring to the company. Leadership also listens to you when you have input, which most employees know is rare. 

The people that work for pMD are a different breed. As an employee with pMD, I take pride in knowing that I can reach out to anyone for support. We all work extremely well together, rather it's a company outing or a huge implementation. 

I can honestly say that I've learned and grown as an individual since starting at pMD.","It is definitely a fast-paced environment! This would not be an ideal position for someone who isn't flexible and ready to learn whatever it takes to make things happen. 

PMD is not a cookie-cutter company, we are a strong team of individuals taking huge steps daily to make an impact on healthcare."
21,pMD,Great company,2021-10-18,5.0,Vice President of Business Development,"Because the company is a slow money company (not a PE owned enterprise looking to be consolidated) the company can risk trying to solve complicated problems without knowing at the beginning exactly how we will solve it. If any industry needs this it is Healthcare!

As a team member you get to work on a wide variety of things and are well supported in solving for ideal customer results.","Typical growth pains related to expanding a team.

You have to like doing a lot of different things in day."
22,pMD,Massive opportunities,2021-10-14,5.0,Director of Engineering,"Incredibly dynamic, mission oriented, fast moving, ample mentorship, and great collaborative culture. There are huge opportunities in healthcare and making an impact on people lives. The company is constantly finding ways to grow and make a difference.","The mission of the company is so large that it can be overwhelming, so individual should not be afraid to ask for help when they need it."
23,pMD,Hone your skills and build new ones,2021-09-16,5.0,Sales Manager,"I never do the same thing and each day is an opportunity to learn/do something new. I'm lucky to build/hone my skills in my specific role and to also build new skills and relationships by directly supporting customers and the broader team. And with this new experience, I'm encouraged to think about my longer-term career goals and have felt supported to take risks that advance me along my chosen path.",being mindful of top priorities helps to make the volume of work a manageable task
24,pMD,"Awesome growth, awesome people!",2021-02-24,5.0,Director of Engineering,"pMD's got a great mission, that makes you feel good that what you do matters. While being here over the years, the company proves time and time again that it really cares about people. It's not just about the doctors, or just the patients, but everyone - including it's employees that make the magic happen. 

The DNA of pMD consists of just awesome personalities who are willing to go above and beyond to help each other out. It's amazing how, even folks hired during the pandemic, working completely remotely, feels like family. The pMD culture is so inclusive, it's a great environment to work at and nurture a career.

The growth opportunities are limitless, as I've witness firsthand myself over the years. This is not an exaggeration as I started as a Level 1 engineer and rose up the be a Director of my own team. We strive to mentor everyone into a future leader and take pride in watching others succeed.","It's a fast paced, high activity company that might not be suited to everyone, like someone who wants to clock in and out of work each day. pMD is constantly vigilant in maintaining a good work life balance, but Healthcare doesn't sleep, and we are in that space."
25,pMD,"Amend, Modify and Transform",2021-09-17,5.0,Executive Assistant,"The company that exists now is different from when I joined. With constant open discussions with clients and team members, the company is amenable to change. Processes, product offerings, benefits, and staff are always getting better.",The company is like an always changing start-up. Your role never remains stagnant. There is alway lots of things to do. You earn your salary.
26,pMD,Great Place to work with lots of opportunities to grow,2021-10-15,5.0,Billing and Collections,The workplace culture is awesome and management is the best. They are very understanding and supportive to your needs. The company provides great perks  and work/home balance and flexibility.,I do not have any bad experiences to share...
27,pMD,Amazing place to work,2021-11-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,pMD has given me back the desire to learn and grow. Everyone spends their days supporting each other and helping each other.,"The days are busy, but rewarding."

Business continues to grow and expansion into new lines of business have huge potential.,"Very busy because of the growth, but they are hiring to meet the need while still maintaining standards."
30,pMD,No two days the same,2021-07-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"No two days are the same at pMD and that keeps it fun and interesting! Even on busy days, you know your work is positively impacting the healthcare industry, which I find rewarding. The team is compromised of hard-working individuals who also like to have fun and care for one another. I’m lucky to call pMD my employer.","There are not many cons to working here! If you are looking for a predictable, routine job, pMD may not be for you."
31,pMD,Dedicated team with great company culture!,2021-01-20,5.0,Operations Coordinator,"I am a newer hire to the team and I feel extremely grateful to have joined at seemingly just the right time. The company is experiencing exponential growth and it's easy to see why. My coworkers are intelligent, hard working, and some of the most welcoming people I've had the pleasure to work with. The work itself is very fulfilling, continuing to contribute in the healthcare field to help providers give the best possible care to their patients. This company cares about their customers, the patients, and its employees. Early on, I've been given the opportunity to hold large responsibilities and execute on fundamental tasks. They trust you and help you grow, and I see a very exciting future with pMD.","The fast-paced environment requires you to grow and adjust just as quickly. You need to have a strong work ethic and be ready to hit the ground running, but your co-workers, and the value of the work itself make it worthwhile."
32,pMD,Toxic culture and terrible work-life balance,2021-10-22,1.0,Software Engineer,"Many of the people are genuinely nice. You can learn a lot too, because you have to do so many things. If you are right out of college and don't mind working nonstop or about the bad benefits, you can be promoted fast and then go to a better company with your new position.","Reviews on this site and other reviews they get awards for might as well be fake. pMD is very heavy-handed in regards to how you answer reviews about them and they stagger reviews throughout the year and assign you a calendar block to write one so they can tell who wrote what. They also know how to game the system, so you are asked to write a glassdoor review every year. That's why there are so many good reviews here, they are all from the same people over and over again. Three bad reviews were written on Glassdoor earlier this year, and the company went on what felt like a witch-hunt. We had lots of meetings with managers, execs, the whole company to discuss them. Some managers even openly made fun of the negative feedback. It was all badly handled and scary. All the company cares about are awards and recognition, so there is no way to provide real internal feedback anonymously.

The benefits are bad for the industry, no 401k match, no equity, no bonuses. Pmd pays all premiums for health, dental and vision, but the deductibles and max amounts are so high it doesn't really matter. Also no dedicated sick leave, just a pool of PTO you use for everything. There are some weird fringe benefits that sound cool at face value but don't really make sense.

One of the worst things about pmd is the work life balance is terrible. You are expected to be available 24/7, and around the holidays you will likely be regularly asked to cancel vacation to meet massive unrealistic sales goals. You have to take shifts during work days, nights, and weekends for front-line support so doctors and patients can call and yell at you. All the work is so overwhelming. Everyone at pMD does pretty much every job and that's not an exaggeration. You are expected to do account management, sales, implementation, customer support, and more AND somehow do all your engineering work. Plus since everyone does everything there are big gaps that just get dropped on the floor since no one person is responsible. There's not much long term planning, so a lot of things get treated as an emergency and have to be done immediately. This means lots of nights and weekends to actually get the work done your supposed to. I have been really burned out for a long time and know others that are too, but management doesn't seem to actually care or want to make things better.

All the Pmd middle managers have been at the company for a long time but don't know how to manage and the company isn't really focused on helping them become better managers. They just feel like normal engineers with a lot of power. The executive team feels basically absent. I don't know about sales or operations, but the engineering group takes such a hands off approach they have no clue whats happening in the group. In the last several years I've been at pmd, I've hardly ever heard the CEO say much of anything. Pmd feels like it has a toxic yes man culture. Everyone has to smile and pretend how great it is, but I know lots of other people who are unhappy too. You are always told you can see a need and fill it without direct permission and that the company is open and honest, but in my experience that just is not true. I have seen other emplyyes getting talked down to publicly because they suggested a good idea for a change. Instead the culture feels like your either with us or against us. Lately the company has been pushing that we're all one big family, and if you have something critical to say you're hurting your family. I have found myself asking who is steering the ship a lot at Pmd. Also the engineering team has really bad diversity. It is not good that a established tech company with so many emplyees has zero women engineers.

Finally COVID has been handled really poorly. The day pmd finally took action was also the day the city shut down later that day. For some reason Pmd also promised a company trip to Seychelles right as the worst of Covid was ramping up, and now it keeps getting further delayed for things like big Covid waves making Seychelles itself shut down. That trip feels more like a fantasy at this point, just something to hold over you. Also during the worst of covid, lots of flying employees to visit with doctors and be in hospitals all around the country. After the first all hands where they insisted everyone come back to the office if possible, they announced one of the team members who traveled caught Covid. The whole thing has felt really reactionary and scary and shows what the company actually thinks of its motto to ""save lives""."
33,pMD,Great people that are obsessed with the daily pursuit of making a difference in healthcare,2021-07-15,5.0,Director of Sales,"The last year+ has given me new perspective on the uniqueness and appreciation I have for pMD as we all have navigated a global pandemic. I’ve never been so proud to work for a company that has gone above and beyond in supporting our team members and clients in an extremely difficult time. At pMD, you’re not an employee, you’re a team member and part of the family. The company has prioritized the pursuit of the physical and mental well-being of our team members in generously offering options to make us the best versions of ourselves. 

Additionally, we’ve been able to see tangible proof of literally saving practices from closing down in the pandemic due to our ability to provide software and services. We’ve spoken with patients who have been incredibly grateful for a friendly 24/7 customer service offering that helps them and their families get the care they need. That type of impact has been extremely rewarding in the face of challenging times. 

As we continue to grow, I’m encouraged that the company can add incredibly smart and talented individuals that are committed to a team first environment and culture while being committed to making a difference in an industry that has endless opportunities for improvement. pMD remains focused on solving more problems in healthcare, and I’m extremely optimistic about what the future holds for pMD!","pMD is a fast paced environment that requires you to adapt and consistently challenge yourself. That can lead to rapid growth and meaningful impact, but it may not be for everyone."
34,pMD,"Great people, great culture, fulfilling careers!",2021-03-17,5.0,Human Resources Operations,"pMD is a honestly a great company that supports not only your professional growth within the organization but also personal by providing an excellent work life balance with a flexible schedules. Led by a very transparent and goal oriented driven mission, pMD is managed by great leadership that values each and everyone of their team members. Although the interview and orientation process is rigorous, you will feel like family on the first day. Your opinions are always heard and taken into consideration. Not to mention, everyone takes so much pride in their work. I feel so incredibly lucky to work with a such passionate, hard working team!","Must be a team player, be able to multitask and manage time efficiently. Travel and customer service skills are necessary! Definitely a fast-pace company; you must be comfortable being uncomfortable-be prepared to quickly adapt and challenge yourself!"
35,pMD,Great company for professional growth with a supportive atmosphere,2021-08-30,4.0,Marketing,"pMD offers a lot of great opportunities to develop your professional skillset and contribute towards an important goal of improving the healthcare landscape for both healthcare professionals and patients. There are also opportunities for growth and advancing within your role at the company. As someone who mostly focuses on my specialty role in marketing, this job has challenged me to get outside my comfort zone and interact more with the customer facing side of the company, while still maintaining a supportive team professional environment where I feel like I can rely on my colleagues to provide guidance if I ever need it. And even beyond that feeling of mentorship, everyone at the company is very friendly and fun to work with. There's a lot of care and attention paid to making sure pMD has a company culture of camaraderie amongst all of the employees, and there's a lot of communication across all team members which is incredibly valuable as well. We also have a lot of monthly meetings with the whole team, so you always feel like you have a strong sense of what the company's goals are and are given an opportunity to voice your thoughts.

Regarding my own specialty role within the company, I feel like this job gives me a lot of creative freedom in how I can approach projects related to marketing, while still having clearly defined goals and objectives from management team members. Having the responsibility and confidence to use my creative input and skills is something that I've felt is sometimes lacking in other companies, but my colleagues at pMD really encourage me and often rely on me to share my opinion and insight on projects, which is something I greatly appreciate. Just having the sense that my work is actually contributing to and having an impact on the company and our mission (and having that recognized on a regular basis) is a very rewarding feeling. I've also found pMD to be very accommodating of my professional and personal needs, both in terms of providing compensation for work equipment or expenses, as well as my own home life needs, being able to work from home remotely, and being flexible and accommodating with my schedule (this is especially important when you're working with other remote people who live in various parts across the country in different timezones.)

As someone who enjoys traveling for work, I really appreciate pMD's enthusiasm for sending us to various locations to meet with clients and do work across the country. While pMD makes working from home very easy to do, having the opportunity to meet and work with colleagues and clients in person is also something I find extremely valuable in this company. However, since we are working through a pandemic, it's important to note that pMD takes great care to make sure employees are both comfortable and safe regarding any work travel, and if you don't feel safe doing so for whatever reason, you're certainly under no obligation to go on a work trip.","For people who are new to the healthcare landscape, as well as software development, there might be a bit more of a learning curve in the onboarding process. pMD does have a very useful mentoring system for new employees wherein you get a lot of the information and training you need before actually starting in your role, but there is a lot to learn which could be overwhelming to some. Even after completing the boot camp onboarding process, you'll likely need to continue learning more if you're less familiar with the healthcare field. 

At pMD, we wear a lot of hats, where in addition to your specialty role, you'll also need to spend a decent amount of time working with customers for account management needs as well as interacting with customers for support needs. This in itself isn't a negative thing and in many ways it provides a lot of value and insight to your work that you wouldn't otherwise have. However, being able to multitask and stay organized is essential and it might not come easily right away if you're not used to doing customer-facing work. For people who prefer to remain ""behind the scenes"" in their job, this kind of customer interaction might prove to be more of a challenge in that you need to build up those kinds of communication skills. It also provides a challenge in terms of time-management and balancing various work tasks and projects. As someone who tends to be more introverted, having that customer interaction and then having to shift towards more creative-minded projects can sometimes be a very difficult transition to make from day-to-day because you're working a lot of different parts of your brain. It can also be difficult if you feel like you're being pulled away from projects to do account management or support work, so being able to set boundaries for yourself and stick to them is also important. Client interaction is extremely valuable because it helps you understand what their needs are in a way that you don't always get with other companies, but you do need to be mindful and vigilant over how much energy and time you're spending on that side of the job vs your specialty role. If you're someone who doesn't want to have any contact with clients and customers, then pMD might not be the right fit for you."
36,pMD,"Five years of personal growth, innovation, and happiness",2021-05-24,5.0,Operations,"Five years ago, I decided to join the pMD team and never looked back. It was difficult to leave my last company, so I wanted to be selective and join a company with a stellar team combined with a mission and a product I believed in. Still, most notably and selfishly, I wanted to work at an organization that would give me mentorship to get to the next level in my career. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine my wish would come true. Not only am I part of an organization doing sensational things in the health care space, but it’s also one that cares about me and my future. It was easy for me to believe in our mission and our product; the track record stands on its own, but the people that I have had the pleasure of working with over the years, both our internal team and customers, are what makes my job meaningful. I have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of the people around me and our customers every day, and I truly feel fulfilled. You are empowered to create your career path, grow as fast as you want to, and have the opportunity to be involved in areas of the business outside of your core role. The pMD team is composed of talented people who are intelligent, passionate, and empathetic. The camaraderie and pride one feels when working here is authentic and represents the values ingrained in our culture, values that are important to me outside of work. The relationship I have with my manager is special. I believe she genuinely cares about me and my success as a person. No matter what I’m going through professionally or personally, the company and the people who work here offer support and flexibility. I don’t know what I would have done without that support this last year, and I’m grateful every day for it.","We move at a very fast pace because we’re trying to achieve the impossible. Finding enough time in the day to get everything done takes some getting used to and requires strong prioritization skills and discipline. It can feel overwhelming at first, but I’ve found that as long as I spoke up about my needs, asked questions, or clarified priorities, I was able to stay grounded. Being a good communicator is essential to success at pMD."
37,pMD,Grateful to be here,2020-09-18,5.0,Executive Assistant,"pMD is a great company to work for and that has really shown through all that 2020 has thrown at us. Back in March, we had to adapt to 100% remote work and shift our priorities with our product to help our customers and their patients as best we could during such a scary time. From those first few months up until today, I've seen how strong this team really is. 

I'm grateful to be working for a company that is helping save lives. COVID has brought a lot of fear and anxiety into our lives and I've been a part of this team that has been able to help providers and patients navigate adopting Telehealth and make it easy for them. It has been so rewarding to be able to help alleviate the pressure this has put on people. 

I'm proud to be a part of this team. Each of my team members offers something unique to the company and they are all truly great people. We are spread out over the country and though we are used to seeing each other often, we've still been able to be connected.","The only con is that this is a work hard, play hard role, which isn't for everyone. You have to be aligned with the company's mission and that means being adaptive and participating in the innovation, which is encouraged by everyone."
38,pMD,Best move I've ever made,2020-09-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"Many of the reviews I had found here talked about this company as a large family, to the point where it seemed totally unbelievable. I gave them a shot, and turns out that all those reviews were actually entirely accurate.

pMD really looks out for its employees, and truly treats everyone as individual people. I know it sounds cliche, but they truly value their employee's time and really treat everyone with respect. I haven't experienced anything anywhere near this at any of the companies I've worked for in the past.

pMD has also reacted extremely responsibly in the face of COVID, allowing people to work remotely as needed, and move back into their in-person responsibilities as they feel safe doing so. They quickly shifted priorities to help customers/patients who began to rely on their services as the pandemic peaked.

This company just truly has its head in the right place and has the most well intentioned values and decision making that I've seen from a company. Finally, I'm proud of the place I work.",I really can't think of any - the only small issues I've even been able to come up with have been addressed and resolved in the time I've been here.
39,pMD,Innovative company with a great culture!,2020-12-20,5.0,Billing Operations Lead,"pMD shows sincere interest in their employees and offers guidance through every task. The company has done an excellent job in providing the framework for career development. pMD consistently equips their employees with the resources needed to be successful. In addition to the exceptional mentorship, the company also fosters a great work culture and drives employees to be creative in each aspect of their job. My experience at pMD has been remarkable so far and I'm extremely happy with my decision to join the company!","If you lack a good work ethic, this is not the company for you. However, all the hard work is rewarded!"
40,pMD,A place that fosters professional growth and a supportive team environment,2021-02-08,5.0,A Senior Role,"pMD is truly a great place work. Benefits and perks are really good and align with my personal and family's needs. In terms of the work environment and professional growth, the whole team, plus your mentors and managers, are all so invested in your success from day 1. There is always a path to the career you're trying to achieve and managers are transparent with an open-door policy. It's an extremely supportive environment. There are no egos here and no matter what your title/role/tenure, everyone treats each other respectfully and as if we're all one team striving towards one goal: improving health care. 

pMD's new-hire onboarding process is built to ramp you up quickly and get to know every aspect of the company, product, and team at a rapid pace so you can hit the ground running and feel like you're a part of the team from day one.

We do a lot of fun activities as a team that are official and unofficial team events (happy hours, dinners, special events etc), it's always a good time. 

We also travel onsite to meet with customers face-to-face, so if you like to travel and see new cities, definitely the job for you!","I wouldn't call this a con so much as an FYI - we're a heavily customer-facing company with a strong relationship with all of our customers. Because of this, we make every effort to make their experience top-notch and nothing less. This means often participating in support rotations, traveling onsite, etc. Some days it feels like a round-the-clock job but it's extremely gratifying and everyone on the team bonds over this. So if you're not committed to putting the customer first, this may not be the company for you. We love our customers and what they do for their patients and health care, so in turn, we're directly helping them to make a positive impact!"
41,pMD,"Working at pMD is a career, not just a job.",2020-09-04,5.0,Senior Manager,"pMD continues to be an amazing place to work. Every day is different and brings unique challenges, projects, and opportunities to engage with our customers and our colleagues. There's never a dull moment. The opportunities to work on new things and advance your career are available to anyone who wants to work for them!

I'm very proud to work at pMD always but especially now - in a time where many companies are struggling financially, operationally, culturally, or otherwise, pMD has navigated both its employees and customers seamlessly through 2020, bringing more value to doctors and patients than ever before. Every single employee has had a direct hand in this, and I'm thankful for each one of them every day!","pMD is at the forefront of serving health care providers and patients, which isn't easy, although it is extremely rewarding. The work can be challenging and often requires employees to juggle multiple projects at a time. It's a great opportunity for personal and career growth but perhaps not suited for the faint-hearted."
42,pMD,Goal-oriented with plenty of opportunities for growth and development in an exciting field,2021-03-23,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Amazingly friendly and caring coworkers, great benefits and perks, remote-friendly culture, interesting problem domain with clear goals and a growth-oriented mindset.","Travel-first culture, great if it's what you like, but good to know before joining."
43,pMD,Struck Gold During Covid,2020-09-21,5.0,Senior Video Producer,"My whole experience has been extremely positive. The people I work with are passionate, helpful and encouraging. The management team cares, listens and acts with the teams best interests at heart. The work itself is fun and rewarding. At pMD no matter what your role is it involves helping people. pMD is comprised of individuals who truly enjoy helping. Whether that is with customers or colleagues. I landed this job right when COVID started locking down the US. I feel as if I struck gold because I am working through this pandemic at a job that I really enjoy. The opportunities have been plentifully and I am encouraged to learn new skills. It has been very positive so far and I am excited to continue working here!",No real cons to speak of. Balancing lots of roles can be difficult at times but they make sure that you know that before you start the job.
44,pMD,Teamwork Focused,2021-04-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"Everyone here is helpful, friendly, and kind
The work is meaningful and impactful
Camaraderie is strong
Clear company direction","Super busy all the time, made easier by sharing the load"
45,pMD,Lots of good but also bad that's swept under rug,2021-04-07,2.0,Software Engineer,"pMD has a lot that is good. First off, for the 3+ years I have been with the company, it's grown a ton but still feels like a ""family"". There are some cool perks, most of the people who work there are nice and hard working. The leadership team overall very much cares about the employees. The office was nice before we stopped coming in because of COVID. Maternity and paternity leave is great which I very much appreciate. My colleagues are understanding when it comes to having to miss because of child related issues.","Honestly there are a lot of cons to working at pMD, but you won't read any in reviews listed because team members practically force all employees to write Glassdoor reviews and constantly take surveys to prove we are the best. They used to be much more chill about this when I first started, but over the last year and a half they force us to write reviews. Because they tell us exactly when to write the review, we all feel pressured to write all positives since they know who wrote the new review. They don't ask for internal feedback and make it very clear when they send out a new survey that if we have any negative feedback, to submit it internally (which again their is no way to do this). So read reviews with a grain of salt when judging pmd. 

Another con is that we have to learn EVERY single role at the company and it is unbelievably frustrating and overwhelming. As an engineer, I have to also participate in support - answering phone calls and emails from patients and providers of our service. I also have to be an account manager and interact with customers, learn their workflow and manage the account. I did not become an engineer to have to interact with people this often. More than that, it pulls me away from my ACTUAL job that I was hired for and I feel like I am always being pulled in 100 different directions. Support used to not be as bad, but after we created a telemedicine feature, we have 10X the support we did a year and a half ago. Again, I did not go to school for SE to have to deal with customer support. As the company grows, the multiple roles make less sense. They need to figure out something more manageable. 

The multiple roles we each are responsible for in conjugation with the constant competitiveness of the company has made a lot of employees very unhappy in the last year. No matter how well you do as a company or individually, there is a higher and loftier goal a second later. Yes I enjoy competition and achievements at work but this is unsustainable. The culture of competition plus the 100 jobs we all have, plus them wanting us to lie about our experience (while providing no actual way to get what we want) is just unsustainable. 

The healthcare is terrible - totally unsustainable if you have kids. They pay full but the deductible is so high. There is no 401k matching even though a bunch of us have been asking for this for years. However they will pay to get your pilot license? I don't see this as a perk...match my 401k or give me insurance that is good enough to be able to go to the doctor when I am sick without paying $300."

Everyone has bought into the company mission and has taken on a true ""we"" mentality. Everybody is so collaborative and supportive of one another and willing to step up in a heartbeat.
- There is a ton of room for growth. Want exposure to something new, well it's very much encouraged by management. Employees are both pushed out of their comfort zone, but also supported every step of the way. Employees also have a strong hand in developing their day to day role.
- Great benefits
- Dog-friendly office and daily catered lunches","- If you want to stick to a strict set of defined roles and responsibilities, then pMD may be for you. The fast-paced environment requires everyone to step outside of their comfort zone and adjust just as quickly as things change. This is not a con for me personally, but this may not be for  everyone."
47,pMD,Great company that genuinely cares about its employees and customers,2020-11-20,5.0,Executive Assistant,"pMD is an amazing place to work. The people are kind, caring, smart, and extremely hard working. They genuinely want to see you succeed and grow with the company. Management is supportive and is considerate of your life outside of work.","This is not really a con, but if you only want to do one very specific job this company might not be the best fit for you. With this being a smaller company you can be asked to wear multiple hats. Balancing can be challenging, but also very rewarding. You really get the chance to learn all that you are capable of."
48,pMD,"Dedicated team, working to make a difference",2020-10-05,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"pMD has a growing team of smart, hardworking, and extremely friendly people. They encourage mentorship throughout the company, which helps people stay connected and grow as individuals. Valuing that form of leadership and having complete trust in their employees allowed pMD to overcome the many obstacles that arose at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and helped pMD stay focused on improving the lives of patients and doctors.","Providing technical support can be challenging work, but it is also some of the most rewarding. Ensuring that providers and patients are having a positive experience and that pMD is constantly improving their products is very important. The entire team helps share that responsibility and people are always willing to help ensure no one is overwhelmed."
49,pMD,Fast Growing Company On the Cutting Edge of Healthcare Changes,2020-07-13,5.0,Sales Manager,"pMD has been able to continue to show its ability to adapt to the ever-changing healthcare landscape during the recent COVID-19 outbreak and not only remain stable as a company, but excel! Working at pMD is fast-paced, exciting and rewarding because the hard work we put in as a team affects real patients and healthcare workers.  pMD supports and pushes its employees to grow at their own speed and encourages mentorship up and down the ladder. Not to mention, the team and people truly are the reason to stay even beyond the impact we have in the healthcare space. You'll never meet a more hardworking, committed group than at pMD and we've kept this integrity as the team has grown larger in the last few years.","Not everyone loves to travel - and pMD does require quite a bit of travel within the US. For those who love to explore new cities and places, pMD's travel truly is a treat."

The app boomed with ten of thousands of app users in the first few weeks. I was pulled in for different roles where I was highly needed.

The mentorship by managers is incredible - if there is something you want to explore, they will make it happen. pMD also allows for collaboration between departments, so there is no shortage of learning opportunities.","The workday can be very busy and requires its employees to be adaptable. Also, most pMDers are customer-facing, so keep this in mind if you are looking for an internal-facing role. High travel volume (although travel is always very fun with your team). Would like to see educational benefits for employees."
52,pMD,5 Star People,2020-09-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My coworker reached out to me and asked me to write a Glassdoor review of pMD. She's one of those eternally positive people who is pure sunshine. Even in the gloom and doom of 2020, she's upbeat and focused on what she can do in her role to make the best of things. And we laugh a lot - that's a coworker worth raving about. Let's get cracking on this review... 

I've worked with pMD for years and years and the company has evolved quite a bit. Change has been a pleasant constant there. Consistently, the people are awesome. Fun, smart, motivated people who make work a lot of fun. 

It's a great group of people!","It can be tough to form and keep relationships while working remotely. However, you get out what you put in to those relationships so that's something I can work on and not unique to pMD."
53,pMD,losing my mind at this company,2021-04-19,1.0,Implementation Specialist,overall folks are pretty kind,"No one owns anything at pMD. All responsibilities are shared and you are expected to learn every part of every department within the company. It does not matter if you were brought on board for a specific role (ie implementation), you will be responsible for everything including support, sales and account management. This includes having to take at least 3 weekends per year ""on call"", where you are expected to have your phone on you all the time and answer support calls, chat messages, and emails. AND also 2-3 times per year, for an entire month, you will be on call. This is extremely stressful especially if you did not sign up for support role. 

On the account management side, its actually a nightmare. Folks like me who have no external / customer facing experience are expected to completely lead relationships with large accounts. In addition to our actual job. This is a nightmare. Hire account managers pmd. And folks for support. This is not my job and it is so overwhelming. 

The benefits at pMD are super disappointing. No 401k matching and I definitely am underpaid. I don't use the healthcare but have heard it's horrible. 

On the culture side, the team is generally very nice. Management tries to say we should have a good life/work balance, and to ""walk"" for 30 minutes a day during work and take a break, yet expects us to do every single job. working at pMD is extremely overwhelming. They also force employees to leave glassdoor reviews, so I would not necessarily trust everything you read on here. 

pMD is a really flustering and anxiety producing place to work. Could I do it over, I would not have chosen pMD."
54,pMD,Solid team environment,2020-09-29,5.0,Customer Success Associate,"From day one, it is laid out how you can succeed, grow, and add value. They are true in saying this isn’t just a job; it is a career. You are set up to succeed at pMD! pMD is genuinely a team environment.

We also have excellent perks and benefits!","No 401k matching, but they did find a new 401K plan that has lower fees and better investing options."

57,pMD,Incredible Company,2020-09-16,5.0,Account Executive,"There’s something special to be said about pMD and the culture that’s been built around it. There are a lot of companies who are quick to put an emphasis on company culture and then once you get settled and you’re in the office, suddenly that company culture dissipates into thin air. With pMD, I truly feel like the company culture is so solid because all of our personalities fit together so seamlessly (hats off to the recruiting team)… we all are dedicated to putting in 110% effort, but the work-life balance is also highly respected. Some of the benefits that are offered are unbelievable - this is a company who gives you unimaginable opportunity. I think it says a lot about who pMD is as a company and who our CEO, Philippe is as a leader. He’s incredibly generous - he wants each employee to have an opportunity for growth both within your work life and your personal life. The leadership as a whole at pMD is some of the best I have ever experienced — each team lead is knowledgeable, eager to help and is always encouraging growth. Its a really comforting feeling to know I’ve entered into this space where everyone has each other’s backs. We’re all rooting for each other and helping one another reach their goals. Not to mention, there isn’t one person on this team that I wouldn’t be thrilled to spend the day with. It is a group of really special and resilient people who truly care about making an impact, whether that’s for their team members, a doctor, patient, or an office staff. It’s an incredible dynamic and I truly couldn’t be more thankful to be a part of this team.",pMD is a fast paced environment - there is a lot to learn and many responsibilities to juggle.

60,pMD,"Seemed too good to be true, it's really true",2019-09-09,5.0,Senior Integration Engineer,"I have been here for less than a year.  When I applied to pMD, I looked at Glassdoor and saw so many positive reviews that my first reaction was skepticism.  No job is THAT good.  Well, as jobs go, this one really is great, and it is because the company really is THAT cool.  I am an older fellow for an entrepreneurial, growing IT company, but I am enthusiastically embraced by all my coworkers for my experience.  

The company creates monthly performance incentives that everyone participates in, no matter what your job is.  They almost always are achievable with hard work, and when we missed one, senior management took the blame for making the goal too difficult for the time frame.  The company is well run and dedicated to both the success of the individual as well as the success of the company.  

The existing products have a place in the market and the team is constantly looking for ways to expand that sweet spot while sticking with our core competencies and mission.","Everyone is so busy that it sometimes can be hard to get help as a remote employee, but it is NOT for lack of willingness to help.  When you find that open time slot, folks will see you through resolving the issue and everyone follows up."
61,pMD,Amazing culture with a product everyone stands behind,2020-02-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots of great benefits, parental leave is competitive, catered lunches every day (mostly always healthy and takes into account others' dietary needs), free snacks/water/coffee. 

Team is close-knit due to the culture that is fostered here from the beginning. The onboarding process gives new folks the opportunity to meet every single person in the company. Many team events that help keep SF and remote folks close regardless of distance. So many opportunities for cross-collaboration, mentorship, and career growth. Many people travel to different places across the U.S., which is fun. 

Everyone is customer-facing in one way or another and our customers love us because we all care and put in 100% effort to understand our customers, their pain-points, and our software solutions. 

There are no big egos at pMD and transparency is a big thing here. We all share the same overarching goal to improve health care.","Sometimes the work hours can be long but truthfully, you know you're doing it for a good cause, for a good company, and for the betterment of healthcare."
62,pMD,Amazing company culture & bountiful opportunity,2020-08-20,5.0,Customer Success Associate,"As the team continues to grow, pMD has been able to maintain its tight-knit company culture and always keeps employee growth and happiness front of mind. I love the cross-functional collaboration between departments and teams! The company is truly unique from anywhere else you could work.","You definitely get exposure to many areas of the company, which will mean wearing many different hats. If you aren’t prepared to challenge yourself it might not be a good fit."
63,pMD,Still love it a year later,2020-09-11,5.0,Interface Engineer,"Very friendly, supportive, professional environment. Management actively looks for ways to incentivize everyone in the company. They are very open with the entire team about strategy, goals and performance. They take input from everyone.","Things can at times get very hectic, but that is really the nature of a rapidly growing and evolving entrepreneurial company."
64,pMD,Fully empowered. Always challenged. Beyond my expectations.,2019-09-13,5.0,Operations,"When I first was hired, I thought I had a good idea of the company. Creating a positive change in the healthcare industry, working with nice people in a fun office, etc. Turns out, I had no idea what I signed up for. This truly is a dream team full of the most supportive, unbelievably talented and intelligent people. It's an inspiring group of people who also know how to have fun. pMD has done a great job creating a family dynamic and you can rely on every single member. 

The management team has also surprised me. I have felt very comfortable speaking to my managers about my career path and any challenges I've run into with my current position. They listen, they mentor and they empower and it's so refreshing. 

I could list all the benefits of working with the company but I'd like to boil it down and say, simply, I feel taken care of. When you take care of your employees, they can pour their energy into the company's mission and that's why pMDers work really efficiently as a team.",It's difficult to think of any cons to working at pMD. I think the fast-paced learning environment could be tough for some people but I really enjoy it and it's what makes me feel empowered to grow into my full potential.
65,pMD,Scaling quickly,2020-10-02,5.0,Software Engineer Manager,"Impactful, great team, agile, fast paced, collaborative",Can be intense if not used to being customer/problem oriented.
66,pMD,"After 20+ years, still innovating and passionate about making an impact for healthcare providers and patients!",2020-06-12,5.0,Director of Sales,"The people. I've never been around such a smart group of people that have a unified vision of making a lasting impact in healthcare software and services. The team has a positive attitude that knows we are making a significant improvement in healthcare. The company is agile enough to anticipate and respond to the needs of our customers and market quickly while creating a culture that supports one another but expects our customers to have an exceptional experience in every interaction with our software and support services. 

I'm constantly reminded of how fortunate I am to work at pMD when speaking to colleagues and friends. I've never come across another company that invests in its team like pMD. Through the challenging times we all have faced in 2020, the company has been 100% supportive of our team members through their own personal situations while collectively working harder than ever before to positively impact patients' lives through the ability to securely communicate with their providers from the comfort and safety of their own home. The testimonials from that alone are life-giving in knowing you're making a difference. I'm grateful for that during these challenging times.

At a time where it could be easy to cut expenses and benefits (and even jobs), pMD has been doubling down on supporting our team members and even hiring more talented people!","I don't think this unique to pMD, but we have been 100% remote still as of June 12, 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. The company has gone above and beyond to utilize video conferencing and making sure each team member has a great home setup, but it's still more challenging to not be able to have your team be together. I expect we will be better as a result of this, but it does take some more effort in the interim. We also are evolving at a much faster pace than anything I've seen over the last 10 years, so you need to be a person that is excited about innovation and okay with rapid growth and changes to keep up."
67,pMD,"13 years later, I'm still in love with this company",2020-06-03,5.0,Vice President Software Engineering,"pMD has the best people I've ever worked with. Across the board, in every department, this is an incredible team of passionate, smart, driven yet fun-loving people who are united in a common mission to eliminate medical errors.

The collaborative spirit is so strong at pMD - I love to see folks from every part of the company working closely together to solve problems for our customers. We have cross-disciplinary customer teams that accelerate career growth by giving everyone involved hands-on, rubber-meets-the-road experience implementing pMD with great mentorship.

I also really appreciate how my department (Engineering) stands behind the quality of the product. Now more than ever, we're directly involved in patient care with our telehealth and chat software, and I see the engineers at pMD really stepping up to that responsibility by focusing on the customer experience making sure the product is bug-free and easy to use.

I appreciate pMD's many, many great benefits. I've particularly enjoyed the coworking space benefit as a remote employee. Being able to leave my work-from-home setup a few days a week and work in a beautiful space with great community has been a game changer for my quality of life, my focus at work, and my work-life balance.

pMD has also had my back in some really radical ways over the years. For example, at one point the ""life"" side of the equation became really heavy for me and I needed some time away. pMD was incredibly supportive and my teammates stepped up in order to make it possible for me to take a 6 week sabbatical. They really had my back, and I was able to return re-energized and with a clear mind. I've seen pMD meet each employee where they are and do whatever it can to help them have a great life as well as a great career.

Finally, with COVID-19 has come a lot of changes and challenges. We switched overnight from a 60% in-office workforce to a 100% WFH workforce. Our telehealth product exploded with demand literally overnight. It was so amazing to see the team rally and support each other as we struggled initially to maintain our bar of unparalleled service to all of our customers, prospects, and the patients using pMD. It blew my mind how quickly the team was able to rise to this unprecedented challenge and rally around our values. In the end, we received quite a few ""love letters"" from customers about how the pMD team helped them through this overnight transition to telehealth. I love that we were there for each other, and as a result, we were able to be there for our customers.","It's honestly pretty hard for me to think of any cons about pMD, since I've been really happy here for an extremely long time.

Over the years, I have seen folks struggle who were not passionate about serving the customer (physicians and patients). I think that intense customer focus is what ties us all together, so without that it can be hard to navigate a long career at pMD."
68,pMD,Still going strong after three years,2019-07-26,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"It's been a few years since I started and pMD has only gotten better. On any given day every department is looking to get better and never settle. This has created a very motivating environment. An environment of trust, caring and hard work makes for me as an employee want to continue to not improve my professional work but personal life as well. Work demands have increased but that's not a bad thing. We're continually improving on every aspect of the company, whether it's processes in place for on boarding, implementation or sales, our leadership know we can always improve. The people I work with are all amazing. When we collaborate on a project or just see each other at the water cooler, it's always a pleasure to interact with people that I consider not just my co-workers, but my friends. There is a sense of comfortability when it comes to addressing any questions or concerns you might have to management and they actually take your feedback to heart, which is greatly appreciated.","There isn't anything I can consider as a ""con"" working at pMD. Travel can weeks can take its toll but management is willing to work with you should you feel that it's catching up with you."

73,pMD,pMD focuses on investing in it's people,2019-10-07,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"Security is one of the biggest things to me, in working for a company (and frankly overall happiness). From being able to trust your environment you work in from a day to day setting, to trusting the company having a bright future, to allowing you to grow both personally and professionally. It's a tall order, that pMD continues to strive for and I think it's doing a great job. Being able to work for a company that embraces and promotes 'family first' is where you want to work for - be it your work family or personal family.","Nothing worth doing is every easy, and that's certainly true at pMD. It has a great mission to ""Save lives"", and it's obvious to say that it's not an easy one. This translates to being challenged often, and being ok with living out of your comfort zone at times. This type of atmosphere is not recommended for the complacent, looking to click in a 9-5 job."
74,pMD,A company that puts their employees first,2020-06-26,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Another year of working with the fantastic pMD team, and again, I am beyond pleased. I feel lucky to be apart of a team this team and am thankful for continued opportunities at growth and leadership.

I feel fortunate to come into work everyday to be surrounded by smart, hardworking people who genuinely care about our product and customers. The office environment is upbeat and everyone is super friendly (even our little dog friends who come to visit.) It's  also always nice to change up my 9-5 when traveling once a month to go implement or visit clients. The mentoring you receive at pMD is also a big pro and something that I've benefited from tremendously. I've grown professionally and personally in the last year more than I have at any other job, and the skills I've learned have all been invaluable for my career growth.","At pMD you wear many hats and traveling to our customers is a big part of the job! You may be expected to 'give it a go' at something you've never done before or might not necessarily be in your job description. Not really a con, but could be if you're not open to trying new things."

Goal-Focused.
Great Benefits, Competitive Compensation, and Interesting Perks.
Awesome and fun location for remote employees to travel to for team events.
Well-loved product covering an interesting and evolving problem space.","San Francisco can be an expensive trip, job eventually requires traveling funds. (But they do work with you in the beginning.)"

78,pMD,Truly a great place to work,2019-07-15,5.0,Manager,"pMD is constantly growing, evolving, and maturing, all for the better. It has always been a great place to work, as evidenced by the longevity of the employees - a rarity for the Bay Area and the tech industry here, but what's most impressive to me has been the company's ability to grow year after year, not only in size/revenue but also as a workplace. In my years at pMD, the structure of the departments, job roles, benefits/perks, and professional development have all improved so much. I'm proud to work here and be a part of pMD's admirable mission to improve patient care by reducing medical error.","pMD is still a small company with a big mission and big goals. That can sometimes translate to working outside of the traditional 8-5 and/or being asked to work on projects or tasks outside of the scope of work of your particular role. This can be taken as a great learning opportunity, but it's not for everyone."
79,pMD,Great place to work,2019-10-03,5.0,Vice President Business Development,"- A talented team of employees:  top through bottom.  You can count on everyone.  That's rare.
- Close to our customers - We have a focus on knowing who they are, how they operate and what they need.  The company provides basically unlimited resources to accomplish that.
- Privately owned - There are no arbitrary quarterly numbers to hit, there is no PE master wanting to pump and dump.  This is a long term play in the dynamic health care space.","- There are relentless periods of travel.  Now, managers do try and take care to make sure one can achieve balance, and there are times when you can do more in the field than not.  So it can depend on what drives you and your ability to say no to what needs to be done."
80,pMD,Great place for a well rounded engineer,2020-03-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"pMD has great mentorship programs and awesome employee advancement opportunities. They also give employees a chance to work in all aspects of the business, not just the position they were hired for. Also, catered lunches are a huge plus!","Some people don't want to be customer facing or travel regularly, so that may not be for everyone."
81,pMD,Really DOES feel like a family,2019-09-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"Right from the get-go, pMD shows that it's truly invested in their employees and helping them to succeed. I was somewhat skeptical of all the other reviews mentioning the cliche ""it's like a family"" and ""feels like I'm working with real friends"", but in my time here, it has literally been exactly that. pMDers are all very interested in each other as real people, are always offering assistance, and are excited to help each other out in any way they can. I feel like I've truly hopped in amongst a family and been welcomed with more open arms than I can count.","Honestly, it's hard to think of anything that isn't just nit picking. The only real con I've come across is the 401k portfolio/investment options aren't really the greatest, but in my experience, that just kind of comes with the territory of smaller companies."
82,pMD,An incredible start with an incredible company!,2020-01-14,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"While I have only been with pMD for a short time, the attention, help, and encouragement I received from everyone within the company while I onboarded really was something special. This onboarding process (or ""bootcamp"", as the team likes to call it) was an intensive 3 week learning period where I got a ton of exposure to the company culture, the pMD product suite, the challenges we're trying to solve within healthcare, and real hand-on experience helping healthcare professionals, including learning how to train doctors with the software and handle common customer support interactions. It was  a whirlwind in the best kinds of ways, and I have never experienced such a well-structured and thorough onboarding process with any other company. They even brought my wife and me out to the headquarters in San Francisco for the first two weeks while I got started, as I typically work remotely.

Since my graduation from the bootcamp onboarding process and taking on more traditional engineering roles, the honeymoon period still hasn't faded. Everyone on team pMD is highly motivated and super intelligent, yet still humble, friendly, and generous with their time and attention. This is a seriously high-performing team that has held onto their culture and values where they matter most, and I can't wait to see where we're headed.

Some other great perks:
- Incredible company culture, down-to-earth people
- Very flexible with remote work / distributed teams
- Great office environment (I really look forward to office visits!) + dog friendly
- Lots of focus on professional development and growth
- An emphasis on personal health and family
- Continuously-expanding benefits / employee perks","pMD is a small company, and that means you'll take on many responsibilities you may not have originally anticipated, especially if coming from a larger organization where roles are more cut and dried. That's not necessarily a bad thing; it's incredibly eye-opening and valuable to be able to see and touch so many parts of the company's operations. However, some might find the broad scope of projects available and freedom to assist as needed a little overwhelming / distracting if proper focus isn't a priority."
83,pMD,A Rewarding Career,2019-10-11,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"The team at pMD is amazing: collaborative, smart, friendly and great problem solvers. We all have a multitude of responsibilities here, which is exciting because no two days are the same. Also, as a mother of 2 young kids, it's wonderful how supportive and understanding management. This is truly a family oriented company, and I couldn't ask for better work life balance.","As mentioned in the pros, we all have a lot of cross-departmental, which may not be for everyone. Just know, if you join the pMD team, you will be contributing in all areas of the company, not just your designated role."
84,pMD,Team of hard-workers who care about one another,2019-10-01,5.0,Software Engineer,"The people at pMD are smart, hardworking, and incredibly kind. They do a great job of supporting one-another and can be trusted to always give it their all. This makes for a really supportive environment where one feels like they can do their best work. In addition, the work is very rewarding and gives you many opportunities to see how your work has made a positive impact on other's lives.","The work changes often from day to day. This can make the job very interesting and provides a lot of opportunities for personal growth. However, it can also require a lot of on the job learning and an ability to balance multiple responsibilities at once."
85,pMD,Great place to impact an industry AND grow professionally,2019-07-25,5.0,Sales Engineer,"Cross-functional experience -- regardless of primary role, everyone gets exposure to customer-facing responsibilities and learning all aspects of the product line.

Focus on customer experience -- the company focus on premium customer experience and support is awesome and source of pride.

Company culture -- awesome support for employee growth, both professionally and as humans. Family vibes for real.

Company growth -- poised for tremendous growth and success in the marketplace. Very excited about the direction and potential.","Ramp-up process -- can take quite a while to fully understand the product intricacies and customer base.  

Daily start time -- much of the customer base is in the Eastern time zones, so expected to be in office very early (relative to typical Silicon Valley work schedules)."
86,pMD,The only company I want to work for,2019-10-13,5.0,Recruiter,"I've been at pMD for a little over three years, and I couldn't be happier. Why am I so happy? It boils down to three things; the people, the culture, and the work.

The people are smart, passionate, creative, funny, and family-oriented. I am a better person just by being around these incredible individuals. My colleagues are always there to lend a helping hand and to provide mentorship. My manager cares about my success and empowers me to take my career to the next level. 

The culture is supportive, fun, and positive. There is an emphasis placed on continuous learning and professional growth, which, combined with personal motivation, allows you to grow your career quickly. 

The work is complicated, interesting, and fulfilling. We truly are making a positive impact in health care and changing how software supports an industry.","The environment is very fast-paced, and because our team is small, you tend to wear many hats and tackle things outside of your role. That can be challenging and frustrating, especially when you have a full plate, and adding one more thing can sometimes feel impossible, but that's when the magic happens. This environment has allowed me to take on more responsibility, find my inner warrior, and have an impact in areas of the business I never thought I would. The team does a great job of supporting you as you grow because you do grow at pMD, whether you want to or not. Growing pains are real and can be uncomfortable, which is why this company isn't a fit for everyone."
87,pMD,"Supportive environment for career growth! pMD is more than just surface level ""How was your weekend? How is it going?""",2019-09-30,5.0,User Experience Designer,"pMD is a profitable and experienced company (20 years old) with a great start-up environment and culture. The company cares about you beyond the regular ""Hey, how was your weekend?"". As an employee of pMD, it doesn't matter what your position is, the company values your professional and personal interests. For example, I am on the more technical side, but love working with customers, so the company includes me in account management meetings and slowly exposes more of that responsibility to me as I gain experience. For people that want to increase their technical knowledge, pMD will help pay for continued education courses. Managers are willing to have frequent 1:1 meetings to make sure they are doing all they can to help you in your next career goal (i.e. becoming a senior software engineer or salesperson). You are encouraged to share your ideas and speak up if you see something that you think can be improved or improve the company. 

There is an environment of extreme ownership over goals and projects. Your successes are always appreciated with a company-wide email blast and failures are tackled with a ""how can we fix this..."" mindset instead of pointed fingers. Trust is paramount - your  word is taken as fact because there is a mutual trust between you and your coworkers. It's really a strong team mentality that is built on a great foundation of transparency. 

Great work life balance. No one is going to track how much office face time you have. 40% of the company works remotely and works to grow with you when your life takes you away from the physical location of the main office. 

The common SF start up perks like daily catered lunches, snacks, etc. No ping pong table, but flight lessons are available :).","You do travel around the country a fair amount for the company. I love travel, so it works for me, but may not be for everyone out there :). There are some processes in place for customer support that could be more streamlined."
88,pMD,A company that is young and 'young at heart'.,2019-08-25,5.0,Executive Administrative Assistant,"The company has the energy of a start-up with the stability of well-established tech company.  pMD offers the usual tech benefits of catered lunch, snacks, and paid health benefits.    Everyone often share words of encouragement and support especially during my training period.  Attendance to friday happy hours is highly encouraged for team building and to create opportunities to share with colleagues.",There is a steep learning curve with a distinct language/culture which will take a few months to understand and adopt.
89,pMD,"Great people, awesome culture, stellar benefits",2019-09-10,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Wow! Each year, pMD finds a new way to exceed my expectations. The company has grown significantly since I joined, and I am impressed with how the executive team has managed to keep the identity of the company throughout the growth. The team is fun-loving and hard-working. It's a pleasure to come into work each day and know that a group of passionate, driven folks are working alongside you towards the same goals. The management team consistently sets motivating incentives to reach growth goals that electrify the office. 

In the past year, I began to take advantage of the most unique pMD benefit: flight lessons. This new hobby has been an excellent learning experience that I've even been able to apply to other areas of my life. While it's a significant investment of time and energy, I've found a new passion for aviation and had a blast learning about an industry I never thought I would have the privilege of exploring.

From a career perspective, pMD focuses on developing its people. As an engineer, I've enjoyed having input into product decisions and design. I feel like my voice is always heard. I also believe that you are truly in control of your career at pMD. My manager has always worked with me to develop plans to reach any career milestone I set my eyes on. I don't think I could have progressed my technical skills or career as quickly as I have at pMD at any other organization because of both the emphasis pMD places on its people and the quality of the managers across the board.","pMD's company size means that employees wear a lot of hats and have a diverse set of responsibilities. This is one of the biggest ""pros"" in my opinion, but it's not for everyone."

A lot of my friends in other companies don't feel like their work has an impact on the world around them, whereas I'm confident that my work is constantly moving the needle forward in the medical industry. Even a small change in the product can have massive effects on the workflows of doctors and billers across the country, and that's both really exciting and humbling for me as an engineer.

-My team is really great -- I admire every person at pMD and especially my colleagues on the development team.  I'm learning new things from them every single day. Everyone is extremely friendly and dedicated to their work. Everyone communicates, everyone puts in their best effort, everyone really cares about the product, the customer experience, and the end goal. 

-Getting real insights into our customers is a privilege that software engineers in other companies don't have. We travel a lot to see and hear from our customers, interact with them directly several times a day, and build and design our product with their needs in mind first and foremost. Not only is it rewarding for me to see my work get used, but it also encourages me to push myself and produce the best possible solutions to our users' problems.","-The workload is large, and coming at you from all different sides.

I am always skeptical with companies that have too good of rating but pMD has actually lived up to their rating. The positivity, support and genuine personalities sets this company apart from the others. There are no egos here, no one is above anyone else in terms of work responsibilities. Because we are a small company, we all pitch in. Whether it's doing a training over the phone for a client you've never worked with, or traveling on-site to help with an implementation or to even stock the kitchen after a grocery delivery, no one is above anyone in terms of work load.

Many company's CEO's may say they have an open door policy but pMD truly does! Coming from my last company where I would chastised for asking a ""dumb question"" here there are no dumb questions and you're never afraid to ask the same question twice. While there is no ""perfect company"", pMD is pretty darn close to that and I'm excited to be along for the ride!",We are a small team which means everyone is expected to do any and every thing to help out. That might be a turnoff for some folks. We do travel a lot but the company seems to recognize that when you communicate that to them and will work with you to slow down your travel.

Hands down the best on-boarding process I have ever witnessed. The first 4 - 8 weeks you’re in “bootcamp”. Throughout bootcamp there are a number of things you must complete before graduating. Bootcamp is both enjoyable and challenging. When you graduate, you’re fully equipped with the knowledge and skills you need to be a rockstar employee. 

Support is a large part of your job at pMD. Everyone rotates to cover support 24/7, 365. pMD is truly dedicated to the providers and delivering unparalleled customer service. 

The culture at pMD is wonderful. The travel is spontaneous and fun! I am throughly enjoying traveling to brand new states and visiting our customers. Not the mention, the travel points and miles are great! 

I am constantly impressed by the work ethic of my colleagues! Everyone here goes above and beyond to help each other, and you’re continually being recognized for your hard work. 

When the opportunity presented itself to join the pMD team, I was nervous due to my lack of healthcare experience. However, after my time here, I have no doubts that I made the right career move!","If I could change one thing, it might be focusing more on West Coast travel. Those
long flights can really take it out of you! Not to mention how humid it is on the east coast during summer.

Everyone here is customer facing, and together we build a culture of doers. Everyone is willing to jump in and help on anything. We may all have job titles, but everyone does a bit of everything. That makes for a fast paced energetic office where everyone really wants to be here and work at 110%. The best way to describe it is intensity. Everyone works very hard to make sure we are making the best products and services in healthcare.

Even as we grow quickly, the hiring culture is to look for the best of the best. Every new employee is added thoughtfully to the team, to help their team and the company be better.

You will learn a lot working here. I work in operations, but have learned about the healthcare industry and how pMD works to make healthcare better, for doctors and patients. Due to everyone doing a little of everything, you will learn in depth about the industry.",Due to the intensity of the office everyone is moving at 100mph. This isn’t for everyone.

102,pMD,Amazing company culture and accelerated professional growth,2019-06-18,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I was very fortunate to have my first job out of college be at pMD. pMD is located in SF which is a very social city which made it very easy to make friends. Everyone at pMD is kind and welcoming (Especially important because of the company's size)! Management is also very accommodating regarding employee circumstances and is willing to work with employees to make sure their personal and work life is the best it can be.

As a software engineer, being at pMD was amazing because of the upfront responsibility given to me right when I started out. At large companies, it generally takes time to receive interesting/challenging projects because of internal processes regardless of your individual skill level. Since pMD's development team is small, I was able to take on challenging projects only a few months into my employment.

tl;dr I wholeheartedly recommend working for this company!","Being a small company, employees are expected to do a wide variety of things. Even as a software engineer I was involved in non-engineering tasks. For some people, this is a great way to break the monotony of working in one specific field everyday. But for me personally, I wanted a more software specific role. One of the great thing about this company though is that management will definitely work with you if you decide that you want to be in a more focused role. So don't be afraid to have that discussion as soon as possible."
103,pMD,Challenging but rewarding workplace,2019-06-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"pMD is a company that teaches its employees while also ensuring that they have a healthy lifestyle. As employees are daily navigating the complicated structures of the US healthcare system, the work tends to be quite challenging. However, there are ample opportunities for employees to enjoy the perks that pMD provides. These include catered lunches, travel, and monthly team events. Management also listens to the interests of employees and takes them into account when designing their roles within the organization.  This has also made pMD  a fantastic company for a new college graduates with its emphasis on mentorship. As new admits to the workforce, younger team members are granted the opportunity to explore what interests them and provide feedback on the direction they would like to go. Younger team members are also not seen as junior but rather as integral contributors to the entire company. Being able to pursue a pilots license (which is funded by pMD) and the ability to work from home or remote sets this company apart from others in healthcare.","There is a significant amount of dedication required to efficiently work at pMD. If you are interested in a 8-5 desk job with little engagement, this isn’t the place for you. Also, travel occurs frequently for pMD employees which will require you to work a bit harder to stay on top of your day-to-day responsibilities."

Each role contributes in powerful, exciting, and visible ways. Coming from a bigger company, I never imagined that a small fish could make such a big splash! There’s nothing quite like seeing your very own project go live and this happens frequently with each member of the team.

A lot of cross-departmental work goes on at pMD. There is a huge emphasis on understanding the product as a whole and thus we get training on all sides of the board. Being exposed to every aspect of the business has been extremely beneficial. Who knew that someone in sales would be able to explain the basics of interfacing, provide unparalleled customer support, or spend time writing blog posts? Being a pMDer requires a well-rounded mind and the pMD management team has done an excellent job hiring exceptional employees that possess that quality!

My absolute favorite part of pMD, though, has definitely got to be the people. pMDers are the friendliest, most engaging, and intelligent group of people I’ve ever met. It’s amazing to see the work that can be done when you find a group that meshes so well together – both professionally and outside of work. I can say for certain that I enjoy walking into the office in the morning. There’s nothing better than being happy to go to work.",None I can think of now.

It feels good to contribute to a company that is helping to make the lives of health care professionals a little bit better. pMD is always working to innovate and provide the best possible service. Being a part of a company that cares as immensely about the health care industry is a great feeling. 

I've been with pMD for years and my career has blossomed through the support and mentorship I received. I have been blessed with the opportunity to learn so much. 

I couldn't ask for more!","Honestly, this is tough... I was asked recently why I don't refer everyone I know to work here since I clearly love my job. The answer is simple: it's not for everyone. You have to be the type of eager beaver who wants to constantly learn, grow, help, compete, and sink your teeth into a new challenge every day. For me it's super cool and a wonderful fit, but it's a fast paced and challenging place to work so not for everyone."

Everyone here is passionate, a team player, and willing to jump in if someone needs a hand. We're also very lucky to have an awesome customer base of health systems, hospitals, and physicians that are forward thinking, and a pleasure to work with.  Every day is a new challenge, and I really do feel like I am constantly learning.","You will wear a lot of hats at pMD since it is still a small company. This may be a con for some people if you aren't willing to roll up your sleeves and learn about lots of different parts of the business, but personally, this has been one of pMD's greatest assets for me. You certainly have to be willing to work hard because everyone around you is giving 110%! We do travel for most roles in this company since we're all really passionate about getting to meet our customers face to face and helping them to solve their problems in person (and see cool places in the US!), but that may not be everyone's cup of tea."

I adore my coworkers and many of them are almost like family to me at this point. They are not only the brightest, but also the best - they have determination, passion, and sincerity. We all spend a lot of time working face to face or on the phone with physicians and other caregivers, and it inspires and challenges us to do our best work.

I don't think there is any other company that is so well situated to skip the hype cycle and actually make a difference in healthcare.","We work hard - this is not a company for people who are thinkers rather than doers. Everyone is expected to carry their weight, both with the team's shared responsibilities as well as in their own work. It can be a lot at times, but the rewards are profound.

Travel is part of the job (anywhere from 25% - 50% of weeks could have some business travel, depending on your role). I see that as a plus, but it's not for everyone."

On a more fun note, the pMD office is located in the Presidio, which is a beautiful place to work. The office is large, open, and even has a full-size beer fridge.

I bike in to work and there's always a spot for my ride.  Catered lunches are healthy and the variety is awesome!  Frequent happy hours are fun to relax with the team and catch up.  And work travel is in small cross-functional teams which is a great learning experience plus we always find time to squeeze in something fun, great food, and lots of laughs.",Sometimes we have too many options at lunch that I can't even pick one.
130,pMD,Making a difference in healthcare. Amazing company to grow with!,2018-09-06,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Your individual contributions matter!

pMD always continues to adapt and improve it's products, processes, and culture. I've been with pMD for years, and they've continually found ways for me to learn and put me in the best position to succeed. The team is simply the best in the business, and it's always a pleasure to work with such a talented group.","Working @ pMD means you'll inevitably find room for personal improvement and growth. This can be demanding at times, but rewarding."
131,pMD,Fantastic team doing great things!,2017-06-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fantastic team of intelligent, motivated, fun employees. Extremely fast-paced environment - the days fly by. My favorite aspect is the exposure to and impact that every employee has on the overall business. Having worked at a large corporation, it is refreshing not being confined to a functional silo. Every employee regularly travels and interacts with our customers, which helps keep everyone connected to the mission.","Complex industry and product offering, so takes a fair amount of time for a new employee to get up to speed. Part of this is the fact that every team member needs to be knowledgeable on most areas of the business, but goes back to exposure (see Pros)."
132,pMD,Fast paced with lots of freedom,2018-07-20,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"pMD is a company that punches above it's weight class. To do that, engineers are given a lot of freedom in identifying, planning, implementing, and rolling out new products and features. This is pretty unique for a software company where the engineers are involved in pretty much every step of the software's life cycle, often times even in sales.

There's always more work than there's time, so prioritization becomes an important skill set that everyone learns quickly.",Things move fast and you have to often make decisions in complex environments that can impact large number of health care professionals
133,pMD,Adaptive software company,2018-09-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you make it through the interview process you truly feel like you have achieved something.  That continues on in the way the company relates to employees.   pMD wants you here and wants you to be successful.  Once you learn the company, how it operates, your role in it, and whatever secret sauce, you , in particular possess, the world is your oyster.","Everyone says the travel.  And travel, if unlucky enough to have it back to back, is a bit onerous.  But the travel comes up because growth and opportunity is involved.  So it's purposeful."
134,pMD,Great job surrounded by great people,2018-09-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The employees at pMD are very nice, care a lot about the company, and provide a really supportive work environment. The company takes feedback from its customers and employees seriously. pMD is invested in building a terrific product and maintaining great relationships with customers. In addition, they provide many opportunities to accept responsibility and make a serious impact on the company.","It's a fast-paced job where your responsibilities can change from day-to-day. This helps keep the work interesting, but might not fit with those looking for a typical nine-to-five."
135,pMD,Exciting company on the verge of great things,2012-06-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Love the people I work with and the shared passion about what we are doing.   You are never bored here, that's for sure.  Always something new to work on and being a small company, you have the ability to work with several different departments.","If you don't like wearing many hats and having a lot of responsibility this may not be a good fit. Personally though,  I love it.  Keeps me on my toes and really close to our clients."
136,pMD,pMD is on the cutting edge of healthcare technology.,2015-01-27,5.0,Sales Manager,"pMD is not a startup, but the culture and working environment offer a lot of the same advantages. You're expected to wear many hats. People wear casual clothes to the office. There is a kitchen stocked with food and a giant beer fridge. We have a private plane. The office is beautiful and modern looking. We all have fancy cutting-edge MacBooks and giant hi-res Cinema Displays. The team feels like a big family, and it's a flat organization with no tolerance for the stifling bureaucracy that plagues large corporations. Since we're not a startup, we don't have to answer to investors. We control the company's destiny, which is quite empowering and allows us to be fairly nimble.

pMD has been a great experience for me. We do a great job hiring ambitious, energetic, positive, hard-working individuals that also love to have fun. The team is an absolute pleasure to work with. The products are well-designed and I truly believe that we are a disruptive force in the healthcare industry. This is the place to work if you want to change the world. Change, especially in healthcare, can be incredibly difficult; pMD embraces that challenge and expects employees to do the same. That's one of my favorite things about working for pMD.","pMD is a small company with a great product and a largely untapped market, so there's always more work to do. You're given a lot of latitude and as much responsibility as you can handle. Although I sometimes take on demanding projects that require long hours and a lot of travel, I find the work rewarding and I have a ton of great experience to show for it. I really enjoy working with people that have high expectations for themselves and the people around them. Regardless of tenure, the people that work hard and produce results are rewarded and promoted. Since it can feel like a pressure cooker at times, it might not be the right place for everybody. To do well at pMD, you have to be open to adapting and growing into new roles as the needs of the company and the industry change."
137,pMD,"A ""unicorn"" company: small, innovative, and fast-growing; yet stable, profitable, and never VC funded",2015-03-07,5.0,Director of Software Development,"In my opinion, pMD has some of the best aspects of a large company (profitable, stable, large user base of happy customers, existing products that are proven) and a small company (exciting ideas, small tight-knit team, fast moving, fun culture).

Speaking to my experience as a developer here, it's incredible to have so much close customer contact and to be able to make a difference in the lives of busy doctors who really need the help. To me, that's how you know your work is worthwhile - you hear firsthand from real people whose lives you're improving.

It's also been helpful for me to learn mobile software development at a company which has been doing it for more than 10 years. This is a company where mobile is part of the DNA and that definitely knows how to ship fantastic native apps for all kinds of mobile devices. There are fun, meaty technical challenges to make software that runs incredibly fast on a mobile device, even when it deals with sensitive data that must be encrypted.","I love the company a lot and I've been here since 2007, so I have to dig a bit to think of any major cons.

I would say that there can be a lot of travel to customer sites since we have a very in-person culture. If you're the kind of developer who rarely wants to see or interact with your customers, that would get tiresome. I find it energizing to get face time with our customers who are on the cutting edge of healthcare and whose ideas help to guide our product development. But it's not for everyone.

Also, the company is located in the Presidio in San Francisco, so it would be hard to get to the office if you live way out in the East Bay or South Bay."
138,pMD,Small company; big impact,2017-08-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"pMD is a great place to work; it’s truly a small company that’s making a huge impact on the health care world. I’ve worked on several different teams in my time at pMD, and I’ve had the chance to work closely with many of our amazing employees. From our most senior employees to our newest hires, everyone who works at pMD is incredibly intelligent, driven, and committed to our team, our customers, and our product. The whole team often mobilizes together in a truly impressive way to meet our shared goals.

Working at pMD has taught me a lot about the health care industry, and I feel very empowered to lead large and long-term projects that I would not have been able to a year ago. In both the health care and the technology industry, the learning curve can be steep, but at pMD, you’re given the tools you need to get up to speed.

I’ve had the chance to develop great relationships not only with my coworkers, but with our clients as well. It’s amazing to be able to work for a company whose products are embraced by its users. Based on our clients’ feedback and the constant changes to health care, we’re constantly iterating on and developing new features, and it’s a great experience to be so involved in the life cycle of new features.","Working at pMD is definitely not always a 9-5 gig. Travel, big projects, and competing priorities can lead to some long and tiring days. I feel our hard work always pays off in spades, but there will be times when it feels challenging to get everything done.

We are a growing company who has recently expanded to a variety of teams and roles. There’s a huge opportunity for professional growth, but there’s not always a ‘set in stone’ career path for every role. You have to be willing to take time and brainpower to shape your future with the company."
139,pMD,Rewarding Work at an Innovative Company!,2017-09-05,5.0,Software Engineer,"While the perks of working for pMD are amazing, the best part about pMD is the team: we are close-knit, dynamic, hard-working, and fun-loving. I started with pMD as an intern and had an amazing experience. The internship perfectly balanced pushing me outside my comfort zone with making sure that I had the resources necessary to fall back on when I needed them. pMD was also very adaptable and allowed me to have a flexible schedule as I finished up with my studies. Now that I have switched to a full-time role, I’ve been exposed to all the customer-facing aspects of pMD that make working here as an engineer so unique and fulfilling. 

The work is continuously interesting and, while it is challenging, the reward of being able to see the projects you work on impact real doctors’ everyday lives makes it so worth it. pMD is not just another start up, and it’s amazing to not only see the advances happening in healthcare, but to be able to help drive the industry forward. 

The entire leadership team at pMD has done a wonderful job building a collaborative and friendly culture at the company, and you can tell that they care about and invest in their employees. The culture is very positive and has helped me grow both personally and professionally.

pMD is a place where each individual impacts the company’s growth and helps continue to build a world-class company. Everyone is passionate about the work we do and takes personal ownership in helping us continually improve and grow.","Since we're a small team, you have to get comfortable wearing a number of hats, but the team does a great job of getting new employees up to speed on how to handle the variety of work through a well-developed orientation program. 

Each employee is given a lot of autonomy and trust, so you need to be comfortable taking responsibility, but this allows you to really feel the impact of your work."
140,pMD,Proud to be a pMDer,2018-06-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The pMD team is one in a million. I feel like you don’t come across a group of smart, driven, and passionate individuals like this at your average workplace. Teamwork truly makes the dream work, and everyone on the team cares for one another and helps each other succeed.  

The office is a huge open workspace, easy for the multiple departments to interact with each other. Also, great for a loop around on your electric scooter or skateboard. Lunch is catered everyday and there’s never a shortage of cheese-its and La Croix in the kitchen. Pretty much everyday, everyone actually sits down and has lunch together, which is not what I was accustomed to at other work places. Whether it's discussing new customers or plans for the upcoming weekend, the team actually spends time together which really speaks to the company culture.

Company, product, and employee growth are all high priorities!! pMD actually cares about your ideas and ambitions. Senior management encourages you to try new things and take on projects that you are passionate about. The structure of pMD is very unique in that, just because you are part of one department team, doesn’t mean you are pigeon-holed to doing just one thing at the company. 

As a young professional with not a ton of experience, in my last job I felt very placed behind the scenes and held back from being involved. Working at pMD has given me the opportunity to own my work and have responsibilities that are important to the success of the company and team. Every employee’s role is important and the amount of growth I’ve experienced is unparalleled to what I’ve had previously.","Being on the pMD team means wearing a lot of different hats. You have to be up for the challenge of taking yourself out of your comfort zone from time to time. The travel aspect is also not for everyone, but I think it can be a nice change of pace."
141,pMD,Passionate team working to save lives --- a breath of fresh air in the technology space,2018-09-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are many good things to say about the values of the company, the office space, benefits, etc,  but the most impactful to me has been the mentorship and support! The team is structured in a way where - no what stage you are in your career - you are able to ask questions, learn from others, and pass on your knowledge. In addition, training is taken very seriously here. As a smaller team, you are exposed to multiple teams and have the ability to uncover - then follow - hidden strengths. Together, this really promotes the development of your career, and fosters an open and collaborative workspace. 

The second best thing I've found is the camaraderie  and passion that everyone brings everyday to the office (and remotely). We really work as a team and bring our best to achieve success as a team. You are given projects that challenge you and help grow your career. Work hard, play hard! 

Lastly, our commitment to our mission and building the best product is something I value greatly. It's not often that a company can balance mission goals and ship quality software at the same time, but so far pMD has succeeded with that focus in mind. 

Onto the other parts ---
- airy and spacious office layout with great light/views
- open office layout with enough personal space to work independently as well
- pet-friendly office
- all the tools/software you need to do your work 
- travel to new places
- You are valued as a human being, not just an employee (birthday celebrations, personal successes, WFH, etc)",It is honestly difficult to think of a downside to working at pMD besides the fact that it may not be for everyone. It's definitely for someone on the more ambitious side who wants to further his or her career because you have challenging tasks that make a real impact on company growth.
142,pMD,"Mission-driven, successful small company that values its employees",2019-05-31,5.0,Vice President of Software Engineering,"I've been working for pMD for almost 12 years and have never encountered another company like it. pMD's origin story is unique (founder's mother suffered from medical errors, never sought VC or PE funding, built the business and grew deliberately over many years to create a great experience for customers, always been mobile software since the first release in 2001). Because of these unusual characteristics, pMD is a very different place to work from other small software companies.

As a result of the thoughtful and deliberate approach to building culture and team, pMD is full of hard-working, fun, proactive people with positive attitudes and in many cases a personal connection to our life-saving mission. pMD then provides extensive individual career mentorship to those people to help them grow as quickly as they're able. The result has been very happy customers (over 1,000 glowing reviews on our website) and a great team of very capable people who value the company's mission and our common goal to grow so that we can save more lives.

I've seen a lot of changes during my time at pMD and I've also been impressed by how the company's benefits have consistently expanded. I think it's now one of the best, if not the very best, benefits package of any comparably sized company, even competing with those offered by companies that are VC funded and may or may not be around in a few years.

For the right kind of person, pMD is a place that you can call home and where you can stay and grow for the rest of your career. That's a breath of fresh air in an industry where people change jobs every 1 - 2 years on average.",No one at pMD will slow you down from growing or stop you from taking on new responsibilities. Remember to take stock every so often and align with your manager on what your highest priorities are so that you don't burn out.
143,pMD,"Where exciting tech, fun culture and improving healthcare all align in a growing, small company",2019-06-07,5.0,Director of Sales,"I've had the privilege of working at pMD for almost a decade. Hands down the people and coworkers are what make pMD such a special place to work everyday. To maintain the fun, exciting, feel of a ""start-up"" even after the company has established itself as a premier software company in healthcare is an incredible feat! 

At pMD, we have incredibly talented people without egos that are committed to making a difference in healthcare while helping each other continue to progress their skillsets. You get a chance to wear many different hats and be exposed to different departments of the business which gives you a more holistic view of the company, feel more empowered to make a difference and learn from others. It's a great place to grow your career considering there's nothing from holding you back to rising to a leadership level as you continue to progress and excel. 

From a sales and customer standpoint, it's refreshing to know that we have an incredibly reliable and intuitive product to where practices, physicians, health systems and administrators are routinely thrilled with the service we provide. 

Lastly, of course the perks are all great (company provided lunches, wellness rooms, great office space, fun company outings and incentives, etc.) and exciting to see pMD continue to win Best Places to Work awards, but it's all about the people that you spend your day to day with that make it such a special place.","There's never a shortage of work that can be done or places to go for customer site visits, etc. That means there is also travel involved in most positions at pMD. It comes in waves and is articulated clearly in the interview process for expectations. However, if you're against travel, I'd be sure to get clarification on what's expected in the interview phases."
144,pMD,"Amazing company, even better team!",2019-06-28,5.0,PR Manager,"- The team is incredible. Everyone is super smart and passionate about both the company and customers.

Top management was always accessible and responsive on the few occasions I felt I needed its input or decisions. 
Even though I was only a part time team member, I was treated as a valuable asset and when I made errors, the team was encouraging, understanding and helpful.",Expense reimbursements are slower than typical in my experience.
