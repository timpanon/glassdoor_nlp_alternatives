99,AMD,Stay away from post silicon teams if you value work life balance.,2022-02-05,1.0,Senior Engineer,"1. ESPP is nice.
2. Vacation days increase from 15 days to up to 25 days based on service time.
3. Your experience depends on the team you end up on. Stay away from post silicon teams in general if you value work-life balance.
4. Free parking on site. Lots of good restaurants near the office.","1. Overtime is expected and is considered normal (60+ hours per week). Get prepared to give up most of your evenings, weekends and holidays. Note that this does not mean your efforts will be appreciated or that you will advance in your career faster. Some senior employees even work through vacation days.
2. Management does not care about employees. Constantly looking to make employees work through weekends, christmas break etc. with no additional pay or days back in lieu. Middle management blames senior management by saying these are requests cascaded from the top. 
3. Pay is the lowest in the industry. Competition (Intel/NVIDIA) pays significantly higher. For example, the base salary of a new grad at Intel is more than a senior engineer at AMD. 
4. Look out for ""recharge days"" through out the year. These recharge days come directly out of your vacation days. Sometimes a recharge day might fall on a friday which you take off and burn a vacation day, and then you might be expected to come in on the saturday to work. You do not get any additional pay or a day off in lieu for coming on a saturday. 
5. You'll notice that a lot of junior employees/new grads have lead positions. This is management trying to squeeze as much juice as possible while paying the lowest possible salaries.
6. Some teams can be cliquey. Some managers fraternize with some direct reports ( hanging out constantly outside of work ) which is completely unprofessional and leads to favouritism. If you're not part of this inner circle, you get passed over for promotions or higher raises. 
7. Female CEO but women face constant sexism. Women coming back from maternity leave lose their progress in advancing to the next level. Women taking their full maternity leave entitlement get shamed/talked about behind their back (as if maternity leave is a vacation). In the last women's day event held by the company, the guest speakers included caucasian male executives which many women raised as distasteful.
8. High turnover of experienced employees over the past year."

There are many good, smart, driven colleagues that do excellent work, deliver results and raise the bar for everyone. The cultural diversity is a also positive at AMD. 

The CEO is whip-smart and is getting proven results which are evident in its surging stock price.","The group in which I worked was led by a highly toxic Senior VP who managed by fear. This individual was a bully pure and simple. They made unreasonable demands, frequently delivered public reprimands, and cared little about their team’s personal lives or work/life balance. That fear-based management style trickled down to the levels below. If something wasn’t going well in the executive ranks, you could be sure that everyone felt the pain to some degree. 

Because these executives often achieve the desired results, I believe a blind eye is turned to the methods by which results were achieved. 

I’ll be honest, there’s a lot to admire about Lisa Su but the fear-based culture starts with her. She commonly operates in this way with other executives. 

These are is THE reasons I left. I wish I didn’t have to but my personal life and mental health were suffering. Many people in the same boat however couldn’t seem to take that step because the next paycheck or bonus is so attractive, and explains why tenure is often quite long."

- A lot of ""old guard"" that have let their skills run completely out of date but have decided they will continue to ride the gravy train to retirement
- There is something seriously wrong with the way the entire QA process. You can see it in forums that AMD notoriously releases buggy chipset firmware, driver software, etc with issues that should've easily been caught by QA.
- Often times projects that you work on will get axed for no apparent reason, leaving you with months and months of effort that is never used for anything
- It's difficult not to notice the insane gender imbalance. I get the tech industry as a whole has this issue, but there were less than a dozen women on a floor with several hundred guys. It's 2019, people..."

--The people, by and large, are wonderful - super nice and collaborative. 
--If you raise your hand and want to get involved with something, even outside of your immediate job area, your management will encourage you. 
--I'm not sure everyone realizes what a powerhouse Lisa Su is - she's a total badass and knows exactly what she's doing, and it's nice to have that kind of confidence in your CEO. 
--They also do a good job of moving around their top employees to do different things and get them promoted. 
--There is a lot of flexibility and autonomy - work from home (or wherever) is rarely an issue.","--The story of AMD is really compelling, but the workload can just be impossible. It's hard when you've worked so many long hours for so long to keep going sometimes. You'll rarely have a weekend off, and your vacation/holiday time isn't necessarily sacred either.
--They send mixed-messages on communicating to the executive team: they will say publicly that you can go to an executive and ask them a question, but when people actually do, executives often get offended.
--Salary and benefits are just okay, nothing to write home about. I know they try to keep an eye on what salary markets are doing, but their data gets so stale so quickly.
--As with any large company, things tend to happen slowly and you need like 8 layers of approval to get anything done.
--There are some managers who are fantastic, and others who are terrible. A great job can easily become miserable if you're assigned to a poor manager."

1324,AMD,Shooting itself on the foot,2016-03-07,2.0,SMTS Design Engineer,"-Like many reviews before point out, there is a good life-work balance. Be careful though because many individuals interpreted the very same thing in a more negative way (lack of ambition, schedules are rarely observed, ...). 

-There is a very positive consequence of not being a successful company: people tend to be more grounded than in other tech companies. The constant chaos results in workers that understand what the important things in life really are, and understand that most of them happen outside of the workplace.

-Strangely enough, you can get promoted fairly quickly (by elimination, everyone leaves but you), which may help out when you move to the next job","-The company is a mess. Upper management is there just to collect the $ and have no real intention to turn around the company (for starters, google ""AMD Rasgon bonuses"" and click on the Yahooo article)

-Employees are treated like idiots. We are promised a never-ending list of things that are oh-just-around-the-corner and never happen: more share in emerging markets, the emergence of a semi-custom business (fancy way to describe two game console wins), gaining market share back from NVIDIA (according to Lisa Su in 2014 ""there is no reason why AMD's graphics share should not be 50%"", it now stands below 30%), and so on. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me (and then I leave)

-Constant layoffs plus attrition = scarce engineering talent. It is very difficult for AMD to come up with good products considering the amount of good people who left, and the fact that they have been replaced by so-so engineers since top talent will land elsewhere

-Morale is low. The parking lot is almost empty by 6.30pm. You meet strangers and five minutes they are openly making fun of the company. The ex-CEO is laid off and given $5M in cash but people do not see any salary raise when they are promoted. 

-As the result of all of the above, AMD's technology understandably is way behind, which results on a death spiral: less revenues -> more losses -> more layoffs -> products are delayed -> products are no attractive by the time they hit the market -> less revenues"

 - Disconnect between the Graphics and CPU teams is a major barrier. 
 - Server products are nowhere to be seen in the last 3 years. Lets hope that the Zen core products will actually deliver but I suspect that it may be too little and too late.
- AMD is milking the goodwill that the buying public have and there is only a finite amount of that. Better products and marketing are the first in a long list of things that they need to do.
 - The 700lb CPU Gorilla in Blue and its Graphics sibling in Green mean that AMD has its product development spread too thin to win any significant market share.

1482,AMD,Drastic Changes needed in order to survive (perspective of an ASIC engineer),2015-08-14,2.0,Senior ASIC Engineer,"Opportunity to work on some really exciting cutting edge technology as well as learn and hone your skills. 

Current CEO genuinely cares about the company and is not just there to bide time before deploying the golden parachute. 

Current executives are starting to be aware of the problems (outlined in the two sections below) and may be able to turn the company around.","Non-existent raises and bonuses (not existent because of how poorly the company is currently performing). Huge discrepancy between people when it comes to responsibilities and compensation. You may be working like a dog and be responsible for a number of things, all while getting paid less than a person (same role and title, but different team) who is doing 20% of what you do while getting paid more. Frustrating lack of technical leadership. Most of the middle management really lacks technical skills which is unacceptable for an engineering company. (Many ASIC managers are not capable of any technical contribution and some lack understanding of some absolutely fundamental concepts). As a result, a lot of managers solve their problems by simply throwing more people at the issues. This empire building attitude creates large teams with a lot of weak engineers instead of lean, agile teams with strong engineers. During my past years with the company I have seen far more good people leave than join. A lot of groups have family (mafia) like relationships within them. While this may be a good thing because people have a lot of friends at the office, it does not promote a healthy, critical look at the teams (i.e. everyone is family; there are no strong or weak people). 

HR heavily influences promotion cycles which is highly demotivating and leads to a ""government job"" attitude at the workplace. Why work harder when you'll get your promotion anyways after x-number of years? This, again, does not encourage good people to stay at the company and is not a trait of a high-tech business.People are far more interested in keeping their job than seeing the company succeed."

Some enjoyable travel from time to time.","For me and others, observed wasted effort on projects without real follow through.  Too many work hours, especially with staffing cutbacks.  Saw many of best engineers leaving because of lack of performance leadership. Too many dinosaurs in middle and upper management; nice people, just didn't know how the company should be changing internally to compete. Too many folks don't understand how and why hardware gets bought. ATI integration took WAY too long and why oh why did they sell the handheld graphics unit ?! And they hitched the wagon to MSFT, should have supported Android years ago!"

That is, if you don't ask for promotion or compensation adjustments or bonuses.","Old people.  Old ideas.  To be promoted, you should have been with the company for a long time and know the old-timers.  Brown-nose the old guard: you will get promoted even almost every other year, even in these tough times.  I am now looking outside.  In the eight years, I worked here, I got a manager finally who I thought knew what we were doing.  Recently the management let him go!  He was modern in his style and was very innovative. I thought I had started enjoying work despite the financial conditions. The guy knew how to make remote employees work. He always went fighting for his engineers.  But one day I came to work and I was told he had been let off!  Now I am looking outside.  But feels sad to leave because I love what I have been doing here.  And, in Markham where I work, there is no other competing business.  I am so damned with this management we are considering relocating now."

I do feel that we have good products coming in on the market and are doing a decent job and research and development despite our financial situation.","The only downside is the pay. My initial pay I hired on as was on par with pay everyone else. However, the actual promotions and raises are very small, even though I had stellar reviews. I saw a lot of good people leave AMD within my short time I've been there. I've also seen multiple rounds of layoffs, which broadcasts AMD's instability.

1550,AMD,Opportunities and Instability,2015-05-31,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. AMD offers some very interesting work. Between ARM cores, x86 cores, and high-end graphics, AMD offers a variety of cutting-edge work that no other company can match. I have always been completely satisfied and stimulated with the work I have been given here. 
2. AMD is willing to give young engineers a great deal of responsibility, so one can grow quickly as an engineer here. This is a place where you feel that you can really make a difference. 
3. Although I think AMD's talent has degraded somewhat over recent years, there are still many talented and passionate engineers here from whom one can learn a great deal. 
4. The AMD executive team is fairly strong. Lisa Su in particular is exceedingly bright and well respected. 
5. AMD has all of the pieces in place to be a very successful company. With a lucky break here or there, it could become a very profitable company. 
6. AMD has an underdog culture that appeals to many.","1. AMD has been struggling mightily financially for about a decade now. There are frequent lay-offs and constant restructurings. This is not the place to work if stability is your primary desire in a job. 
2. Although AMD's pay and benefits are competitive, the company seldom makes money and thus generally doesn't pay out much in the way of bonuses or RSUs. Other companies can afford to be more generous here. 
3. AMD is contractually obligated to work with GlobalFoundaries, which has serious execution challenges that adversely impact AMD. It is frustrating to work so hard on a chip only to have the FAB not execute on it. 
4. AMD's teams are generally understaffed, so it is sometimes a challenge to maintain a good work/life balance. My balance is fine now, but it has been very poor on occasion. 
5. The design teams are very global. You'll probably find yourself on many late-night calls with China and India."

My counterparts were very eager to help and all-in-all I had a good experience learning about the technology. The place had it's own gym, a tennis court and a cafeteria that I'd frequent for lunches.","I rarely had some problems with the company. On rare occasions, I'd hear people's opinions on how there is a senior management issue but until the issue gets to my level, I rarely pay attention to words you hear from people. It started to be a problem when the company did waves of retrenchments. Since I was quite junior to the team (less than a year), I'd freak out everytime they did that. Until it happened to me one day and all I could do was think about the compensation to make me feel better. The sad part was that, I think the people they had selected to go were not really under-performing, it was just that they were newer than the people who are staying or that after a certain project is completed, they just downsize that easily."
1594,AMD,Employment at AMD,2015-03-17,4.0,,"There is interesting work on edge of technology, no limits for innovative engineers. The compensation is one from the best on the market.

Lots of opportunities to wear multiple hats as long as you show a willingness and ability to learn.  Onsite cafeteria, gym, and rec room (billiard table, Wii gaming console, table tennis).  Free coffee.  Onsite wellness checks.  Covered parking.","No formal training.  A lot of churn pertaining to work assignments and employees. Limited documentation, most of the knowledge base manifests as tribal knowledge requiring you to hunt down the right people in order to fulfill inquiries related to the current project.  Heavy workloads so most employees don't have the bandwidth to help answer questions.  Limited resources means employees with the ability to work multiple roles and/or figure things out get over-worked while others are hyper-focused on singular tasks and narrow skill sets.  Pay and compensation slightly below average for mid-level engineering/technical employees.  Multiple job titles/columns ensures ample confusion when trying to compare pay/compensation rate to the national average.  Slow to react to market trends.  Cuts to R&D really hurt future growth potential and the ability to expand the product line.  Advancement opportunities are very slow."

Layoffs have become an annual thing every fall.  In the last round of layoffs, they targeted mid-management, so after getting rewarded for good work with promotions, they got laid off.  A lot of managers with many years of people management experience were replaced with managers with zero people management experiences, so morale is very low.

The folks on my team are amazing, smart, and dedicated individuals who care about their work and want the company to succeed. Work-life balance is fantastic.","Over the last 3 to 5 years, I feel that interactions between organizations at AMD have have become much more confrontational. I have noticed much more finger pointing and failure to take responsibility. It's very likely that this change has been caused by resources being stretched too thin.

There is a strong push from upper management to transfer more responsibilities to pre-silicon teams, but those teams have so far been unable to deliver on their commitments in order to enable post-silicon teams to be successful.

The trend appears to be to move jobs overseas to lesser-skilled workers in India and Asia. My team has been tasked with training a set of employees in India. I suspect I will be let go later this year."

1620,AMD,Great environment for a job in this field in Colorado,2015-02-04,5.0,Design Engineer I,"Work is challenging, fun, and rewarding! There are a ton of interesting people and a lot of the team members enjoy each others company and it's a pretty good group. Pay is competitive, location is amazing, Importantly, the mid-level management (who the engineers deal with) is VERY flexible with hours, with taking time off, with load balancing in difficult times. I've literally never been overworked. Barring compute limitations, there's not a lot of excessive meetings and red tape to do actual work, the engineering team is pretty efficient.","There's not much effort put into training because there are a lot of smart stubborn people around who eventually just figure things out the hard way, but that's just stupid and frankly inefficient. The engineering team needs to better communicate concepts and strategies to each other and to new hires. There's a lot of people in their own world and like things done their own way, but this is unhealthy because if you don't collaborate and communicate then there are going to be different peoples' expectations that are at odds with each other. I don't think this is done intentionally though and most are courteous enough to take time to help you understand and open minded enough to change their minds if need be.

HEALTH CARE PLAN is lackluster (although it's essentially free) - little to no coverage for mental health, and if you want to see a specialist or go to urgent care, better start putting some $ into your HSA. It's about to get even worse too as the company will not seed HSA's in the coming years, so it's no better than out of pocket for most people. The more pricey plans don't have enough value for most people to warrant consideration."

1622,AMD,"I was very happy working for AMD, and was in for the long term.",2015-02-03,4.0,,"This is a ""scrappy"" company that has been through many ups and downs over the years, but has always fought hard to persevere.  They have attracted good, strong CEOs.  Many employees have been around for 10 years or more, in spite of regular layoffs in the last 6 or 8 years.","Upper management doesn't seem to stay for the long term, which hurts continuity.  VP level execs come and go on a regular basis (2 years seems most common).  Their prime focus often appears to be on change.  Not that change is all bad, but change for the sake of putting another bullet point on your resume, regardless of results, does not benefit the company in the long term.  Change is disruptive, so should be well thought out beyond a two year time frame."
1623,AMD,Cost-cutting has driven away many strong contributors,2015-01-27,2.0,Senior Member of Technical Staff,"In the early-to-mid 2000s, market conditions enabled the company to retain multiple strong design teams. Innovation was encouraged, for example, by awarding bonuses for patents. The sabbatical program was generous: 8 weeks paid vacation after every 7 years. Work-life balance is good, except for the inevitable need for late night meetings due to design teams spread over multiple time zones.","Many good employees left after taking their final sabbatical when management ended the program in the early 2010s. Cost-cutting, in the form of regular layoffs, forced many of the best engineers out. Getting communication from design teams halfway across the world became more difficult. The fundamental problem is that the traditional market -- CPU/GPU for desktop and laptop machines -- isn't growing fast enough."

Some of the cost cutting measures can introduce some annoying issues.
1627,AMD,Ups and Downs,2015-01-16,3.0,Senior Member of Technical Staff,"Some teams have healthy cultures. Some technical work is cutting-edge. It's a friendly atmosphere. AMD is never too formal. Flex time is possible so long as you're delivering stuff. There's often good collaboration across teams / sites / functions. Not much red tape. Work/life balance is fine in my experience, 40 hours will usually do it on most teams.

Not a lot of crazy pie-in-the-sky research projects -- everyone's work is directly related to products. And we do ship a lot of products, they are in people's hands.","Some teams have unhealthy cultures: some are documentation-free, some are led by bullies. A few entire teams are deadwood. Some very senior bullshitters have built empires for themselves, and you don't want to cross them. Some parts of the company are an old-boy network, and some of the old boys don't hardly deserve their privilege.

Revolving door senior management. Revolving door strategic plans. Annual layoffs and titanic-deck-chair-rearranging exercise. There are big upcoming debt payments, so a major future restructuring seems unavoidable.

There's been brain drain, and less mature people have been promoted to fill the gaps, this has led to coworker quality issues on some teams. 

No accountability. Nobody ever gets in trouble for missing deadlines, low quality deliverables. It's good enough right?

AMD can be democratic in the worst way. We can't do something unless everyone agrees, but we have to keep talking about it if anyone wants to do it. So there are a lot of ""efforts"" where 25 people get called to a weekly meeting to discuss some vague future process improvement which never goes anywhere. To survive, you have to develop a good sense of which efforts are fictitious and ignore them or decline participation."

This is the right direction in my opinion.",Change is extremely difficult in this 30+ year old company.  A company of this size should be a lot more agile.  There are a lot of siloed special interests that outwardly support change as long as it is not their area that changes.  I do not have the impression that the executive leadership team is completely bought into the vision they claim to support based on the behavior of middle management.  There is not enough focus on gross margin from the revenue side.  Lacks sufficient measurement and control of margin eroding discounting practices from the sales teams.  Serious need to flatten out end of quarter linearity but no focus in this area.

Many of the engineers are good, smart, hard-working people.  But this has nothing to do with AMD.  Many engineers in general are good, smart, hard-working people.  This comment is applicable to pretty much any company that has engineers!","After reading many reviews, it is apparent that experiences are quite varied in the company.  Here are the cons with platform development (board-level design):

1. No work-life balance for multiple reasons. (a)management will overload newer employees and allow Sr. Staff members to add to it. (b)Marketing will cancel projects after you have put in insane hours and then increase the quantity of SKUs without changing the deadlines =  More work expected in half the time.  No, your manager will not push back on your behalf.

2. Technical decisions are made by people who don't know.  Marketing wants something based on cost and an apples-oranges comparison with the competition, then it's up to the engineer to make it happen.  And no, the laws of physics are not considered an acceptable reason to why it can't be done.  
3. Career growth opportunities are extremely limited.  Those that exist are not given to the achievers, but rather the boss' friends.

4. POLITICS has killed Engineering! (a) Much of the hardware work is being shipped to China so everyone in platform is struggling to prove their value to the company; even if it means being treated like a doormat. (b) Senior Staff Engineers who have been promoted above their ability compensate by off-loading doomed-to-fail work and then pointing fingers when things don't work out. When a junior engineer succeeds, the senior guy will manage to pass off the success as his own. (c) You can never have an engineering discussion.  Any purely technical conversation is killed because it is above the heads of many (including the senior guys).  Mathematical explanations are disregarded unless you have experimental proof.  The experimental evidence may be physically impossible to obtain for any number of reasons, but that just means you are wrong. (d) The word ""ownership"" plagues the department to the point where it no longer has meaning.  You may ""own"" a design, but 3 of your colleagues have dictated what components you are to use, the PCB layer count, and thermal conditions so you have no room to design anything.  Your ownership has been reduced to schematic entry, and technician level testing.

5. Poor management.  Related to the point on politics, many managers are not qualified to lead their teams.  They are not as knowledgeable as  their reports.  The manager-employee relationship turns into a struggle and the employee will always lose with a disproportionate workload, no work-life balance, and poor performance reviews regardless of any significant contributions made to the company."

Work across many sites in Asia, India and North America.",Does not have money to hire and work machines and cad. Teams are stressed with current resources. Have to fight to get needed computing resources.
1750,AMD,"So much potential, but where are the visionary leaders?",2014-06-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Despite all the engineering/technical talent that has left in the past several years (mostly by choice, although layoffs have been devastating to morale as well as productivity), there are still some pretty sharp people around who want to do amazing things and might actually know how if given a chance and some breaks.","Despite their many years of experience, none of the most senior leaders has experience in a role similar to what they are currently in, none has been faced with the internal and external challenges facing AMD, most do not really understand the semiconductor industry or the markets AMD is targeting, and sadly, none really have the support of the employee population anymore (that started evaporating almost two years ago)."
1751,AMD,Politics galore,2014-06-02,2.0,Senior Product Engineer,Strong foundation in GPU division,Heavy politics through out the company and AMD brought over the politics into ATI post merger. Middle management from CPU side are only concerned about maintaining their entourage and do not appreciate what the GPU group has done in terms of technical efforts.
1752,AMD,Chaotic...,2014-05-31,3.0,Member of Technical Staff Software Development Engineer,There were good people around and I enjoyed the challenge of the work I had.,There were people who were promoted ahead of time and who could have benefited from closer supervision from above but did not get it....

1755,AMD,"Great place to learn, if you enjoy a challenge",2014-05-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Always challenging
* Many smart people, and almost all of them are willing to teach you what they know
* Very casual culture, engineers are generally approachable and friendly.  Dress code is non-existent.
* Technical ideas usually succeed on their merit - anyone can offer up a good idea and impact the product, no matter how junior
* Can-do attitude still exists, despite occasionally getting burned out
* Generous work from home policy and fairly flexible hours
* Flexible career path - managers are open and supportive of changing groups if you want to try another job (at least between verif/DFT/RTL/synthesis teams)
* Lower to mid level management all have engineering backgrounds and are technically competent
* Mid-to-senior level management has improved substantially on the engineering side - Jim Keller is an engineer's engineer which is great to have at an executive level","* Always challenging
* Workload can be very heavy at times, and additional compensation is rarely offered.  It is easy to burn out and largely your individual responsibility to manage your own workload and say when enough is enough
* Benefits are standard to sub-standard, have substantially declined during the no/negative-profit period and seem unlikely to improve any time soon, despite profitability
* Consistent low level attrition (this is maybe to be expected, as Austin has a very active market for chip designers)
* Cost cutting measures can make you feel like you're getting nickled and dimed to death sometimes
* It's not always clear what impact your work will make on the company's success until long after the fact.  Being highly self-motivated, enjoying a challenge, and being able to ignore high level distractions and just focus on the immediate project are requirements to work happily here - which is fine, as long as you fit that description.  If you don't, you may not enjoy it at all.
* Emotional stability is a requirement here.  You have to roll with the punches, including annual layoffs, and not get overly distracted or distraught.  The longer you work here, the easier it gets, and management is supportive, so this becomes less of a con over time."

- Good facility including underground parking and 24/7 gym","ATI used to be one of the best Canadian companies around until AMD (A Major Disaster) took over. Since then it has been a nightmare. There has not been a year that there is no lay offs. The company has no future and no product that can compete. Their most valuable asset is graphics (old ATI) in which without them they would have been dead by now. No room for grow as the promotions are far away and between. Most employees are fed up and just awaiting to receive a package to leave.

1774,AMD,Mediocre,2014-04-06,1.0,Technical Staff Member,"Not much. The notion of working with the smartest people mostly comes from recent graduates, just entering the field. Same for the cutting edge technologies - these technologies are becoming public domain anyway withing couple of month/year at most since prototyping at company. Besides, work is work, no matter if working with cutting edge or legacy technology - principles are the same.
Flexible hours is a big plus though.","Middle/lower tier management is a sheer menace. You might provide brilliant solutions/propose ideas/pioneer development in certain areas/deliver excellent presentations - the response would be - ...uh...ok...a-ha... In the end all that  stuff you poured your brain on and committed countless extra hours to, would be eventually ""rotated"" to some other people. 
If one is self-sufficient enough, he/she would resign to working alone, delivering results and reducing level of communication with superiors (according to workplace hierarchy, that is ) to a necessary  minimum. Once in a while, if you're lucky, you may be thrown a meager promotion.
In the end this honorable path would lead to elimination from company workforce. When company is doing reasonably well, you are tolerated. Once layoffs are in the agenda - you are out, even with a spotless performance record and track of good reviews."
1775,AMD,Was a good company,2014-04-03,2.0,Financial Analyst,Casual environment/ dress code. Flexible working hours. Work-life balance can be achieved. Easy access to higher management and 1:1 regular interviews may be helpful to carry out career plan.,"No clear visibility in career promotion/ advancement. It seems to be very random and depressing. 
Management decision-making process sometimes really unclear and depends on personal connections. For example, my offer was changed from contract to full-time without compensation advance. HR department told me it was a done deal and they did not even ask me about it."

The company is fairly open, decisions seem to be communicated when they are made, and we are generally free to cross chat between teams.

1858,AMD,AMD - in retrospect,2013-10-21,3.0,CAD Engineer,"I worked at AMD for many years in 7 different groups.  Had the opportunity to work with many great people.  AMD allows their employees the freedom to get the job done through flexible schedules and tele-commuting from home.  AMD provides many community outreach projects and activities to help promote bonds between employees.  A great place to start, then run.","Incentives such as  stock purchase, target bonuses have been reduced or eliminated.  Multiple influences from upper management promote mission creep, incomplete projects, and changing product line focus.  These type of actions blow schedules, promote employee migration and layoffs."
1859,AMD,Managers at AMD are living proof of the Dilbert principle,2013-10-19,1.0,Software,"- If you don't want to do any meaningful work, and just collect a paycheck, AMD is a good company","- If you want to learn, and grow in your career, stay away from this company. 

Project managers with their worthless PMP certificate run the show. Development morale is at an all time low. Developers don't give a flip about doing a good job, most of them have become desensitized because they constantly put out fires, and fix problems caused by bad planning and incompetent project management. They don't care about innovation. Innovative ideas are usually poorly executed, making the product WORSE.

Ideas don't come from developers and engineers, it comes from marketing. AMD always plays catch-up. AMD is an extremely poor jack of all trades. The only reason this company exists is because they sell cheap crap.

There is no prospect for advancement, if you start your job on the wrong team. AMD will never have swan stories of somebody who started in the mail-room (or the equivalent for an engineer), and worked his way up the chain and became successful. They hire ""experienced"" people from outside the company, and pay them 2x what somebody who's been with the company for 5 years makes. No internal promotions. You might get a title bump if your manager likes you, and you'll get more opportunities to tell other people how to do their jobs while checking your facebook."

Physical design side, there is vast array of scope to work on from RTL to GDS. There is custom work still left in few areas of core. Moving to new markets makes sense e.g. dense servers and custom products.",Too much bureaucracy lately. Management was unaware what products to build on priority basis and what's best processes to build but it seems to be changing.

Health benefits exceeded the industry standard. I never paid anything except a small co-pay, even for major surgery.

Absolutely amazing colleagues. Some of the brightest minds in the world work there.","What you’re hired at was about as good as it gets.  The company would consistently hire very senior level people, at very competitive salaries, and then assign them a title that would limit their potential for receiving any significant form of raise.  Most often the salary increases wouldn’t even cover increases in cost of living (not good for a long term career).  Often when referring people into he company we would inform them to only accept a position if the company agreed to change the title to a higher level, thus forcing them to be hired at the bottom of the salary range with room for salary increases.

The Information Technology teams were re-organized SIX TIMES from the beginning of 2010 to the latter half of 2012.  By the end the staff was “siloed” into groups based on very specific functions, and none of these groups communicated well. This made it impossible to complete any project.  By the end of this time it was common to say “If you don’t like what you’re doing, just wait two months”.

If you are not located in Austin, TX then you will often get overlooked (referred to internally as “Good ole Boy Syndrome”)

There is a major lack of focus from upper management (Director up), and middle management is horribly overworked (promotion to management was considered a death sentence)."

talented and pretty bright guys that were real drivers of the team, all in the name of cutting loss.Not performance related layoffs, atleast not this time as far as I can see!!.","Reory Read needs to change his plans. He needs to comeup with clear product lines that can fetch us money. Instead of just laying people off and dissovling the company and while keeping his job!!. 
The low power mobile market AMD is planning to enter is already saturated with Qcom,nVidia,TI and others. And AMD is like an year away from a real good tested product to compete in that space.
Then comes performance of the products which was always questionable aganist Intel. So although I still work here, I see a shakey future. Reory read, needs to come up with a plan to back fill with a vision of good products. Just licensing ARM wont cut it!. All those companies do it too, including Samsung.
One more thing: AMD needs foot soliders- engineers to ge the job done. But AMD is top heavy
with  lots of Directors and Senior managers. Why?. Reason?.  Lay them off instead and 
consolidate your org.  I am against letting go bright enigneers. Reory Read is not ""Read""ing it right!

The promotions are few and far between and seem to be heavily based on who senior management sees most, not necessarily who is doing a good job.  You boss also has to like you because it appears they need to burn political capital to get promotions for non-senior management noticed people.  Management lets you do your thing, but that means when the poop hits the fan you can get fried too.  They don't really know what you do or how involved or difficult it is.  Raises are small.

2) Work life balance - Other than bringup/launch times, plenty of leeway was given to do the things that we all want to do: go to school with kids, eat dinner at home with family, go the the gym, etc.
3) Doing what you want - I was firm enough with my manager that when I said I was going to do something, I meant it.  So, when I wanted to learn something new, I was able to go do it.","1) Squeaky wheel syndrome - I was squeaky, so I got more grease than those around me, but they don't give you ANYTHING that you don't demand.  They really should reward people for their effort, not for their complaining.

(2) Decent work-life balance, but that is changing.
(3) Employees starting their careers get a chance to learn a lot compared to bigger companies.","(1) This is not a company to join for long term growth prospects. The most productive period of an engineer in AMD is the first 3-4 years from joining.
(2) The senior management is increasingly adopting an engineer unfriendly approach (think of Google, then reverse it). As a result, the best and brightest are increasingly calling it quits, and it seems the management does not care. There is no effort whatsoever to either retain existing talent or to attract talent.
(3) When experienced engineers quit, they are largely replaced by Program Managers (or people with equivalent skill sets), causing a severe dearth in technical leadership.
(4) There is no support for any out-of-the-box thinking at all, which is what made AMD a household name to begin with."
