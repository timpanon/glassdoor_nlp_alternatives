Great CEO and company usually stays out of the media compared to other Tech companies. Fantastic work/life balance.","Almost zero vertical mobility. Lots of people leaving for senior leadership roles elsewhere and then some come back years later in higher roles. Utah is still treated low for pay compared to most other places in the US.

- Looks great on a resume
- Sometimes they brought a literal cash grab machine into the office (pre-COVID)","The flip side is that you're not a person or have any intrinsic value, you are simply a number or name on the spreadsheet that is expected to deliver.

- For a CS role, it was extremely focused on upsell/cross-sell and you'd be expected to sell at all costs (especially to the detriment of the customer)

You need them to fight for you, elevate you, highlight your accomplishments to senior management otherwise you get lost in the shuffle. They don't encourage movement to other depts as much as other companies, and it can literally take years to get a promotion. The unspoken rule is you do the job for a year and then get the promotion. Also, be vocal and open with others about equity/stock/shares. I found out it was very unfairly distributed on my old team with some people in management lying about it without even being asked directly."

Adobe also has many bright minds that are great to work with - especially within product.","Adobe's operations divisions are surprisingly disorganized given Adobe's size and reputation. Adobe wouldn't be Adobe without 5 teams all doing the same thing. 

The data is also very disorganized requiring extensive munging when building pipelines to projects. Much of Ops management is also old fashioned - still using Excel and PowerPoint for everything.

Slow to promote. Poor work/life balance (turns out when there's unlimited PTO, a culture forms where people rarely take any)"
79,Adobe,Old school,2022-01-14,4.0,Legal Counsel,Compensation is market for old tech,Old tech with boring products and a generic culture
80,Adobe,The least toxic employer I've ever had,2022-01-14,5.0,Senior Site Reliability Engineer,"The company as a whole is very good about keeping the toxicity common to large corporations at a minimum. Because of its heritage as a software engineering company more than what's considered a ""tech company"" today, there's a very healthy engineering culture with a relatively low level of meddling by upper and middle management in most parts of the company. Employee benefits are very strong and the company is excellent at integrating a remote and geo-diverse workforce, even prior to the pandemic. The headquarters facility is well-run and facility staff (from building operations to kitchens to security and safety) are fantastic.

Incredibly smart people work here and for the most part embody the company's stated value of bringing their genuine selves to work.","Compensation and growth opportunity is not commensurate with the company's stated aims for employees. After a decade of record-breaking years, employee compensation rises quite modestly.

The engineering heritage of the company is eroding a bit. Offices with doors that close and allow engineers to think about problems and solve them were torn out and replaced with open plan spaces that are noisy, busy, and unproductive.

Reorgs are increasing in frequency -- something of a red flag -- and often disruptive."

85,Adobe,Magento Commerce Group is Toxic,2022-01-05,1.0,Senior Software Architect,"Adobe Brand
Benefits
Good products 
Vacations
Good technology","Magento team is extremely unethical and toxic. They hire outside talent to help them, but they don't have ability to listen new ideas and proven approaches from industry. 

Leadership is unethical, play dirty politics, break promises, lie frequently, play favoritism due to various biases. Seen people there leading engineering teams who has never coded in life, cannot understand complex design discussions and problems but still played their way to higher ranks. It doesn't matter what you know and can do, but it matter who you play with better.

They don't realize that these non technical politically correct people are easily replaceable but not hard working engineers with proven industry experience. 

I have seen more than few people left under extreme depression due to all these politics and toxic culture. Sad part is that even after escalations to higher management by multiple peoole, they didn't do much.  If someone looking for a growth within a company, instead of helping, they are cutting people who are not 100% agreeing with their approach, they need yes man without ability to challenge the status quo.

Even though they have failed strategy for many years now within Magento. They are truly working like an organized gang of people who know each other previously, anyone else coming from outside with high potential is seen as threat to their insecure minds."
86,Adobe,Good pay and benefits.,2022-01-04,4.0,SMB Account Executive,"Good pay and benefits, atmosphere is usually fun.","They are extremely political in everything they do and push their ideals on their employees. 

Work to life balance can also be an issue at times."
87,Adobe,Employee focused and socially aware,2022-01-04,5.0,Software Architect,"Adobe has been great to work for, they work very hard to make sure that employees have the resources they need to succeed. I appreciate their aggressive moves towards diversity and pay equality as well as supporting the communities they are in throughout the globe.","Adobe is a very large company and that means that things move slower (career-wise) than they would in a small company, and it suffers from the same thing that many Silicon Valley companies suffer from which is that if you want to progress your career it is faster and more effective to leave the company than to work your way through the internal bureaucracy."

89,Adobe,Awesome Company to Work For,2021-12-22,5.0,Program Manager,"Culture, Values, Pay, Benefits, Opportunity","Large Matrix, sometimes slow to outcome"
90,Adobe,New ugly side,2021-12-21,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Been here over 8 years and had a great ride. Considered top talent and been well-compensated. Stock price has really appreciated. I've contributed to multiple new products generating $100M+ annually and a handful of new patents. As a female engineering leader I feel I've been treated equally relative to my male peers which isn't the case elsewhere. Fantastic people, excellent company culture, successful business & operating model.","The last two years have brought out a new ugly side of Adobe, unfortunately. Executive leadership is all in California resulting in insular thinking and is clearly being more open about their support of left-leaning politics. My peers in other locations feel our leaders lack awareness of different perspectives, lifestyles and experiences of employees across the United States. Being in CA myself its harder to understand this but in recent months I can see what they're talking about. Examples include Adobe's prompt action to subject itself to President Biden's ETS vaccine mandate seemingly before the ink had dried. During my team here Adobe has never, I repeat, NEVER been a front-runner on any issues involving difficult decisions and significant change... but rather we conservatively and prudently wait to see what other major tech players do along with the consequences, and then follow suit or act differently if appropriate. In the case of ETS, many other tech companies and large employers are waiting for this controversial issue to play out in the courts and ultimately the Supreme Court before imposing what can be such a life/career-changing requirement on their employees. But contrary to the Adobe I've grown to love, it feels its appropriate to force all employees - remote or not - to vaccination NOW regardless of current and future court outcomes. And another example: occasionally, we deliberately 'over-rotate' with our diversity and inclusion efforts resulting in obvious reverse discrimination in our hiring practices and development opportunities, but leadership casually sweeps it under the rug. Its painful to write such a review about a company with 9 great things to every 1 drawback, but these drawbacks are inexcusable and SO uncharacteristic of our Adobe-4-All mantra."

Love Covid global days off and hope they continue. Love that they subsidize your personal volunteering with extra donations from Adobe.","Workload is high, especially at End of Quarter. Some mid-level management (at least in my department) is pretty unaware of work below them and too focused on pleasing other departments over protecting their team from unnecessary work.

198,Adobe,Acquisition Woes & Toxic Adobe Lehi Culture,2021-08-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, beautiful facility, global COVID days off, bereavement leave for pregnancy loss","Adobe is ranked as one of the best companies to work for, which not only conflicts with my experience at Adobe, but makes me worried about going somewhere else. My experience at Adobe has been so poor. After reading my examples below, you may ask yourself, ""Why not go somewhere else?"" My answer is that if this is as good as it gets, there is nowhere that will be better than Adobe and that is why I am still here.

Examples: 
1. Myself and others were misleveled upon acquisition and have been essentially told to ""deal with it."" In regards to pay, a female manager alerted Adobe she was underpaid not only at her level, but at the level below her, and was told to be grateful for what she has and that no laws had been broken. Many people have given Adobe the opportunity to make things right since the acquisition, myself included, and Adobe has refused each time. 
2. There is a toxic, White, patriarchal culture that is pervasive throughout Utah. It exists at Adobe Lehi. White men hire white men and are offended (and retaliate) when diversity concerns are raised.
3. The ERC does not take employee concerns seriously. It is well known, and openly discussed, that you should not surface concerns to that organization. The default is inaction. I know several people who are considering their legal options to get concerns addressed. Note: If you are a current employee reading this and you have to go to the ERC, please document all interactions with them and avoid meeting in person. Better yet, go directly to your HR Business Partner.
4. Male leaders are not punished for their sexist behavior. When reported to their superiors, they tell us things like, ""He's better than he was,"" and, ""He's just lonely. Cut him some slack.""

TLDR; When you have enough resources, you can make anything look better than reality. I believe that is what Adobe does. Investing resources into community events, internal groups, etc. is insufficient when you are unwilling to do the work to create a truly healthy work culture. I know I speak for other women at Adobe Lehi when I say we want to be paid and leveled fairly, treated with respect, and listened to when serious issues occur."

- Everyone is very approachable. I have never felt like ""I can't talk to that person"". 
- Adobe as a company actually tries *hard* to do the right thing. When social issues have come up (internal or external), there has been a fairly open discussion and the companies actions have been transparent and understandable even when not everyone agrees with them.
- We have a huge amount of technical freedom and a rich and deep research organization always coming up with new things to try.","- We are still struggling to really nail our server offerings on the creative side. This is an opportunity -- if you are someone who shines in that arena we need you!
- We are dependent on our platform partners to be able to deliver the best experience to our customers. That can be problematic at times.

They prefer external candidates as compared to hiring some one within Adobe. The support teams supporting various enterprise products burn the midnight oil working weekends during the summer shutdown, winter shutdown doing an on-call rotation and don't get compensated. The senior management keeps talking about work life balance but when it comes to taking care of employees in a practical way they lack a vision. Other companies like Facebook, Ebay , Cisco who run the 24 hr operations have a dedicated NOC team, thats not the case here in Adobe where the teams are expected to do regular work and support the On call as well.

268,Adobe,Cards are stacked against you but at least you have great benefits,2021-05-25,3.0,Enterprise Account Executive,Adobe has great benefits and a great employee stock purchase program.,"Management treats employees like names on a spreadsheet. They do not care about your experience or strengths when considering new opportunities. Management does not lead, they are often unresponsive and unavailable to meet. 

It's very hard to get paid at Adobe. Lists are constantly changing, you are responsible for attrition, there is very little help in generating pipeline and managers are slow/hesitant to approve comp exceptions.

Quotas are unreasonably high and you do not have the support from management, BDRs, Inside Sales or Marketing to grow pipeline. Solutions Consultants are amazing but stretched too thin.

Forecast calls are terrifying. Management looks through opportunities in Salesforce and then interrogates seller in front of entire team.

Also, Adobe does not want to pay you. If you have a nice base, I think that they will give you a list and quota so high it's unattainable. You will not get a raise and if you do it could be applied to your variable."

But there’s a gap....","After several weeks of onboarding and participating in discovery meetings, it was clear that Adobe VPs and “heads of x” weren’t carrying the culture created by executive leadership down and through to the  individual contributors.  There is also a significant amount of unhappiness within the DX marketing org. Apparently there was a re-org last fall, and few understand their job and those that do, aren’t happy in their new roles. They openly admit they’re not sure how to integrate Workfront resources and because of that, they are pausing on spending time learning until they have to. Layer on top of that no clear direction from Workfront marketing leadership on new messaging and themes. It takes forever to get anything approved by Adobe. All of this creates doubt about the future. Without clear direction and lack of culture, me and many others jumped ship."

Lot's of pressure to exceed utilization hours to meet numbers every quarter. The mantra is to bill as many hours as you can. It is important to hold people accountable and to achieve goals, so there is a silver lining, but it is difficult to strike the right balance between overwork and sanity.

388,Adobe,Exceptional company with rigorous standards,2021-02-22,5.0,Customer Success Engineer,"I could write a novel of pros for Adobe. They have a genuine concern for employee well-being from physical to mental health, work-life balance, to job satisfaction.

The whole company genuinely feels like a cohesive team, all working toward the same goals with the same passion and concern for one-another. Despite the organizations size, sub-teams feel like smaller businesses that are easy to navigate socially and professionally. The clear work-ethic throughout inspires an overall attitude of excellence and drives you to achieve and work harder daily. Goals are clear, the workload is communicated and understood.","Every company has it's flaws, but it's challenging to pull out anything more than a minor complain that would be commonly found anywhere. The workload for my time is a little higher than it maybe should be, but I'm confident efforts are constantly underway to make improvements and hire more great people to fill in.

Unless you are willing to venture out and make yourself known, you could potentially feel isolated from a social perspective, especially during Covid, but even minor effort takes you a long way."

441,Adobe,Marketo Specific Review,2021-01-22,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"Benefits are amazing
Innovative customers 
Awesome events held by Adobe","The only thing that will keep your head above water working with Marketo CS is the benefit of working for Adobe, but the two are still very disconnected. Marketo CSMs are treated like secondhand citizens, your compensation will be lower than what you see listed for an Adobe CSM and if you are not Enterprise you will have an aggressive and arguably unattainable sales goal. This isn't truly Customer Success, it is sales and do not let them tell you it isn't. They have also implemented a new ""level"" system that makes it so they can tell you you are getting promoted without actually giving you any title change or any significant compensation increase. 

Management plays favorites and is extremely cliquey. If you aren't meeting quota you will be treated like scum and if you are meeting quota they will treat you like you got lucky and that you better double it or else. They create a toxic environment of competition between the employees and there is a real high school mean girl mentality with a lot of the CSMs and if you are not in their inner circle you will get to look forward to snide comments about your performance, looks, or really anything they can come up with to try and knock you down a peg. I know several people, including myself, had to start going to therapy to deal with the environment. Thank god Adobe benefits cover it! I still flinch at the sound of a Slack notification from the issues with this team. 

There is also no official training and you can go your entire career here never actually getting into the product. I literally have never actively been inside the Marketo product, they do not even give CSMs a demo environment to test in or be trained at all. The one silver lining in that mess is that you have an SC team that knows what they are doing. I have never worked with more capable people than the people on that team and they can cover you for demos, but it needs to be tied to a new money deal, not troubleshooting with a customer or helping them understand a product they maybe just purchased. 

My advice to people who just want a foot into Adobe, join Marketo it's less competitive than the other products, but keep in mind that management isn't on your side to jump to other teams so if you can network under the radar that's your only chance. They don't want to lose anyone because turnover is already bad. I watched them lose a lot of amazing top performers to other companies because of this. Your opinion doesn't matter here, but the rest of Adobe seems to actually care about career growth."

- I worked in the creative cloud team and the work expectations are too much
- They talk about gender equal etc but I don't see it practically, If you are a working mother or female in general, what you speak weights less
- They do not take 360degree feedback during performance reviews, manager just takes the review from one senior engineer whom he believes and your performance is measured based on your relationship with that sr engineer.
- Manager do not say it, but they expect ppl to finish ur sprint work (how much ever time it takes, they only need end result)as well as spend some extra time and contribute to projects outside what you do and also do regular brown bag sessions and presentations, in short work for more than 50hrs per week and thats what they consider to promote you.
- If the manager does not like anything in you, they put on PIP(performance improvement plan), and u should agree to whatever they say, and if they decide to fire you, whatever you try to improve they don't even consider it. 
- So, if they put you on PIP, better quit the company and move to something else
- Overall, bad experience in my entire 15 years of career."

When they make a mistake, it's ok because everyone makes mistakes. They cover it up like no one made a mistake. As much as you try to include everyone and work as a team, the previous group does not want to be any part of it. It's there way or the highway.

For this review, please know I left under good circumstances. I was not hit as hard with what follows as some, but I got out while the gettin' was good. Adobe sales comp is totally [insert your worst curse word here] messed up. They have a negative dollar to dollar hit to quota for any customer who cancels. This means you inherit a customer who is cancelling a $500K - $1M license and you are immediately that much in the hole. For a relationship you didn't start, and had no influence on. They have tried to ""fix"" it, but their fix was retroactive and I have friends who ended up owing Adobe $20K - $30K in COMPENSATION after the ""fix"".

The company's response to COVID has been both humane (giving us company-wide time off on a regular basis) and customer-centered (focusing only on the priorities that'll help our users the most). 

When people take time off, they're truly off; on my team, we don't come back to missed Slack messages on Monday mornings (or even many weekday mornings). For the summer shutdown (a week) and winter shutdown (another week), email is truly silent as everyone takes real time away from work, and we all come back ready to go again.

I get to work in extremely technically advanced spaces while keeping time for myself and my family, and am ecstatic to have landed at a company that supports both.","It's a big company, so things can move slowly; the focus on robustness means that you're unlikely to start working in the latest-and-greatest UI frameworks or to integrate exciting betas of third-party products. Adobe makes up for this by being fast on hardware adoption, though – the products have got to work on a variety of chips for extremely advanced levels of work (hardware demos often show off how well a new machine runs Adobe editing software), so the research teams get to skate out ahead of the rest of us."

Consulting is a great practice because you get to work with a huge variety of clients on challenging problems. Always a different team and a lot of variety so you learn a ton. I had some amazing opportunities for growth. The values of Adobe as a whole are incredibly strong and make it a great place to work.","Sr Management came in from Big 5 consulting and tried to recreate a sweatshop like you have at bigger firms with recent college grads - expect our teams were 15+ years into their careers. They started treating people like numbers and it turned a job that everyone loved into one that everyone disliked. People don't leave jobs, they leave bad managers. They were always moving the goal post and never took the time to celebrate achievements. But Adobe is a classic case of ""golden handcuffs"" - even when you are unhappy, people stay because the benefits are so good. If they were to replace Sr Management for consulting with people who had trust in their teams and helped them grow, it would be a great place to work again."

Moderately competitive pay, hard to compete with FAANG numbers, but close.","Core technology is not valued enough, built by offshore teams that simply could not care less about writing good code. Nearly everything below the product-level code is a disaster (one either in progress or waiting to happen).

Product teams have some geniuses in their field - if you can work with them, absolutely do so.

Interview process is probably too easy, to a fault. You're going to work with some folks that coasted through the last 10 years because they know how to write a for loop. A lot of engineering fat, process bloat."

For the second month in a row they are not paying out commissions that sales reps earned in December and January. This means that the commissions you earned in December are paid in APRIL.

No formal process, I've worked over 9 years but to this day, under scope projects still constantly happen where sales team ""can promise the stars"" and consulting ""needs to deliver"". Lack of accountability between the two groups.
- Lack of formal training, mostly done via videos or just an informal on-the-job training or ""figure-it-yourself"" situation.
- In terms of the cloud solution, it's a bit siloed, cross training or knowledge share is lacking."

625,Adobe,Marketo Commercial CSM org is in full tail spin -2020,2020-02-24,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"Unlimited PTO (but strings attached to take it).
Stock options (but Adobe takes their taxes out of your stock credits).
Ability to work from home Wednesdays (but can be taken away on management discretion).
Co-workers are all very intelligent and great Denver office.
Parking and commuter benefits to office off 18th and California 
Well stocked kitchen with snacks, drinks and food.
Lunch provided last two business days of the month.
Two kegs tapped on Friday after 3 PM.
$360 yearly health credit (Most people used for ski pass)
~$1k dropped into HSA for high deductible healthplan per year
Pet insurance offering.","Commissions not being paid on time because ""Someone left the business.""
Compensation plans not being delivered until a quarter of the way through the fiscal year.
Sales targets are increased by 10-20% over last year with less ability to meet them.

Senior management never has answers for direct questions and is not genuine or forthcoming with what's really happening from top down decision making.
Same Senior Management has been promoted for the team's performance, but creates negative culture putting extreme pressure on FLMs that is then transferred to FLM to CSM relationships.
There is a palpable distrust and dislike for senior management throughout the org and cross-functional teams. This makes it difficult for any other team to want to work or support the Commercial CSM org.
Crying, confusion, discomfort and overall uneasiness ripples throughout the entire org regularly.
Feedback is rarely asked for, and when received goes no where.
Renewal team operated without a manager for almost 12 months
Layers of middle management have been added.

Constantly changing and broken quoting tool.
Accounts have changed hands multiple times, which is well known as a major complaint from customers as to why they leave Marketo.
CSMs are the catch all for almost everything related to current customers, where more responsibility is added but compensation is not raised.
Asking to utilize your unlimited PTO is only approved based on your performance.
Favoritism from FLMs to their favorite CSM friends.
No on-boarding  or mentoring for new CSMs when they join the org.
No known promotion track for CSMs.
Overall lack of diversity on the team with only two POC in the entire org.

Competitors are catching up with Marketo in regards to pricing and functionality which is making the CSMs ability to renew or expand customer much harder. 
Customers are expected to spend 8% more per year with almost no additional functionality added to their subscription.
Auto-renewal language added to contracts as sneaky way to make them stay with the company. 
Product reliability has been viewed from customer perspective as going downhill.
Forcing customers to purchase Professional Services to get basic help utilizing the product.

Non-existent training on Marketo product itself.
CSMs are expected to ""learn as they go"" while being the trusted adviser for the customers marketing decision making."

- As a designer, you are so close to the tools that you use.","- I think this happens at a lot of big companies, but you sometimes feel like a cog in the wheel.
- Acquisitions are a heavy strategy for Adobe, so sometimes you end up trying to tie solutions together rather than ideating completely new solutions.
- Navigating a highly matrixed, political system is sometimes draining. Can feel like you spend way more time in meetings than designing."

634,Adobe,"Hostile work environment, fear and intimidation",2020-01-26,1.0,Support Engineer,Nothing other than good insurance.,"New Magento support management that started in October 2018 has created an environment of fear and intimidation. They have put at least one person on a PIP in each support team and fired them to scare everybody else. We  feel disconnected from larger Adobe. Management has absolutely zero respect to their subordinates, especially lower ranking ones. 
Adobe ""Unlimited PTO"" has been codified into 10 business day per year by support management. Mandatory overtime that is enforced by fear. 
6-week competition with $25 gift card prize  - what a joke."

There are plenty of opportunities to nuture your career, but I didn't feel like I needed to burn the candle at both ends to be successful.  I appreciated that balance.","Since Adobe is quite large, it is essential to get to know how all the various stakeholders work together.

- Amazing vision and story to tell customers
- A lot to learn since the product suite and industries they touch keeps growing
- Cruise by and still not get fired makes for a pretty easy job 
- Amazing PR and on many lists of ""best places to work"" so you can share that on social media","- Very political organization like many other large corporations with ""meh....so so"" leaders who either moved up the ranks by just working there forever (but didn't grow true leadership skills) or newer and somewhat better leaders who are cut-throat and moved up by stomping on others
- Does not care about people, it's all about closing business and leveraging the weaker/nice people to push their agendas
- No people develop whatsoever, no concept of goal setting, quarterly check-in and promotions happen based on tenure not talent/deliverables. 
- Mid-level managers are just individual contributors with a manager title, you will learn nothing from them and they won't develop you either. They cruise and hope you cruise with them
- No diversity even though they are on many lists, its all paid PR. Most of the top leaders are White or Indian men. They have some token female leaders but they all hold leadership roles for HR or CSM type organizations and they aren't the best of the best coz they keep the best to do actual work."

657,Adobe,Best company i've worked for,2019-11-12,5.0,Product Manager,"- The company has fantastic work/life balance and gives you a lot of autonomy. If you want to work from home, they're cool with it. If you want to work in the office, they're cool with it. 

- The company genuinely values employees, they want to retain people and will absolutely let you move teams/products/office locations/cities to keep your experience and knowledge in the company rather than watching you walk out. 

- Shantanu 

- Sr mgmt is good, they have experience in the space and have the people management chops to make working easier/enjoyable 

- They have a clear strategy & vision thats guiding their product investments and they communicate it regularly","- It's gets a little crunch-y leading up to product launches or big announcements, but thats kind of expected

- Adobe is a company built on acquisitions, and while the business strategy is usually rock solid, sometimes the comms isn't. It's tough to get any insight about what other business units are doing unless leadership gives a super high level read out during an all hands or there's a specific task that requires collaboration. 

- Some decisions are made from a bit too far up the org chart, things can get a bit ""top heavy"" at times"
658,Adobe,A great place to work!,2019-11-05,5.0,Senior Computer Scientist,Very creative & innovative place full of technically sound people. Work environment is really good & they take good care of employees.,Compensation is a bit low when compared to other companies in the area.
659,Adobe,An Amazing Employer That Wants To Help You Grow,2019-11-04,5.0,Marketing Manager,"A lot of companies expect you to just sit, put your head down, work for 8 hours, and go home. This is NOT that place. Adobe prides itself on its company culture and it shows tremendously through the leadership, its people, and its dedication to innovation. Some cool things about Adobe off the bat: they have a learning fund that encourages you to take classes, go back to school, or even go to conferences to help you develop in your career.  There are a lot of on-site events for holidays, volunteer opportunities, and more so there is always something cool going on. Of course the wellness center is pretty awesome (and there are fitness classes you can take), and the food is pretty on point. 

One major thing that has been a refresher is that Adobe and the people who work here really put an emphasis on constructive and positive feedback: everyone here wants you to succeed. That energy carries throughout the workplace. You also feel very empowered to to help others as well, which creates this community and continuous cycle of trust, positivity, and communication. 

I will say this: Adobe is not for the faint of heart. ""Good enough"" isn't enough here. If you're okay with that, and you're an individual who likes to thrive, push, and succeed, then you will fit in just fine. There will be days where you will be putting in your time, and you'll have a 10 hour day. There are some days where you might leave a little early. What I will say is that you WILL take pride in the work you do, and nothing here is meaningless, at least in my opinion.","A work from home option would be nice, but I can also understand why they'd want people in office as it can be very hard to foster a work culture if employees are remote."

The workplace is nice--gym is top-notch, cafeteria is great, and other amenities make it an enjoyable work environment. I feel like the company, my manager, and my coworkers all support a solid work/life balance. Not only is there a lot of talent at Adobe, but there's an incredible amount of all-around great people and that makes work even more fulfilling. The company shutdowns (1 week off) at the 4th of July and at Christmas are AMAZING. Flexible PTO, sabbatical of 4-6 weeks every 5 years, $10,000 tuition reimbursement every year, four months paternity leave, 6 months maternity leave, employee stock purchase program with a guaranteed 15% ROI every six months, even if the stock dips. Several times when my family has gone to the dentist or doctor the offices are surprised at how great our health insurance is. There's also a decent amount of internal mobility that happens, so Adobe seems supportive of that.","This is hard...I've been with Adobe four years and it still feels like my dream job. Maybe one thing is that since Adobe is still growing so fast and acquiring companies, it can be challenging to learn so many new things and adapt to be able to support new directions and integration efforts."

-Adobe hardly ever lays people off...there are some who take advantage"
696,Adobe,Better than most think,2019-08-03,4.0,Group Product Manager,"(1) Work/life balance at Adobe is just amazing. Especially the shutdowns in July and over New Year's are super valuable (it gives you a real mental break that you otherwise don't get).

(2) The company has a strong monopoly with the Creative Cloud, which brings in huge profits and took the stock price where it is now. 

(3) It is an amazing brand and working for Adobe makes you truly proud.","(1) Level of stress really depends on what product you work for. On the Creative Cloud side everyone is somewhat dispensable (it's a monopoly after all), which means it can be a pressure cooker and very political. How else to stand out?

(2) Given that work/life balance is so amazing, the compensation is a bit lower than elsewhere. I think it's totally fair but something to be aware of.

(3) On the Experience Cloud side, Adobe doesn't have the same level of experience as other companies. Adobe is not a traditional Enterprise software company, which means it's somewhat uneven.

(4) Kind of hard to make a career progression, given how nice the work/life balance is. Arguably it's better to make a career elsewhere and then join Adobe later on in your career."

- Good pay and benefits for the area
- Good culture and lots of events
- Great company perks
- Great brand","- Lots of red tape in getting big initiatives pushed through
- Cramped office with people jammed into every corner of the building
- Office space designed for low profile walls to promote collaboration that really was more of a cost cutting initiative that made for a loud and distraction work environment
- Little movement at the upper echelons which prevented movement beyond Sr. Mgr or Dir
- Strong focus on hiring leaders from the outside instead of promoting within
- Low appetite for taking risks
- Lacking in ability for internal innovation that led, more often then not, to acquisitions for growth
- Certain departments were very hesitant to allow any formal work from home programs
- Recent high turnover in tenured employees due to internal drama and a culture that is starting to go down hill
- Unclear organizational leadership at the BU level
- Strong emphasis in diversity that over rotated to a negative bias towards over represented groups ie a perception that certain employees received promotions primarily because of belonging to an under represented gender or race.  This includes an internal view by some that others are immune from termination because they fall in an under represented category even if those individuals were under performing"

Many layers of management and decisions are made top-down.  This makes execution difficult, coordination cumbersome and ultimately inefficient.

710,Adobe,"Lots of positive things but ultimately, lots of negative things.",2019-06-17,1.0,Technical Writer,Benefits. Cool office. Booming company.,"They brought me on as a Jr Technical Writer. They said they would train me and grant me some RSUs that vest in 4 years to convince me into making a long term commitment. Great!

I was initially on a centralized doc team full of writers and a manager *(the guy who hired me) and it was good. 2 years in, they decentralized us and all the writers were split up and put under product organizations. Okay cool. The product manager who became my new manager was a nice guy and a great product manager but had ZERO CLUE how to manage a writer and was mostly nonexistent and just cared that my job was being completed, which it was. This was because he had no idea what my daily duties entailed.

 Both my first manager of 2 years and my 2nd manager had nothing but top reviews and ratings to give me.

Then, the product I was working on got canceled and shipped to India. What did they do to the Jr Writer which they brought on, trained, and gave RSUs to convince him into making a long term commitment? They moved me to a new product, right? No, they just laid me off. Great manager reviews, total loyalty and commitment to Adobe, multiple product knowledge of several products across the cloud, and nope.... they just laid me off. 

A couple of my coworkers even complained up the ladder at how it was handled. But nothing changed. I was picked up by Microsoft a month later, but I still find how Adobe handled the situation very unsettling and unprofessional. They instilled a sense of commitment and loyalty into you... and so I ignored several other opportunities that knocked on my door--only to realize that was a mistake because Adobe didn't care about the commitment and loyalty they squeezed out of me."

The work environment is one where colleagues truly care about each other. It may sound simple but it's really motivating to be at a company where employees care so much about each other and the company cares about you- as a person not just another employee.  There is also a mindset here where leadership is always questioning the status quo, pushing everyone to think bigger and differently, not get complacent, and to push for disruption if it will make us better. For a company over 30 years old and very successful, it's incredible to see and hear our leaders pushing for new ways of thinking so actively. There is no ""old vs. new"" guard that you might see at other companies. In addition to all this, the offices are gorgeous, comfortable, and creative. Food is excellent and subsidized a lot (not free which I like as there's no waste and less entitlement that what I've experienced at other Valley companies).","No real cons from a working perspective, I could get picky and say the elevators get crowded at lunch time and parking is tough if you show up to work late!"

- Lots of people are there for a paycheck. Lack of talent 
- Extremely slow paced environment

Their office space sucks and its a damn old building in emeryville and not like a corporate atmosphere. If you have multiple offers, better stay away from this Adobe Emeryville office(Adobe Ad cloud), atleast for the sake of your good.

756,Adobe,Isolation and Offshoring,2019-02-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice office with lots of artwork, generous IT facilities (2 docking stations), food, snacks, cafeteria, generous benefits for BART, Caltrain, and other health / wellness benefits.","Two things were very tough to endure at Adobe: 1. Isolation, 2. Offshoring.

Isolation 

Regarding isolation, this applied to me and my ""coworkers"", but I think others at Adobe were well-integrated with a team. So my experience in the group I worked in could have been unique. But small teams and geographically-distributed teams are subject to LOTS of isolation. In the 3+ years I worked there, I worked in three different physical office buildings, and moved my desk four times. I worked for four different bosses in three remote locations. Most of all, the people I worked with on a day-to-day basis were also geographically dispersed, and, with me moving around a lot, and other people sitting around me moving around, I never felt a sense of community. The people in the desks near me were not on my team and I didn't work with them. Often they were a bit stuck-up, or unfriendly, or from a sales culture that emphasized a ""dressy business casual"" attire for some reason, which was at odds with my more casual garb (despite the fact they were not customer-facing). Moreover, they had little interest in technical subjects, and therefore encounters were often awkward. I always felt under-dressed, but I had no reason to dress up in my role. 

Our group had lots of turnover, so there were constantly new and/or different individuals I worked with. I therefore felt physically isolated, and, a bit psychologically isolated because our team was relatively small and not well-known within Adobe and with customers.

Lastly, there was no good reason given for why I was moved around so much. I almost felt it was at the whims of facilities and/or management.

Offshoring
 
Adobe uses offshoring aggressively for certain teams and I'm not sure why. It didn't work in my department. Resources in India were poorly trained (if at all), stuck in their ways, very bureaucratic, and under the tight control of another managerial organization, so they had little, if any, incentive to work together or get ideas/insight from their counterparts in North America. Most importantly, I found most of my working time spent fixing or redoing a lot of work that was of poor quality that was previously performed by offshore resources. Offshore teams went through significant turnover, but were still firmly in place, even in positions of authority when I left, with a regular set of newcomers to replace people that had resigned or moved to another department. Offshore teams were often extremely slow and error-prone in their work, and often made very bad decisions about processes and tools that had very negative consequences.

Conclusion 

Adobe has lots of great people and products. Unfortunately, in my case, my team at Adobe suffered from much political ""power trips"", isolation, hierarchical, and top-down approaches, and ""upper level"" teams with ""carte blanche"". These people are self-proclaimed experts that will look down at you, always find fault with your work, give no thanks for the hard work and struggles that you do, and generally try hard to bully and make life miserable for you, simply because you are ""below"" them. 

Be careful working at this company. It's a big company, so others' experiences could be more positive. But mine and others were not so pleasant. If you work with offshore teams or in a small or little-known group/department, watch out. The fancy buildings, fancy food, and benefits are nice, but when you are isolated and not respected for your work, that negates all the good things at Adobe."

They frown on diversity and don't welcome it. Even when upper management knowing there is problems in the lower level teams they don't get involved or do anything about it. 
-There isn't an open door policy- you are not welcomed to come talk to your upper management, they barely say hi, you are suppose to use your chain in command, I went to leadership and then got ""marked"" , so it only damages your career- it's best NOT to say nothing.

Adobe is truly a great company to work for and it shows within the people that you work with. Everyone I've met is incredibly open and my experience so far has been great when it comes to being able to chat with any individual within the company that I am interested in learning from. 

I started off as an intern last summer and was able to return as a full-time employee and it has been great.  The company really pushes for work-life balance and to work smarter than work harder. Upper management within my organization is really open to accommodating to talk to, although I know that one's experience in regards to that can vary based on your org.  I'm super excited to be starting my professional career at Adobe and look forward to how my career will develop at this company.","Food isn't free, but it is subsidized and definitely worth what you're paying for. If it ever becomes free, that would be great! 

Also based on what I've heard from fellow interns, there is a lot of ambiguity in regards to intern to full-time conversion and I hope that experience would be more defined as I had a lot of my peers experience a limbo of being recommended to have the opportunity to return as a full-time employee but end up not receiving any offer. 

Can be a pro for some, but there is definitely a strong WFH culture and so the office can feel rather empty. Regardless, work gets done which is fine."

They tend to keep people siloed doing one particular function, and do not really promote expanding your skillset. There is a ""tuition reimbursement"" program, but it is completely not a guarantee that you will be reimbursed, and you need to get the approval of your manager before you can even seek it out. Many people at Adobe have been lucky to have encouraging managers who mentored them and always presented them with opportunities to grow professionally - I was not lucky in that arena."

786,Adobe,Program Manager,2018-11-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Adobe welcomed me with open arms. I interviewed with several tech companies and I must say the interview process was far better others. The talent partner mentored and ushered me along the way providing me with advice and continued to stay engaged with me throughout the process. Adobe's HQ campus is beyond amazing with bright colors. My first week, I was welcomed by several employee networks and employees from various sites all excited to have me part of the #AdobeLife family. Now I am heavily involved in these employee networks planning for site-wide cultural events and more. My manager constantly supports my work/life balance and asks if I need help or advises me to slow down at times. 

I joined Adobe because of its family first benefits. Birthing and non-birthing parents receive six months of family leave after birth. I can also freeze my eggs and receive fertility benefits in addition to adoptions benefits up to $25,000! It was the best and right decision to make to join #AdobeLife. The company does not feel competitive in nature at all like at other tech companies.",No cons at all for Adobe

They ensured Magento acquisition would be successful. Clear career path at Adobe. Lost of growth and good talent being added.,It’s very large.

790,Adobe,I worked at Adobe full-time (More than 10 years),2018-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When it comes to technology, Adobe is right at the top of the stack of employers. A fantastic and open work culture that truly believes in innovation.","Not all managers have good people skills. They might be excellent on the technical side of things but maybe have been promoted too fast within the ranks. Leading teams requires more than technical expertise. I would also like to point out some random policy decisions such as continuing with Aetna for insurance is very problematic. Especially when people have complained regarding their lack of cover for certain problems, such as not providing coverage for younger women for prenatal genetic testing. This is definitely something that needs looking into."
791,Adobe,Project Manager,2018-11-07,5.0,Project Manager,Marketo's culture and management is truly unmatched to anywhere I've worked before.

Marketo has gone through a period of venture capital ownership that has made it stronger and smarter than before, despite the growing pains.",Communication is fragmented over too many systems with competing purposes.  The company needs more administrative resources to keep things organized.  Recruitment efforts that have focussed on Denver to the detriment of other factors have resulted in some under-qualified candidates getting positions in part because they are located in Denver or willing to live there.  Other offices sometimes feel neglected.

795,Adobe,Adobe a great place to work,2018-10-14,5.0,Senior Hadoop Engineer,"Adobe has distilled its value in a way that helps to get through the ceilings that plague most companies even half its size. I feel fortunate to have seen this in action at all levels from product delivery, to departments behaviors, to how we work day-to-day. It has helped to foster trust from those on the ground giving their all each day. It is key for transforming into the business of tomorrow.","We are only held back by ourselves. I've found units within Adobe to be wonderful sponsors for improvement, innovation, and change. We are currently shifting all levels within our BU to be product oriented.

Also, very open to employees making lateral career moves and slow but progressive upward mobility if you just work hard. Very based on merit vs politics.
Nice size bonuses, increase in reserve stock options yearly, and a 5 week sabbatical every 5 years.","Little difficult to navigate the labyrinth of the company structure with how big they've gotten and there are the usual politics that you'd find in any large company.

Engineering ability is looked down upon. Good engineers are often not promoted, and poor engineers are often promoted as long as they talk to the right people.

Your time is strictly tracked, down to 15-minute increments. 

You will be actively discouraged from going to conferences if it means taking time off work. You can forget about ever having your conference ticket paid for unless you're lucky enough to be working for a large client project.

Product engineering will also look down on you coming from consulting. So movement is very difficult, even if it's to a position that you're extremely qualified for."

837,Adobe,Hiring practices,2018-03-27,1.0,Program Manager,"Great company, promotes community support, benefits are great and co-workers are fun and creative. Flexibility to work from home as needed and also great development programs.","I got wind from a co-worker about a recent hiring process where clearly a person of color (and let’s be more specific - a racial minority) went through a hiring interview process as a contractor to cover the hiring name on maternity leave and was clearly very well qualified despite not going to a top 10 graduate MBA program.  He even had a dozen years corporate experience with fortune 50 companies.

He apparently was amicable, diplomatic and passionate about joining Adobe and even had a creative background on top of his MBA. But because he didn’t quite fit the ‘profile’ he didn’t get it. Even when the majority of the interview team thought he was the one, but no. 

This is the type of hiring discrimination that stays in the shadows. The Adobe of yesteryear would’ve taken him and his passion. Sadly the tech barrier for race is still up."
838,Adobe,Responsible for our enterprise strategic sales,2018-03-25,5.0,Strategic Account Executive,"Great company, benefits, and culture. Good work life balance.

For employees, the company has been doing extremely well with their Cloud offerings so the stock has nearly tripled in price in less than 3 years making a great ROI for employees that get RSUs.   Pay is good/ average compared to other companies in the area.

Lastly, it's a great place to be if you're looking for flexibility and WFH opportunities.  As long as you're doing your job and in the office for key in person meetings, they don't care where you work from.","If you are motivated and career driven, this is not the place for you.  There is no CLEAR path to promotions.  Most of the management/ Director positions are filled with external candidates and it is extremely difficult to move up unless you have an executive sponsor.   Also, they don't conduct formal performance reviews which could be part of the problem.

Adobe often times prides itself in being one of the BEST places to work but HR works hard on these surveys and they are always asking employees to rate them well.   

Company is also very political, more so than other places in the valley so you have to know and gain trust with the right people.   Otherwise, your voice will never be heard."

The work-life balance was similarly excellent and I appreciated their willingness to not only let me volunteer locally but to chip in a pretty large donation to the nonprofit I was working every 10 hours I recorded. The severance package I received was very generous relative to the time I spent at the company (just over two years).",My team was distributed across the globe and (as would be expected) there were a lot of difficulties getting everyone on the same page/motivated to follow the processes I was responsible for within the group.

916,Adobe,Incredible place to be.,2017-07-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Adobe invests in retaining top talent. Experts land here, and then are incentivized heavily to stay. Thus, if you're fortunate enough to be a junior engineer on a team, chances are good that you'll be surrounded by the very best in the industry to help mentor you. I've found my team to be humble, mature, accomplished, and eager to help me improve my skills.

- Because the engineers here are very much at the top of their game, it makes for a very uncompetitive atmosphere - they have little to prove and are very secure with their abilities. As a result, I've found the teams to be incredibly productive and collaborative.

- Adobe has a thoughtful business strategy. It is stable, focused, and driven. It doesn't get swept up in the typical flashy and silly hype surrounding much of the tech industry. It's fun to be part of this larger, sensible vision.

- I came here because the company placed a high value on ethics. Since I've been here, I've seen that these ethical standards are robust, and it makes for an awesome work environment.

- This is one of the few top tech companies that truly wants you to have a good work-life balance. Adobe understands that their employees perform better when they're not burnt out. Adobe understands that it's better to retain top talent and reduce churn than it is to constantly lose key team members and have to get new employees up to speed. This seems like a no-brainer strategy, but if you look at the industry retention rates, you'll see that few companies understand this.

- It's not a cult. I've not had anyone try to feed me kool aid. I really appreciate this, and probably would have gone elsewhere if this weren't the case. Even though I have a high opinion of the company, I've not ever really expressed this at work - it's simply not part of the culture to bleed for the brand or put on a show about how much you love the company.",- I wish its brand were as sexy as some other tech companies.

Since Adobe is such a large company, it takes too long to get any valuable changes done. We are bleeding reps because upper management can't pull the trigger to fix the issues they created this year in the Sales organization. Which is a much larger issue than just inside Sales. Adobe Sales org is putting itself in a bad position by not moving quickly to fix internal data issues. This is causing people not to get paid, and forcing the top talent to leave, which leaves Adobe with the unsuccessful reps.

Add that to the very real prospect of not hitting one's full number (as many will not this year), and you have a losing combination. Also, the sales team in SF is isolated from the rest of the company and therefore does not get to feel like part of the greater company culture.

Or maybe you are a prospective new employee, eager to start your sales career and are  looking to base a major career decision on a random, anonymous, TOTALLY unbiased online source (seriously millennials, don't talk to internet strangers). I direct my comments to you though (please take as many grains of salt as your parent's insurance-provided-doctor prescribes).  

You'll notice the other reviewers' chief complaint is with our Sr. dictat... I mean  director... to summarize, he has no successful previous sales experience, has insulated himself with a thick layer of mid-level management, armed himself with a fleet of analysts, doesn't listen to any of his more experienced line managers, and targets people who challenge him then warns others to not ask ""career limiting questions."" He tries to come across as genuine but is basically a male version of Dolores Umbridge.

So how does a marketer take control of an inside sales organization? 

The key is to remember that most of the roles in this org involve finding prospective buyers and setting up demos for our sales team. There are a few roles where you work with an AE to close small deals but these are difficult to work your way into and frankly the juice isn't really worth the squeeze once you make it into that. So more than likely you aren't in ""Sales"" (from Adobe's perspective). Sure -- you are developing valuable skills for your future as a sales professional, and many very successful salespeople cut their teeth in this org, but from Adobe's perspective you are a lead generator (not unlike a marketing email, display ad, paid search term, etc).  Ultimately, a cost of sales -- and costs are meant to be lowered -- which is exactly what the Sr. Director spends most his time on. 

That's how a marketer takes over an inside sales org. Because somebody who spends more time with spreadsheets then people thought they could lower cost of sales and manage people like a marketing campaign- while simultaneously preparing them for sales careers. 

Hopefully Adobe wises up, replaces top leadership with actual sales professionals who can groom the next generation, and stop the hemorrhaging of great sales talent leaving in droves. 

That being said, maybe you will be the transfusion to replace the lost life blood of inside sales...  About 15 spots have opened up and there are a lot more coming soon (like empty first class rooms on the sinking Titanic). Just go in with your eyes open, get Adobe on your resume and then have an exit strategy.  

Good luck!"

You'll learn how to take a simple successful system and over complicate it with busy work and pointless validations.  You'll learn how to forget about the customer and doing what is best for them. You'll learn how to create an environment with no path to success. You'll learn how to talk out of both sides of your mouth.

942,Adobe,What once was a dream is now a nightmare,2017-03-28,3.0,Seasoned Sales Associate,"Adobe is a dream and has so many wonderful things to offer.  It does however have a single festering sliver that NEEDS to be pulled.  Among the many pros of working at Adobe here are a few: elite/driven people, amazing products, fast innovation, positive global impact, and benefits that cant be beat.  At one time there was endless growth possibilities.. that was until the sliver got there.","About two years ago leadership changes were made and a marketer was hired to run the Inside Sales Team.  He openly admits that his only sales position throughout his career was a total failure. He claims to be data driven and relies heavily on his data guy.  Both guys think the entire company can be driven on data alone, and not real world logic.  That is basically the demise of everything that has happened since they both started.  To his own detriment he has frequently ignored line management who know better.  Every time there is push-back from line management it is likely ignored or those individuals are singled out and caught in his cross-hairs.  Its very unfortunate because the managers are only making suggestions to better the company and strengthen the team.

They have cut territories, increased quotas, and hired a large staff of analysts to police the quality of work being done.  This staff is being paid nearly a million dollars total per year to micro manage.  Pipeline is starting to dwindle because of the lack of production due to unnecessary babysitting.

944,Adobe,It's a good company. Experience will largely depend on which organizational and leadership group you are in.,2017-03-28,4.0,Sales Operations,"Good culture, perks, compensation, maternity/paternity leave, stock plan, friendly people. Most of the organization understands the value of flexibility.  Jerks are largely clustered under leaders hiring more jerks. 

It's a good company. Experience will largely depend on which organizational and leadership group you are in. They have some good mid-level leaders and some aggressively sub-par ones who drive their employees too hard, but probably don't see as much attrition as they should because the company culture and benefits are good overall. 

Most of the mid-level management privately express concerns about how intensely we've hired in India, how they are blocked from hiring elsewhere, how challenging it is to find staff with a mindset of attention to detail, quality work, and an understanding of how to communicate internationally.  They are generally afraid to communicate this to executives. Key executive positions are held by talented Indian leaders who do not appear to understand the extent of these cultural difficulties in hiring at an individual contributor level. Back office and IT are largely a mess because UX focus has been customer-centric for so long, and many small development mistakes have been introduced into systems. Leadership and hiring there could be improved as the complexity of the environment increases.","Most groups need tools and ideas to better manage the volume of meetings and emails consuming people's time.  Open work environment increases collaboration and team bonding, in some cases, but reduces productivity as people find it difficult to maintain flow, or abandon their cubicles to find quiet spaces and less movement, despite a desire to work near their teams."

947,Adobe,Inside Sales at Adobe is a JOKE,2017-03-17,1.0,Inside Sales Executive,"Adobe is the best company to work for in Utah, not even close. Comp package, benefits, employee stock plan and the #AdobeLife is elite. ""I Don't Like it, I Love It,"" by Flo Rida and Robin Thicke wrote this jam about Adobe.","Only one problem: Inside Sales leadership. There are no leaders in management, though they have the titles, they cannot do their jobs because their leader appears to be dishonest, condesending and threatened his entire org during the most recent all-hands meeting, to not ask “career limiting questions,” regarding their quotas going up 40% to 125%. Any managers that challenge his ideas are pushed out. His pride is killing Inside Sales at Adobe.

Employees aren't heard, valued or respected. Twelve (12) from Inside Sales have left in the past month, but whats scarier is the amount of people actively looking. When it==the max exodus occurs they won’t care, but they won’t even see if coming because they think all is well in Zion. There are many more that will be gone by the Summer. Our leadership actually reached out to another local company that hired some of the Adobe employees, and demanded that company end existing interviews with all Adobe employees. The evdence is the emails that company sent to the interviewing Adobe employees. HR violation or not, that’s how this leadership behaves. They don’t listen and they think they can solve problems, but with no sales leaders in upper management they often misdiagnose the problem and the solutions just compound problems. This is not just a Lehi problem as two from San Jose left in the last two weeks. Our leadership will handpick specific people and situations and use that best case scenario as the typical example of how things should work every single time.

Leadership has raised quota 4 times mid-year in the last 22 months. Once you hit your number, they move the number back then brag about how they removed the cap that the last leader had. We miss that guy. After one such quota change they retroactively took money from an entire team of ADMs, totaling thousands per ADM. Retroactive folks! He has taken away entire revenue streams, not paid out spiffs, forced ADMs to compete against the field team and doesn’t provide cover over the top when we attempt to execute his plan against our field teams. We have “new quality standards” that are simply just busy work for him to report up some awesome new changes. All of this would be fine if we were being compensated properly to deal with his drama, but production has fallen off a cliff and he bragged that gives him more credibility as a leader. He may be delusional, narcissistic or just threatened by A+ players. I will admit, I’m not a doctor. I have heard comparisons to Lord Farquad, but I have not seen the movie Shrek, so I cannot comment. During our company Christmas party one of the white elephant gifts was rolls of toilet paper with his likeness custom printed on the ultrasoft. Many fought over that gift. During one exit interview he was called out on his threat to the org regarding “career limiting questions” and he denied ever making that comment. He forgot its recrded and that it was attended by nearly 150 people. It’s also cute that he personally posted a positive review of the great job he’s doing here at Adobe, lol. Now he has the other Inside Sales managers posting positive reviews on Glassdoor. Now you know you’re desperate…"
948,Adobe,Inside sales org needs new leadership,2017-03-16,1.0,Account Development Manager,Adobe is a great cook company to work for. It is unfortunate that the dark cloud of the inside sales organization overshadows all of the great benefits of a great organization. The people and direct managers are excellent to work with.,The upper management of inside sales seems like he's trying to force all of the talent to leave Adobe. I have been with the organization for over two years now and have seen a lot of talented people leave because of their lack of faith in his leadership abilities and organizational direction. I heard such great things about Adobe and the inside sales or prior to me coming and at first it was all true. Over the last year I have seen a complete turnaround in the organization and Moral across the sales team. I am looking for other positions within Adobe and outside of Adobe and most of the people that I speak with within the inside sales org are doing the same. I looked at Adobe as a place that I could retire at when first coming to Adobe. I can say for sure that that is not the case now.
949,Adobe,Inside Sales has to change. HR PLEASE HELP!!!,2017-03-16,3.0,Inside Sales,"Work life balance, stock plan, compensation, health benefits, family perks, great facilities, line managers, technology, executive leadership, people, spiffs, cafe","No formal training which results in longer ramp times. Quotas have doubled without a clear explanation as to why. Inside Sales leadership has little sales experience which is apparent and has resulted in changes to process which has affected overall pipeline for Adobe. Do to the lack of pipeline, there is now unnecessary stress being felt from the executive level all the way down. Lack of trust in inside sales Sr. leadership has resulted in top talent to leave. Morale is at all time low which is being shrugged off. Not only have we lost top inside sales talent, we are now starting to lose line managers that can no longer refrain from expressing their concerns. I'm afraid that concerns within our org fall on deaf ears as upper management is too prideful to admit that they are wrong and unwilling to make changes. Overall, I'm hopeful for the future but wouldn't put my money on things changing anytime soon."

They have very competitive benefits and will always get you the hardware / software you want to do your job. Most of the offices have done really well to hire a diverse group of people and it seems to be really benefiting the company.,"The office in Lehi has retained a lot of the old management from a previous acquisition that was based in Utah. This has brought with it a very polarized staff who work under the assumption that everyone is just like them. The hiring practices and management reflect this as well. Management doesn't seem to want to take action until you have had a problem. Never before when you are telling them that there is going to be one. Additionally, if you are a performer, the workload will just pile on to that individual. There area a lot of under-performers who are content with just doing minimal amount of work and much of the management enjoys this type who don't have any drive. Finally, at times, there is minimal amount of communications from your manager to you about how they feel you are performing and what that will mean at review time. You are very often left guessing what compensation will be right up until you just receive an email."

The last two were the challenge.","Too many power struggles on the Creative side of the house.  Management doesn't seem vested in solving the problem, and the peons suffer.  Those that try to create a workable climate find themselves on the outside, and eventually let go.

Seems to me that the fast/flexible Adobe of three or four years ago has given way to corporate stagnation.  It's just another IBM/Microsoft."

Stock is flying, espp program excellent as well as benefits.","Where do I begin.   In my twenty plus years of sales this place was the most toxic and frustrating for ridiculous reasons.   The management team creates an unnecessary toxic environment that prevents effective selling and supporting of customers.   The amount of internal work far outweighs the selling that should be going on to the customer base.   The aggressive nature of the  sales management team creates an ugly environment, that then gets pushed on to the customers.   Some of the management is talented but feels intimidated by upper management and that is pushed to the salesforce.   There are unqualified people in management that micromanage to a level I have never seen.   The worst part is having commission taken back when a customer doesn't renew that you didn't sell in the first place!  Numerous good reps and managers have left for this reason.   I can't stress this enough, stay away from this toxic environment"

The strategy is to keep NA employees (usually managers & highly qualified engineers) happy and have as much employees in India as possible (they are cheap). Investment are made in these 2 regions. Elsewhere, you have to part of Sales organisation to get some investments.
Enablement is almost inexistant if you're not part of Sales related organisations or management.
Career development (at least in EMEA) is just as simple and annoying as being an external person applying for a job at Adobe. No rotation to have taste of other positions, If you want to try another position you have to apply and get interviewed exactly as any external applicant. Being already from Adobe won't help. Except if you already work with the product covered by the job.
There is no allocated budget per teams/heads. Senior Management decide who gets what on request and if they have not use most of the budget for themselves.

HR and management listens to you and there are many employees whose job is to make Adobe a better, safer, more diverse workplace.

In terms of product direction and strategy, I have no complaints. Their vision is clear and their execution model seems solid.

But to get the full benefit you need to do without 25% income (which is the max contribution level) for at least 6 months between purchase dates.) Health, dental, vision benefits are good, but not nearly as comprehensive or affordable as they once were. Some teams allow people to work remote (like me) which is #1 benefit by far but not available to all teams/job roles.","Adobe has grown immensely over my 15+ year tenure, which is a good thing, but it's lost some of the charm and fun that used to be here in the old days as a result. (Especially those under the founders, John and Chuck) Also, we used to get a lot more in terms of Profit sharing, Stock Options and other bonuses, which were pretty much all taken away during the recession for the sake of 'cost savings' and then never brought back (as if we would forget after a few years), even as profits and earnings per share soared higher than ever."

The person on boarding me got let go two weeks after I got there and I was told to figure it out.  Lots of infighting and Politics.  Most back stabbing environment I have ever experienced.  Lots of lies told to me when I was interviewing and beyond, reality wasn't even close.  Lots of distrust by employees of their immediate bosses.

1108,Adobe,Honest opinion,2016-02-02,2.0,,"The benefits are pretty decent. You get about 2-3 weeks of paid vacation depending on what you can work out with your manager. There are 2 company shutdowns, in December you get about 1.5 weeks off around Christmas and the New Year, then in the summer your get a week off during July 4th. This is paid holiday for regular employees plus another 7-8 other holidays throughout the year.","They tend to recruit from BYU a lot as they have a location in Lehi, UT. New hire diversity had drastically dropped. They stopped giving out company bonuses. Holiday parties are a joke. The revenue keeps growing, but the raises are miniscule at times."
1109,Adobe,Best Career Experience Yet,2016-02-01,5.0,Director,Super creative and open to new ideas and thinking. Very diverse. Strong management. The benefits and compensation packages are better than any Fortune 500 company I've worked for.,Typical management politics. Executives are far too involved in the day to day decisions and campaigns.

1110,Adobe,Slow moving but great culture,2016-01-29,4.0,QA Manager,"One of Adobe's cultural values is respect and having left the company and worked at other companies, I see that clearly now.  Employees and management do treat each other well there.  Having been at a variety of other companies i now realize that is unique.",The company doesn't move as fast as it could. It benefits from having a monopoly in the graphics tools space and it has done a great job of capitalizing on that. If you want to work somewhere dynamic that this might not be the place for you.

Some good human beings at Adobe.","It's a large org, with a lot of people who've been with the company for a very long time.

1126,Adobe,Great place to work in Bay Area,2015-12-17,4.0,Senior Manager,"Great work like balance, they continue to remodel and improve the San Jose campus.",Limited options for growth and advancement.  I wish they had more of development track or even turned to internal candidates more often.
1127,Adobe,The worst culture ever,2015-12-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The money, the perception that the company name gives you in the job market when you decide you're done with this nonsense.","The culture is the worst I have seen in my professional career. The company is mostly run by white males who give lip service to diversity but have zero interest in it. There is a huge amount of narcissism and a bias towards people who talk nonstop about how great the company is and brown nose.  It's like the worst frat you've ever seen. Most salespeople have never used the products they are selling. They have their sales scripts but that's it.

You are expected to attend meetings and engage in typical workaholic behaviors if you want to go anywhere or save your job.  They literally openly threaten firing during conferences and meetings if you do not praticipate to their liking. I have spoken to a number of people who have missed family events years in a row or missed milestones like their child walking for the first time because they are expected to attend grueling meetings regardless. It is very clear that these people must give total control of their homelife to their spouse or partner, otherwise their home would be in shambles.

Expect poor to no training or mentorship.  When you struggle, you will be blamed. You'll be pointed to the web with countless trainings that will teach you zero valuable skills.  Your mentor will end up being someone who is way too busy trying to be a superstar suck up to actually mentor you. When you fail you'll be labeled as ""just not adobe material.""

The processes are a bureaucratic nightmare that would make George Orwell say ""really? That seems over the top.""  Expect that any process will require you to call or interact with offshore resources in India who struggle to communicate and have zero understanding of the process beyond their link in the chain.

It is without question the least empathic work environment I have ever seen. God forbid you bring up anything unpleasant like a death in the family or anything similar as just small talk. The employee will gloss over it and talk about how ""excited"" they are about the ""opportunities"" Adobe has in the market.  That is unless they want to sell you something and then they will act like they care until the deal is done."

*Extremely High functioning employees are eventually rewarded recognized
*Perk pushes like working from home
*Environmentally conscious
*Community outreach and support
*Advancement potential (though dependent on department)","Little to no racial diversity particularly at the Sr. Level and an odd new ""TechBro"" culture in some departments.
Middle level managers are often promoted into positions they are ill prepared for managing (see below). 
Certain operational departments thrive in nepotism and team members are recruited from fraternal connections regardless actual experience or capabilities (tech-broism)
Sr Mangers/Director level managers are unapproachable and seem uninterested in the individuals on the teams that report up to them.
HR (though that is no longer their name) should provide the example of how to treat employees, they seem uninterested in employee satisfaction. Any relevant analytics to be gleaned from the review process is just ""data"" to them. Therefore promotions are long overdue, often title/grade levels are inaccurately applied when compared to other companies within the same industry."

I get to work with some extremely smart people and the social atmosphere is very friendly. They are also really good about letting you move to other positions within the company once you are an employee, so there are infinite ways to grow your career, which is great, because I don't want to go anywhere.

Without negotiating, they gave me a generous stock award as a signing bonus (pretty sure that's standard) and they also have an insane employee stock purchasing plan that allows you to buy Adobe stock at a 15% discount from the lowest price over a 2 year period... It's free money.","I haven't found any yet... I mean, if you hate working for a big company, it might not be your thing.

The pay is amazing and I can't find it anywhere else

The career opportunities are fantastic and I'm able to move around as I see fit","Management really has no idea what I do on a day to day basis. This is a double edged sword because I don't like to be micro managed, but I also feel like they are very disconnected from the work I actually do."

1169,Adobe,Adobe has solid leadership and provides great opportunity,2015-09-17,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The company knows that transformation is needed to stay on top of a rapidly changing industry, and has so far done a fair job tearing down the old and busted pieces from within to create a service-oriented business. To see this first hand with VPs, directors, and management within the ""creative"" business has been one of my best career experiences. Leadership puts a lot of trust in each employee to do their best. Because of this, there is a lot of opportunity to influence things in a meaningful way that is rare in a company this size. I love each day at my job!","The wide geographic dispersion of employees is difficult to manage and work tasks sometimes feels like they are flung around without good technical direction. Certain pockets in the company have a lot of politics. There are good opportunities to interact with other developers, but many don't take advantage of it (or can't because of fixing tough problems of our own making). A lot of things that are done by individuals to ""check a box"": inefficient meetings, partial communication, incomplete work, missing/lacking integration... it feels like this can improve, though."

1171,Adobe,"Good company, not so good on certain Business Units",2015-09-14,3.0,Senior Consultant,"I had a great general experience at Adobe for the 5 years I worked there. The company has a clear road map and knows how to get there. I particularly enjoyed the opportunities of giving back to the community that were sponsored by Adobe. 
The values of the company are ingrained in the company, specially in the Creative Side (original Adobe: Photoshop, Flash, Illustrator,etc.) of the company, and little less in the Digital Marketing (ex Omniture) part of the company.
Big Pro: sabbatical every 5 years (4 paid weeks onthe 5th anniversary, 5 weeks on 10th and on), plus 1 paid week of vacation in July and other one onhte December Holidays, to that Adobe adds 2 extra weeks of vacations.","I personally had a not good experience within the Systems Architect group in the Target division. The expectations where high but not clear; some contradicting guidelines as ""all our clients are important, no special treatment"" but when something happened to a big client then it was ""this is a special client, you have to give priority to it"" (and push back on other medium size clients). Also the direct manager stopped sending birthday celebration emails, congratulations for work anniversary, I felt the only point of work was the number of billed hours.
The surrounding of the 410 Townsend office are a little shady and it is not uncommon to find garbage laying around in the section that is supposed to be a sidewalk. The surroundings of 601 Townsend are great and clean.
Social interaction at the 410 Townsend office is not good and the building is 3/4 empty on a normal work day with all teh people that work from home."

You really can feel Silicon Valley coming through.,"I work on the Digital Marketing side of the company and things are very sloppy.  Finance workers such as analysts are required to input accruals and other journal entries.  It feels like the checks and balances of a controller is sorely missed.  I have never worked somewhere that I don't know everyone who works in accounting to satisfy the demands of a finance role.  Not at Adobe.  There are so many people all over the world putting in entries it's impossible to know who does what.  Accounting is like a black box of unknown workers.

There is an amazing amount of duplication of work.  It seems like no one really owns anything because there are so many other people doing that same thing."
1181,Adobe,Okay Tech company to work for....but there are much better,2015-08-26,3.0,,"- Whole company shuts down the week of Christmas & New Year's and again the week of July 4th. Makes it much easier to unplug and come back without a tsunami of emails, etc. 

- Work life balance is decent for a tech company. 

- Sabbatical program for employees who have worked there for 5 years (one month off paid).

- Adobe is very open to people working remotely and a lot of people do.","- Lack of job security: Adobe is known for having layoffs on an almost annual basis. People start getting nervous about their jobs come evert January. You're unlikely to see it coming. 

- Benefits aren't on par with other tech companies such as Google, Facebook or even newer companies like AirBnB.

The Marketing Cloud platform truly does it all for the most advanced and deep-pocketed digital Marketers.  Large Company health benefits, expense accounts, and the events put together and attended are top-notch.",Lots of turnover and unhappy clients as a result of the turnover.  So many levels of management that the amount of pressure put on the sales teams is absurd and every level of success and goal accomplished will be replaced by an even larger one.  Getting contracts completed in a timely fashion tended to be a challenge.  Salesforce is a mess due to so many acquisitions and not a lot of clean-up.

Adobe is admired in Utah.","The downside is that the sales compensation model is constantly changing from year to year.  After each change, it is more difficult for Account Executives to make money (it is difficult to make good money at Adobe now days, great money is a thing of the past).  Multiple AE's brought in large deals last year, and the year before, so Adobe officially capped them and did not pay commission above a certain amount (of course this message from management was delivered to the AE's after they sold the large contracts, happy selling!).  

Quotas at Adobe are usually 3 to 4 times higher than the average AE's quota at a competitor or other software company.  Quotas have increased by 40%+ each year over the past 3 years.  Additionally, upper sales management is choosing to micro-manage and apply pressure to bring deals forward (that aren't ready) as pressure mounts to perform on Wall Street.  Have you ever had a manager tell you to bring a deal forward that isn't ready?  It's not fun and it sets you up for failure even though management knows that the deal isn't ready.  

I've never seen it this bad at Adobe.  Pressure to perform is mounting and the crap will keep rolling down hill as quotas aren't obtained..."

Whether that's with artwork, photography, or data.  They encourage the heart and every treats everyone very well.  You will love your colleagues.  They are innovating in their human resources areas with their ongoing ""Check-In"" process, and they really care about leadership development.","Adobe is a multi-headed beast now.  They have so many markets and products that they serve, they serve very few of them really, really well.  They're no longer excellent at any one thing, but just very good at a number of things.  The tedious yearly budgeting process, both for execution and for resource management, is ripe to be blown up and new approaches considered.  Tremendously bright VPs and middle managers are reduced to blubbering idiots that can only pass their upper executive's demands downward, causing huge morale and dissatisfaction in the employees as they are hamstrung by half-baked, un-customer-focused ""corporate"" mandates."

* Little chance for promotion or mobility because of low attrition at the top
* Senior-manager-heavy: we are having trouble hiring younger people, and some of our key talent isn't that far from retirement
* PTO policy *sounds* great, but many managers discourage you from taking time off
* Some truly abysmal people managers who have little experience running teams but who are given no motivation or resources to change their ways.

Too many re-org. Forget promotions due to re-orgs, as every year you might be moved to a different team, and no manager would promote you till you work for them for more than an year, and you cannot work for more than an year, since the team would get affected by a re-org. Its happened with me three years in a row.

Compensation is not adequate for the work load. Managers feel they don't have to pay more because of the large job seeker pool which also means Managers have no incentive to keep experienced employees around.   Very difficult to move up, too competitive. In many cases, hiring managers are looking for MBA candidates and will look outside the company even if someone internally could be trained to do the work.

Besides happy hour, Adobe also community service events in which you can sign up with your team. What I love about Adobe is actually the 2 shutdown periods where Adobe closes down for a week during July 4th and Christmas.","Adobe has an open policy about PTO for salary employees. Basically, if you need time off, you just speak with your manager. However, because there is no PTO accrual basis, most people on my team take only 1 week off at a time. Meaning, if you wanted to travel somewhere far and take 2 weeks, that can be a stretch and may present difficulty in getting approval from management."
1288,Adobe,"Fantastic work environment and products, but customer focus sometimes falters",2014-10-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Adobe provides you with the chance to work with well-known, technologically advanced products at a company that, for the most part, truly cares about its employees. You get to work with some very smart and creative people, and the same can be said for many of the customers. Though things may not always be perfect (what is?), it's clear that upper management actively thinks about how decisions affect employees, and continually aims to create a positive work environment with good benefits. It's generally a very open and honest company culture.","Though the company pays lip service to being customer-focused, and many individual contributors do sweat the details for customers, when push comes to shove customer satisfaction often loses out to short-term profits. That can be frustrating when you're trying to do the right thing. As for work environment, one historical problem with Adobe is that decision-making has generally been very consensus-oriented, which can slow things down. That may be getting better, however. As with any large company, culture and issues will vary a bit based on what department you're in. Some are more political than others, for example, though, in general, Adobe seems less political than most companies of the same size."

Lots of opportunity for training and cross functional and lateral opportunities. Ability to work from home. Great location in San Jose because it is away from the crowds of Mountain View/Palo Alto traffic.,Too much red tape in organizations like IT. Silo teams and tough to grow career into the next phase.

Great location flexibility as well; I see many cubicles and offices that remain empty 4 days a week. Some of them, 5 days a week (yes, they are occupied).","For a Silicon Valley company, the pace of innovation is not particularly on the the rapid side. I wouldn't go so far as to say slow, but definitely not fast. Same goes with bureaucracy and office politics - not as bad as say a traditional, non-Valley company, but it's there and it slows down everything.

Current management is brilliant. The overall shift the company has made in the last few years has been incredible. The company was not headed in the right direction for a long time and now things are looking very very well.","The San Jose office is depressing.the company is still taking a very long time to get serious about disrupting long-standing parts of the business. 30 years of legacy code means attachment issues, and a lot of work to do before real innovation can happen."

We work on interesting stuff all the time using the latest technology.  Adobe takes very good care of their employees; they make sure you get want you want from training to benefits. I simply enjoy going to work, enjoy sharing my ideas with intelligent (and humble) people who are always ready to help. People are not jealous of each others, they are ready to help you improve if they have time. It is true that not all teams are like this but I would say the majority of the teams I have seen there.

- Awesome products, amazing brand reputation, lots of growth opportunities
- Work with sharp, bright people (recruiting is very selective -- I had to work very hard to get hired)
- Unlimited PTO -- there is not a cap on how much PTO your manager can give you
- Full week of the 4th of July plus full week of Christmas and New Years are paid holidays
- At least for Utah, pay is above what you will get at other tech companies
- Great benefits, especially the employee stock purchasing program where you can buy Adobe's stock at a 15% discount
- Here in Utah, the Adobe campus is incredible. I feel happy while I walk through the building","- Lots of bureaucracy when it comes to practically anything (your manager needs a gazilion authorizations for anything you want to do or get)
- Bureaucracy especially ridiculous when it comes to HR
- Hiring freeze which forces teams to hire temporary contractors, creating a sense of instability within the company. You never know if your coworkers will be here next year, not because they are not performing, but because they are ""blue badges""."

Some business units have basically given up on hiring locally in SF and fill positions almost exclusively in India.

Some highly visible mistakes have been made by senior leadership with no one held accountable.  This culture of unaccountability permeates down.

It seems to be a complacent employee base made up mostly of nine to fivers waiting to retire, with no real motivation to move the needle.  They are more than happy to let the truly talented minority carry them and the company on their back."

The brand is very powerful worldwide and the pay and benefits are outstanding.","It is inevitable that a culture that does such a great job of preserving work-life balance will have pockets of operations where the pressure to deliver is very intense (sales, radical updates to products such as making it all cloud based). Also, the Omniture acquisition brought in a lot of people who were in the mold of their former CEO Josh James who was selfish and self-promoting and the antithesis of Chuck and John.

Strong rewards: pay is equitable if not better than peer companies. ESPP, in particular, is ridiculously good. Health care is similar to most high tech companies but they do offer pet insurance which is somewhat unique.

Management: very open, addressable; feels like a small company at times.

True performance-based review process: no bizarre stack rank, no funky ""grades"", just a straightforward conversation with your manager about how you've done and where you're going.

Work/Life is second to none: Need time off? Take it! No limit on PTO. The simple agreement is, simply, make sure your job is taken care of.","Things can be a little frenetic. As Adobe shifts from the old to the new, some plans come in at the last minute. 

Hierarchical career movement may be limited. Org structures are pretty flat so, while your scope of influence may grow, you might stay in the same spot in the chain of command for some time. 

There is some discipline-specific segregation, typical of a mature software company (e.g., testers only do this, marketing people only do that, etc). I think this is more of a holdover culture from older employees as I don't see any segregation coming from higher levels."

I witnessed the poor treatment of a once outstanding coworker who became ill (illness is seen as weakness?). She was laid off so they didn't have to deal with her anymore.

Major restructuring happens in early- to mid-November every year, and about 5-10% of the workforce is laid off.  Rather than attempting to find new positions for good employees, they just throw out the good and the bad across the whole company.  If someone high up doesn't like you, you're in trouble, no matter how much value you've created for the company.

(Note: I have not been laid off, but enough of my colleagues have been that I feel justified in writing this.  If management just cut the dead wood, that would be fine--but people with consistently high performance marks are tossed off without a care, and others who create no value are kept around long past the years that they should have been let go.)"

1430,Adobe,Best job I've had so far!,2013-08-14,5.0,Computer Scientist,"I've worked at a few different tech companies which were *vastly* different in culture, vision, and size.  The first was a small startup which had me doing everything from writing code to answering phones.  The next was a medical device company where a bug in the code could literally put lives at risk.  Next was the largest software company in the world, which was the most intense place I've ever worked at.

Then came Adobe, the best place I've worked at so far:

- AWESOME pay!  I was already giddy from my starting salary when they hired me.  Now, 5 years later, it's up 25% on top of that, with (usually) yearly stock and cash awards, along with an additional %-of-your-yearly-salary bonus for being a Lead.  By far and large, the pay more than makes up for any other shortcoming/nit-pick I have about Adobe.

- An Employee Stock Purchase Plan which has been very good to us the last few years

- Unlike the other companies I worked for, Adobe (in San Jose) has a higher-than-average median age, which means families, which means the building is mostly deserted by 5.30pm

- Private offices!  If you've been with the company long enough (3+ years), you'll probably get an office with a window.

- VERY easy to move around and take on leadership roles, if you've got the right attitude.  I mention in the ""Cons"" section that engineering is filled with introverts, so if you're able to step out of that area, the sky's the limit.

- Free refreshments and (limited) healthy snacks in the break room.

- Free meals for engineers that stay until 6.45pm

- Well-outfitted onsite gym (with showers & lockers)

- Best-looking set of buildings in the city.  There are out-of-towners taking pictures of the building all the time.

- Friday beer-bash events","- Hardware refresh policy (for new monitors/laptops) is a bit stingy.  You only get automatic hardware updates every 3years.  However, if you have good reason for it, management may agree to new hardware earlier than that.

- Health Insurance options are the same as all other companies around here, but unlike Google and nearby startups, Adobe only covers 85% of the health insurance benefits (instead of 100%)

- The people here (in San Jose) are a bit on the older side, so there's not as much of the youthful spirit as you'd see in companies like Google or Facebook.

- If you're an engineer (like me), be prepared to be surrounded by the stereotypical introverted personality types!"

A lot of opportunity to move the business forward. Collaborative culture. For the most part, GREAT people to work with.","Not willing to truly invest in marketing. A fantastic brand that you never hear about. New business strategies flounder. Generally, management is very risk averse. The CEO is more of a technologist lacking interest in the value of marketing."
1465,Adobe,Great company where the benefits make occasionally shaky leadership tolerable.,2013-02-06,5.0,Communications Coordinator,"I can't say this enough: Adobe really appreciates and values their employees. The benefits package is universally fantastic. I've seen that the emphasis on work-life balance can vary from team to team, but I'm very fortunate to work with a great group of people who realize the importance of an occasional mental health day here and there. In my role, I'm able to focus on a variety of things that I'm interested in, plus I've been able to enroll in training courses to broaden my knowledge base.","As I said earlier, the executive team had a history of changing directions, rather significantly, on a yearly basis. However, the company strategy is beginning to solidify around the creative and marketing segments, and I'm inclined to believe the leadership team has found a strategy that's working in the market and they want to stick with for the foreseeable future.  I really wish we had a commuter shuttle between San Jose and San Francisco like some of our Silicon Valley brethren, but I'm not sure we have enough employees making the trip on a regular basis to make it a viable service. Typical office politics have a tendency to delay projects, but I think that's a universal complaint among many companies."

1475,Adobe,Good company. Lifestyle friendly. Okay pay.,2012-12-05,3.0,Senior Product Manager,"Has been a good career while in junior positions. Culture of the company seems focused very much on impressing internal leaders vs. making money for the shareholders. Business decisions often seem to be about proving that the company has made the right internal investment decisions, and wants to show how newly purchased technologies fit together nicely vs. actually building something desired by the market.","Opportunities to move up, however, are completely dependent upon team membership. If the team isn't growing, there are no opportunities. Moving to a higher level job in a new business unit is discouraged, leaving little option other than to wait for current senior staff to leave."

Although there are a lot of opportunities, they don't necessarily come with more cash/benefits. The yearly review process doesn't exist anymore and is an ""on going"" process. That's great in general, getting constant constructive feedback. However, what's yet to be seen is how this will work with promotions/recognition"

The Adobe culture is great and I think it is getting better. The people at Adobe enjoy their jobs and it shows in interactions.,Very tall company and a lot of middle management feels a bit stale.

There is a high value on PTO from upper management. Family first. Advancement opportunities if you have the drive to learn and move up. The company is still small enough to know a lot of key people up to Ops Staff. 

There is a huge push to improve the workspace on a global level and it is making it an even more enjoyable place to work. 

There is also a new welcomed push from HR to remove the annual review process. This is a huge innovated step for a company this size. It shows that HR is listening to the employees and making changes. 

Ultimately, Adobe is a great place to work because of the people I work with. I genuinely enjoy working with most of my peers. It creates a solid experience.","The HR policy that restricts the salary increase when you move to a new position.

There is no job security, and no long term plans. Its virtually impossible to plan out more than 2-3 months of a project, and there is no vision on what products to build, what customers need.

I was able to work from home twice a week.,"After the Macromedia acquisition all of sound it felt like we were working at a really big company. It was much slower moving and harder to get things done. Seems like we just keep acquiring companies since they can build things quicker than it would take to do within Adobe.  We have had problems communicating to the development community the whole Flex story.  There are certain people who just plug along and don't contribute much, while other good people were let go as part of the yearly layoffs.  They reduced employee benefits e.g. ability to roll over PTO time from one year to the next eliminated profit sharing, instituted bonuses (at your managers discretion), and are now doing a forced week off each year, they tried to position this as if it was a better deal but no one bought that."

Management has trully lost it over last year with bad decisions and communication.  Word is that they are just trucking along to vest more options  and then re-org to buy more time.

The digital marketing side of the business is growing and has a lot of promise.","The company is very risk averse and generally tends to be reactive (often years later) to industry trends rather than proactive.  Additionally, management no longer focuses on doing what is best for the customer, and instead looks at what's best for Adobe (short-term thinking, in my opinion).  There are many brilliant people, but complacency and resistance to change are a big problem.  

Additionally, in company meetings the CEO talks to employees as though they're the press, doling out bland corporate-speak rather than being forthcoming or genuine.  An inspiring leader, he is not."

Top management is out of touch and focused completely on Wall Street, not on pleasing the customers. Middle management is so focused on keeping their jobs they are scared to do anything that will kill the cash cow. Front-line managers are unable to effect change and don't get much respect.

Layoffs are an annual event now, and each September on the company slowly grinds to a halt as the rank and file waits to find out whether they'll have a job the next year. It's terrible for motivation and also encourages short-term thinking, since nobody can assume that either the strategic direction nor their jobs will be the same over the long haul."
1531,Adobe,Empowering,2012-03-10,5.0,,"Total autonomy. Adobe really believes in the freedom to work how you work best. It is refreshing to see a company hire talent and then offer an environment where they can contribute freely. Lots of cool perks across the board. Great worldwide HQ campus. Really focused on being environmentally conscious, and of course who can forget free access to everything produced by Adobe. They even have a system for you to buy retail packaged software for your friends/family at a ridiculously discounted rate.","It's a big company so it can sometimes seem difficult to plot your career advancement, though they do offer help in this respect. I've heard of others taking up the offer to move around departments/roles, but honestly I think this is primarily geared at the most junior level employees. The reality is, they hire top talent and understandably want to see the fruits of their recruitment in a specific area they tapped you for."
1532,Adobe,It is all about what you expect,2012-03-10,3.0,,"- very little stress
- great work life balance (out by 5pm, in after 9)
- great benefits
- most people are nice
- free food/soda
- If you are looking for decent pay, no stress, consistent work, hard to go wrong","- Absolutely no correlation between ability and position in the company
- Far more politics then other companies I have worked with
- Some of the least skilled people I have worked with
- Terrible infighting between groups
- No one is held accountable for anything
- MANY MANY layers of management for no reason
- If you want a position that pushes you, makes you better, will allow opportunity and growth, not the place for you"
1533,Adobe,Adobe is an excellent place to work and to learn,2012-02-19,4.0,,Lots of smart people to work with and learn from.,Seem to be floundering a bit of late to find direction.
1534,Adobe,"Used to have focus on cool technologies, now very much business focused.",2012-02-18,4.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Very cool technologies
Excellent benefits
People are very open and receptive
Everyone knows and admires Adobe and its products
Worldwide business exposure","Expansion seems to all be done outside the USA - very  limited growth within.
No attention paid to giving people wider experiences, so heaven forbid you stay with a product too long, you'll be shown the door.
Strategy explanation never seemed to make sense the last few years - maybe it's gotten too big to have a single focus?"
1535,Adobe,Great Company for Total Package & Work/Life Balance,2012-02-01,4.0,Group Product Manager,"- fair and equitable treatment of the employees
- excellent total compensation package, including many perks
- opportunity to work on plenty of high-profile projects","- slow on management decisions

- lack of distributed ownership / decision making ability
- not an exceptionally motivated workforce"

Lots of Parking

Work environment is great.

Annual Layoffs  talented folks gare demoralizing. Seems like there is the threat to your job every year.
Performance reviews are rather superficial."

1542,Adobe,No room to grow,2012-01-03,2.0,,"Great PAY, and time off.
Location and parking","Performance reviews are rather superficial!  Your reviews to managers are ignored!
Need to keep it professional with directors and managers.
Poor management leadership! 
Laid off great workers and kept the ""friends"" of managers on board. UNFAIR"
1543,Adobe,Dinosaur software company,2011-12-30,2.0,,Lots of time off. Easy to coast and get paid pretty freakin well.,No opportunity for growth. Incompetent management. CEO is clueless.
1544,Adobe,"Smart people, driven to excel.",2011-12-23,5.0,,Work life balance.  Leadership in the industry.  Resources and support.  Company invests heavily in keeping workers abreast of products and works to grow synergies through acquisitions.,Teams work across broad geo locations which can be challenging. Performance reviews are rather superficial.  You won't really know if the quality of your work is any better than satisfactory or not.
1545,Adobe,"Overall a nice place to work, but not perfect.",2011-12-22,4.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Good work life balance. Making cool products that help creative people realize their dreams. Decent compensation. Smart, honest, hardworking coworkers. Freedom to run my business as I see fit.",Complicated internal politics. Strategy changes every year.

1547,Adobe,"Good pay/benefits, but slowly nosediving to failure",2011-12-10,3.0,Content & Community Lead,"-great pay definitely above industry standards despite experience level
-tons of benefits, which I miss
-products WAS interesting (notice past tense), air and flex had a lot of potential but seems like management didn't feel the same way
-work was fairly interesting
-good availability of technology","-very clique-y, if you haven't been at the company long enough be ready to feel like an outsider
-SF office definitely had that hipster feel (which is a bad thing), UI/UX had that too cool for school attitude
-management has no faith in the product
-promotions and recognition given to those who can kiss up the most
-in the most recent layoff, it was very funny to see the lazy good-for-nothings stayed on while the technically talented folks got laid off 
-""best places to work"" is certainly an overhyped title, although pay and benefits were great, culture isn't quite there"
1548,Adobe,No work life balance,2011-12-08,2.0,,The compensation is good and they are growing in certain areas.,"There is no work life balance for the business unit I am in (Omniture), and even though the business is growing it translates to very few career opportunities for current employees.  They are much more likely to hire someone from the outside for positions that open up due to growth.  So, in the end your are working incredible hours for little opportunity of advancement."
1549,Adobe,Unorganized and Short Lived.,2011-12-07,2.0,Account Development Manager,"Great benefits, great perks, such as company cell phone, expense card, employee lunches, free drinks and snacks, reimbursement for not driving to work, reimbursement for athletic memberships such as yearly gym pass.","Very unorganized at the top.  In acquiring so many companies with complimentary products to the core creative suites, they have not merged sales forces.  You are constantly stepping all over everyones toes and pissing co-workers as well as clients off."
