Management really works hard to ensure that employees are supported. They have helped us out with a reimbursement for setting up our home offices. And the new plan for remote work is super flexible! 

There are plenty of employee support groups for whatever you interest is; that are very active. The community and environmental engagement programs are top notch. And did I mention unlimited PTO!?!?

Communication from management is proactive. I Love working with the people in my group. And so far I haven't encountered any real jerks in the rest of the company.","Healthcare plan is better than many, though still not really top tier. And price wise it is on the high side of the middle range.

100,Akamai,Good Company to work for.,2022-01-26,4.0,Solutions Engineer,"Culture, benefits are really what keeps you going with Akamai",None to my knowledge at this point
101,Akamai,Akamai is in the Glassdoor 2022 best places to work for a reason,2022-01-24,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"I have been with Akamai for a relatively long time and haven't written a review so it was about time! There are many reasons why I think Akamai is a fantastic place to work and I'll mention a few, but they are far from all. If you like these - consider joining us - I want more awesome people to call friends & colleagues! 
- Great people. When I say that I mean in the full spectrum as human beings. Pretty much all the people I have worked with throughout the years are genuinely nice people who work hard at achieving Akamai's mission to make the Internet a better, safer place for everyone. There is tremendous talent here at every level - engineering, customer support, product management, sales, hr. The tone is set from the very top by Tom who is extremely hard working & smart, cares about the company & people deeply and manages the company to the highest ethical standards. Evidence of which is our inclusion in the JUST 100.
- Culture. Akamai is a diverse company with people from all over the world and in almost all parts of the world - united on values of honesty, transparency, fairness and mutual respect. While there will always be exceptions I really feel these are the overarching principles by which we go about our days.
- The mission. Everyday we who work here are responsible for making billions of people's online experience a good and secure one. Be it streaming movies, reading the news, shopping online, banking, you name it. We take this responsibility seriously and go to extreme lengths to make sure we get it right. When something does break or doesn't go as planned - we fix it as fast as we can and try our best to make sure it doesn't happen again. Ironically, most of the time people don't know we even exists which means we are doing it right.
- Our technology. Akamai has been around since the early days of the Internet - pioneering many of the fundamental technologies & concepts that power the Internet of today. But we aren't standing still - there is evolution and innovation happening here everyday. Everyone is empowered and encouraged to contribute to this. Just over the course of the last year I have personally played a part in innovations in both edge computing and security for example.
- Akamai is profitable with solid financials. As opposed to many if not most of our competitors we aren't bleeding cash every quarter. This means the company has endurance which is critical for material & long term investments - be it in new technology, hiring talent, scaling up to meet future demand or weathering out storms.
- We are serious about our environmental & sustainability programs. Early on the company set goals for emissions, energy and e-waste and publish a yearly sustainability report on how we are doing. This is one of the reasons we are included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and the FTSE4Good Index.","Overall there's not much I would say are big cons as they typically come as consequences of the pros but for full transparency here's a few.
- We don't market ourselves as much and as well as we should. This mostly affects attracting talent (so hopefully this review can help change that a bit). Customers and those in our technology space know us well but outside of that we are a bit anonymous.
- Profitability means we invest with care. That's not to say we don't take any risks - we do - but if the economics don't materialize after a while we also aren't afraid to move on.
- Bloated organization in parts. Primarily I would say this manifests as too much middle management and process sometimes. But I never let that hold me back and neither should you :)"

I was effectively demoted without cause, despite consistently very good reviews. The rising tide of the reorg floated some boats but sank far more others than it should have; many folks were pulled off of leadership and management tracks for no good reason; some people were put on PIPs for poor reasons, effectively managing them out without severance or the good treatment for those who were laid off. This has been very disappointing treatment of people who have been seen as valuable (but perhaps expensive) employees. A lot of very good people are leaving. I’m sure things will shake out and they will do well and be a great employee again, but this was a very disappointing end game for many of us. And it WILL be the end game."

* Very mature, prudent company. Incredible safety culture - which is great when you're supposedly ""on call"" for incidents - my phone has rung 5 times in 2 years. It's not an emergency unless it's an *emergency*. We don't move fast and break things.
* Ethical - The company is not actively doing heinous stuff (no radicalizing teens with social media, not exploiting an underclass of independent contractors, etc). It's a poor commentary on the state of the world that that's a pro, but good luck finding that at a big tech company these days.","* After an activist investor came in in 2017, the company (apparently) cut back on a lot of perks. So don't expect a lavish Christmas party, or business trips around the world. I think compensation is on the lean side for the area as well.

Though most people would rate Akamai 5 stars for diversity and inclusion, I give them only 2 stars because I felt the culture is not accepting of older workers. This is not something most people think of when they think of ""diversity and inclusion"", but as you become an older worker in the tech industry you realize these concepts should definitely encompass age diversity as well as race, religion, ethnicity and sexual orientation."

They term it ""flexible"" but you struggle to find people when you need their help urgently. Specially because there is too much of dependency on other teams.
- Managers will allow you to logout early and connect from home for calls.  But the calls are all accommodated to American convenience and indians are expected to give up their night time for all the ""not so useful but mandatory"" calls everyday including Friday. And this is worse because the US office also has lot of Indians who suddenly think they have a privilege for being in US.  
- Lot of weekend support work for developers but no paid compensation.
- Management is extremely authoritative and there is no open communication unlike other product companies. One is in constant threat of being fired when they are not in manager's good books. There is too much of politics to the point of taking you to complete burnout.
- Their work culture is quite ancient and they are rarely open to new ideas or approaches to do things. There is no team work, it is all IC roles. No technical lead to guide and no one cares about quality of code or work as long as it works. Too many messy manual steps which they are not ready to automate.
- As a developer, you won't grow or improve because expectations from you is to just get things working or maintain them with no discussions, reviews or improvisation.
- The recruiters also do a pathetic job of matching you to unsuitable roles.

All in all, it has highly unhealthy work environment and culture would not recommend anyone to Akamai Bangalore."

Linux Academy Access","Speaking per SOC, full of over-judgmental, unfriendly, demotivating, jealous and even discriminative people, especially among those so-called ""Seniors"", who did everything to make the new comers feel like they knew nothing, they were worthless and even they did not deserve to be at Akamai.

All of this was becoming much more evident while those so-called seniors were interacting with foreigners from Middle East in the office, They were clearly treating them worse but somehow this did not bother the local management at all as the local management did not want to mess up with those so called ""Seniors"" of SOC Krakow.

Eventually, one of those discriminative, jealous and additionally anti-social so-called Seniors became a manager for the night shift as noone else was willing to do it.  At that point, things got even worse as not only he had this judgmental obsessive character with extreme jealousy (especially of better-looking people) but also he did not even know the basics of either management or interacting with people in general.

This toxic atmosphere in the SOC Krakow was so strong that even some of the Polish new-comers grabbed this attitude and started to treat other new-comers as such as soon as they started to work (you can also call it a desperate attempt to be appreciated by the Seniors in order to be promoted)
I have kept those people called ""so-called Seniors"" on purpose so far, as being a Senior does not only mean having more experience and/or more technical knowledge (which literally anybody can do just by cramming the books& sitting in front of the computer all day long). Therefore, even though those toxic people were regarded as Senors at SOC Krakow, in reality they did not even have a tiny bit of wisdom of a true Senior, who can guide less experienced people, motivate them and most importantly, is nationality-agnostic.
In fact, in my opinion, this last thing is not an issue of merely SOC Krakow but rather of all of undeveloped countries with immature business culture, like the Polish one. Virtues like motivation, guidance, wisdom, multi-culti team work etc. are simply too abstract to understand for people coming from such cultures, since all they care about is pragmatism, i.e. whether a person knows the stuff enough or not. That's why even such people were given the title Senior there, the title which they would never be able to acquire,  merely with their technical knowledge,  in any of the developed countries with this attitude and mindset, 

Work/Life balance was bad for the ones who were working on night shift as well. As Night shift is something that messes up this balance.

Finally, Average English level was also too low at SOC Krakow, which is no surprise for Polish IT industry"

Those innocent face making engineers show true face to other engineers when managers are not around.
Best shift to work is weekend shift.
you do 12 hours of work for 3 days and enjoy 4 days of the week off!!!
Lots of internal team politics.
Engineers will keep a smiling innocent face in front of you who you believe are friends but will do backstabbing, they will complain a lot about you to your managers. 
Managers enjoy listening to the gossips and they start believing the rumours. The whole management team is built with a motto of let engineers wipe their mess and award the one who wipes really good or even eat their mess really good. 
Each team will think that they are supreme to others that leads to lot of team-specific escalation to each other.
One short advice is to not to join this team as this team looks shittiest in Akamai. 
Don't join if you are looking for good technical role and career growth.
You will be stuck in a loop you will not be able to break it.

787,Akamai,I enjoyed this company but I don't recommend.,2020-01-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's very difficult to divide Pros and Cons. I'll try to write actual situations I encountered, not just writing my impressions,  ""good or bad"".
So let me mix them up here. As a memorial to my leave this company.
(Place and title is anonymous)

== Culture ==
	
I had worked for a bureaucratic company that everyone including non-tech people would know the name and is several ten times larger than Akamai. 

From my experience, Akamai has five times more managers and positions compared to a far larger company than Akamai. 

I feel too many management teams and the job titles end up leading Akamai to ""no decision can't be made"".

Even though Akamai is still small - midsize company, Akamai is the most bureaucratic company I've ever experienced.

The interesting part is that there are so many rules but many managers even don't care about the rules.

They tend to overwrite even very basic company rules. In most cases, those rules are used to say ""It's not my/our job"". A lot of red tapes in Akamai. So, it's sometimes impossible to achieve a very simple thing.

Let's say, when you go to someone to ask a task following a guide on the intranet, you might be told ""it's not my task because my manager has told me it's not our task even if they're defined and written on the intranet"".  Or ""I know Akamai is selling that service/product but our team doesn’t have enough skill, so we don’t do that.""
	
These are just examples, but you would often encounter similar situations because one small task is divided into many small tasks. It's very common throughout the company, not depending on your job title.  So, in most cases, I think your responsibility is very small compared to average companies. 
If you like small tasks and don’t want to experience new things. I recommend this company. You would get a great work-life balance.

But if you are like go-to-guy, I don’t recommend this company because a lot of people would come to you and push you to do their jobs even if those tasks are not your responsibility. No rules. 

You need to work with many people to achieve a small task. Sometimes, you need to find someone who follows the company rules secretly behind his/her managers if the manager is kind of people who don't like to follow the rules. The more you are versatile, the more you would encounter these troublesome situations. 
	
I felt Akamai consists of village culture. Cliques are everywhere. They control the company and block innovation and changes. And the culture created by them is, as you can imagine, naturally corrupting.  If you like corruption and are good at getting benefits from the culture, this culture will fit you.
	
I think this creates village culture. I've seen several bullies consistently over the years. One bully is recognized and reported even by a customer. So, I could say it's the prevailing culture. HR recognizes those bullies but seems trying to confine them as if there is nothing happening.
	
And I've seen some managers seem to have difficulties communicating with customers or partners. I've seen and been told by customers or partners that some of Akamai's managers are arrogant even in front of customers even when they have trouble with their platform. Naturally, many staff employees follow that kind of style while saying customers are most important.
	
So, you often encounter many illogical situations. One best point in Akamai would be that you can get more anger management ability.

I was told by my former colleagues in Akamai. ""You proved yourself to be a really bad guy because you could work for such a long time in Akamai"" 

Many good colleagues quit. The average is around one or two years. They are still good friends.","Instead of Cons.  I put my review from the perspective of technologies.

== Technologies ==
	
I don’t recommend this company, especially for engineers. If you want to have some experience with CDN, go to Fastly or AWS. 
	
Akamai CDN is based on old physical server technologies, there a lot of legacy operations that seem to be automated very easily. Akamai is trying to move on to new technologies, but it's too slow.

The number of CDN servers is still number one in the world and the strongest point from the perspective of capacity. But Akamai started losing the advantage as other cloud vendors are focusing on CDN. 

And I feel making things more complicated by dividing into many manual tasks is the typical Akamai way while many tech companies making things easier with technologies. 

There are many small products based on CDN which could be a simple product with other venders.  I would say they are coming from too many organizations and politics. The way I look at it, to create more positions, Akamai has needed to divide one product into many products. 
	
Maybe there is so much to do. But that would be because of a lot of manual work which comes from the immaturity of legacy product architectures and approval processes which have to go through many people. It's very common for engineers to say that they feel they are wasting their time, should be able to consolidate these tasks.

For example, with AWS, you may be able to do a task in 5 minutes. With Akamai, it takes one month or impossible. If it's a simple task, these things could happen very easily.
	
And roles are divided into many job titles. So, your responsibility would be very small. Depending on your situation, most of the tasks you do could be clerical tasks.

At least I know a few guys who weren't satisfied with their roles and quit saying that their responsibility is too small and they can't understand why a simple single task requires many people. So, if you have good work ethics to learn more and work hard, I think this is not the place you should belong to. You would encounter a lot of red tapes and politics, local rules by cliques.

For example, in other companies, one person can manage and complete one simple task. But in Akamai, sometimes it can be called a project and may require three or four people. But you can’t tell these things from job description open on the internet.
	
Akamai is trying to expand into new technology areas such as enterprise security which are completely different from CDN.

But Akamai has track records keep failing new business. You can find them if you look up on the internet carefully.

As I see it, Akamai tries to put those new businesses into the same business framework as CDN. So, Akamai still has difficulties to get those new business rolling. So, you shouldn’t expect much in these areas. Some people may like birth pains to create new things and get new business rolling. 
	But I think only you can encounter there would be politics and red tapes, a lot of reasons ""we don’t do that"" by old cliques who stick to the experience of CDN. I've seen a few people left in very short terms, again and again, saying that they had trouble with those situations. It seems a typical innovation dilemma. If you have good experience in those areas, it wouldn't work here.
	
Even with CDN business, Akamai doesn’t allow customers to sign up online. You need to sign a contract that is really complicated and hard to understand and takes a lot of time. From outside, as many cloud companies allow customers to sing up online, it seems an easy thing. But Akamai has a lot of reasons why ""we don't / can't do that"".
	
There are a lot of people involved in one product development, but even the specifications of a product are very vague. Most of the specifications are ""not defined"". So, learning a product takes a lot of effort and time then even with that effort and time, you will still be not sure about the product. 

Actually, there are many materials online, but most of them are sales/marketing materials even though they are supposed to be targeted at technical people.
	
In most cases, you need to work based on some kind of rumors.  Product information is usually exchanged verbally or through chatting. In most cases, the source of information is someone's blog on the intranet.

No culture to write down information.  Everyone is not sure who is responsible for a product even though there are many product managers.
Product managers (I don’t know why there are many product manager titles for one product) are in most cases not able to be responsible for their products probably because of a lot of red tapes."

Troubleshooting a complex distributed system is one of the most challenging part of computer science and the management wants to resolve the issue in 15 mins (sla premium 3.0)
Continuous night shift is the worst, your social life will be non existent
There are so many things which can be automated but management only cares about metrics. 
If you try for an internal transfer, you'll be put in performance improvement plan

Problem was that many of them were hired in the last five years—unfortunately into department leadership positions.","Akamai went from a great place to work to a nightmare in a short period of time.  Akamai became extremely lazy in the hiring process over the last half decade.  Rather than finding good cultural fits, they just started hiring the first candidate that met a desired quota.
Real Estate leadership team was an example of nepotism at it finest.  It’s run by a crew of inexperienced career climbers with undefined, but well compensated roles, and a “do as I say, not as I do.” attitude.  Hint—when you tell other departments that their space utilization is an issue, but most of your Directors and VP work from home or their real estate brokers office 3-4 days a week, it’s not a good look.
HR leadership is a lacking.  They generally couldn’t be bothered to weed out harassment or bullying even when it was staring them right in the face.  Victim blaming and excuse making became all too common.  Suggestion: Stop ignoring the patterns of misbehavior and hope it will go away when mistreated employees get fed up and leave.   Acknowledging, but failing to correct or remove the problem actors doesn’t solve anything.  It just reinforces that the misbehavior is acceptable to a company that represents itself as an inclusive “Great Place to Work”."

There's a huge and shiny new building in Kendall Square that Akamai will be moving in to very shortly. It's very modern and cool.","The tech stack at Akamai is almost entirely proprietary. The company does let teams integrate open source and new tech as they see fit, but the process is very slow. Basic solved problems like continuous build and integration seem like unmoveable behemoths, even though they are not. Technical debt is rising and the company leadership has explicitly admitted that they are prioritizing revenue streams over any sort of technical debt reduction or mitigation. Over the past 5 years the company has gone from a fairly nimble if a bit introspective organization to a profit hungry big business.

There are a few departments that seem to be guided by randomly throwing darts at a board with no thought to how it will affect other units. Communication between business units is poor to non-existent."

Cheap Hershey's kisses candies are the ONLY form of free snack the company will provide. The company will decide to delay annual raises by 6 months to save a few pennies and this has happened multiple times!!!
* MASSIVE offshoring to low wage countries especially in engineering. You will be left wondering why they even bother paying you to sit in a high wage country. You will see your colleagues leave and management will replace the headcount by hiring 2 engineers in a low wage country such as Poland.

I dare you to be good at your job and try to do decent work in that department. The problem is, if you are good at what you do but, you are surrounded by unqualified people in the wrong roles, you are inevitably going to disagree with them. That doesn't fly with the egos in this marketing leadership team. They are only interested in ""Yes Men."" You can almost surely expect to be on the next round of layoffs if you don't get with their ill-conceived program. A lot of talented people have gone out the door for no good reason. Did I mention the layoffs? They happen annually as well as random points throughout the year. Job security is non-existent in the marketing department.

There is no actual plan in any of the day-to-day work, no overarching strategy in the marketing, and no analytics being used improve the effectiveness of the work. Even though the tools are readily available, it takes competent leadership get the department to properly put them to use. There's little to no cooperation between teams and zero accountability when things get really screwed up (and they do get screwed up often. Projects take so much longer than they ever should. Work is finished and approved, then reworked constantly, because of the lack of clear leadership, guidelines, decision rights and strategy.

1010,Akamai,Akamai doesn't really develop anything.,2019-01-17,2.0,Systems Architect,Large company.  Liberal work from home policy.  International.,"Your work will never see the light of day.  

Akamai started as a web caching service and pretty much stopped there.  They have gone on to buy other little companies to acquire new technology and ... don't seem to do anything with it.  Akamai has annual layoffs where folks that are not politically aligned get axed regardless of their contribution or technical importance.  Honestly though, Akamai needs to lay off a LOT more people.  Because Akamai doesn't really develop any  new technology, they really don't need all of those engineers and developers.  Seriously, Akamai could be 1/10th its current size and still be just as ""productive"".  

The liberal work from home policy is nice, but it also has a down side.  My manager lived in another state.  His manager lived in another country.  Our BU was run by another guy in another country.

Nothing seems to get done.  My team produced lots of great work but there was nobody to hand it off to -- even the teams that requested the systems in the first place.  Nobody is in charge.  Nothing seems to go anywhere.  There is no direction."

- Interesting technologies and market segment.","No matter how you perceive Akamai today, they are basically a start-up company with a start-up attitude to strategy and employees.

If you joined during the early days and part of the old boy network, you will be secure and protected. If you're part of any new hire in last few years, be prepared to be let go in a heart beat, nobody will back you up from the management team as they will only be worried about their own jobs.

The sales teams are shocking to work with, they are mostly fly-boys, complain about Akamai all the time and how they could earn more money elsewhere and brag about their Porsches and R8s all the time, no commitment to the company. I met many sales people who were in Akamai, left, rejoined and wanted to leave again which Akami embrace as they're only interested in the dollar.

The experience of the management team is very poor and they wouldn't stand a chance in any other business I have worked in. They are used to hiding in their offices, taking no ownership or responsibility.

The current CEO has no balls since Elliott Management took a hefty stake in the business. Elliott now runs Akamai and the CEO and his inexperienced management team dance to the beat of the Elliott drum.

The company is being shaped by Elliott for imminent acquisition so if you're reading this and thinking of joining then I would advise waiting as you might not be in your job long; sleep easy though as the CEO and his inexperienced management team will make a lot of money out of this.

Finally, the HR team are useless, have no power, no control, another bunch of inexperienced individuals given power but can't help you, only help themselves."

- amazing scale which can teach a motivated engineer tremendous skills and techniques","- toxic culture and extraordinarily political.  teams sabotage each other to ensure that their competing ideas win, it seriously happens all the time.  
- sadly, people play on Tom's personality to get projects done or tanked
- many in senior leadership are clueless, or willfully ignorant, about what is happening in their teams. 
- Good ideas, especially those based in industry best-practices are often ignored or discounted because of Not Invented Here, or early inventor syndrome - because Akamai's tech was truly so great in 1998, they struggle to let go of parts of it that now have been leap-frogged, leading to a bizarre state of advanced and very cludgy or backwards and outdated technology  - and not just for legacy systems, but even new work.
-  As an example - the VP in our office showed up to work less a couple times a year - only when bigwigs would visit.  Effectively delegating his entire job, even direct reports wouldn't be able to reach him for weeks at a time, he never did perf reviews or gave feedback - nearly non-exisistent leadership for his teams - but he talks just enough of a good game to leadership to somehow get away with it for years now."

From organizational maturity, to analytic and clear strategy, to the professionalism of the people here… I love almost everything about Akamai.","It’s a well-known fact that you don’t mention your political alliances and opinions in the workplace because it’s divisive. Then why do some Akamai leaders think that it’s ok to mention their support for the U.S. military and express their “patriotism” in front of a diverse audience? I understand that September 11, 2001 was huge for Akamai. It’s understandable that the story of “The U.S. rises strong after the terrorist attack” got intertwined with Akamai’s story back then, BUT IT IS 2018 and a lot has happened since. Also, Akamai is a global company now. 

Those at Akamai who are supportive of the U.S. government and military need to stop using and building upon that narrative that came out of September 11.  All employees at Akamai should be able to rally behind its leadership and strive hard to make Akamai win. This kind of talk by the Akamai leadership is not conducive to that. It’s not conducive to having an inclusive workplace in 2018.

That reactionary and war-mongering narrative is better kept for executive round-tables or when dealing with customers in the military industrial complex. I am sure it helps build credibility in front of that kind of crowd."

Media team have some very talented management locally, regionally and globally. Some hugely intelligent technical resources and very good sales people.

Web/Security team have some great people also but mostly the sales people and technical guys.
Security is growing and that is down to the sales team who have done well to prioritise the focus on this set of solutions and lead with a security mindset than traditional CDN play of acceleration etc.

Very good products and excellent support teams.

Extremely switched on senior leadership in the US who are also modest and easy to talk to and discuss.

CEO is a very intelligent and personable character.","Some pockets of bad management in region. Politics is very visible between the two divisions and between certain management where it seems almost personal. 

That happens in large organisations which is fine but when it becomes easily noticeable and very publicly aware then that is not good for anyone.

Outdated internal systems which you can overcome but definitely needs a major overhaul.

1221,Akamai,"not the worst, but far from the best",2018-01-04,2.0,Senior Platform Operations Technician,"- They obey the law. 

-  The pay is decent. 

- Their executives say a lot of words about improving diversity and inclusion. 

- Employee Resource Groups (ERG's) exist and hold events with ice cream or other food. 

- The Information Security and Mapping departments contain many good managers and treat employees very well. 

- If you're motivated, you can learn a lot by getting onto Information Security and Mapping email lists, showing up to talks, and taking notes.","- Managers have tremendous latitude to approve/deny ""unlimited"" vacation, which means if you get a bad manager or a manager who dislikes you, you will have zero (0) actual days of vacation. 

- The on-call structure is also determined by each individual team, and is entirely at managers' discretion. This includes whether any on-call work is compensated at all, and how much on-call work is required to keep your job. If you get onto a bad team, there is no upper limit on how many nights, weekends, and holidays you could spend putting out fires. 

- Some departments, like Platform Operations, mostly contain bad managers who literally laugh in the faces of employees expressing distress, in front of many other employees. 

- Akamai does the minimum for transgender people that they are legally required to do. When I was there, their ""LGBT"" ERG was almost entirely cisgender gay men handing out Human Rights Campaign flyers and patting themselves on the back. The company had no gender-neutral restrooms anywhere in the world, and the LGBT ERG was reluctant to say or do anything about that. If you want an LGBT ERG to do anything but celebrate marriage equality and give you ice cream, try another company. 

- Their approach to disability is also ""we will obey the law, and do absolutely nothing else."" To the best of my knowledge, there is no disability ERG, many accommodation requests are denied, requests that are accepted take weeks or months, and nobody whose request is denied sticks around for more than a few months.

- Their approach to infrastructure/operations is seriously flawed and outdated. When I was there, I felt like Akamai was worse than average, but after leaving and getting context from people at other companies, I feel like their NOCC offices are best described as sadomasochistic performance art."

- New management has taken over Marketing which has resulted in layoffs, people jumping ship, awfully-low morale across the board, ""us-and-them"" tension between the new Management team and tenured Akamai employees, little transparency, and snap decisions that adversely affect other arms of the department
- The company is known for it's smart employees, but not in Marketing. Smart, good employees are leaving because employees who can't perform tend to stick around (some of whom came through acquisitions)

Initial offer was decent. Yearly raise was absolutely pathetic.

Stock options are a nice gesture, but are too volatile to be considered anything but a token offering. Go look at the stock price right now. Then look at it over the last 5 years. 

There are a lot of smart, well-rounded people here.","Ridiculously long and drawn out training process. Bulk of what is taught here is to bring someone who knows nothing of CDN into being able to have a conversation (possibly in a vacuum.) In other words, training is a ""one size fits all"" approach, and most of what is heavily emphasized will never be used in a setting with a client.

Regular, mandatory meetings that bring nothing of substance forthe employees, and is more in-person information gathering for middle management. The travel costs for organizing across the entire company must be astronomical.

Regular, mandatory calls (think 5-10 employees) for trivial matters. 

Regular, mandatory training for new products, and yearly refreshers to ensure you haven't forgotten what you already knew. This is heavily rooted in the ""MIT Culture"", which if it works for you, great. Most of what I've learned never happened in a classroom.

Advancement is generally given to those who have lingered long enough without quitting or being fired.

Sales rules this company. Full stop. Even the most oblivious in the ranks here have a lot of political power, and you either go with that flow or you get thrown overboard. This place belongs to the old guard, and they will defend their place at all costs.

Is not complicated to join the company, if you have some sense of how the Internet works and spend some time learning DNS and HTTP that's all you need, which gives an idea that challenges in there are not big.

People is encouraging to compete for everything no matter what, which cause a heavy work environment, they said you should learn by suffering the pain, which includes assignments like present if front of ""senior"" people but they won't even let you finish and they will crash whatever you say until you present as they expect in their minds, which drives you into a loss of confidence.

Outside of that it would get 5 poo emojis.","This was hands down the worst job I have had in my career. I was hired in under a new manager that micromanaged me beyond belief. I was completely burned out within a couple of months. 

I seriously felt like I went back in time on this job....I had to fill out a daily call log with at least 30 calls a day, an updated pipeline chart twice a week, and another chart that listed every meeting I had with detailed notes updated daily. My manager wanted to be on every single call I made. This was a car salesmen environment where I was forced to ram deals down a customers throat knowing they would probably never take another call from me again in the future.

Work/life balance consisted of my manager calling/texting/emailing all day, and even after hours for the same things we previously discussed 10 times during work hours. I used to have dreams about my phone going off with a text saying ""fire drill everyone needs to get on a conference call right now!"" We would all hop on and he would say we need to hop into SFDC to ""commit"" deals that had zero chance of closing. He wanted to inflate his numbers while making us all look like clueless morons when these deals went no where.

Out of the 10+ people that started on his team, there is currently ONE left. ONE. 

Maybe chalk this up to a terrible manager? I reported him more than once.

Akamai offers a 6 month draw because you are not expected to sell much until then. I wasn't even given my account list until month 3. However I was put on PIP in month 4. I sold my first deal in month 5. I was fired in month 6. 

Best day of my career was walking out that door.

Has some decent technology.
Has been around for years.
Makes good acquisitions to stay relevant!","For a technology company, there's a huge shortage of good engineers, with knowledge of new frameworks. Everything gets built on top of old code that's clunky and difficult to QA. Many releases have to get rolled back because they cause customer issues or simply don't work!
It takes a painfully long time to get new features out, many times years... and by the time something is released, there are multiple competitors doing the same thing much better and for lower price!
Finally, certain teams/industries get all the attention of product and engineering and everything gets built with them in mind. The rest of the customer base is left with having to shoehorn Akamai products into their workflow. 

As a company, there's a huge middle management layer that's ineffective and adds to employee frustration. These are managers who play politics, don't care about helping their direct reports advance their careers, and are simply dead weight. This adds to the work/life imbalance for high throughput employees and lets those doing bare minimum fly under the radar (and many times, get promoted!)."

pays attention to ergonomics at work
some nice people in the company","Some mid to low level managers are not suitable to be managers.
I worked at different teams at Akami.
First I reported to a director who paid attention to what you need to get your work done and supported your growth and development. He gave me an excellent recommendation that still helps me today. 

Then I moved to a different team. The woman who I reported to was a manager from hell. I just graduated from grad school and I needed working visa sponsorship, so I tried my best to cope. I worked really hard and tried to do a good job, but everyday I was just depressed. There is no guidance, no training, no explanation on what we're doing.  I was used like a data-pulling machine. No context of why doing this, how to do it. If i did it slow, she would pour on me ""then what's the differece between you and some cheap guy in India?"" When i ask a question, I would get a condescending push-back ""I dont understand what you're saying"" and then she just turned around.
When I said someone else did this before, let me go ask him. She said ""NO,then he has all the CREDIT."" When someone feels her result is fishy and wants to take a look at the raw data, and I said ""Sure, I'll send"", she would scold me so bad because she wanted to protect her own work.
......
Simply put, there was no respect and I was bullied. After a while, I tried to talk to the good old HR ""business partner"" (native me). The HR person didnt help. She just turned around and told my manager even though i said the chat was ""confidential"". You can imagine how i was treated after that.
I learned from the bad manager what to avoid when one day I manage people. However, it was a really bad experience, and I strongly suggest you interview your manager before you take the job, even if you worry about visa and want the job a lot."

1413,Akamai,Analysts Keep Away. Akamai Operations(Ops),2017-01-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Akamai is absolutely first class when trying to keep the employee happy, which is definitely reflected in the Glassdoor ratings.

- Above market Remuneration + Stock Options
- Cool, colorful and modern office spaces
- Ergo Desks for everyone (motorized ones that you can work on standing up or sitting down)  
- Free Breakfast and Dinner buffet. Highly subsidized lunch buffet
- Classy Annual Bashes pretty much every year (unlimited beer and wine on the house)
- Educational Assistance and Personal Loan
- Internet Reimbursement for all
- Decent Corporate training options pretty much every quarter
- AC Cab pickup and drop. And this is not the packed  experience that you might experience at other companies. 3 folks per cab is the max. If you do not want to take the cab they pay you 3k in cash.
- Gift box on Indian festivals(not cheap)
- Free Heath check up at least once a year

Everyone outside of Ops also seems generally happy with their work and future. Maybe the negativity is an ops problem!","Not many Akamai Ops reviews on Glassdoor. Hopefully this helps someone make the right choice fully knowing what they are getting into. Those of us here already – God save us all!

Short: KEEP AWAY from any of the ops(operations) teams if you love your career

Long:
- There is nothing to learn beyond some archaic processes that have been handed down since the beginning of time. And NO that can't change because ""it was always done that way"" . But ""we are open to ideas"" only to come up with reasons to say why ""it cannot be done!"".
- For all the technology advancements the company has made, you in ops will still be stuck with excel for anything and everything.
- You will be considered technically advanced for being able to build queries in Obiee. Many folks who can build queries in Obiee walk around like tech god's! Frogs in a well!
- Obiee is as far as it goes technically. But during interviews ,which is long and painful, you will be asked questions and solve cases like they need you to do rocket science.
- You will be manually modifying excel sheets all day long because someone higher up wants to see the ""right"" numbers which even the system of record does not have.
- Why are the numbers wrong? Because processes and systems are messed up. You are an overpaid band aid!
- Biz stakeholders think that the ops team is setup for advanced stuff that will help improve their biz. But the truth is far from it. It's a hustle in ops! Things haven't fallen on their face so far thanks to the grunt labor done all day-night long by poor analysts.
- extremely bureaucratic for a small sized company. Power vests in the hands of a few egotistical individuals and these folks have an agenda of their own for their own benefit.
- Like any other foreign company the good and high profile work is concentrated at HQ and once the juice from it has been squeezed, it comes to India.
- Everyone talks about ""thinking outside the box"" though! 
- internal movements are a joke(No surprises). While in theory you can move roles in 1 yr, but very rarely will it happen. Mainly because your manager will try every trick in the book to sabotage that!
- At Akamai, manager is God. Lot of power vests with your direct manager hence you can NEVER mess with her/him if you want to have a peaceful life/career in the organization. HR is a rubber stamp don't bother going there!
- Except for the referral bonus, there is no reason to refer a friend into the Ops team.
- the ONLY reason you 'should' take an ops job is for the money and the benefits. Only few people have been able to get out of ops on their own to something more meaningful. There are also cases where some of them were 'managed' out.
- Alternatively, if you have game or can suck up and feed egos you will do just fine and you will be rewarded well. 

Be warned: highly political!

The Emperor has no clothes! - Those who will say so will be persecuted."

Technologically:
Although Akamai products are vast, serving inside the role of AkaTech makes one more specialized to learn only about very proprietary technologies which are not going to help you in case you want to transition to other company which caters to a different world other  than that of CDN.

Stable company.,"Selfish management culture, I have not seen good managers of any level many years in this company. They all seem to be similar in style: first priority is their job security and career ladder, last thing on their mind is their employees and company long term health and development. All these kinds of management culture even made engineers working in the similar selfish style. in the end, team work, enthusiasm, innovation and collaboration cross departments are getting less and less  over the years. Company will suffer in the end.

Job pay level including bonus and stock is on the cheap side, i.e.  low end of Silicon Valley range. Besides, company gears up more to hire H1 visa cheap labor, to relieve its non-competitiveness in retaining good employees.

Some HR managers are not fair to employees either. They work from headquarters in Boston. Know very little about Silicon Valley open culture and employee concerns. When employee reports issues about their managers to HR, they feel like colluding with the manager to defeat the employee, rather than addressing employees concern and solving problems of the bad manager and management culture. 

All these culture things make me think never recommend someone to work for a company headquartered in East coast."

1504,Akamai,This place is home,2016-08-12,5.0,,"Literally. Akamai is home. From working at home, or being made to feel at home by some awesome colleagues. 

Akamai is a great place to work, the team spirit reaches across the companies global locations - a team spirit permeating from the workforce of really clever people.  The learning curve is steep and hard - but rewarding for those that stick it out. Once training is over, you are thrown into the deep and thrown in hard - sink or swim time. If you survive your first year at Akamai, you will do great and can make it what you want. If you can't put in that effort or go the extra mile, well you cant make your time at Akamai what you want - you can see some of those people by looking for the negative reviews here. But I advise you don't :P

Career choices are awesome, there is constant room for team moves, advancement and the company places a huge emphasis on investing in people with both internal and external training. Put in the work, this company rewards you.

Flexible working? Oh yes please. Best flexible working company ever. Brilliant if you have families or medical commitments you need to work around or be around for. 

Salaries are normally at the higher and of market rates, if not over (especially for those with tenure). Benefits package is great; Stock, matched pension to 6%, stock investment scheme with a guaranteed minimum 15% return... though the private medical insurance lets the company down as its so cheap 

Family days, ""bring your children to work"" days, team events, free cooked lunch and breakfast on select days each week","-The steep learning curve, ""drink from the firehose"" training and ""thrown in the deep end"" from first assignments is not suited to everyone, though i found it fine. 

- UK medical insurance provider is rated one star and has a significant amount of negative reviews online.

Disappointed with the benefits from a disparity standpoint versus peers in the US side, particularly after going through a ""perfect storm"" of sorts with a health issue and recent baby.  It highlighted shortcomings in the compensation package (as a Canadian).  Example would be Parental / Maternity leave is expected to be taken out from a set amount of vacation / PTO time; same with medical leave; no EI top up.
Discussions with peers seem to also indicate continuing shortcomings with marketing, legal (e.g. customers complaining about turnaround times for T&C on contracts; issues with employee visa applications) and other corporate services.

There are numerous internal programs that allow an ambitious employee to both learn about new projects, present on their own projects, or nominate new projects to improve the company or offer a new service to our customers.

Telecommuting is definitely an option.  You're given the tools you need to be able to work anywhere.","There is a lot of legacy systems, legacy tools and legacy methods that are difficult for new-hires to pick up and learn.  It's difficult for a new-hire to be able to significantly contribute within the first few months. 

Documentation is really scattered and difficult to nail down.  Much of the knowledge is tribal knowledge that is handed down from engineer to engineer.

As Akamai has gotten bigger, it feels as if they're starting to nickle & dime where they can.  Yes  cost-cutting measures are expected as you turn into a multi-national corporation, but some decisions really seem to focus on reducing cost, and not really recognizing the consequences of those cost reductions."

Its not a very huge organization, but still each team keeps using tools what they feel comfortable, need some standardization.

Plans to streamline and modernize the web app development / dev ops environment are laudable, yet slow-going. There is a lot of tech debt including applications with poor documentation and without unit tests. Career advancement for software engineers is hard to predict or understand.

1672,Akamai,Well run Internet networking company,2015-11-30,4.0,Senior Technical Writer,"Akamai is the leader in its field of content delivery and moves1/3 of the world's Internet traffic on its servers. It's technologies are often leading edge, and as a general rule the people tend to be smart and easy to get along with. The company is particularly well managed, treats employees well,  and compensates people at an above average level. The overall benefits package is very good. Management is very transparent (this is a public company) in does quarterly meetings telling us how the business is doing.

Excellent work/life balance.","There aren't many downsides to working at Akamai. There is the general challenge of working in Cambridge which can be expensive to commute to and live in. The company does not provide things like free parking or gyms, etc. Currently the company is in multiple sites in Cambridge having outgrown its resources. It is expected to relocate (probably in Cambridge or Boston) in 2017.

As to your particular job and the career track that depends almost entirely on your managers. The company does promote somewhat from within, but doesn't make it an emphasis.

Over the past 4 years the company has nearly tripled in size from 1800 to 6000, and the quality of the people has diminished. People there tend to be happy and have voted the company the 3rd best large company to work for in Massachusetts. I think that the company's ranking is based more on the past than the present, and is a good marketing exercise."
1673,Akamai,Good to give a pass,2015-11-28,2.0,Senior Solutions Architect,"Check other posts about trivial things such as free food, snacks, cabs and stock grants. Family insurance is good as well","This review is related to my experience in teams in India only. Other countries specifically US may vary

1. Overall - The technical teams in India is back office. No product development takes place. CIO team works on stuff that most other companies do. 

2. Work - Job description is absolutely HYPED. Most teams work involves network support or filling up xml from the product. 

3. People - 

a. Mostly average people who know nothing other than http/ dns apart from the akamai products working at a high level, all from training

b. At the same time very arrogant especially the one who are around for more than 3 years and have grown only because the company did well. This includes managers as well as directors

c. You are not allowed to challenge a product working or if you have an idea and it will be shot down within 2 seconds if the person on the other side is not convinced. And you won't be allowed to even try it out (even if you did not ask for time other than your regular tasks)

4. Work - Not challenging at all. More than enough if you work 8 hours a day but in a specific shift. Work is either monitoring with tools or creating a xml. Either is mudane work. In any case you are not be encouraged to do anything beyond prescribed tasks. Be clear that there is no one that designs any products in India. Work from home not allowed either. By the way, managers do not have long term strategic initiatives. Never seen them doing much other than excel reports :)

5. Products - The ones that were designed up until around 2010's is good. However, never had any big product launches lately. This may be because of people attitude as mentioned. New startups in the space recently such as Instart Logic have come up in fairly innovative products.

6. Interviews - Interview questions and process is over exaggerated. You have convince a entire team of people to get hired like it is some kind of great job. On, the other side, I was in the interview panel. It never mattered whether the feedback is a “strong no” or “strong yes”. What matters is whether the candidate is a referral or there is a referral candidate in the pipeline.

7. Compensation - again advertised as the best in the industry. It is at best average. Even startups pay way better with better work

So to sum it up, if you back yourself to be a very good techie and wants to learn new stuff and work with smart humble people on big innovative ideas, this is NOT the place for you."

A matured company behaving like a startup and ending up being neither mature nor a start up.

I was promised a different profile when recruited and was expected to work on entirely different things after I joined. Speaking to manager was of no help . I have had very good feedback of Akamai but maybe it is limited to different departments in this organisation .

* - Incredibly flexible on how I work, and where I work. I go to the office less than 3x times a month, and work from home most of the time!
* - Go-getters, and smart people are appreciated.
* - The technology and the Akamai Platform are incredible, and it develops constantly
* - If you like cool technology and constant evolution, this will be a great place to work!
* - Akamai handles the largest amount of Web Traffic of any entity on the Internet - 15-30%, with peaks of over 30Tbps!
* - Because Akamai are a Premium provider in the market, you'll get to deal with literally the largest companies on the planet. No SME's here!
* - Its great being able to work with the largest organisations in the World, and gather that kind if experience. Its a great confidence builder and looks awesome on my CV!
* - If you're into Media, CDN, or Security, they have plenty of products that are either at the forefront of development, or do not need to hide.
* - You will get a LOT of training! *","* - Depending on which team your work in, the hours can be horrible sometimes
* - The entire company seems to be full of workaholics. So if you don't like this attitude to work/life balance (or lack thereof), you need to think carefully about which role you move into. Its mostly the Sales oriented roles that put in heavy hours. The other departments are usually better.
* - You will get a LOT of training! Yes, and some of it is horrible, mind numbing, and depression inducing.... Unfortunately Akamai over-train their employees at the beginning, so the first 6 months can be gruelling. They call it 'Drinking from the Firehose'. And a lot of the training material is not very good and a waste of time.
* - The amount of emails I have to process is ridiculous! And Akamai *loves* emails!
* - They suffer from Information Chaos. Too much information, in too many places, with lots of it outdated, and with few people maintaining it. This used to be a daily source of frustration for me as a newcomer for about an entire year. Until I learned all the information that wasn't written down, but that was stored int he 'collective brain' of more senior employees.
* - Depending on the department you work for, there can be a LOT of internal calls. 
* - Depending on the department you work for, Salaries are not always at market rates.
* - Because Akamai are a Premium Provider in the markets they operate in, they are also the MOST expensive! This means that we've had to turn away a fair few potential customers, because they simply couldn't afford our solutions. There's a certain level of perceived arrogance that comes with this unfortunately.
* - The Business Units in charge of new product development can sometimes be slow to react to trends in the market. It makes the company less agile than smaller competitors.
* - The benefits are pretty good, with good health insurance, pension and good bonuses."

1753,Akamai,"Almost a year here, and not at all disappointed!",2015-08-06,5.0,Senior User Experience Designer,"This is the best place I've ever worked, bar none. People are dauntingly smart, friendly, and helpful, the work is challenging but interesting, the benefits are very good, and the pace - while certainly subject to the occasional flurry of long hours - is remarkably life- and family-friendly. I'm sure that some of this has to do with the ability to work remotely as needed, and I imagine all of this is variable by the team, but I've met mostly really happy and satisfied people here.

While there are politics and tsuris everywhere, I've seen far less of what feels like some of the ugly back-stabbing and political maneuvering here than at many places I've worked. Senior management seems as open and communicative as anywhere I've ever been, and Tom Leighton is a wonderful face and voice of leadership for the organization (with some pretty stylin' dance moves, too).

Most importantly - and I can only say this about my own team and manager, but I gather that it is true in many parts of the company - I feel supported in all of my efforts; that my manager is interested not only in getting the best work out of her team, but that we are happy, satisfied in our work, not overburdened, and with a clear direction in which to head to keep our careers moving forward.","This is a very complex and highly technical space to be in, and if you come in with no domain knowledge, there will be some serious ramp up and learning you need to do. Fortunately, the company is great about training and giving you the room and resources to bring yourself up to speed. 

One challenge is that, while there are many, many resources for improving your understanding of the space and the Akamai ecosystem, FINDING those resources can be tricky, and sometimes what you find is out of date. Getting accurate information from the right people can sometimes be a challenge.

Also, while the company is very committed to UX, getting access to actual customers on a UX basis is not something ingrained in the fabric here yet, and it can be tricky. There is also not yet a good communication structure between UX teams, so there is a lot of overlap, unanswered questions, and asking forgiveness rather than permission.

Finally, if you start after a certain point in the year, you end up being not eligible for a bonus when the time rolls around (I started a week after that cutoff, it turned out). It would be far better if they prorated the bonus structure for the part of the year in which you were with the company, rather than just cut you loose. It would at least have been nice to have been told this during recruitment to set my expectations properly, since bonuses were touted as a pretty big part of the benefit structure."

1781,Akamai,Simply one of the best...,2015-07-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a serial entrepreneur, I was skeptical of joining a large web services company. Surely, I thought, they couldn't feel like a startup, or innovate as well. Boy was I wrong. Akamai is simply amazing. This is one of the only places you will ever work where the CEO on down will understand the most complex ideas you have...not just as business people, but as scientists. Sure, Akamai is a bit 'tougher' than places like Google that give free lunch, but at the same time, you won't find the kind of innovative grit Akamai has either. This is a Fortune 500 company that has a healthy chip on its shoulder, and doesn't believe its own success. Cautious, smart, and immensely supportive...I have encountered nothing but extraordinary people. It has been a joy to work here!","Some of the remote offices over-compensate, and try to inject themselves into projects they aren't involved in for the glory. The Israel office in particular seems to suffer from this."
1782,Akamai,Horrible - Clique(s) of Crooks Run the India Offices,2015-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Free food.
- Well stocked Pantry.

That sums up the benefits/pros.","- Hazing ritual for new hires, especially in the emerging customer group business support teams. Curb the humiliating tactics used to haze the new hires. Many have complained to HR, but it was buried as always.
- Politics, Politics and more Politics.
- Sexual Harassment, Sexual Harassment and more Sexual Harassment - the internal committee's setup to investigate make a mockery out of it. Most of the lead generation/marketing teams are filled with freshers who are taken to bed and then exploited over long periods under threat of termination due to lack of performance with respect to numbers. Its an open secret.
- The Bangalore office is run by a dozen clique's. If you can spend on booze, free dinners and have a penchant for a stinky brown nose, you're able to get into any one of them and your career in the company is set for life. If you're not, then be ready to let go of any dignity, self-respect and decency, along with any ambitions for growth at the time of this realization.
- Whistleblowers are threatened with sexual harassment cases, termination and other dire consequences by managers. HR Team is incompetent and useless. All they do is pay and buy up awards like ""Best Employer/Best Places to Work For"".
- Despite the fact that the Bangalore office is one of the largest outside of the US, this office is a cess pool. It is filled with folks who misuse/abuse their managerial powers to intimidate/threaten employees in their team. These folks have no qualifications to speak of and mostly come from BPO backgrounds. They stick on here for they know they cannot survive outside. Frogs in a Pond.
-I was here for 4 years and could not find even a handful of sincere and approachable managerial/director level execs who I would want to work with/for. Save for one or two, all of them are crooks.
- Do not even think of joining any of the nigh-shift teams. You will experience all of the above and worse."

2. No Documentation at all - zero documentation of all codes and specifications. Will be a great problem for new joiners and hence few people leave. 
3. There are teams like customer care and services , who are not at all valued and they are considered as the targets for all. So not a good team to join. But these teams are having skilled people and management will not respect.
4. As told in other reviews,  all legacy fashion codes and there are people with 10+ years of experience in same position. This will not help in bringing new ideas and only old methodologies are carried out.

While the CDN business is growing, the company doesn't have the will to grow. Discussions on any new processes are thrown because ""we have been doing this way for x number of years"".

Another of the themes has been the difficult interview process. Everyone will talk about how difficult the process was and how you are the cream of the crop. Most of these people are extremely bookish knowledge about how to go about implementing technology. Most of the discussions will be without real life experience. As another reviewer put it if they find you to be good, they will move into rooms to avoid discussing things in front of you.

The last theme has been of people more interested in pushing their agendas. This can range from:
a. pushing their own product - Couple of products funded at the VC stage by VP and CIO are being implemented, even though they are not the best tools available. 
b. people more interested in showing themselves off - VPs and onsite counterparts will constantly snub you for giving advice on the very things you were hired for."

Akamai promoted the position I applied for before they even sent me a job offer, based on my experience and education.

1940,Akamai,More Like a Confederation of Many Smaller Companies Than a $1 Billion+ Internet Giant,2014-03-04,4.0,Principal Software Engineer,"The company is loaded with smart people. It's challenging and exciting to work in an environment where the *internship* candidates are working on their second Ph.D.'s!

Working at Akamai sometimes feels like working ""backstage at The Internet,"" as we watch terabytes of data fly around the world. (Marketing claims that we ""deliver 30% of the content on the Internet"" are conveniently impossible to verify or refute.)

My view of the company is shaped by the group I work with - largely a set of dedicated, knowledgeable people with deep domain expertise and a willingness to share whatever they can in terms of time, knowledge, and tips. I work in the Cambridge office.","The company is saturated with antiquated, overlapping and competing systems (how many bug tracking / project management systems do we have? I lost count at five!).

Efforts are duplicated across the company.

This year, in announcing our *first* ever recognition of International Women's Day, our founder and CEO said ""There's an International Women's Day! Who knew?!"" That tells you everything you need to know about the company's dismal track record when it comes to addressing gender imbalances at the engineering, management, and director levels.

I've met maybe four female software engineers in my 7+ years at Akamai (but it's OK, 2/3 of the accounting and human resources staff are women - just not the department heads). I've encountered one black male software engineer - I hear there may be a few more out there. (But nearly every security guard and mailroom employee and maintenance worker is a person of color, so it's cool, right?). FOUR of the 48 people in executive leadership roles are nonwhite - four men, all of them of South Asian descent. FOUR of the 48 people in executive leadership roles are women, all of them white.

Beyond the complete lack of diversity among the employees, the company seems to be innovating chiefly through marketing rather than investing in real research and development. Some teams do devote resources to thinking ahead, but this is not a coordinated, company-wide effort. Attempts at major process improvements are inevitably stymied by stubborn and/or backward-looking managers."
1941,Akamai,Lost its greatness?,2014-03-02,2.0,Engineer,Used to have very competitive and smart people.,"Unfortunately almost all the smart folks have left for better opportunities.

There are many departments and an employee can develop their skills by switching groups although it might not be very easy.

The education assistance program is a great tool to further develop ones skills.","The company has a policy of not sponsoring green cards until the last 1-2 years of H1B, despite promising otherwise during hiring. Those who are on H1B, DO think twice about this. This is not just in one department, it's a company wide issue. The management will use this policy as an excuse, which gives an impression that upper management don't value the employees while unnecessarily create uncertainty and frustration for the employees.

There management structure is convoluted with many tiers of mid-level managers and the messages are many times lost along the way. With that, there are also a lot of politics going on which can be frustrating.

Career advancement is not uniform across the many groups of the same department, it VERY much depends on the manager. Perhaps this is true everywhere, but a checklist of skills and contributions would help.

The company is starting to nickel and dime by reducing personal workspace in the new offices, doing away with free sodas and weekly lunch."

- No documentation anywhere.
- Lack of focus. It's common for projects to be pushed back, and some get ignored completely.
- Most of the challenges Akamai faces now are business challenges: how to manage sustainable growth, which smaller companies to acquire, and so on. There aren't as many genuinely technical challenges as there are at other companies.
- The people there are in it for the stock, not because of the engineering challenges.

If you can cope with chaos and survive in an environment where every little piece of domain knowledge is something that you will have to dig out of the cold, hard frozen ground, you can be happy here. It is possible to learn a lot of new skills, depending on your situation. 

I personally feel that I have grown by leaps and bounds in terms of my software automation knowledge even though my projects are constantly cancelled at the whims of capricious management decisions from people who never even talk to me personally or even look at the work I have done. Despite this, I feel confident in calling myself a Selenium expert after just 14 months of working here and I started with no Selenium experience whatsoever. I also have grown in my Java skills by leaps and bounds. I have gained valuable, solid OO development experience as an automation developer that I have not been able to get anywhere else.","The company relies too much on antiquated tools and technologies and WAAAAAY too much on homegrown tools when there are more modern, better designed, often open-source options out there. There is no consistent tool chain in place for basic things like: bug tracking, source code management, build management, project management, test case management and release management. 

The SQA process here is nothing like the industry standard best practices that you would find in another company of this size. In fact, I don't think that management really even understands what SQA is or should be. Requirements development and documentation is a joke. Requirements are often not clearly documented anywhere nor is there any standard process for formulating them and communicating them to development teams and testing teams. Trying to find out how to do basic things is a nightmare. Lots of people will tell you, 'It's on the wiki.' The 'wiki' is a rat's nest of outdated, half-written broken pages where there is occasionally a nugget of useful information, but you will be forced to take a long and frustrating journey through nuggets of incorrect information before you find it.

Don't get me started on the test environment systems. Okay, do get me started. Test environments are a mess. People are forced to share a few systems where there is incomplete oversight regarding what is or is not actually installed on them. It is not unusual for people to step all over each others' toes trying to test out something because of the lack of communication between various parties using the systems. The architectural limitations that are baked into the products makes the challenge of spinning up a cleanly separated test system for anyone who needs one impossible and there seems to be no impetus to fix it even though countless hours of productivity go down the drain because we don't have this ability.

There is a consensus that there is something 'broken' about the SDLC process and the tool chain, but effecting change for the better seems almost impossible because it doesn't appear that anyone with any authority to make change happen even understands what the problem is or how to hire people who can figure it out. People who try run into a wall of politics that would make the Great Wall of China look like a pile of paper mache after a monsoon. 

This company operates as if each separate team were a start-up company where people are just free to do whatever they want. There is a culture that is openly and actively hostile to the idea of submitting to standards and practices they didn't pick themselves. To be fair, it is not uncommon that someone trying to impose a 'standard' is trying to make people do something stupid and ineffective because they don't have the technical understanding that is necessary to pick a good one. So, even though we need some standards rather than our current cowboy wild west way of doing things, there is a history here that justifies hostility and suspicion regarding anyone who tries to impose one. With the eagerness of a small child on Christmas Eve, I await the day that the right set of people with the right personalities and skills are able to surmount this situation."

- too little time to write actual code (unless you are too brilliant and can code up something very quickly)
- Architect does things on his own terms and overrides tech lead and manager; often times tech lead and manager are as clueless as the new hire. Poor mentoring.
- Terrible for entry level engineer
- Too many things to know before feeling productive - whole lot of complexity in products 
- Immigration process is slow for entry level folks (F-1 students moving to H-1B -- take care; clarify about green card immigration process during interview.)
- Upward mobility not so good, takes 4-5 years to get promoted (since there are only 3 levels for software engineers) no matter how hard you worked; till then keep growing linearly in terms of compensation. 
- Lot of old guard - people store company knowledge in their heads, not sufficient documentation, you can get tired of going and asking for every small thing (even after spending 2 years in the company) -- this should be resolved by better training for new hires.
- Old legacy systems in place -- need to use more open source.
- Not as competitive in compensation and perks as other top silicon valley companies. 
- Conservative east coast management - stingy in spending. 
- record profits, record quarters -- but still cut down on perks and bonuses to employees who are main assets.
- projects are under-staffed. very painful at times even when the shortage of staff affects critical release cycles by a big margin. they do not want to spend!

I would look at better places in silicon valley to work for if you are a new or a recent grad."

Non-toxic work environment.,"Luddites rule the roost at Akamai - the thinking(often times of architects and engineering leaders) is stuck in the 80's and 90's, stubborn and insular. Being one of the earliest movers in what we now think of as the ""enterprise cloud""-space, they have let so many opportunities slip by and ceded ground(and are still doing so) to a plethora of ""cloud"" companies who did not have that advantage. There is no vision or technical leadership to even bridge this gap, let alone break out of this cycle of building and maintaining aging, fragile and inflexible technologies & infrastructure. A lot of time is spent on reinventing the wheel with little to no benefits. I can honestly say that my time at this company was the least productive and that it did not let me grow as an engineer - in fact I feel I regressed quite a bit, being stuck in a very dysfunctional engineering culture. Final observation: I have written and submitted college assignments with more rigor and quality than some of the code that gets shipped out to production at Akamai."

They bend forward and take every requirement from Product team and turn them into a CR (change request, just like a bug) without even considering the overall impact to the system and pushing back when necessary. I guess that the manager's performance is evaluated by the no. of CRs they close. That's why they want to open/close as many as possible.

There is hardly any chance for advancement. Unless you're one of the boss's pets, you're pretty much stuck in the same position for many years until either your boss moves up or you can't take it and get moving yourself.

2083,Akamai,Good Company and work environment. Hectic Work & Tedious Hours,2012-06-12,4.0,Customer Solutions Engineer,"- Good Company
- Less Politics
- Helpful and fun-loving peers
- Good perks like food, internet allowance and health benefits","- Tedious and unhealthy hours for India. As the work is in US hours.
- More spiff, benefits and pay for Sales folks. Technical talent feels neglected.
- High work load and stress on performance
- Too much stress on positive Customer Surveys
- Screwed up work-life balance.
- Very few (hardly any) on-site opportunities"
2084,Akamai,A great place to work.,2012-06-08,4.0,Systems Software Engineer,"I joined Akamai straight out of college in their streaming team. My interests are networks and systems, and at Akamai I got to work on Streaming protocols and systems. Akamai is a brilliant company technologically and therefore, a heaven for those who love technology, networks in particular.

One of the things that I appreciate as a developer here is the amount of time it takes to the code to hit production is very small. The fact that my code is sitting in production and impacting people is gratifying.","Akamai systems are interdependent and therefore, if one really wants to start making technical contributions, it involves understand a lot of components. I remember when I started, I took at least 2 months to get the hang of a lot of things."
2085,Akamai,Interview,2012-06-08,3.0,,Good place to work at,Located very far and remote
2086,Akamai,A good place to work at,2012-06-05,3.0,Software Engineer,"The salary, increments and perks on offer are pretty awesome.
Exposure to new technologies is an added advantage.","The amount of flexibility required is very high, not everybody can be available in odd hours"
2087,Akamai,Great Place to Work,2012-06-02,4.0,Product Manager,"Lots of learning. Niche technology. Leaders in the CDN space. Great perks and know how to pamper their employees. IF you are ready to bend your back, there are numerous opportunities available.",Management in India has almost no say in decisions. US culture very evident which can make or break your career. Need to really slog it out if you need to keep your job. Training new employees and guiding them in adapting to the work culture will help in retaining potential high performers.
2088,Akamai,Great experience,2012-06-01,4.0,Senior Applications Developer,"- Employees take us much off as needed, no defined number
- Very flexible work environment with great management",- Size of company can complicate communication
2089,Akamai,I've had one of the best experiences compared to the other organisations I have worked for.,2012-05-12,5.0,Account Services Manager,A Product based company with a Start-up like attitude giving employees the importance they deserve. They only choose the best when they recruit people for the Job.,If you are not comfortable taking up responsibilities and getting the job done without any supervision. I wouldn't recommend this place for you.
2090,Akamai,good,2012-05-07,4.0,SQA Engineer,a lot of growth can happen,lot of competition in this sector
2091,Akamai,"Good company for starters and Sales folks, but it is NOT a true Technology company. It is another BPO organization.",2012-04-29,3.0,,"1. Open Culture
2. Excellent salary for sales folks.(possibly more than industry standards)
3. Growing company, in customer facing activities though.
4. Very relevant product  & solutions for Internet market.
5. A few of India management  members are excellent leaders like those in Engineering, ECG, India Finance & Network operations.
6. Good Company for those candidates who belong to customer facing functions.","1. Highly political & bureaucratic environment.
2. Very less opportunities & autonomy for R&D & Product development teams.
3. Some of India Management  team are really mediocre ( they lack solid functional & management knowledge) except those mentioned above. There is no single thought leader who can change the face of Company from customer servicing organization to a true technology organization in India.
4. Local HR leadership & its team is highly incompetent and do not have any leader whom we can look upto. They work like just ‘postman  in recruitment process’ by emailing CV’s, no depth in their functional knowledge. Quality of business partnering in HR is always questioned.
5. No real career progression road map in the company. 
6. While hiring quality has dramatically reduced over the past 2-3 years (just meeting targets of quantity of hiring),  company could not retain quality employees too.
7. You need to hobnob with top management team to grow.
8. Possibly, a higher 'attrition' than industry standards, which might be for lack of proper career progression system and competitive salary across the company."
2092,Akamai,"Challenging and at times frustrating, but overall, a good experience.",2012-04-07,4.0,,"The people - So many people have been working there for years and years and years.  You just don't find that too much anymore.  They stay because they love it, and it's good to work with happy people.
The flexibility to work where you want when you want.
The industry - These guys have something great and they know it. There is nowhere for the company to go but up.
Senior Managment is awesome.  They know their stuff.","Many middle managers don't share the same qualities as senior management.
A bit of an ""in crowd"" mentality type culture.
The hours can be tough at times, but they are getting better about it.
The culture is moving from start-up to big company.  It can be a bit corporate at times, but if you don't mind that, it won't be a big issue for you.
Not really a place with set career paths - you have to fight your way up and through."
2093,Akamai,Run by suits who were born on third base and thought they hit a home run.,2012-03-15,1.0,Solutions Engineer,Compensation is adequate. Name recognition is pretty solid in the industry. The knowledge you gain by working and being trained at Akamai is somewhat unique and carries well elsewhere.,"The very tragic truth of Akamai is that they lost their ""Steve Jobs"" or ""Jeff Bezos"" in the terrorist attacks of 9/11. His name was Danny Lewin and he was the true visionary and heart behind the company. The other co-founder, Tom Leighton, is just a really smart guy (former professor at MIT) who is now only a figurehead. 

Running the company now is a cadre of moderately-effective suits who have some managerial skill, but wouldn't know innovation and leadership if it bit them in the ass. The core technology developed and commercialized by Lewin and Leighton (et al) in the late 90s was/is strong and solves very real problems inherent in the way the Internet was built. The thing is, you could have put a chimpanzee in charge of Akamai with that technology and he'd look like a genius a few years later. There was almost no way to fail. 

And this is where the main cultural problem with Akamai lies: The guys who were given the golden goose think they are badasses when, in reality, they're just average joes.The upper management of the sales structure is a boys' club of undeserving millionaires inwardly insecure about their abilities and therefore manipulative and highly political. Sagan's internal communication always seemed dismissive and even sarcastic, as if talking to the rank-and-file were a chore. 

This culture has trickled down to the bottom and now infects the whole company. Kiss ass and tear others down for a few years? Great, you get a promotion! Work hard and be loyal? Don't kid yourself. Nobody at Akamai cares. 

You see, Akamai has reached the top of its growth curve and is now faced with a double-whammy. (1) The CDN marketplace is becoming more and more commodotized. Telling customers you can provide the 8th ""nine"" of performance when competitors are at 1/4 of the price is not a winning strategy. And developing ticky-tack add-on products to pad the bottom line will only get you so far. (2) They seem incapable of pivoting into a new growth area. How did that foray into advertising work out? Ooooh, well what about the acquisition of Velocitude? Yikes. 

Why should you believe me? You don't have to. They hired a new president in late 2010 and he left after a year. There are no obvious lights at the end of Akamai's tunnel and he knew it.

Why does this matter to you, the prospective applicant? Because you'll probably be coming in at the bottom of the ladder and there is NO MOVEMENT anymore. Without growth, there will be no one coming in underneath you and since the promotion opportunities are based on time served, you'll be last in line. If you want a good paycheck, join Akamai. If you want career growth, look elsewhere."
2094,Akamai,"Amazing, Amazing, Company",2012-03-06,5.0,,Work with a group of smart people,SOmetimes the company strategy seems to be to inward looking
2095,Akamai,"Cool technology, smart people, but a real 'in-crowd' mentality and lack of transparency from management.",2012-03-05,3.0,Technical Project Manager,"Cool technology
Smart people
Collaborative atmosphere
Good renumeration","Lack of transparency about what's going on and why
Provincial mentality - very US-focused
Technology may suffer 'innovator's dilemma 
Greedy!"
2096,Akamai,it was good,2012-02-23,4.0,Sales Engineer,good technology and good services,its a total bureaucracy and needs to run like a smaller startup
2097,Akamai,It is enchanting and thrilling at Akamai.,2012-02-15,4.0,Systems Software Engineer,Akamai is pretty flexible in the sense it allows professional and private life to exist in their own ways. Work is cool here and there is a good pool of talented people working in tandem.,"Branding is not done properly. Even though we are a B2B company, but still brand name of the company especially in INDIA must be done.Campus hiring from top engineering like IITs, NITs, BITS etc colleges is the best way Akamai can achieve i believe."
2098,Akamai,Great place to work.. but..,2012-02-10,5.0,,"1. Great place to work. Very relevant product and technology.
2. The Senior Management is efficient. Some real humble and honest guys (The CEO/Founder are fine examples).
3. Good compensation and incentives (Foe sales). Best when compared to others in the market. 
4. The benefits are decent and in comparison to other companies in Bangalore they are great. 
5. You can operate independently (in sales) just by updating you manager. Not much of micro management which is good. 
6. Flexi-hours  which is great. 
7. Facilities are great when compared to a lot of other companies out there. 
8. Stable company (great technology).","1. Hard working, silent and dedicated individuals will remain wherever they are. Chances of moving to the next level is slim. 
2. India Management is mediocre (not the best) and hence the company not really reaching its full potential.
3. Local HR team is incompetent and hence you don't have the best of the best locally. Difficult to find people you can look up to. 
4. No real career progression road map for sales folks. You may get a salary and role change but will continue to do the same thing again. No real learning. 
5. You need to hob nob with the top guys to really progress in your career, so folks who silently go about doing the jobs have no chance to progress.
6. Managers are selfish. They only take issues up if they get directly and indirectly affected. They lack empathy. 
7. Unable to retain and nurture good/quality employees.
8. The internal job postings are a farce. The candidate is already selected before the IJP is rolled out and the others are made to undergo the entire process and end up being disappointed in-spite of doing well in their interviews.
9. You need to have influence to progress anywhere. If you are not known to the top guys you have no chance to progress."
2099,Akamai,"Good overall, but independent-development structure can mean uneven quality in experience.",2011-12-30,4.0,,"Generally good people who care about the work, which is cutting edge for internet. Opportunity to advance and learn if you want it. Innovation  is valued.","Company is in transition now from being a startup in early 1998 to operating more on the big business standard model now. That can be a difficult transition if you value the sort of meritocracy and individual initiative that you have in startup situations. More departmentalization and compartmentalization, less whole view big effort."
