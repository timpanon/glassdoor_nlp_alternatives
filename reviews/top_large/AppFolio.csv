- Used to have an incredible culture. Still have strong social connections because of this  
- Very easy (almost mindless) work
- Santa Barbara office is beautiful","- Culture has completely crumbled post-COVID 19. Appfolio can’t figure out what it wants to be, and it is bleeding talent as a result  
- Employees are disengaged and uninterested in the work 
- Compensation is extremely low, particularly in equity
- Brain drain. The most talented people are all leaving or have left 
- Managers and leaders don’t seem to accomplish much 
- Highly political 
- Management seems like an “old boys club” at this point.  The new talent they’re bringing in / promoting for senior management roles is more of the same"

9,AppFolio,Room for Improvement,2022-03-27,3.0,Business Development Representative,"Team culture is real at AppFolio. 

Lots of autonomy within the BDR position.

Many tools at your disposal to succeed.","BDRs and Sales are now required to be in the office multiple times each week, despite the fact that the bulk of the company’s departments are allowed to stay remote

Unusually low quota attainment on the team - therefore OTE is not accurate for the majority of team members.

If the OTE was accurate, though, the pay would still be very low for SaaS - especially considering AppFolio is headquartered in such a HCOL area.

Lack of momentum with career progression - it does happen, but much slower than at other SaaS companies."

The people here really love it!","It is a hard place to grow a career salary-wise. The company takes the approach of finding entry level positions and moving you up from there. Beware, this approach often does not reward more responsibility or even promotional status with monetary salary increases. While it is a great place to get in the door for tech, watch out for complacency when it comes to salary."

28,AppFolio,No Longer Drinking the Cool Aid,2022-02-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I used to think AppFolio was the best place to work ever. Very positive culture and during the rapid growth phase there were opportunities to move up. I grew my career here and learned a lot. I met a lot of nice people who I still keep in touch with and consider friends. Very stable environment, even during startup phase there wasn’t a ton of swirl.

401k match

Great WLB, you’re not often working past 5","Another review on blind said it best that AppFolio is a big fish in a small pond. It’s great because it’s in Santa Barbara where there aren’t a lot of options. They get away with low pay by hiring fresh out of college kids who don’t know better (myself included) and indoctrinate them into a culture based on loyalty to the company. I was a longtime employee and absolutely shocked to learn what market pay was when I left. 

Really cliquey culture, either you’re in and all your friends work there or you’re on the outs. I had bad experience with other managers trying to make me drink to “haze” me after getting promoted. There is a lot of playing favorites. 

Long time leadership who had a place in early startup kept in place even after creating negative environments. I had some terrible experiences with male leadership absolutely gaslighting. I had heard about them exhibiting this behavior and ruining other employees careers and feared for my own. This took a severe toll on my mental health. It doesn’t seem right to have to go to therapy over the way you’re treated at work. 

There is an “AppFolio” way of doing things and dissenting voices are discouraged. 

New leadership are a lot of white males, DEI is a joke. Company is in a place of transition with lots of longtime employees leaving. 

Stingey with equity for most employees."

48,AppFolio,Solid Culture,2022-01-25,5.0,Product Manager,"Modern Agile and ""Spotify model"" development teams and processes really excel here. Hiring consistently brings in good people so it's hard to find a so-so co-worker.","Culture is excellent, but the time devoted to zoom gatherings for celebrations could be re-thought to optimize people's time."
49,AppFolio,Toxic Positivity is the Culture,2022-01-21,2.0,Website Production Specialist,"- Potentially a good place to start a career or get into the tech space from other industries. 
- There are some fantastic people in the company (but beware the fake niceness).
- Have been COVID safe and following protocols (ie. fully remote) up until end of 2021 when I left.","It's hard to know where to start with this nearly 3 year experience. Now with some time and distance, the best way to start is to say that I had a sticky note on my computer that said, ""Shut Up, They don't care what you have to say. The culture IS toxic positivity."" 

Your day to day experience at this company is 100% based on your management. If you have a great manager you can go months without seeing the worst of the company. If on the other hand you have someone who is not good your life will be filled with micromanagement, passive aggressive feedback and microaggressions. Even when you have a great and caring manager like I did, they can only do so much and ultimately if you advocate for yourself too much or have a good sense of foresight/constructive criticism you will feel repercussions. You cannot speak your mind openly here. 

This company does NOT want to be fully remote. If they could they would force everyone back into the office at the drop of a hat. When I started pre-pandemic we were told ""remote isn't possible at AppFolio"". Of course in March 2020 we successfully transitioned in a day, but thats beside the point. So if you see a job posting that says ""remote"" take that with a grain of salt for now as up until just a few months ago (before Delta) they were trying to persuade everyone to come back to the office with ""everything is great in-office"" propaganda in every meeting. Once the pandemic is over I suspect they will have hired enough remote employees (outside of office locations) they will have to let them remain that way - but be aware.

Now onto career and compensation. When I started I was told that it was typical for someone in my role to move on either within the company or to another job in about 2 years. This was normal. I was also told that moving positions (associate, specialist, senior, etc...) was based on a timeline and hitting established metrics. In my case I started as a Specialist at what I considered a solid pay rate (50k) but low for my experience. I was told that I should be senior by my 2 year mark. Well what do you know. The goalposts were moved multiple times over. I was given markers of what I needed to do and I would do those things in just a few months, give proof and then once again the metrics changed. Also they loved to give qualitative feedback. Stuff that had no metrics to measure performance. Stuff to keep you stuck because there is no easy way to prove success. This happened 3 times. I ended up giving up and finding a much better job instead. Pro tip: If I were hired today I would check to make sure they are offering better pay rates than those hired a few years ago (I did notice that the pay ranges for roles went down in the time I worked there to a lower starting salary rate).

If you’re in a customer facing role like I was expect to be devalued, overworked, encouraged to work unpaid overtime (not explicitly) and probably offered a lower pay rate than what you can find elsewhere (especially with the growth of remote work - go out of state if needed). I also started with the false impression that I could grow a career here and be respected for the work I do. It turns out AppFolio would prefer for you to show up and shut up. To burn through low paid new college grads (the young/desperate/naieve) rather then help move current employees up in the company (whether through raises or promotions or moves to different departments). Don’t expect a raise of more than 5% (I got 3% this past year which is less than inflation). They don’t do cost of living increases either, despite having their main office in an incredibly HCOL area.

Sorry for the long winded review. I can give much more feedback but I will stop here. All I can say is that I did not realize how bad it was until I started working at a company where I can truly be myself without fear of retribution, speak my mind, have boundaries, have my life circumstances considered (we’re not drones - we’re human) and be respected by my team AND clients. It’s a wonderful thing.

Side note: Take the numerous good reviews on this platform with a grain of salt. At least once per year (before the “best companies to work for” awards happen) they encourage all employees to fill out a Glassdoor review in order to “attract more good people”. I personally never filled it out. It felt dishonest. But I know many others who just quickly gave it 5 stars with no feedback - especially if they are new."

Nice offices, free coffee bar.","Over worked - they tend to load way too much on people. When I worked there, I had a very, very difficult time balancing work life balance. Meaning I did not have a personal life, only at work life. That was the main reason I chose to leave. After I left, I had a few people there reach out to me who expressed the same challenge and were considering leaving too for that reason.

It’s also hit a passive aggressive culture of feedback. They will smile upfront, but then slam you pretty click with aggressive feedback. The result is you never quite know where you stand.

Finally, A very weak mission “become a 1 billion dollar company”… that doesn’t speak to a lot of people.l, definitely not me."

Nice offices","They expect you to learn the software inside and out essentially within a month before working with clients? Then fill your job role within 3 months, expecting you to know years of R&D  of this software within months.  If you have zero to minimal experience with accounting, real estate, or tech in general good luck surviving. Once you pass onboarding you’re essentially the work horses of the position. Overloaded with cases, and clients.  Doesn’t matter how hard you try, even with probationary status, they will fire you or force you to leave if you aren’t meeting standards, even for this industry, is off.  Doesn’t matter if you try hard at all, they will find a replacement asap. In my opinion the company is expanding too fast and expects the employees to understand and prepare for any and all scenarios working with clients. If the clients go through onboarding, then it would be successful and there’s would be no need to have customer care reps.  Long wait times. Overall if they want to keep employees, make them feel wanted. Not like they are replaceable which clearly happens"

-The company structure seemed geared for very extroverted people (the open floor layout, the management style, the forced group activities, etc.). Not a deal breaker, but you might be using a ton of energy just existing in their environment as an introvert. **This was pre-Covid.

• Lots of opportunities to learn and to grow your career
• AppFolians are proud to work at AppFolio - and show it every day!","As AppFolio grows, the company continues to evolve to ensure teams are well-equipped to be creative and successful.

The collaboration across the company leads to creative solutions and ideas that make this space and energizing and exciting place to be apart of.,"This isn't much to complain about since we are in a pandemic but one of the more challenging things about working for AppFolio as an internally-focused and facilities based employee is the decrease of work, projects, and responsibility during this hybrid work situation.

124,AppFolio,STAY AWAY FROM CUSTOMER CARE,2021-08-09,2.0,Customer Care Representative,I love my coworkers and the people. Truly the best people I have met. Challenging position where you learn every day.,Where do I start. Was hired when the position was named CSM. Brought on with the idea that you would be handling a queue of 12-20 cases. Little did we know it would be MONTHS of 100+ cases everyday. We deal with daily disrespect and abuse from clients with managers refusing to talk to these clients to give them the correct expectations. This has been the most challenging job I have ever had with the LEAST pay I have ever had. For a almost billion dollar company you would like you could afford to pay your front of the line customer care team more than $22/hr. This is absolutely not an entry level job. Clients and management expect you to be able to solve complete accounting problems with no accounting degree. for the amount and type of work we do we should be getting much higher pay. You are promised mobility within the company but when you find a position you want to apply to it is almost impossible to apply. Have never been in a company where applying to other departments was frowned upon/looked down on. More than 50 % of the team quit within 5 months. So much potential but goes to show how much we are valued.
125,AppFolio,"Good people, but stressful",2021-08-09,5.0,Underwriter,"Great company, they get a good reputation for a reason. Good people. All around great experience working here.

Short commute from my home to the office.","Training was sub par when compared to others training programs that I have had. It consisted of Long dull power points, knowledgeable but dull presenters and Homework and test! Maybe it was because of the pandemic? Please realize that not everyone learns in the same way or same pace. The classes were too long and the onboarding task were frustrating because they were often times over items not covered during the presentations.

Seriously lucky to work alongside any of the awesome, genuine people at this company. Makes coming to work really enjoyable.

- Autonomy: Probably depends on the role and team, but I experienced some great autonomy in the work I did; ability to really take on full ownership of projects from start to finish.

- New office in SB, which will probably be pretty sweet!","- Compensation : Salary is pretty sub par (for analytics at least). Nowhere near top of industry. And benefits seemed nearly non-existent outside of base salary.

- Analytics Investment : So few analysts for so many stakeholders, leading to a real lack of work/life balance.

159,AppFolio,Great Company if you're not in the Customer Success Department,2021-05-02,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"Benefits were really good, specifically healthcare benefits. The dress code was casual, which was nice. When in office, the free snacks and drinks were a great perk.

If you don't like being hand-held and work well under stress and autonomously, then the work environment at AppFolio would work for you.

If you're just out of college, looking for experience, this job isn't a bad stepping stone; however, it is a combination of an IT Help Desk/Call Center job than actual Account Management position. If you go into it with that expectation, then you at least won't be terribly disappointed.","The Customer Success (CS) department got the short end of the stick constantly. There was definitely the typical, ""sales people over-promise features or outright don't know the product so they promise customers features that won't ever exist to get clients to sign"" situation. Then those in the Customer Success department had to deal with the fall-out, which was usually an upset client. 

Favoritism wasn't blatantly obvious, but it existed. It could also be cliquey at times - both with management and within the CS teams. Management also made a lot of promises by dangling the carrot of a raise or promotion if you did X, Y, and Z, with no follow-through. The asks would get incredulous and when/if you meet the metrics, nothing would happen (majority of the time).

I personally overheard a client use racial slurs and profanity with a teammate and we were told by management the client would have to ""threaten our lives"" in order to drop them as a client. This client was the definition of a bully and we were expected to continue working with her, despite the abuse (granted, not all clients were like this, but that was a truly appalling situation).

When working in the Dallas office (pre-quarantine), we were also outright asked to input five-star reviews by management because former employees were inputting bad reviews.

By the time I quit, I was one of a handful of people who had actually worked there longer than a year. Turnover was frequent, so many of the people on the phones/assisting customers had very green/little product knowledge. More senior team members were expected to help them and mentor them, all while hitting pretty outrageous metrics in the same breath. (Isn't that something a manager should have been doing)?

Work/life balance was talked about; however, in CS that didn't exist if you wanted to keep your job and meet your daily/weekly metrics. Many people (including myself) didn't take actual lunch breaks in order to meet said metrics. At the time, those included a specific number of phone calls per day/week/month, a certain number of cases closed, specific number of emails/communication sent, etc."

A very relaxed work environment, which has its pros, but also has many cons.","They are expanding teams that do not necessarily need expanding in order to look like a rapidly growing company. They will hire anyone, which leads to a few people doing all the work on large teams. 
When in office, it was easier to hold employees accountable, and you could rely on people to at least be available for questions since you could just walk over and ask them. When everyone started working from home, you could really see who was just there for the paycheck. Lots of the people on your team would be unreachable all day, so you would be stuck waiting on them to get around to logging back on in order to complete your own work. 
There is very little accountability, as managers are too scared to step on toes - they all want to be the 'fun' manager, so they all are. 
There is also lots of politicking if you want to move up. Promotions are not based on merit, but they are based on who the managers like the most, so you will likely be passed up for promotions a few times unless you play the game."

There are a lot of smart people working here, which makes my job much more enjoyable. I've also seen AppFolio be very inclusive and diverse, and they are actively making an effort to continue to improve in these areas. There are tons of examples where the company is being transparent within the realistic bounds of being publicly traded. Jason, the CEO is accessible and open to learn about how we as a company can improve, and to share his perspective with any employee. We seem to have clear direction and it feels like success is inevitable.","Property Management is not a 'sexy' industry, so the problems we're solving can feel a little bit muted, however, the scale with which we're solving them is impressive. It's a young company, it feels like 60-70% are <2 years removed from college, so there are natural experience gaps but it's made up for by the hustle and intelligence of the type of person we hire. Just like any company, there are politics, and the recent influx of middle managers is making growth seem a little more challenging, but the opportunities are there if you know how to navigate the organization. Stock grants aren't that great given the success and size of the company, and salaries are lower than the industry averages if you believe what Glassdoor and other sites tell you about market rates. I'd give the company/HR benefits a B-, tons of room to improve there but not shabby at the same time."

Recruiters tend to be people who couldn't make it in sales - this company is no different. Don't fall for it.

The reason why many employees leave the company or find a different department to move is because this department is always backfilling and short in headcount. This results in more work and high stress for the employees remaining. Due to the high volume of support tickets, it is not realistic to have such high expectations with quality when leadership is always wanting more from their CSMs. There just isn't enough fuel to fire the engine."

Something like that is needed when you have clients freaking out on you for 8 hours a day (9 if you worked while eating lunch at your desk as some often did). During my time there, product trainers were the best and incredibly resourceful (S/O to you, Kenna). Management was readily available most of the time when needed for escalations. Yes - there are free snacks and coffee. Make sure you thank Rachel for keeping it stocked and fresh. Benefits good for my single life. Vacation/PTO great to counteract the success department demand. Pay average/below average in comparison to other Success Manager roles in the area.","I learned at the end of the road that you have to give an ultimatum to acquire your desired position, despite all the positive talk about growth and expansion and taking different paths in the company.

They've won diversity awards that I question if they paid for. It's a rich white culture filled with people who look and act alike. If you don’t fit, you leave or get fired. A Diversity award is completely laughable. Sure, they have a few people of color. 

Everything they told me during my interviews was a lie. Best Places to work also seems like a lie…they probably pressured employees. Sure, those who they like are made to feel like gods. They compensate people's egos but underpay. 

I believe this company is filled with leaders who are egomaniacs who say they are down-to-earth and honest but foster a toxic cut-throat culture where you need to know how to pretend and use the language but results don't matter.

A Diversity award is completely laughable. Everything they told me during my interviews was a lie. Best Places to work is also a lie…they probably pressured employees.

A lot of people quit. New hires would come in and be repelled by this dysfunctional company. I know this because I was in HR, hired as a recruiter to relocate to Santa Barbara. Attrition is a major problem at this company. . 

HR is a particularly toxic team as they don't actually have any power and no one tries to understand the value that could be provided. Their expectations of me were extreme. No ramp, no training, and my workload tripled within 6 weeks when they ""managed out"" another recruiter who wasn't ""performing"". In less than 90 days on the job, I had made over 20 job offers while I also relocated myself. Then I was fired for telling someone I had gotten out of an abusive marriage and was stalked. Ridiculously they also said it was because in the conversation I had mentioned I had a weapon for protection. A young(ish) single female relocates to a foreign city after a dangerous situation should have self-protection. This was from the HR team! I wasn't offered relocation back home, was tied to a 1 year lease, and they offered 1 month severance in exchange for my silence. I declined. They will probably say I am disgruntled. Getting fired was the best thing that happened because I got away when I did.

We want new team members to be able to come in and make an impact right away.  To do that, we set clear goals and milestones but new employee success also requires a great deal of hard work and determination.

It pays off though and is really rewarding when new hires can help our customers and find ways to enhance our culture."
248,AppFolio,Customer Success Key Account Manager: Follow Up Review,2020-08-13,5.0,Customer Success Key Account Manager,I previously wrote a review in Jan 2019 after a month with AppFolio as a Key Account Manager. Pros remain the same: AppFolio truly cares about their employees. Work/Life balance is still a priority. Everyone here makes you feel so welcomed...like everyone is family! Our Leadership does a great job asking us for our feedback and acting on it.,"The training process is not a ""Con"". We have an amazing but robust product. During your training, there is a lot of information you learn within several weeks and put into practice. However, it is worth mentioning that the training for the Key Account Management role is critical to fundamentally understanding the product."
249,AppFolio,It's all true - they walk the talk,2020-08-13,5.0,Senior Manager Marketing,"people, mindset, values, business acumen, customer focus",growing pain--need for more structured communications/operations to remain agile
250,AppFolio,Putting their Employees First,2020-08-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"After reading the title, I'm sure you'll be shocked by this response but AppFolio truly cares about it's employees. The amount of resources, thought and action they take in empowering everyone to be healthy impactful employees really sets this company a part. Amidst everything going on with COVID-19 the company has thrived and continued to grow. The product is continuously improving and those of us in the frontlines of service can actually see the benefit our software is bringing our customers. The people who surround me are just as hard-working and proactive in their work that they inspire me to be my best. Leadership is trustworthy and lead with our company values.",We all definitely miss the office but with WFH we're doing a good job staying connected.
251,AppFolio,"Great leadership, benefits and balance",2020-08-12,5.0,Key Account Manager,"When job searching the last time, one of my big priorities was that I wanted to find a company where I believed in the mission, believed in the leadership team and could stand behind the decisions folks higher above me made. In an interview process it is really hard to truly find these things out vs. lip service, but having known a couple of people already working at AppFolio I came into the role confident that I had found the right place and I have not been disappointed in the slightest. The leadership in general (exec or not) at this company is extremely humble and helpful - they want to see you succeed and be the best at your role that you can be. 

From a product perspective - the product is outstanding - another difficult thing to truly confirm in an interview process unless you've worked on the product as a customer previously. There will always be feedback from clients saying they wish it did this or that, but it is a product anyone can stand behind and be proud of.

The benefits and work-life balance that you will get from AppFolio are top notch. A lot of companies claim work life balance only for you to later be pressured to be available 24/7 and here when I leave for the day, I am done. I get time to focus on my family and life outside of work. Seeing the way they have handled Covid and the many people who are at home with kids and have been for months speaks volumes of their true belief system and outlook of work-life balance. I have had the flexibility from my manager to do what I need to take care of my kiddo and work odd and slightly fewer hours than what I normally would. Our benefits package has been similar to what I had in previous positions, but in speaking with friends at other companies it's a solid package with really low cost for health insurance and both HSA/FSA options. There's certainly more to the package, but those were the 3 most important things for me personally.","The most difficult thing about this position is the accounting background that so few new hires have that makes it so much easier to understand the product. The pro in this is that you are not alone in not knowing accounting when you start. There is an intense multi-month training program to get you up to speed, but unlike other software where you just learn the point and click of the software, here it's also super helpful to have (or be willing to learn on the job) some accounting principles to help guide you in conversations in clients. I knew this was an accounting software coming in, but I was still surprised by how steep the initial learning curve was. If you aren't willing to take ownership of your learning, then don't bother applying. If you are willing to take ownership of your learning, then know the learning curve will be steep, but it is definitely doable."
252,AppFolio,Great culture and work-life balance,2020-08-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"AppFolio has a great culture. One of the biggest reason you would love to work here is the AppFolians. I have met many wonderful people that I love to hang out with even after work. 
The on-boarding process was smooth and helpful. There are many academy sessions that can you learn the products. I continue to benefit from those academy sessions even when I have been in the company for over one year.
My manager makes great effort to support me and helps the team succeed. I feel that my voice is heard and valued. The company respects and cares about personal well-being. The work-life balance is great.","Even though the career path is clear, the title doesn't really translate to other companies. Unlike L's in Google and Amazon or E's in Facebook, AppFolio don't have that many of levels to match other places. It doesn't really hurt much since many would stay. Another con might be the compensation. It is competitive enough in San Diego area but not the top tier. To me, the pros win."

263,AppFolio,AppFolio is a great place to have your skills trusted and grown,2020-08-07,4.0,Senior Software Engineer & Team Lead,"AppFolio teams are so empowered (in fact, not just in description), that as a new software engineer fresh out of college I was still listened to by my entire product team and our director. It really gives you a chance to step up instead of step back, which will help you grow your skills.
In engineering, many improvements in technology and practices come organically from engineers themselves, which means we are on the forefront of learning more helpful technologies without switching javascript frameworks every two years just for the sake of it; and it also means we you have the opportunity to bring new proposals to the table and make a case for them to your fellow engineers!
My director has been so proactive in helping me grow. He's pointed out and leveraged my strengths. He lets me and the team come up with our own solutions to problems.
Everyone within a team is on the same footing; there are no team leaders or managers, just a bunch of employees in different roles using their different strengths to come to a consensus on the best way to move forward.
Since all my teammates have been equally empowered and trusted, everyone on my team really wants us to succeed, and I can trust them to carry their weight and more, as well as support me.
Great food, coffee, events, etc.
Friendly teammates and officemates!
Dog-friendly office!
Very competitive compensation.
Incredibly effective transition to remote work during COVID-19. Leadership very responsibly made the announcement in early June that we would be WFH until at least January 2021. This was very thoughtful for both employees, who are now able to make housing changes instead of being uncertain how quickly they will be asked to come back to the office, and the general safety of the world in light of the pandemic; if we as a company can easily work from home, we should not be putting the rest of the world at unnecessary risk. I think this is reflective of how thoughtful leadership is, especially with respect to their own employees. 
Everyone is treated with respect, regardless of background. There have been substantial and effective efforts to increase recruiting in engineering for women, specifically, though women and especially other minorities are still underrepresented.","At least in engineering, all the directors and VPs are men; white men specifically. The same is not true for other departments, and there are ramping efforts in diversity and inclusion to find ways to source more diverse engineering talent. This is much needed.
The company is growing rapidly right now, and especially during this period of remote work due to the pandemic, there is less connectedness to each to each other and AppFolio's culture than what AppFolio has been so loved for through its entire history."

-Will give you the ability to move to departments if you so desire
-Great benefits
-Your stepping stone if you have no Software sales experience prior to this company","-If you're going in for a sales role, either get lucky, play the game, or wait it out because the company culture is so good (at least here int he Dallas office) that sometimes having a slot to fill is very scarce and competitive. 
-Sometimes the transparency of the management team can be frustrating, especially if you understand business movements and why businesses do what they do. Generally, you'll get generic answers because they can't really indulge.
-Ultimately tho, a BDR/SDR role is not a career"

It's got a very stable business, even in times of uncertainty like this. I have smart and energetic co-workers who I consider good friends. They support me and I work hard to not let them down.

I've been with AppFolio 5 years. In that time I've seen a lot of changes. The company has grown, overcome and adapted to challenges, innovated, and built on its success year after year - all the while, keeping the employees and the customers in the forefront. During Covid, while the entire company is having to work from home, AppFolio has gone above and beyond to make the transition as seamless as possible, dedicated more resources to support employees' mental wellness and developed products and processes to allow employees and our customers to adapt to the situation. 
The founders of AppFolio, the leadership and my colleagues inspire me daily. I'm proud to work for such an amazing organization.","I don't know if there is a company out there that can be everything to everyone. That being said, the pros heavily outweigh the cons.

275,AppFolio,Great company!,2020-07-29,5.0,Senior Director of Engineering,"I have a very high trust in the exec team. The two founders are still very involved in the company and the rest of the exec team is a good mix of long-time AppFolians and very talented people who were carefully selected. Those people have skin in the game and value of long-term success of the company.

People care deeply about each other and leaders embody servant leadership. Work-life balance is a real thing.

For engineers, there is a high hiring bar and the engineers are very strong. I'm constantly blown away by how much we can accomplish. In the last 6-12 months some very strong senior+ engineers have joined and that has helped with mentoring the younger engineers.

The vision of the company is to have solution for many vertical markets. New major efforts are started on a regular cadence, which gives opportunities for growth in all sorts of ways. It also means that within the same company there are various efforts that are at different stages of maturity and whatever type of engineer you are you can find interesting problems for you to solve.","Like many other tech companies, diversity could be better."

286,AppFolio,Amazing company but hyper growth comes with hyper growth problems,2020-07-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"AppFolio is a really nice place to work, and the people are really great. Everyone tries to make it great, and it shows from the event to day-to-day work. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, you can truly tell they are trying.

AppFolio also tries to do things their own way, and it is great to see a company not just conforming to the industry norms. It is an interesting and intelligent way to approach things.

Also, I cannot describe how above-and-beyond the company has gone for parents. It is nice to know that they care about those with families, and try to accommodate them. It is truly appreciated.","I am part of the recent wave of hires that came with a massive expansion of their development team, and it is a tough place to be in. Everyone is stretched thin, and the department itself is struggling to figure out how to adapt to this. Since joining, I have had 3 different managers as the company reorganizes, as well as a couple different mentors. I appreciate the company is trying to make it work, but it has created a bit of chaos.

Also, there is definitely and ""in crowd"" of former Citrix/LMI employees. I don't think they intended for this to happen, but as an outsider, you can definitely feel the difference between the level of enthusiasm and caring.

Also, the snacks were not great when we were in the office, and the food and beverage team really did not seem to care much."

The company hires sales reps that will add to the positive environment and get along well with current employees. It is honestly FUN to go into work every! Also, the sales department here is very different than typical sales departments - individual reps are willing and eager to help each other work deals, even when there is no incentive to them personally. We all just genuinely like to see other reps (our friends) succeed and hit milestones. It's an incredibly positive and motivating environment - lots of humor, laid back setting. Also, the product is amazing and essentially sells itself.","Only con I can think of is that it's an open work environment, so be prepared to sit very closely to your entire team.

299,AppFolio,This Company Stands By Their Employees!,2020-07-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"From what I have seen, management at AppFolio really does prioritize doing the right thing for their employees. A few examples:
-I experienced a very serious medical issue when I had been with the company for slightly less than a year. I received amazing support from my manager and the HR team that made it possible for me to take the time off I needed, and get the care I needed with company health benefits. My manager was incredibly supportive throughout the entire process and made it easy for me to return when the time came. I will never forget how the company supported me and made it possible to continue growing my career despite this significant challenge. 
- AppFolio was quick to do the right thing to protect employees from COVID-19, switching to fully remote operations quickly, canceling all work travel and events, and giving us the tools and resources needed to work successfully from home through 2020.
- I have never once witnessed negative behaviors like gossiping, backstabbing other employees, or unhealthy rivalries. Unfortunately I have seen these behaviors at many of my previous employers, but never at AppFolio. Career advancement opportunities abound, and they go to those who deserve them, removing any pressure to compete with co-workers as if work were a zero-sum game. 
-Management does a great job of encouraging us to take time off and recharge! I appreciate that workaholism is not seen as a value. There is no unspoken pressure to work around the clock or take fewer days off, and managers set a great example of healthy boundaries between work and personal time. 
-AppFolio's hiring process is rigorous and results in a highly talented team, who I am grateful to learn from every day.","Listing cons feels like nitpicking, since AppFolio is genuinely a great place to work. If I had to list a few, they are: 
-The company is very large, and with so many different verticals and segments, sometimes it can be really challenging to work cross-departmentally. Obviously, progress moves more slowly than it would at a small startup, but the flip side of this is that we get things done right, innovation is validated by extensive research and listening to customers, and the company's stability is never in question.
-It doesn't sit right with me that there is no differentiation between sick days and normal PTO days. I would prefer if the company offered a set number of sick days per year that were separate from PTO, which is gradually accrued (even if this meant slightly reducing overall vacation time). 20 days PTO seems like a lot, but any time you take off due to illness will be subtracted from this, and if you don't have enough PTO banked when you get sick, you'll need to take unpaid days off. Other software companies in Santa Barbara have more generous time off policies in this respect.

314,AppFolio,Great Place to Build Your Early Career,2020-04-02,4.0,Services,"- Fantastic Culture. Great place to come into work every day. Made lifelong friends and professional relationships. Spreading positivity is valued and appreciated. Teammates are there to help you when you need it. 

- Great work/life balance, most of the time. There are busy times where you will be working long hours some days, but this is true with every tech company. 

- Direct managers give you opportunities to take on projects outside your normal day-to-day, and your visibility within the company will grow if you perform well with these projects. 

- Mostly clear metrics for success. You usually know how you're doing at any given moment. 

- Direct managers genuinely cared about me as a person and a professional. I trusted them and they trusted me, and that is invaluable in a corporate setting. 

- Plenty of opportunity for young professionals.

- Leadership has a clear vision and is generally very good at following through on goals and initiatives. 

- In my experience, promotions are merit-based and are given to people who work hard and are good at what they do.  I haven't seen nepotism and cronyism be any sort of problem, and when someone gets a promotion, the general consensus is that it is well-deserved.","Although AppFolio was a great place to work for many years, I have to mention some of the areas of opportunity for improvement.

- AppFolio takes advantage of the influx of young talent from Westmont and UCSB, and as a result, compensation is below industry average within services specifically. You come in at a low rate, and don't expect to make up for it over time. Raises are pre-scheduled and not open for negotiation. This also generally doesn't change with promotions. They know what they'll be paying you for the next 5 years, regardless of how you perform and what extra responsibilities you take on. I get this from a strategic and budgeting standpoint, but it can be demoralizing. This is especially true because unlike tech companies in LA or SF, or even other tech companies in SB, there is no cost of living adjustment to recognize you're living and working in one of the most expensive places in the country. 

- There is a massive discrepancy between how services and other departments are treated across the board. It's understandable that product/engineering/sales make more in compensation than services, but this extends beyond simply pay. At a point, it got so bad that during a company summit, they took everyone from the same conference room where the speaker gave a presentation, and funneled employees into 2 different areas for lunch. Services got sent to the sandwich bar, while product/engineering/sales/I'm not sure who else got directed to the steak and seafood buffet. It was very awkward when good friends and even spouses were separated in this way. The issue was openly addressed and explained away by department budgets, and people were discouraged from discussing it further. Luckily this was a couple years ago and they did not make the same mistake in following years, but the impact was made. Another example would be the company-sponsored, paid, 2 day Disneyland trip that only product and engineering were allowed to attend. Very demoralizing coming into an empty office during your busiest time of the year, knowing all your colleagues were enjoying a paid vacation. This issue was never properly addressed. 

If I were in another department, I would give AppFolio 5 stars across the board, but there are some obvious issues when working within services. 

- The MVP product approach results in unfinished features being released to customers. MVP is fine, if you're using the ensuing feedback constructively. But when everyone is focused on building the shiny new toy, things are left undone and features incomplete. 

- Benefits are below average, with healthcare plans, for example, being less-than-competitive compared to other similar companies.

- While promotions are well-deserved when given, they are only given according to company need, not when an employee has outgrown their current role and earned greater responsibility."

322,AppFolio,Poor Management leads to poor results.,2020-02-03,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"Snacks provided on site, and occasional catering leftovers from management. Relaxed dress code and flexible hours.","Your daily workflow consists of getting yelled at by residents because the customers that use Appfolio's MCC service generally do not take care of their properties and are tired of fielding those calls themselves. The clients that use Appfolio's service will routinely call in very upset at you because they have been promised unrealistic hold times and service levels by other departments or members of the team and you have no response other than to provide an email they can contact. I'm sure you can guess whether or not that makes the customer happy. If you do decided to work here, just take the bare minimum number of calls to keep management off your back. If you are a hard worker and take more calls than others you will just be asked to take more and more. The people around you will continue to slack off and have no repercussion, but management will wonder why your numbers have slipped as they pile other employees work on you. Your process will also change wildly from day to day, most times for the worse. The software developers are tasked to make changes from multiple different departments but have very little interaction with those departments or understanding of their job at all. So routinely a feature will be added that makes your job process more difficult, or straight up breaks functionality. You will have to spend quite a bit of time trying to find workarounds or provide solutions, but you will still be expected to hit weekly metrics as if nothing was wrong. 

Management is a mess. In my few years with the company there were 10+ people to hold a ""manager"" title. Most of them did not last more than 3 months and were either let go or quit very quickly. The people who trained them, who were responsible for their success failed many times over, but were given promotions and had new positions created for them. Management will routinely cancel self development and advancement opportunities because they mismanaged their schedule and no longer have time or flat out forgot. They do not take any time to improve the quality of work of the standard employee as they are too afraid to have hard conversations with employees from fear they will quit on the spot and leave the crew even more bare bones than it already is. I had 6 managers in my time there. You will spend a month or two working with a manager on a plan to advance or things you can work on to further your career, only to be switched to another team the next month with a manager that cares very little about your career advancement as they are a week or two from quitting or being fired themselves. 

Appfolio used to have room for career growth and opportunity, with new positions opening up and new departments opening up regularly. Well, the new department failed miserably and didn't last a year before it was shut down. The new positions that were created within the department failed and were combined into roles for one person. The budget was so poorly managed that all raises and promotions were frozen due to managements miscalculations. You will probably earn 2-3$ more than what you started at and will not get much higher than that regardless of service time or performance."

Everyone here is very friendly, supportive, and team-oriented. Leaders here make it possible for every employee be themselves. They are easy to approach and laid back, but very driven to get things done. The culture is amazing - it's not all about the free lunches, stocked kitchen, legos, games, pingpong tables, yoga, sports during lunch, and FLEXIBLE work environment, but the PEOPLE I work with make it a big difference. No micro management here - we're all treated like adults. :) 

Leaders truly care about professional/personal development. They take the time to understand your strengths/skills to help grow your career. They also listen on how the company can make improvements, and the best part is that... they take action!","As much as companies promote healthy lifestyles, it would be amazing to have a gym onsite.

327,AppFolio,Baby Yoda would work here!,2020-01-15,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"I wanted to get into a technology company but did not have a technology background. What I do have is a strong work ethic, a positive demeanor, a desire to learn, and a winning smile (at least my mom thinks so). I desperately wanted to work for a tech company, and one that cares about their customers and employees. AppFolio meets the bill and then some. Customer Success gave me my opportunity and I am so thankful. 

AppFolio sets ambitious goals that we appear to achieve and I’m confident we will continue to. With this ambition comes the need to identify top performers and promote aggressively. It is clear that is what happens here. If you are hungry, a nice person, and work hard - you will grow your career. It is that easy! I have learned so much in CS that I know makes me a more valuable AppFolian and will allow me even more opportunity as I continue my career here. 

With all due respect to those that have not been promoted or fell stagnant, it isn’t the leadership team or some kind of evil plan that is holding you back. Work is hard sometimes; this job is no different. In my short time here, I have seen a crazy amount of promotions and have no doubt I will have a fruitful career here. Maybe I just have perspective, but this place is legit. All I ever wanted was to work somewhere where I was valued and could control my future with my effort. I found that place! 

Pros Punch List: 
Opportunity for growth - I don’t have to desire my boss’s job. There is plenty of room for advancement.
Amazing co-workers - some of the nicest people ever and I’m laughing nearly all day!
Cool work environment - Ping Pong, Pool table, open floor plan. 
Endless snacks, food, and regular adult beverages! 
Super collaborative and supportive environment.  
Leadership values and promotes a work-life balance and  truly care about their team members.

The people make this place great, but the work expected for the Services department is outrageous. The Customer Success department is no doubt the most important part of the product lifecycle, yet we are treated like the poor stepchild.  This is a California-based company, so many events are held throughout the year where Dallas teams have to deal with their already-overwhelming case queues, plus cover Santa Barbara teams while they get to go and have fun. The Dallas office no doubt works harder than others, yet we won't get any additional compensation or bonuses. 
The sales team is the only team that makes commission and gets praise for bringing on new clients. Most of the time, they sell clients on features that are not supported, and our team looks like the ""bad guy"" for providing clients a workaround or telling them what they don't want to hear. It's up to Onboarding and Customer Success to keep clients happy, but it's almost impossible with the work expected of us. We pride ourselves on 24-48 hour response time, but that response time is getting higher and higher due to supporting chat. Chat is essentially immediate support, which is against our traditional values. Not only are you expected to call clients when scheduled, but you also have to respond quickly to submitted support requests, yet resolve immediate chats that come in. On top of this, managers expect you to meet certain metrics and keep a positive attitude, when everything is crumbling around you. In 2019, we were expected to have a surge of new hires, but at least half of the amount hired quit within the same year. The higher-ups have never been more out of touch with the company and will continue to see high turnover if processes do not change soon."

334,AppFolio,Best Job Ever!!,2020-01-03,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"My favorite thing about working at Appfolio is the amount of growth opportunities there are within the company - especially within Customer Success. When I was interviewing for my role, I heard a lot of talk about the potential for growth  (something that was very important to me when picking my next job). Within a few months of accepting my offer, I saw first hand the people around me getting promoted to different roles. Within a year of starting, I was also promoted! 

In addition to that, the culture and environment of this company cannot be matched, this company promotes collaboration and the people I get to work/partner with are brilliant, kind and driven.","- No dogs allowed in the Dallas office :(

Getting in to the company as a part of Customer Success is something I feel really lucky to have done, considering I did not have any corporate experience prior to working at AppFolio. The work is fast and there are high expectations set for the employees, but the management team is always available and focused on helping employees get the most out of their position here. In my first year on the Customer Success team I learned more about professionalism, task management, and customer service than I ever expected to learn (not to mention everything about the software). I really appreciate the focus on longer term professional development rather than just day to day performance. The pay is entry level, but the role comes with full benefits and PTO and lots of opportunity to grow.","I think it can be easy to get caught up in the day to day stress of working in customer service, but if you take advantage of the benefits that come out of the job and the opportunities that you can take within just the first two years it is easy to see that it is worth it. This role is for people looking to build a career, not just take a job. You have to start somewhere when you are beginning your career, and I feel really strongly that AppFolio is a great place to come in and learn what it takes to succeed in a big, successful company."

One thing I highly value about this company is the emphasis on Teamwork. Everyone is super collaborative. Prior to AppFolio, I hated team projects because I'd end up doing all the work. Here, teamwork is our motto! I love how much we support one another. 

I can honestly say that applying to work here a year ago was one of the best decisions. The leadership team is incredibly kind and compassionate. They genuinely want you to succeed and advance your career. I have since been promoted after working here for a year, which has opened a whole new door of opportunities!

Some time later I decided to come back, the main reason being that of all the places I've worked previously, AppFolio was the brightest shining star. I worked at some places before I made my way back to AppFolio and let me be the first to say that you can easily tell that AppFolio puts an emphasis on taking care of their people. Whether it be benefits, swag, FOOD, company-hosted events, and even happy hour! It's just a fun place to be.

341,AppFolio,An Honest Take,2019-12-26,1.0,Customer Success Manager,"- Really good coworkers
- Great place to start a career
- Office is nice and easy location","The interview process for this position is not entirely accurate. The position is presented as an account management type role when in actuality it is more akin to a call center. CSM's are expected to provide live, real time support via chat with up to seven clients at once while managing a queue of email requests.

The management in CS is struggling hard to adapt to these changes and as such the turnover is outrageous. I can only speak for the CS department but the morale is so low that coming into the office was unbearable most days. This is largely due to the stress and pressure of knowing that you are going to clock in, work for nine straight hours, and then clock out. It was very common in my time at AppFolio for people to work through lunch and stay late daily. In the interview process they stress the culture is about a healthy work life balance but in my experience this could not be further from the truth.

Compensation is very low compared to market standards, but the benefit packages offered are very generous. In the AppFolio culture discussing compensation with management is extremely taboo and there were no scheduled merit increases or bonuses. If you discuss your compensation you will be mocked for bringing it up, just a fair warning.

The office is very cliquey and if you're not in with the top people in CS you have no chance of forward progression. Honestly though, if you are money motivated the forward progression here is not for you. No one is getting rich at AppFolio. To me, this is a job for people fresh out of college, not for someone looking to build a career. This could be a great chance to get some experience on your resume and be a great learning lesson for your future career aspirations. 

Not to rag on management and leadership, but when I left the department was in absolute shambles. There is not a lot of direction and there is not a lot of quality control. You either sink or swim and I think that if people had a clearer understanding of what this role actually is, they would be able to get more quality people in instead of having the insane turnover that they are experiencing."

The job is easy yet keeps you on your toes and the training was the most involved training I have ever experienced. You meet with every single person in your department and get to know what they do and their role. The training is so relaxed and they let you decide how fast or how slow you want to learn, based on the easiest way you learn new processes and technology. Everyone I work with is always willing to help and all the managers want you to succeed. Most managers started out doing exactly what you are doing and worked their way up which is really inspiring. The office is fully stocked with drinks and snacks so you never go hungry which is great! It’s a nice working environment physically as well.","Some of the higher up managers aren’t as physically involved with the team as I would have thought. The difference in your job title especially in my role  is prevalent as your desk is near those that have the same title. It makes sense but feels divided sometimes! Also the PTO is great, but once the 20 days are used (they’re accumulated as you work) and you have your schedule and days off it’s locked. If something random comes up (like if you’re sick or even if you know far in advance) on a day you aren’t scheduled off there’s no real way to switch your shifts around. You have to either switch with a teammate or let it affect your performance rating which affects promotions. It feels super restrictive compared to my last role. It is a 24 hour call center so it makes sense but just be aware! Pay is great but it’s kind of a thing no one talks about which makes me think some may be getting more or less than me for the same position which doesn’t feel fair.

The company lives up to its values, hires great people, and truly cares about employees. The company continues to innovate and grow, and is focused on developing future leaders. A few more things I love about AppFolio include: the work-life balance, the fun, smart, talented, driven people I work with every day, the opportunity for career growth, teams built on collaboration and trust, an unwavering customer focus, fun events and celebrations, company-wide fundraisers to give back to the community, and transparency and accessibility of leaders.  

If you are positive, passionate, hard working and committed to owning your own success, come join the AppFolio Family, you *will* really love it here!","As a growing, public company, we do have some 'red tape', and sometimes there can be a misalignment of motivations across departments. Still not as bureaucratic as companies I've worked for in the past, and I personally like having some of the set processes, benefits, and resources in place that come with a larger company. In my department, there is still lots of autonomy. I think it varies by department and role."

395,AppFolio,"Great People, Great Company",2019-09-18,5.0,Marketing Communications Specialist,"From the physical set up of the office to the welcoming and innovative culture, AppFolio is hands-down the best place I've ever worked. 

Literally, every day I walk through the office and pass people or see them in the kitchen, I'm met with genuine smiles and asks about how my day is - many of these people I don't even know. AppFolio does an excellent job hiring great people who are intelligent, kind, fair, and motivated, and it shows. Everyone on my team is excited to do what they do every day, and pulls more than their own weight in their roles. 

I'm also not sure many people pick up on this, but even the way our offices are structured shows the value leadership place on their employees. In my building, just about all of the leadership offices (Directors+) are in the MIDDLE of the floor, so it's the employees on the frontlines who have window seats. Everyone has standing desks, and we work in an open environment. At first, I thought I would hate this, but when everyone on the team is open and willing to chat with you when you can solve something quickly, it's the perfect setup. If I can solve something faster by talking to someone in person, I'll just walk up to their desk and they're always willing to chat. I've never worked somewhere where people are so excited to solve problems and not annoyed that you're distracting them.

AppFolio also has ample opportunities for professional development for everyone at the company, whether it's institutional or by team. Programs like Lunch N' Learns, where each one specializes in a topic like communications or project management, offer opportunities for you to be improving each day.  Not to mention in my 3rd week on the job, both my manager and VP separately talked to me about where I see myself headed in the future, and how they can help me get there. 

I'm also constantly given opportunities to innovate processes and try new things - if I have an idea, they tell me to run with it (within reason, of course). And I'm not the only one, I've seen countless others try new things and have great success. AppFolio takes such care in hiring the right people that they trust in you to make the right decisions and take the company to the next level.","There are very few cons at AppFolio, and many pains are temporary and because of growth. For one, at the SB office, we're a bit short on space (this should be solved in 2020 with the opening of a new building). This makes the offices a little noisy, but nothing sound-canceling headphones can't solve. We're hiring rapidly but growing rapidly, so sometimes team size doesn't match company needs, but again, they're solving for that as quickly as possible. There are no issues I don't see being resolved in the next 6 months.

Additionally, my personal frustrations stem from wanting to cover much more ground than I currently can because our team is in its infancy. Which, honestly, is pretty amazing that I wish I could work MORE! Excited to grow my team and do more amazing things with AppFolio."

407,AppFolio,Employee and Consumer Conscious Company -- Great Gateway for Entry-level Employees,2019-07-02,4.0,Contact Center Representative,"Appfolio is a fantastic company to gain experience for anyone new to the workforce or shifting careers. While I cannot speak to the office atmosphere or management for all office locations or departments, I have been continually impressed with the operation of the contact center. The management team cares not only for the profit and future of the company but for the employees as well and it shows. It is a call center and, as such, the work is not always enjoyable, but the management team acknowledges that fact and takes great effort to keep office morale up. They encourage growth and development and will readily discuss your career aspirations whether inside or outside the company.

Expect decent company provided snacks daily with lunch brought in at least once a month.  Coworkers are in close quarters, but the office is nicely decorated with lots of natural light and arranged to keep from feeling like you are working in a cubicle farm. It is in a nice location as well in the Legacy shopping area, so there is plenty of space for walking away from your desk and computer during lunch.

The company benefits are definitely a pro as well. They offer great PTO without any pressure or recourse from management if you choose to actually use it. Insurance benefits are fairly standard, but the cost is largely covered by the company. The 401K match is a little above average as well, especially for an entry-level position. Just this year the company began offering paid parental leave as well.","Although the Legacy Shopping area is nice for taking lunchtime stroll, the traffic is fairly awful regardless of which direction you are coming or going and public transportation is a poor option. While there are bus stops only a few blocks away, the TRE/DART does not have any stations nearby.

While there is plenty of promise for internal growth and the management team is eager to bring forward opportunities whenever they arise, the contact center currently seems to have hit its peak and plateaued, so any real growth in the company is occurring in other departments. If you have a bachelor's degree (and are possibly open to relocating to California) this is not an issue. If you are without a degree, however, your time with the company, ability, and experience will count for little to nothing and limit you to transitioning into sales or waiting for management opportunities within the contact center to become available.

Despite the company's overall above-average benefits, there are no sick days offered so you have to use PTO if you need a day or two off for your health, a child's health, or unforeseen circumstances. This becomes tricky also as, technically, PTO must be approved 24 hours in advance unless it is an emergency situation and the determination of ""emergency"" is at management's discretion. I personally have not yet had an issue, but was warned on one occasion when a situation arose and I called in late in the evening that I may not receive any PTO to cover my missed day due to the late notice.

Starting pay is fair and about average for the positions I've held thus far, but after receiving the opportunity for a merit raise at 6 months there are no further wage increases unless you move into a higher paying position."

412,AppFolio,Great but...,2019-06-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Growth company with lots of opportunity.,The expectations are unrealistic. Small teams don’t necessarily make sense anymore and a larger investment needs to be made  into developing employees.  Sure PTO is generous but you’ll either feel bad using it or never have a chance.
413,AppFolio,Spinning out of control - management flip flops constantly,2019-06-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"free lunches, flexible hours
some smart people work here 
offer good amount of PTO","low salary for a variety of positions
management flip flops on ideas (you're constantly working on a project only to be told it is no longer important and to just drop it)
pick and choose who they service/support (no longer are clients equal)
co-workers are pretty immature and hostile (fake) - I can count the number of genuine individuals on my 1 hand
there are cliques (like in a stereo typical high school)
some teams are put on a pedestal, while others are NEVER mentioned = one word - favoritism - 
management is inconsistent - they will confirm something with you/go over a case and protocol - the next day , will say they remember nothing about it and that it should be done differently
90% employees are under 30  
turn over is pretty high - sometimes team members disappear with no explanation, lots of management turn over 
managers are passive aggressive to each other/other teams - which really brings down team morale/trust
mistakes are covered up by management instead of brought to light so everyone can learn
numbers presented at company meetings are inconsistent with the actual numbers - they present the numbers so it looks like the company is excelling, when in reality they just changed how the reports are structured and what data represents in a report - very shady and pretty stupid
space was cramped as they kept hiring more employees with no extra room/bathrooms were filthy and constantly occupied but they seemed to have resolved that somewhat 
company events are always centered around booze - gets pretty old
open office concept does not allow for concentration/professionalism - especially with the influx of new hires - at times you are yelling into the phone so that your clients can hear you/clients ask about loud noises in the background
benefits are covered only 50% by company
too many dogs! many dogs not trained and jump up at your/your desk/grab your clothes which is very uncomfortable and dangerous  AND some also pee on the floor haha"

417,AppFolio,Customer Success Review,2019-05-01,5.0,Customer Success Manager- Investment Management,"Amazing Company! I have been at Appfolio for nearly 10 months now and I've loved it from day 1. Appfolio is amazing at really treating their employees with respect truly caring for career development. Upper management is absolutely wonderful, all the managers on the Success team are absolutely wonderful, they always there to help and they truly care about career development and growth, which was huge for me. Appfolio is true to its core about hiring great employees and creating an amazing product that our customers love.","When I first was hired, the training had a lot of remote training that was done online between offices, it was hard to really to grasp some of the tougher products without someone in person. This has now been resolved as all offices have a training manager on site which is really going to help new employees!"
418,AppFolio,What makes AppFolio great? Let me count the ways...,2019-05-01,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Note: I'm in the Product Development department, which houses software engineers, quality-assurance engineers (QA), user-experience designers (UX), and product managers (PM). It also contains our Operations and Security teams. Other departments are probably great also, but this review pertains to my department. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Small teams. 

We work in small, focused, 6-person autonomous teams comprised of a few software engineers, a UX designer, QA engineer, and a product manager. Each team is focused on cranking out software solutions to delight our customers; there is very little bureaucracy and very few top-down mandates. My team's product manager presents several high-impact projects, and we work on whichever project we think is most interesting. We all have a say in what we work on, so we all feel a sense of ownership over our projects. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No deadlines.

We try hard to deliver quality software in incremental stages, getting feedback from our customers along the way, so we hardly ever waste time developing features that no one wants. Management trusts us to iterate quickly and deliver value rapidly, but there is also an understanding that it's important to build sustainable, maintainable code. Consequently, we can take the time to code it right, and be proud of our work. I've been really impressed that no one imposes arbitrary deadlines on us. For example, toward the end of a recent project, even though we had finished shipping the feature, we decided we needed an extra week to refactor the code to integrate it nicely into our codebase. So we took the time to do it right, and no one batted an eye! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great culture. 

Every couple weeks our team has a ""retro"" -- a meeting where we look back on the last couple weeks to see how we can improve. Retros start with ""appreciations"", where people take turns thanking their teammates for their help and support. It sounds corny but it's actually really nice. Who doesn't want to be appreciated at work? And there are lots of events: We have team outings (we took a trip to the local zoo), volunteer days (the company gives us a day a year of paid ""volunteer time"", we recently went out into the Santa Barbara hills and repaired some hiking trails), hackathons, tech retreats, and contests to make the best guacamole and present it in a funny skit. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good infrastructure. 

Writing tests for our software is deeply ingrained in our culture. We have a huge suite of tests that run in an automated fashion every time you change the code. The philosophy is essentially, ""If the tests pass, then you didn't break anything."" It's very luxurious to be able to release code knowing that you didn't break some feature on the other side of the codebase. It lets us move quickly with confidence. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment in employees. 

We have a great onboarding program, bi-weekly 1-hour in-depth tech lectures, bi-weekly sequences of 15-minute tech-demos, and a curriculum of ~40 one-hour workshops on various aspects of our tech stack. Management agrees that it's vital for us to keep our skills up-to-date and sharp, and it's a great asset to have so much knowledge-sharing as part of our culture. We also do a lot of pair-programming, which I really like. It's a very high-bandwidth way to learn about our code base. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good work-life balance. 

AppFolio does a good job of providing some amenities, but not so many that you feel pressure to live at work. For example, we have lots of yummy snacks, coffee, and various sodas (all free!), but you wouldn't be able to eat all your meals at work. I like that we don't have on-site massages, laundry, child-care, or haircuts. Santa Barbara is too beautiful for us to  spend all our time at work, so we have enough amenities to make our work-time enjoyable and comfy, but not enough to stay cooped up in the office. People get to work around 8:30 or 9 and leave around 5:30 or 6. Because we try to deliver value in a steady stream of small improvements, the work is very consistent, which contributes to my work-life balance.",It is expensive to live in Santa Barbara!

421,AppFolio,Great VIP Leadership,2019-04-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,CEO and directors really seem to care and are approachable. Company is fairly transparent and listens to their customers and staff.,Management changes/growing pains were disabling for those affected.
422,AppFolio,Contact Center was great until....,2019-04-16,2.0,Contact Center Representative,The “Company” is great! Everyone in other departments are nice and friendly. Even the management team in other departments are nice. The company has a great vibe overall! My department had what we call a “Wafflethon” which was fun and tasty!!!,Overall the culture at the Contact Center was great just the management team needs help. Not the new managers their great the old managers. Once we moved we started loosing tons of agents roughly about 20+ in a matter of 3 months once the senior manager was promoted to her role. She even fired the best manager we’ve ever had!!! Although I wasn’t on his team I wish I was he seemed to care about his agents and their advancement within the company. The senior manager over the maintenance side seems very snobby now and doesn’t seem to care about the agents anymore. I once walked past her office (her door cracked) and heard her talking bad about the other managers and agents to the other female manager whom no one knows what she does anymore. I once needed a day off for personal matter and was denied due to business needs. I requested in advance like 5-6 days ahead. Even another agent was denied her time off due to her schooling. So now she misses class because she doesn’t want to lose her job because they won’t adjust her schedule. This department has gone down hill since the new senior manager. I will be looking for a new company to go with. I love appfolio but the director and senior manager need serious adjustments. I don’t mind doing my job which I’m suppose to but if you can’t feel any advancement with the company why work there especially if you can’t get any raises stuck at $13 unless promoted.

From day one, I was given numerous opportunities and was able to make an immediate impact. I had an interest in sales and worked my way into the BDR program. During my time as a BDR,  I had the pleasure of working with driven co-workers and received great coaching from management. The BDR role gives great insight into the sales role because you are constantly in communication with that team. If you are interested in software sales but still need to gain some experience then I highly recommend this role/company.",I don't have anything bad to say about my time at AppFolio

426,AppFolio,It's all up and to the right and it gets better as we grow,2019-03-26,5.0,"Manager, Onboarding Services","I've been at AppFolio just shy of 2 years and in that short time I've moved from a more entry-level position of Data Migration Specialist in the onboarding department all the way to managing an entire team in the onboarding department. The growth potential here is insane and I'm not an outlier. Most of my peers have moved up to senior or manager positions as well. My department alone has more than doubled in size since I've been here.

I've been at several companies before starting at AppFolio and my only shame is that it took me this long to find it. It still blows my mind that this is some people's 1st or 2nd job. I can't imagine where I'd be today if I started here 8-10 years ago instead of grinding it out at other companies. It sounds cliche to talk about the ""culture"" but that's exactly what keeps me at AppFolio. The company truly cares about its employees and it shows across compensation, benefits packages, PTO, and all the great amenities they provide. 

Beyond that, they deliver a truly amazing product that I feel confident standing behind which makes my interactions with customers all so much easier. I've been at companies before where I didn't believe in the product or level of service we provided and as such it was hard to feel invested in the company or want to stay. AppFolio is basically the opposite of that. 

To sum it all up, I'm here for the long haul.",It used to be my commute but I've invested in a home nearby so now it's not an issue.

One of my favorite things about AppFolio is that I get to go into work every day with a group of incredibly talented people who are also down to earth and friendly.  It creates 
 an inspiring workplace culture where I feel consistently challenged but also excited to come in and contribute.   

Additionally, there have been constant growth opportunities as we continue to grow  so there are always new challenges to focus on developing my career.  AppFolio does a great job of being transparent about the requirements to move into new roles and providing resources to enable us to get there.","No major cons to think of, working in Customer Success can be stressful at times but they do a great job of mitigating that with different events, snacks and hiring people who make it fun to come to work."
429,AppFolio,Not as good as it sounded,2019-03-16,2.0,Engineer,"Some very nice people, free clothes, food, close to beach","There is not trust or real appreciation in Engineering. They sell you how great it is but then you find out it is not what it seems during interviews.  People are fired without a good reason, and others are quitting because of limited opportunity, fear, and bad management.  I have seen many leave in a short time. If you want a quick experience, it is maybe fine, but not for long term. I was happy when I moved here for this job but now I wish I took a different offer."

I have been with AppFolio for a little over 2 years and honestly, it has been the most fun. It is very rewarding to see how far I have come in such a short time and am so excited to see what else I am able to accomplish.  The people you work with become your family and your managers have open door policies and are always pushing you to do your best and excel in everything you do.

It is very rewarding to work for a company that cares about its culture and its employees on a personal level. Not a day goes by where I am not thankful for working with such great people and such a great Company! 

It is so motivating to see so many great women excel in their positions and continue to grow as well as share their stories across the board. There is just not a place where you can find so much talent with such a diverse background. This is truly so inspiring to see and witness on a day to day basis. It makes me so proud to be an AppFolian!

What I appreciate is knowing my contributions at the company do make a huge difference for not only our customers, but the people working within the company. Our want and ability to collaborate with one another only makes things faster and more efficient, and we enjoy the process! 

Knowing that my contributions matter is probably one of the most important things in any position, whether that be services, sales, marketing, etc. On top of this, our management shows great transparency and stresses work-life balance being important!

I look forward to going into work every day, and I feel supported in my job as well as challenged. The snacks and ping pong and PTO are all great pluses. Everyone talks about the culture (as they should) but I do want to point out something I've told many of my coworkers and friends but have yet to put in a formal review.

Appfolio has so many inspiring people in management--but I want to specifically call out the dozens of amazing and brilliant women in high levels of management and the executive team. As a woman, I don't feel limited or held back in my career growth at Appfolio, and I have so many intelligent and savvy women to look up to who are managers, directors, and executives. To have women so well represented is NOT a common thing from what I've seen at most tech companies and that makes me SO grateful for Appfolio and their hiring and promoting philosophy.

I also love Appfolio's commitment to the local community and how they get Appfolians involved in service that's meaningful to them (we have a free volunteer day every year). I really appreciate how Appfolio supports their employees to enable them to do quality work, and also encourages them to have quality time for family, friends, and all of life's adventures that take place outside of work. There is so much to be grateful for working here the last 4 years, so thank you, Appfolio!",Continuing showing appreciation to the Services department and providing avenues for growth into the rest of the organization.

Sitting in a lecture styled setting is not the best way to learn a software system. Some people learn easier through shadowing. Training felt a lot like school in the sense that they quiz and grade you. However, when you need assistance a lot of the times they expect you to figure it out on your own.  The workload is very intense and it’s sometimes difficult to get help because coworkers are also busy. There is a lot of turn over, and few senior members on each team to help assist all of the new members at a time. As I mentioned above most people are willing to help, however, there are some colleagues who are not so willing and actually put you down when you don’t know something that they think you should know by now. Some of the clients are grateful and kind, but a majority of them do not care about their morality and are ok with making the customer success manager feel less than for not being able to help them instantaneously."

Founders are humble and friendly.","This is generally an extrovert's company, it can be difficult for introverts to work in the open office plan or participate in department activities. Pay is lower compared to other tech companies for the same position even though the product is an accounting tool with complexities. Pay has generally increased, but not enough to match for inflation and rising rent costs in Santa Barbara. Customers are not always the nicest. Competitor companies will offer higher salary raises for the same position. Annual salary increases are generally not based on performance, but rather the business need in your particular area of work.

I wanted to take what I learned and apply that to another area within AppFolio and I chose to join services. I was able to internally move positions and now I get to apply my best self every day to a job that I love. 

I am looking forward to our growing company and culture. This is an excellent place to work for the first time out of college graduates and for technology industry veterans.

- Great work life balance
- Awesome company culture
- AppFolio helps and encourages employees to give back to their communities
- Plenty of growth opportunities and experiences to learn from to help you apply yourself
- I feel valued and that my opinion matters","- The company is growing fast and it is difficult to keep up with the changes and new personnel. Communication and transparency can be an issue as teams and departments change roles. 
- Not always clear what opportunities exist for cross-department collaboration."

458,AppFolio,Run Run Run,2018-10-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Location is good, San Diego is a nice place.","This review is for Mycase under Appfolio. This place has becomes from 'great culture' to 'OMG, Mycase is falling apart'. The turnover rate is like 30-40%, including engineers, designers, PMs and management. The office literally run out of budget for farewell events and people get used to it. Smart people already jumped the ship and others are preparing interviews.  The product strategy can hardly bump the revenue and Engineering management doesn't understand tech and management at all."
459,AppFolio,I love this place,2018-10-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Awesome leadership team. Being a publicly traded company, change within AppFolio and the product itself is necessary and constant. Executives are transparent in the reasons behind these changes, which allows employees to understand how the company ultimately makes decisions. This is rare for a company of this size. While AppFolio has grown substantially since I was hired, this is something that has not changed and I hope never will. 


- SO MUCH opportunity. Employees are encouraged to be forward-thinking in their career and management always looks internally when a new position opens. I have received 4 promotions in the span of 4 years. 


- Amazing people. I have met some of my closest friends working at AppFolio. They hire positive, hardworking people that you actually enjoy being around outside of work. 


- Cross departmental movement/learning opportunities. There are frequent meetings held for the sole purpose of educating employees on the inner workings of other departments to ensure we are all aligned as a business and to foster career progression. Employees are always supported if they have an interest in a position that falls outside of their department. 


- Impressive product. Employees are able to meet customers at trade shows, our annual customer conference, and luncheons hosted throughout the year across the country.  Getting that face-to-face interaction allows us to see the positive impact our software has on our clients and their businesses.


- Work hard, play hard mentality. The teams I have been a part of have always been rewarded for their success.


- Compensation. We're all here to make money.",I can't think of any!
460,AppFolio,Working in Services at AppFolio (Santa Barbara),2018-10-17,4.0,Product Success Manager (Onboarding),"The company culture is great - everyone who works here is not only a coworker but a friend. The job challenges me every day (but not too much) and I have autonomy in my day to day work (I can make my own call schedule, am able to innovate on processes). I also feel my feedback regarding the work we do as a department and my ideas are heard and acted upon by management.","There still is not a great review structure in place. We only get reviews and are only qualified for a raise once per year (unless you move to a new team). Because of this there is a lot of turnover in the teams and this can be tumultuous and feel overwhelming (constantly having to pick up work from people who are leaving to seek better pay). I personally have experienced having to wait an unexplained amount of time to receive a promotion, only to realize the reason I had to wait was so the company could lump together my promotion and my annual raise I was already receiving. It was disappointing to say the least - and when I tried to negotiate salary I was shot down. There is never a good explanation as to why you are receiving the raise that you are, and oftentimes management is not transparent about things like pay. 

If you work in services (Customer Success specifically) it is going to be at least one year until you feel fully confident with the product and you are qualified to move to another team. The first year at AppFolio can be rough because of the learning curve and the difficult customers you will have to deal with in the Customer Success queues. But if you stick it out the benefits of the next many years you will likely spend with AppFolio are absolutely worth it!"

The company focuses on their customers which has been the recipe for success.   There are a ton of growth opportunities and AppFolio invests in it's people.   I'm happy I made the choice to trust AppFolio with my career.",As a growing company its hard to stay connected to everyone especially those in different locations.
464,AppFolio,Great people make a great company,2018-10-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked at AppFolio for a little over four years. I agree with what I'm reading in the rest of the positive reviews on here -- this is a great company, full of awesome people. I've had numerous opportunities to grow my career, and I'm happy with the challenges and opportunities I've been given.

AppFolio is obviously a tech company, but it feels less like a 'startup' than it did when I first started working here. That's not a bad thing -- it just feels like we're a little more deliberate in how we make decisions. We still have the (organic) snacks, the dogs, the standing desks, the Macs, the brightly-painted walls, the candy, the ping-pong tables, arcade machine, lots of PTO, and all those other perks that say ""Don't worry, you're not working at the Sears corporate office"". 

In my opinion, AppFolio's upper management have done a stellar job of steering the ship. We still have a lot of room to grow in this industry, and the list of things we could build is a mile long. Our leadership team has done a great job of prioritizing features and functions to make sure that we don't over-extend ourselves, while  providing a ton of value to our customers. 

We have a set of company values that were drafted by the co-founders when AppFolio first started, about ten years ago. One of my favorites is 'Great people make a great company' -- this really rings true for me. AppFolio is full of smart, friendly, considerate and genuinely nice people. It's not that we're giving each other hugs in the hallways all day long, but there's a real sense of openness and trust that comes from a culture like this. People will obviously come to meetings with opposing views or priorities, but in my experience it's easy to navigate through difficult situations because you can always start by assuming the other person has good intentions.","I've noticed some 'con-ments' on Glassdoor around compensation. I think it's an important issue, and all else being equal, I'm sure we all want a bigger paycheck. My two cents is that AppFolio has a very fair compensation structure, with solid PTO, health insurance, 401k and other things that are generally the subject of conversation with your doting grandparents.

In the past couple of years, AppFolio has become more transparent about the way the compensation structure works, which has been helpful to me both as an employee and as a manager. I had an awesome promotion experience with my current manager, where I was able to have a productive discussion about my goals and understand the framework the company uses to determine compensation. 

There are no real cons to speak of, except for minor ones that directly stem from the fact that we're a fast-growing company. For example, it can sometimes be hard to find available conference rooms, and sometimes we run out of fresh raspberries to put on our organic yogurt and granola in the morning. Tragic, I know."

I started my career here as a Sales Development Rep (Now known as Business Development Rep), and was able to make my way up the ranks to where I was eventually leading the team. The department gave me a great knowledge base of the type of clients we search for and the Real Estate Industry as a whole. I truly felt valued by my team and management, but the job itself was definitely a grind.

- Plenty of PTO
- Flexible hours

The business has many different facets so if you're willing you can move laterally to work in various roles.

AppFolio has an excellent product, which seems to help all teams across the board.  It's easier to support, sell, market, build, and promote a great product than a bad one.","The thing about working at Appfolio is that your experience will largely be determined by where you are in your career.  You will probably enjoy it if this is your first professional job after college, or perhaps if you are just looking for a job to pay the bills for a while.  In either case, plan to stay no more than a year or two and keep your expectations low.

I worked for AppFolio 4+ years and consider it a good starting point for a career but not a place to build your career long-term.

Here are the cons:

1. External Promotion
AppFolio fills a lot of management positions by hiring externally.  This means less opportunity for you, the hard-working employee.  Of course this is good news if you are on the outside and interviewing for such a position!

2. Promotions are Simply Title Changes
While internal promotions do happen, they are usually nothing more than a changing of your title and don't offer much, if any, additional responsibility or true growth with respect to what you do on a day to day basis.  It's worth sticking around until you get a ""Senior"" title if that's what you're after but for those wanting more than that, then it might be time to move on.  Lateral movement is great to a point, but it's treated as if it's a promotion like you're supposed to be happy that you can't get promoted but you can job hop all you want.

3. Inconsistent Rules / Guidelines
Compliance rules are set in place but when a customer doesn't fit in the regulations and employee sticks to the rules, management then appeases customer and doesn't always back up employees even though they were doing exactly what they were told to do.

4. Incompetency is Overlooked
It is way too easy for employees, and yes managers too, to get by while barely keeping up with their job.  Managers and directors seem to just not care how employees perform.  If work piles up for one employee they will just dole it out to the rest, in essence giving extra work to those who are trying to stay ahead.  Where's the motivation to work hard if you know your co-workers performance is lackluster and you will end up with some of their clients/work anyway?

5. Yes Men/Women are Rewarded
This one has to be the worst.  AppFolio's culture has a very fake air to it, and it is no where more evident than when an inept employee gets a promotion.  Why would such employee get a promotion you ask?  It is because they agree with everything the boss says and are also vocal about how much they love AppFolio.
What upper management wants more than anything is for you to be a proud promoter of the company, it's culture, and just be smiling and positive all the time.  While there's nothing wrong with that at all (in fact is a good thing because who wants to work at a company where everyone is negative?), in this case the pendulum has swung wayyy too far to the happy-go-lucky side of things.  So much so, that we have these cases where management is willing to turn a blind eye to the incompetency and instead reward the positivity.  Sadly, I watched this happen many times and it really does take away the motivation to do your best work.

6. Fake, Very Fake
As a continuation of the last con, the culture seems very forced and not entirely genuine.  It was genuine at one time and some of that has continued but for the most part you get the sense while working there that behind the smile, your manager or co-worker is really just out for himself/herself.

7. Pretend to Want Feedback
Speaking up in meetings is encouraged but in reality they only want you to go along with everything the manager or director is saying, don't try to come up with alternative solutions.  Basically if you reiterate what a manager just said in a different way and agree with them, you will be applauded.
Employee surveys are sent out every so often which is a great way to provide feedback but for the most part things don't change in response to the surveys.  It seems that the motivation for the surveys is more to influence and convince employees that AppFolio is a great place to work than collect feedback."

You have to deescalate as best you can, you may contact property managers but they are also very busy that sometimes you cannot reach them. 

I worked here during the time there was several hurricanes in the US, and most of our tenants got hit. This was a very hard time for me to deal with, as i created WO and submitted them to vendors.. sometimes it would take days for them to assist..NOW that is not Appfolios fault - Technicians can't work in the rain or they were booked with other WO.

My advise to those who take on this position have to prepare for situations that can affect there mental health. I would go home thinking about work, dreaming it, talking to my friends about it. It was unhealthy, you have to be mental strong and even though i was doing a great job at work I didn't feel like I was truly helping  those over the phone."

The manager doesn't support their employees and expects them to be chained at their desks the whole day. Doesn't understand the sales process at the company. Does not want their employees to take advantage of the reasons why the company is so great (ie: Dogs, snacks, committees, lunchtime yoga, quick walk breaks) Even though this position is not an actual sales job the manager puts an unreasonable amount of pressure on their employees. During 1:1's the manager resorts to destructive criticism and tries to instill fear in their employees. The job is easy enough, but I would stay away if you clash with people who are power hungry.

-The company is very transparent about their revenue and goals and makes sure everyone understands why.
- The number of females heading the teams. This to me, was especially inspirational considering tech and sales is a male dominated industry.
- Fully stocked kitchen. Occasional lunches,  donuts on Fridays, bagels every other day.
- On-site Fitness classes.","- The favoritism was obvious.
- An environment that fosters mostly extroverts. I felt very pressured to participate in team outings and be best friends with everyone.
- There needs to be a better understanding of growth and career paths. I was told that career paths were open and was dependent on an employee's interest. However, it's such a vague answer that I felt like my only option for growth was in my department.

Associates have found out what some of these managers are saying about them, which is why they have given up trying to work harder and have resorted to gossiping.

While AppFolio encourages employees to own their careers, they also go to great lengths to develop and retain their top talent and invest heavily in personal and professional growth opportunities to help them be successful.","It's been a challenge to avoid all of the temptations around the office.

Having to like where you work is extremely important since this is where you spend a majority of your week. Not only do we have a great space to work in, but the people who work here as well make the job. AppFolio does a wonderful job at hiring people that are alike, are motivated people, and most importantly, are friendly people. The job details only take you so far, but it is the energy, atmosphere, and culture that set it apart from other companies in the area.  

The second biggest piece of it, for me, is the opportunities available. AppFolio and its upper management are not ones to hold their employees back from moving between departments and growing within the company. They notice the hard work, work ethic, and motivation of their staff and want to help them build their careers. Factors like these are what has helped me grow throughout the years both professionally and within my role at the company.

This is definitely a company where hard work, dedication and a willingness to learn & help your peers pays off. Do not expect to have a promotion or a title change handed to you, it is certainly earned through showing your merit.

This is truly a great place where you can begin your career out of college or if you are switching industries.

The sky truly is the limit here.",The only con that I had (compensation & benefits) has been addressed and continues to be as we grow.
577,AppFolio,"Appfolio, an amazing company",2017-07-24,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"A great place to start a career. There is a lot to learn in the SDR position and they provide a ton of support for their employees. I was only there for 4 months before being recruited for another opportunity, but I really enjoyed my time there. The SDR team in Dallas is special and all of the interactions I had with leadership throughout the company was very positive. You learn a lot about being an effective communicator and they give you plenty of freedom every day. Very little micro management but a lot of support. From my experience, they seem to have it all figured out pretty well and the future outlook of the company is incredible. And the fully stocked kitchen and ping pong table is really nice. It took a pretty incredible opportunity elsewhere for me to leave.","It's hard to think of any cons. I never dreaded going into work and they were very upfront and honest with me about performance expectations and advancement opportunities. The SDR position is a grind and isn't the most enjoyable, but you do get a lot out of it and they don't make it hard on you."
578,AppFolio,"If AppFolio was a fast food restaurant, I'd Super-Size every time!",2017-07-07,5.0,Account Executive,"I have worked at AppFolio for 4 years in virtually every position in the sales organization including Sales Development Representative, Inside Sales, Sales Ops, and Account Executive. Below are my thoughts:

First, the leadership at AppFolio is second to none. They have worked hard to create a culture of tribal knowledge and support that persists even after significant growth. You can genuinely walk up to anyone on the Sales floor to ask for help and they will put down whatever they are working on to make time for you. It's a privilege to work for a company where ""winning"" means that you win together, and your manager is looking out for your professional AND personal success. No where else will you find so many tools readily available including great sales training, 1 on 1 mentorship, extensive industry exposure, and a group of people at all levels who all want you to be successful.

Second, it's awesome to do sales at a company where we genuinely have the BEST product for our customers. This means one can be absolutely confident when talking to prospects, and every department works together to proliferate an organization centered on great software that truly changes the lives of our customers. The best part? AppFolio is continuing to surge farther and farther ahead of the competition.

Lastly, career growth at AppFolio is extensive and thoughtful. This means that the most senior people don't always get the first promotions. Instead, management develops each person based on his or her personal strengths and career goals while also following what will be best for the company. Career options are abundant with clear guidelines on what is expected of an employee to get a promotion or make a transition between departments.

Overall, AppFolio is an excellent choice for the individual who is interested in starting his/her sales career or already has 10 years of experience and is looking for a company to call home.","Don't expect to work at AppFolio and be immediately successful just because you did great at your previous sales job. It is important to work hard and put in your time to learn the product and the industry.

The company doesn't pay as generously as similar positions, but the culture and organization more than makes up for it."
579,AppFolio,Best Career & Life Decision,2017-07-07,5.0,Account Executive,"I've always made it a priority to surround myself with intelligent and genuine people. AppFolio has this in spades. Management is open to change when great ideas are presented. I've been promoted multiple times over the past 3yrs. Employees are driven, agile, and fun to be around!  (Plus, I met my wife here!)",In-house daycare would be awesome
580,AppFolio,Sr. Account Executive,2017-07-07,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"AppFolio has an amazing culture with a collaborative team across the board. From the top down there's great support to ensure you're successful as an employee. I've never worked for a company that is so aligned on goals - and one that works hard to ensure we realign with any changes. There's a nice balance of fun and hard work and it's great to be a part of a team that focuses on both equally. 

Other pros:
- benefits are great
- we give back to the community and AppFolio provides employees with volunteer opportunities often
- discounts on fitness clubs
- free fitness classes every day on-site
- they truly care about you as an employee and listen to your feedback on ways to improve",Would love more ongoing career development opportunities.
581,AppFolio,Great way to start in a growing company,2017-07-05,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"• I was an SDR for about 1 year and 3 months. I am writing this as honestly as possible. The company has a great outlook and the SDR program is still only a year or two old (in its current form) and management is constantly trying to adapt its practices.
• With my previous job being very unstructured I was able to appreciate the efficiency and structure that AppFolio and the SDR program supplied. I learned a lot within just the first 3 months there than in previous jobs / positions.
• I was not the greatest SDR (I always fell into sales roles but it isn't where I shine). I struggled quite a bit early on but I put my head down and worked hard. Support from my team and tips from management helped as well. In the end I was able to leave the role at the top of my game and move to another position within the company that fit my persona better.
• The team there is great and I made lasting friendships with my colleagues.
• The job is tough but it is a great way to get into AppFolio, especially so if you are looking to breakout and start your sales career or further your career in sales. This really is the top SDR program around. If I could do it then just about anyone can.
• Since I left the role I have heard the management and SDR program is doing a much better job at being transparent and involving SDRs in more important decisions. Also, the sales team is engaging much more with the SDRs than before.","Some of my cons have silver linings. A lot of this is what I observed and just didn't think it fit in the whole heartily in the ""Pros"" section.

• The job is a grind (50+calls a day plus emails). Management tries very hard to break up the grind with growth and self improvement through development team meetings. Essentially learning how to think positively, have resilience, and get out of your comfort zone.
• The position is best suited grow into a sales career. If you know that is what you want to do, then hit your goals and talk to the sales managers.
• Moving to a different position in AppFolio besides sales can be pretty difficult. So the downside being if you are inconsistent your options could be a bit limited. I was lucky another position came along that I was able to peruse hard and get but most other positions require 1-2 years knowledge of the AppFolio software. 
• The SDR formula works but it isn't for everyone. Follow what management and the senior team teaches you. STC is an amazing tool but you need to find your way (be a person not a robot) while still utilizing the training you get. It can be hard to explain that to management at times but if you are showing results then you will be left alone.
• This may be a stretch but I would say too many meetings. I came from a job that had a lot of meetings but this has even more. I get that meetings were used to break up the day and improve us as callers but there were a lot of times I just wanted to be on the phone hitting goals and not in another meeting. Just added to my stress but maybe that is just me."

That said, AppFolio is honestly the healthiest, happiest, most transparent culture (family) I've ever had the pleasure of being a part of. Never have I experienced a company where doing what we say and saying what we do are so closely aligned. Our values? They are real and alive - both externally and internally - not just some superfluous words on a poster or a meaningless recruiting tactic. Leadership at every level operates with integrity, ownership and without ego.  Our business model is sound, smart and agile. Stuff gets done. Decisions are made quickly but intelligently. Autonomy reigns. Balancing work and life is encouraged and modeled. Internal growth and movement is off the charts! Snacks galore, an ice machine (whoop!), fun events that bring people together and an endless desire to always raise the bar. I could go on and on and on....",Sometimes the coffee/espresso machine breaks and we have to walk downstairs or to another building for our Handlebar fix.

Plenty of opportunities to collaborate and network with other departments. Team activities like city league sports are encouraged and often sponsored.

595,AppFolio,Great company - horrendous Sales Development department,2017-04-26,3.0,Sales Development Representative,"AppFolio is a great company to work for. They offer a superior product, are an industry leader, financially solid, a bright future, offer TREMENDOUS benefits, great office locations (Santa Barbara, San Diego, Dallas), nice/new modern open floor plans, employee friendly/modern work environment, catered lunches and their famous fully stocked kitchen/free food.

In addition, one thing I highly  respected was their transparency into the company's internal finances, processes and changes. We would have monthly company meetings hosted by the CEO or VP of Sales and all the department heads would share the changes and updates. Pretty rare for a publicly traded company.","I write this with the preface that I was not a perfect employee and made some mistakes. But I was well-respected and had no HR record.

I took the SDR role under the promise in my interview that if I met all the requirements for promotion I would have an opportunity to transfer further in the Marketing department . Throughout the course of the 1 year role obligation (WAY to long to be an outbound SDR), I achieved every requirement necessary and was a top performer on the team. When I became promotable I was told there are no higher level Marketing positions in the Dallas office. So I was misled from day 1 and used for department/company production for a year. I made it clear in my interview and throughout my tenure my only intention to continue my Marketing career. To be fair, I was offered promotions to other departments. None of them were in my career path so I declined.

The SDR role is atrocious.  It's a vertical market and limited prospects. The department has been calling on the same prospects for years and AppFolio created a terrible sales tactic reputation. We were consistently reassigned accounts that were called way too many times in the past. I was instructed to even call accounts/contacts again that had previous call notes that said ""Never contact me again"", ""Do not contact"" and even people who unsubscribed from Marketing emails ""to see if things changed"". I was yelled at by prospects, pleaded with to stop calling, cussed out and hung up on countless times for continuing to call these accounts.

Inbound leads are a joke and veil of secrecy covers them. It was obvious the SDR team at corporate was fed more leads than our satellite office. We had to fight for a ""put back"" system when we were assigned garbage leads. Once we got a system, it would take management a week to approve and there was no transparency if we actually were placed back on top of the round robin.

SDR management is the most extreme passive-aggressive micro-managers I’ve ever worked for. They made a brutal job even more unbearable. It is a glorified cold-calling call center. They're obsessed with KPIs (primarily outbound calls), constantly monitoring the dashboards and would Gchat you if you're not on pace or didn’t hit your KPIs for 1 day. Even if your production (meetings set & SQLs created) were at or above quota you would be hounded. Further, if you were in trouble or they needed to talk to you they would sneak up behind your desk and say this incredibly annoying saying “Got a sec?”. 

In addition, management was the worsts leaders I’ve ever had. In my entire tenure I maybe saw them call a prospect 5 times. They had no respect from the team because of this. The Sales managers on the other hand led by example and were constantly on calls and demos with prospects. SDR management would always show these ridiculous motivational videos, give these corny speeches, and have the cheesiest sayings and emails. We also had WAAAAY too many meetings/huddles for an SDR team. 1 every morning and afternoon which we would usually play these 3rd grader games. We’d even have random end of day huddles if that wasn’t enough. We were treated like children. If you were 10 minutes late from lunch you got a scolding. If you were gone from your desk “too long” they would come find you. 

There were LOTS of broken promises that included:
*Monthly team outings. We had maybe 5 in my 14 months
*Misquoted monthly bonus amounts - We requested they be written into our comp 
 plan to prevent this, but was told they “may change monthly” and would be too difficult.
*Constantly changing and unclear promotion requirements
*We were encouraged to give department feedback, but it was used against you

The pay is atrocious for the job and bearing the manager. You start at $18/hr. Per Glassdoor, the average starting salary for an SDR in Dallas is $22/hr.

To sum it up, in my 14 months there 18 SDRs either quit (14) or got fired (4) and only 3 were promoted. Says it all!

If you want to work for a great company apply at AppFolio. Just not as an SDR unless you’re looking for a miserable, dead-end entry level cold-calling job!"
596,AppFolio,Great Company From Top Down!,2017-04-25,5.0,Implementation Services,"We are customer centric. We build great software and genuinely care about the relationships we build with our users.

Executives hold regular company meetings to keep all of us in the know about what we are doing as a company.

Many opportunities to collaborate across departments. This is great for networking, building relationship and professional skills, and gives opportunity to make an impact on a large scale.

Once you have put in the time and effort there is a ton of opportunity. We have a ton of great people. Hard work and commitment are rewarded.

I have been at AppFolio for just over 6 years. My career has grown, my salary has grown, and I have grown (my second job out of college).

I have been treated well by everyone from our CEO, to VP's, directors, and managers. I genuinely feel like I can approach anyone in the company. My opinions and those of my colleagues are valued.

The company looks for feedback from our employees, regularly, and spends a great deal of effort building on the positive and addressing any concerns.

On a personal level, Appfolio leadership has proven to me that they want to see me succeed. The support is tremendous. It speaks volumes that I have received such a great level of support at a growing and successful company.",AppFolio pays fairly but Santa Barbara is an expensive city to live in (arguably worth it).

Implementation is such a great department to join.

The product is slick and cutting edge.  The Engineering and Product teams have their fingers on the pulse of the property management industry and understand how to release product that really makes a difference in the lives of our clients!  

The pay is very comparable to other local software companies for a Success position.  And contrary to some reviews, Customer Success offers a lot of room to grow with the company both personally and professionally, but there is a natural order.

For starters, you have to put in time to master the product, which has a steep learning curve and is constantly changing and improving.  This can take well over a year, so you have to be patient.  

You also have to show middle and senior management you are dedicated to the company and are willing to roll up your sleeves and put your time in.  The company is growing a lot and positions are always opening up.

I was in MCC. I worked crazy hours for a long time. I was there in the building completely alone during times when I definitely should not have been-wasn't safe, power outages, etc. I had impeccable numbers even for the odd hours. I was continuously jerked around in regards to a raise or a department transfer, just like most everyone else was. I will admit there were transfers to other departments but that was not common. You were always told why you couldn't transfer out or couldn't get a raise rather than being told how to achieve those things. So there is little growth in MCC.

I definitely should have left earlier than I did but I had hopes that I would get what I was worth at some point. That had a lot to do with there being almost no transparency with management and the demeaning manner in which they ""managed"" the teams. It was borderline verbal abuse in most cases.

- Kitchen
- Chance to earn a few extra bucks here and there
- Software is great
- Other departments seem to have fun...","Where to begin? Clearly the October 17th review isn't a real employee, only been there for a month, or they were told to say something. The previous negative reviews from the past year are dead on. Seriously.... take those into heavy consideration when thinking about applying for the company as an SDR.

The executive team really doesn't care about the SDR department. They tell us we are the heart of the company and sales (duh... every SDR department is) and our feedback is heard. Is it though Mrs. CMO? Have you read these SDR reviews on Glassdoor? How has the executive team and management not put two and two together? We know why ;)

Managers drink any flavor that is given to them by the executive team. Speaking of managers, lies lies lies. They are really good at micromanagement (they should write a book about it), not fighting for you, using your words against you, and covering up everything they say. Often times they tell you one thing, it'll change, they won't tell you it changed, you're still believing and achieving for the originally thing, and then once you achieve it, they'll say, ""Oh. Sorry. Forgot to tell you. It's actually..."". Examples of this include but not limited to: KPIs, bonus pay outs, promotion criteria, department transfer

The ""anonymous"", optional employee survey. We were told to take it and encouraged to say good things. They practically watched us fill it out. You think any SDR is going to be honest? Anonymous surveys in a company don't exist.

The pay is awful for an SDR and the bonus/commission you get when the ISR/AE decides to make it an Opportunity (fair?) is a joke. Plus, most SDR departments will pay either a bonus or a commission of the final sale to the SDR. This happens at AppFolio only if you've suffered enough as an SDR and made it to White Belt, Ninja, Green Beret, or whatever dumb thing they decide to call it.

SDR jobs are a dime a dozen in the D/FW Metroplex. I guess it's because of this reality that they think they can easily put a body in a seat, so they don't change and listen to actual reviews and complaints. The executive team won't change. If you're looking for an SDR job, I highly encourage you to read all the reviews and make an educated decision. The company culture is great. I'll give you that. But as an SDR within the company under the current management and executive team...

I can't wait to read the CMO's response. I'm sure it'll be a generic thank you, we value our SDR team members, we strive to be the best, blah blah blah. I've met all the executive team over my 13+ months of employment there and they are all fake and clueless. Why didn't I leave earlier? Because I was promised several things and believed in that. Guess I saw that light.

But at the end of the day, executive team doesn't take the SDRs opinions into any consideration. Because if they did, the management, current atmosphere/mood, and turnover rate wouldn't be what it is."

In fairness, the job is not for everyone - but like with anything worth doing, you get out what you put in.

My manager was also incredibly condescending, unprofessional in many ways, and expressed blatant favoritism. He was thrown into this role with no management experience (and no sales experience either).

I am honestly surprised by the positive reviews of this position. The discontent with management was frequently expressed by many members of the team, including top performers. Turnover was high, which our team felt was due to mismanagement in many cases. 

No clear path to promotion - Many top performers (which I will admit, I was not one of them) had a promotion dangled in front of them for the purpose of improving their performance and boosting their numbers. However, when it came to promotion, they were overlooked. 

What was most frustrating was how differently our manager acted toward upper management in comparison to how how he treated his team. Management seemed to promote those who were ""coachable"" rather than those who had good leadership abilities - patience, experience, maturity, and skill."

632,AppFolio,Great Company to Grow Your Career,2016-08-24,5.0,,"I have found no lack of opportunity for advancement in the Customer Success department. In the three years I have worked here I have had three different job titles and five different salaries, all within Customer Success, which is unheard of in most industries. I was uniquely lucky to take over one of the Customer Success teams two years ago, and have been given a ridiculous amount of autonomy and freedom to shape and improve the team as I and my team have seen fit, with the support of my manager and the higher department leadership all along the way.

The company is certainly growing. A year ago that meant there were endless possibilities for future promotions to jobs that didn't even exist yet - the Optimistic Unknown. Today it means the company is constantly redoubling its efforts to make sure its employees feel taken care of and valued as we continue to expand. Company Value #3: Great People Make a Great Company. 

Also, who doesn't love a fully stocked kitchen, oodles of PTO, and an AMAZING group of coworkers?","Customer Success is, at its core, an entry level position. Most new hires (though of course there are notable exceptions) take this job straight out of college and have no other work experience prior to AppFolio. Because of this, the salary starts pretty low, since the first six months of a team member's career here is spent in a training/probationary period where the company is investing a ton of training and professional resources to bring them up to full speed on the customer service team, which deals primarily in helping Property Managers with their day-to-day accounting.

Six months in, though, there is opportunity for salary increase and title change, and it continues from there. A dedicated team member who is willing to work through the ranks will be highly rewarded, assuming the team member is thinking long term and appreciating the soft reward they are receiving from the position (professional skills, leadership opportunities, etc) in addition to the salary.

It is difficult sometimes for new employees, straight out of college, to know what to look for in the larger picture, but as long as you can realize that it is a career you are building in this position (and not just a job) then you will be able to see the amazing opportunity that this company and specifically the Customer Success department can afford you."

They want you to think they're devoted to you as an employee and say one of their values is to, ""Do the right thing, because it's good for business."" But they don't pay staff what they are worth for their work. I've also seen a number of people get promoted into new positions and start taking on more responsibilities but not get a pay increase for as long as a month or more! This is mainly in customer success. 

The explanation for this is that ""HR is just too busy"" or ""HR takes time to pass these things through"". But in the meantime the staff is expected to continue working a more demanding position without a corresponding pay increase. That sound like doing the right thing to you?

They'll try to lure you in with the cool atmosphere and ""perks"" like a pool table, and free snacks, but at the end of the day their compensation package is garbage and they regularly underpay. Also the company still isn't profitable yet, so if you're looking at the big picture then that's an issue that can't continue and doesn't look good for the company if they can't turn a profit.

There are a number of positions here that are dead end positions that don't really lead anywhere within the company and don't have a clear promotion path. Many customer success managers, some positions in value added services.

At the end of the day it's an okay place to work in terms of atmosphere and people, but don't stay for too long because the earning potential simply isn't worth it."

659,AppFolio,Bleed blue,2016-02-03,5.0,Sales Leader,"Over time every role evolves from green to ripe to rotten. If you're lucky enough to be in an environment that feels ripe for years and years - hang on to it! Appfolio is that ripe place for me and I feel lucky (along with prove I'm deserving) every day. 

The reality is that success is equal parts environment & personal mindset . Appfolio's environment is inspired from the top down as a place that celebrates excellence and strives for continued improvement. AppFolio is on the cutting edge; we're inventing, innovating, and optimizing in every department from Engineering to Customer Success. Every time I read about a new Sales technique from a SaaS thought leader it's a technique we implemented months ago and are already executing and optimizing. It's the environment that has kept me ripe for a long time and makes rotten seem like a myth.

Regarding personal mindset - Belief governs behavior.  Believe you'll win, and you will. Focusing on something negative that you can't change is simply not useful. You'll be successful here if you are genuine, positive, and motivated by achieving success for yourself and a team. If you're resistant to change, love pointing out a mistake, and only care about yourself... become a tax auditor.","The cons of working at AppFolio are like the saying, ""once mans trash is another mans treasure.""

One's Trash: Vertical market means work is repetitive.  
One's Treasure: Instead of focusing on different personas, a million different use cases or value props focus is instead turned to mastery and execution. 

One's Trash: Appfolio expects a lot from their people
One's Treasure: People more frequently fall to the lowest denominator than rise to the occasion. Working at a place with a very high ""low bar"" means everyone is putting out 100%"

There's more, but if you go into this job as an individual knowing some of these things you might be more prepared for the REAL AppFolio.","Cramped spaces, managers don't lead by example.

679,AppFolio,SDR and loving it!,2015-10-07,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"I interviewed at quite a few places companies between Santa Barbara and San Francisco, and have to say that AppFolio beats them all. I’ve been on the SDR team for a little over a year now and have loved it. The job is hard, yes. But you have a great team around to support and motivate you. Company culture here is huge. Every week we have pod races where the winning team gets lunch at Hollister Brew Co or Bowling at Zodos, etc. You are showered with gift cards to all the best eateries in Santa Barbara. And where do they get these prize ideas? From the team! Management is always looking for new ideas from us about how things can be better. It’s a public company with a small company feel, which is invaluable. You always feel like you’re making a difference. I mean, in the mornings I get coffee with the CEO, Brian Donahoo, and talk to him about books - where else does that happen?! The small company culture goes hand in hand with opportunities for growth. If you work hard and do well, you’re recognized. You’re asked to speak at Quarterly meetings, you’re promoted to a coaching position where you can share best practices, and of course, a nice “thank you” commission check. 

This was my first sales job, but I am so grateful for the top-notch training I’ve received here. Keeping in mind all the fun we have here, what ultimately makes this company so successful is its structure. I get face time with my manager every day and from day one he’s worked endlessly with me to get better and better. He always makes sure that he’s available and a resource to everyone not only when it comes to everyday minutiae, but also for career advice. Every Monday morning, while everyone’s still shaking off the cobwebs, he’s booming with energy! For my birthday, he actually went to 4 different bakeries to get me the perfect vegan cupcake #dedication.

There’s complete transparency about where you stand in the company and with the team. What you put in is what you get out and I’ve seen that time and time again with people that I’ve coached. I personally love this position because the learning never stops. There’s always something more you can do to and a little extra you can put in. If you want a company where you can have an impact, grow your career and make tons of friends in the process, this is the place for you.","Since it is a growing company sometimes we run out of snacks in the afternoons.

Considering this is my first job out of college, I could not be happier with my decision to join this team. 

The SDR role itself is a fantastic introduction into the fast paced sales of a tech company. The training you will receive will be superlative to the industry. You will not learn how to be a telemarketer; you will learn how to be a consultant, and a good one at that. Expect the same training that you'd receive at tech giant in Silicon Valley but with more personalized attention. Training is also ongoing as we meet multiple times a week to sharpen our sales acumen. 

In terms of culture, AppFolio is full on fun, energetic people that give this company such a unique vibe. Expect lots of catered lunches, retail gift cards, ping pong tournaments, and enough AppFolio t-shirts to fill your entire wardrobe. There are a ton of dogs at the office, too.

Couple times a year, employees are pressured into delivering a work related project in 24 hrs, in exchange for food, beer and shirts/sweaters.

The pay and benefits are mediocre, compared to the quality, quantity, responsibility and impact of work. 

Raises are on the weak side. No profit sharing at this time. Number of Options granted at a time is now low and doesn't off set the low end of pay.

Seems like the company is deliberately leveraging work relationships and atmosphere in order to pay on the lower end."
708,AppFolio,They've spoiled me...,2014-12-09,5.0,Implementation Specialist,"They foster a culture of employee appreciation and respect. I left the company due to relocation, and I've since then compared every company to them (and none have yet surpassed or really even come close). There are companies that say they are like AppFolio, with the perks and great environment and transparency, but AppFolio is everything it says it is. I know I will have a hard time finding a company with as much heart as they do business sense, but its reassuring to know that they are out there.",My only con was the distance I had to drive. I lived in the city and the office is about 15 miles outside the city. That's not their fault- I just wished the commute was shorter.

712,AppFolio,Not as happy as they want you to believe,2014-11-16,2.0,Implementation Manager,"Free food, happy hour nights, tee shirts, costumes.","Staff is robotic, processes come before quality, management is below average at best. Company culture is targeted at the very young looking for a first job. Cronyism among top management is rampant. Not for anyone who wants to put quality work before production line quantity. Take a look at their Appfolio ""Happy"" video on YouTube. It's insane."
713,AppFolio,"Good company, just not for me",2014-11-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The culture of the company is incredible. Tribal knowledge is the backbone of the sales department and everyone truly cares about the team effort.  Dress code is relaxed (I wear jeans to work everyday). All managers are there to help in any way they can!  If you work hard and are successful there are many opportunities to advance within the company.,"I have nothing negative to say about the company, I just found the job to be very boring. Every position in the company is a full-on desk job and I just found myself unable to be successful in that type of environment."
714,AppFolio,"Amazing Company, Ton of Career Opportunity",2014-10-28,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The leadership team does a great job of instilling a strong company culture. It is a very positive, open environment and everyone is very welcoming. You immediately feel like a member of the family and make new friends that extend beyond work. We are incredibly spoiled with food, fun AppFolio gear, fitness, happy hours, company parties & contests. There is never a dull day at the office.

In addition to the great atmosphere, it's exciting to be a part of a company that is growing so quickly. Every year we establish company initiatives that actually get implemented and completed. This is awesome to be a part of and gives you a sense of accomplishment. Our strong leadership team knows how to effectively lead each department and keep everyone in line with company goals. I feel honored to learn from the managers above me, there is a lot to learn for those early on in their careers. 

New employees also have the plus of a strong benefits packet. For the entry-level positions, it's rare to find a company that offers PTO (and a lot of it) & full healthcare coverage from the start. For the Services department, you have the option for a promotion after 6 months, that is unheard of at most companies! Overall I have nothing to say but great things and am excited to see what's to come.","I have no complaints. As a member of the Services department and Customer Success team, I feel the complete opposite of most of the other listed cons. Our department has the most promotions and team growth of any department, month over month. Experienced Services members also have the opportunities to move into other teams and departments which allows for further career advancement. Customer service is not an ""easy"" job, but any candidate just looking for a resume builder should find elsewhere. You'll quickly find that “easy” is boring and has less pay off long-term. AppFolio is a great company for motivated people looking to work hard and do their part to contribute to a growing company. Promotions and raises aren't given because of length of employment, they are something earned. I appreciate this at AppFolio because it allows the motivated employees to be rewarded for their hard work and stand out at the company. For new hires right out of college, it's best to understand that you need to work hard and be patient in the working world (one year at a company is not that long!!!). Promotions are earned and there is plenty of opportunity for them at AppFolio."

The company is always growing looking to promote talent from within.  They offer great training and a great opportunity to get hands on experience doing something that matters.  To top if off, the senior leadership has created a great company atmosphere and set the company up to be very successful long term.","Nothing bad to say.  Appfolio is a fast pace and growth minded company.   If you do not mind showing up to work and giving your best, there are no cons.  However if you are looking for a clock in/out job allowing you to coast, its not the place for you.  The company rewards hard work and talent."

Most people are intelligent, motivated, and fun to be around. It makes work more enjoyable. Additionally there are many skilled people within the company who know their stuff and are available to learn from. Fun atmosphere, free snacks, relaxed but focused work environment. Great place for people who are serious about getting work done, but like to have fun along the way.","Employees in customer success are under-compensated for the stress and effort the job requires. They put too much work on our plate, and expect long days with no added benefits for working overtime. When we speak with clients, most of them are upset they can't get a response quick enough because we are so over-encumbered with clients that we don't have enough time to respond to everybody promptly. Even if we work 10 hour days, clients must wait because it's too much work for too few people. This is (hopefully) a temporary thing, but the expectations for us are simply unrealistic at this point."
721,AppFolio,Great company - Has it's cons thought,2014-07-07,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"Great people, good benefits, free snacks, work out classes, occasional happy hours and fun work events.","The client base a CS manager will work with with will eventually wear you down as they can be very demanding and sometimes very rude.  In the beginning you have a lot to look forward such as possible advancement into a different departments and your 6 month raise/ benefit acquisition.  Lets get real though, no one wants to be in customer support as a career choice.  You take the position in order to move up and grow your resume.  So if the department your looking into doesn't need any extra people or they find someone more qualified you could find yourself stuck.  You have the possibility to move up within the department but the pay is weak compared to any other position in the company.  We have a top notch sales staff so it just keeps getting busier and you end up working more hours yet you keep getting paid the same regardless of effort or performance.  It becomes very tough to stay positive and motivated."
