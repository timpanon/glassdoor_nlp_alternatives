- Great people on the ground who care about their work and the people around them 
- Management can be good depending on your organization
- We were well supported during the pandemic","- Constant re-organization of departments with little insights or transparency into how it impacts the teams getting moved around 
- Leadership above the people managers do not care about employees in any meaningful way 
- There is a lot of lip service from the C staff around valuing teams and people that does not translate into day-to-day life at Autodesk 
- People managers are not able to effectively reward team members who work hard
- Promotions are slow to come, if at all
- Lack of clear direction on how to grow and improve or move to a new team
- Leadership is always turning over and with each new leader comes a change of direction which leaves employees feeling unsure of what we're actually doing
- The company uses a lot of legacy software or overly customized software that can make simple tasks challenging to complete 
- Each purchase of a new company leads to splintered off business practices that don't integrate well with already existing systems and processes"

The people that work at Autodesk are truly exceptional, friendly environment that encourages sharing ideas and being creative.",Could look to increase some of the base salarys to compete with market trends
27,Autodesk,"Innovative, Growing and Positive, but also Siloed and Slogging through internal transition",2022-03-25,4.0,"Sr. Manager, Operations","Autodesk produces products you can be proud of and is committed to making an impact for customers and on the world around us.  Autodesk works hard to be ethical and takes extra steps to 'walk the talk'.  Autodesk makes the tools that people use to design and make.... well, everything.  Internally, that's a source of genuine pride.  

From an employee perspective, Autodesk tries very hard to treat people with respect, adhere to its published values and - when push comes to shove, STICK to those values... unlike some other Bay Area companies that might be more willing to compromise their stated values (e.g.: 'don't be evil' ..... ).  

Autodesk is in the midst of a huge transition:  from perpetual license to subscription, from desktop to cloud, from narrow function applications to end-to-end integration, from a loose collection of complementary point products to platform company.  It's interesting, but also exhausting, don't even think of interviewing here if you honestly regard your work-ethic as anything but ""HIGH"" and ""Driven"".  It can be very rewarding, the over-all strategy makes sense and progress toward those mid-term and long-term goals is undeniable.  Autodesk does not just talk.... we DO.

All-in, if you are smart, talented, hard-working and really give a damn about what your work contributes to, Autodesk may be fore you.","Autodesk is 40 years old and going through a mid-life transformation.  Every infrastructure system is in transformation; products are at various stages of their transition to Cloud enablement, and the drive to be a platform company is ( finally ) real this time.  Entry-level positions do a lot of transaction volume and there's some question about whether compensation is competitive.  Mid-level positions work relentlessly - that's driven both by the internal pace of change as well as business growth - be prepared.  There are politics at play in Director-level and above; and it's an internal joke that 'nothing is guaranteed but death, taxes and Autodesk re-organizations'.  the Alphabet soup of Org acronyms coupled with the reorganization of the quarter makes it tough to know who does what.  As Autodesk has grown it has become more corporate, and it's easy to play ""Buzzword Bingo"" with the Org announcements and scope changes.  Product divisions don't understand the infrastructure that runs the company, and are the worst communicators I've ever seen in terms of sharing their product plans with the upstream and downstream groups who will bear the workload of their decisions.  The customer experience is complex, and end customers frequently become frustrated but the experience of simply accessing and managing their software investments.  The company has a habit of doing 3X yearly employee surveys but does not always honestly assess what employees are telling them, and it feels like Autodesk will put more effort into 'spinning' the survey results than addressing the raised issues.  H.R. support is weak after a recently departed H.R. V.P. gutted the department and tried to turn it into a ticket-driven, self service support function and I doubt those folks have time to breathe.  Still, every company has challenges and Autodesk's heart is in the right place.  We're on a journey to be better, and that's made tougher by the span and rate of change, as well as the rapid growth of recent years - but things are trending up."

There are no initiatives for employee retention, and there is a huge pay gap between incoming and existing workers. Autodesk isn’t a top tech company, so it doesn’t attract top talent.

Pay is high but that’s to make up for the rest of the cons and it’s an illusion at the end of the day because the increases are not real-they are always based on you staying for another three years.",Culture-either outright aggressive or passive aggressive with no consequences for actions and no need to treat people like human beings. Constant changes-either layoffs or the next day you are on a new team you didn’t choose with people who likely don’t even work in your city. Be careful what you say-they say it’s an open culture where all thoughts are welcome-it is anything but and one statement that suggests you are challenging ideas or not “being a team player”-you will be punished. Most people have spent their entire careers at the company. They have never left to see how other cultures work or to even get new ideas. It’s a very incestuous place lacking any real innovation.

53,Autodesk,Good benefits and work if you are in the right team and you are under 40,2022-03-10,3.0,Principal Software Engineer,"Good benefits including unlimited vacations, equitable distribution of RSUs, ESPP, $1000 towards wellness benefits, healthy employer contribution towards healthcare. Great inclusive work culture. Great diversity initiatives. Remote work friendly.","Autodesk operates as a large corporation with many underlying orgs and projects that fight for relevance. They constantly change priorities which tends to mean a lot of instability for developers/staff. Losing relevance equates to layoffs. Gaining relevance equates to promotions and higher priority. At the start of each calendar year, upper management assigns a priority number to each project. If the project you are on slides down the priority list, you will eventually get laid off and your position get transferred to a higher priority project regardless of your inherent talent. 

Autodesk is not good at retaining and moving talent within their org. Sometimes you'll see layoffs and hirings at the same time for the same type of positions! They prefer to hire externally. This is also a way they get rid of more expensive, senior staff in favor of younger talent graduating from college. The word they use is 'redundant' to get rid of people around January about every 2 years. They are not great at forecasting resource needs to prevent the redundancy in the first place.

Autodesk tends to also have a high turnover. Most of their employees are new as of the last few years. They have trouble retaining talent.

All this said, it's still a stimulating place to work if you don't stick to one position more than 3-4 years. Jump to different projects internally (you'll have to re-interview) to avoid getting stuck in a project that loses priority. All projects, outside of the big ones, will eventually lose priority. 

The employees that have been around decades did so by anticipating which projects are on the rise and downfall and strategically jumping ship to the next shining ball while also building an internal network to help them.

The pay is good but not on the level of FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Netlfix, Google, Amazon,etc..)."

- have ERGs, and mentorship groups
- got to enjoy various exciting belonging group and activities: pool games, maker club, etc. before Covid
- Vibrant office & ergonomic 'auto-desk'
- Lots of horizontal jobs around","- Middle manager have too much control over individual promotion, growth, exposure,etc. If you get a good manager it is heaven, but once you got the bad one, it is absolute hell. And mind you there are some bad apples around.
- System is old, outdated, lots of data integrity issue and all in silos. The company will need lots lots of effort & time to revamp all of this.
- Low salary and very difficult to get increment. Small % increment even if there is any.
- HR is useless. There was an ex colleague who had sexual misconduct issue, HR cant do anything and asked her to still talk to the perpetrator, so she needs to quit.
- No psychological safety. Even GLINTS employee survey is just a way to bully the individual
- Getting a promotion / job progression is very difficult and some even get same or lower pay.

They carry a very liberal mindset and indoctrination when it comes to Covid. If you're like that, this would be a pro. But for a company that touts inclusivity, they are not inclusive of those who have chosen a natural route of handling Covid as apposed to the vaccine. They disparage such employees even to the point of threatening employment (although thankfully for me it has only remained as a threat). Such work environment has made it less enjoyable to work here when one thing is touted and a very different thing is practiced, and it is disappointing.

Another Con would be their career advancement opportunity really looks at predominately Autodesk experience. So if you get into the wrong department, it becomes a very tedious journey of climbing the proverbial ladder to get anywhere, even if with past experience you are more qualified than half the people of a job ""two rungs up."""

Opportunities to do graduate rotations in whatever team you like if you ask for it.,"The grad scheme is marketed as an opportunity to get your engineering career going with design & make projects. In reality, once you have finished the year of rotations there are almost no permanent roles available in this area. The focus is more on customer engaging roles such as content creation, QA, presenting & training, and the occasional customer visit. 
In the past, permanent roles for graduates could be created if you had an interest in a specific area, however this is no longer possible. Due to corporate goals, if any budget is released due to someone leaving, this budget is quickly moved to other areas. Therefore it is very difficult to progress your career if you would like to remain in a mechanical engineering type role.
In order to be recognised within the company a lot of self-promotion is required."

The team was expected to work long hours including early mornings and late nights, there was no recognition or career growth opportunities, and the pandemic further intensified discontinuity among the team. Overall the team seemed overworked as management has no room for human error and continually increases workload without adding resources."

219,Autodesk,Disappointing,2021-11-27,2.0,Software Engineer,My colleagues are pleasant and intelligent. Work life balance is currently good. Global holidays are nice.,"We have been working from home since March 2020 and this has been a great success, we have genuinely been as productive at home as in the office, honestly in my case my performance has been greater while working from home. Despite this, management in the Birmingham office seem very keen to push us towards a return to the office early next year. Autodesk has introduced a global company-wide ""workplace flexibility"" programme which allows most employees to change their working pattern to hybrid-remote, under hybrid-remote there is no minimum requirement to be in the office other than specific instances which your managment chain deem to be useful for team collaboration. Organisations have adopted this in varying ways. In the Birmingham office this has been made clear to mean ""2-3 days a week in the office"". This is an issue as in a recent employee survey it came out that over half of employees in my organisation wish to be in the office no more than 1 day a week. Despite this, managment are taking a hard stance on this, rejecting flexible working applications from people who have re-located in the last 18 months and increasingly trying to push the idea of returning to the office on the rest of us. A lot of employees here are currently waiting in hope that managment will eventually cave in and allow more flexibility, otherwise people will be left with no choice but to leave the company for a role that is more remote friendly. If this happens the company will surely struggle to hire experienced engineers to fill the vacancies, there has already been an ongoing problem with hiring experienced engineers for roles here and this will only get worse if we're forced to go into the office so often. 
The office itself is also in an undesireable location, if the office was in the city centre rather than an industrial park in Small Heath people might feel differently about returning. I would very much advise any prospective employee to check out the surrounding location to the office if they don't get an opportunity to see it during the hiring process.
Pay could be better, especially given the recent tech salary boom."

222,Autodesk,What a transformation,2021-11-25,1.0,Territory Sales,I’ve joined Autodesk because of its reputation of a supposedly amazing company with great culture.,"After joining, I have realized after a few quarters how the story was only belonging to the past.

For someone who have an Engineering background, working at Autodesk was an awesome experience! Autodesk do help people MAKE things and it is rewarding to see a lot of those work made my customers become a reality using Autodesk products!

The upper leadership do care about its people which was demonstrated even more during the pandemic. Autodesk did everything it can, plus more, to accommodate and help its employees during the pandemic.","It has grown so fast that some divisions may have become to arrogant. It seems more difficult to enter into different roles internally compared with someone coming outside. Hiring managers in most cases, already have people in mind to fill open roles that the interview process may just be a waste of time. 

My advice is to expand and build your network. If you are shy or hope that opportunities will just be handed to you out of pure hard work, you will certainly be left out. I have seen people with little or no experience move to new roles because they have a good network of people who are willing to give them a shot. It is a fact!

It talks a lot about Diversity and Inclusion - it is great at a higher level but once it trickles down to different teams, it becomes a hypocrisy."

Seltzer water machines, snacks and social events to help you feel connected with your coworkers.","With the Exception of GPS, lots of things come with limitations for the support teams. The flexibility of where to work doesn't exist. The flexibility of working from home isn't the same. And with the switch from PTO to DTO, the ""Week of Rest"" where Autodesk shuts down around Christmas time is meaningless to the support teams as they still need to work.
The culture code of being able to speak up (be brave) hasn't penetrated well into GPS.
The most challenging part is compensation. Bonuses are great, raises, not so much. So the longer you work there, the farther you fall behind. And almost every year there is some sort of reorg and oddly it occurs right before your performance review. I've had twice as many managers than the number of years at Autodesk. Others have had it worse.
And with the announcement of the new Hybrid (flexible workplace) position for everyone*, it turns out there were a lot of exceptions for support roles.

Although the company puts a decent amount of effort and resources into their employee's career growth, the value of an employee isn't high and easily replaceable.

No career path in the ACS division, we all know the sales team will get diluted and channel parters will take the jobs. That’s what Autodesk does best. Buy startups and spit out the people working in them in small increments so they never make the news. 

The culture is bad, as they like to talk about diversity but don’t higher them cause apparently management doesn’t know how to interview them. Fact ! Comment I got when asked. 

I finally quit, and the HR proved me right that this company doesn’t care. Kati, worst HR . Who kept on getting defensive when I was trying to explain my side and why I quit. Sexism and no ownership of the management. If they are not hitting their target, they will though you under the bus.

The company has very good HR practices.","Doesn't always follow what was promised:
1st time I worked for them - they said the role was full time permanent. After 3 months of going through rigorous interviews and lots of wait to finally being offered the role, the job then changed into a fixed-term contract. I accepted it because I've gone through the hard yards to finally get the role. The job then constantly changed every month in the first 2-3 months of my job (good if the responsibility was getting less, but I was basically given more senior responsibilities - which was a good opportunity but on the downside has given me more work to do compared to what I originally applied for and the pay was not commensurate to my role and the job title).
2nd time I worked for them - I was told to show them my payslip and they will offer a salary equal or higher than what I previously earned. I did send my payslip. The final offer was below my previous salary (I'm guessing because my previous salary from my previous company was probably higher than what my reporting boss was earning). Again, I accepted the job because of the hoops I had to go through in terms of the interview and screening process (common amongst tech companies in the US)."

Company also place strong emphasis on ensuring employees enjoy good work-life balance. During the pandemic, company has given extra days off to all Autodesk employees to take a break from work. Company is also closed during year end holiday globally, so that everyone is taking the time off from work. This is fantastic because you won’t receive any emails or DMs as everyone is on leave.

Good compensation and benefits, although it’s still not comparable to other top tier tech companies. But the team is making effort to improve, and I’ve seen improvements being made to benefits.

Autodesk is one of the best companies I’ve worked at.","Compensation is not as attractive compared to other tech companies. Progression is slow.

Standards are incredibly low here. Besides Autodesk, I've never been at a company where a project lead can ignore all correspondence for months and still be employed.","This primarily pertains to the Brand Content & Socially Media (BCSM), formerly known as Content Marketing & Social Media (CMSM) team. If you are interviewing with this team, run. ""Leadership"" (Leadership is in quotes because he is a leader only in title as the head of this team, he is not an actual leader by any means - I wouldn't trust him to lead a wildfire through California). Please join this team if any of the below apply to you:
- If you want to work for a team led by someone who has no idea what he's doing and what he wants for the team. This team is led by someone who literally takes two years to change the team name from Content Marketing and Social Media to Brand Content and Social Media then back to Content Marketing and Social Media then again back to Brand Content and Social Media...first of all is a complete waste of time and resources but image trying to work on projects as he dilly dallies and changes his mind whenever he pleases.
-If you want to work for a ""leader"" who says he cares about diversity and inclusion but has 4 people of color on a team of 25+ (to achieve this in the Bay Area is near impossible given the makeup of the city and the technology industry), has hired and promoted zero people of color over 2.5 years, has never attended a employee resource group meeting, and says to ""just be happy"" when a person of color voices concern about inclusivity for minorities on the team. 
-If you want to work for a ""leader"" who says he cares about team morale and his individual team members but cancels one on ones at the last minute 5 times before actually meeting and wishes his employee happy birthday on a card meant to congratulate said employee for the birth of a child. When the company survey shows that employee satisfaction on his team is way below average quarter over quarter for multiple years, instead of figuring out a way to address and fix the issue himself, he outsources to lower level employees on his team to create, lead, and implement solutions that, surprise surprise, never result in anything. The theme here is all talk, no walk.
-If you want to work for a ""leader"" who asks his employees to cancel a paid corporate subscription to a project management system and create a new account with a fake gmail to save money from his budget when he works for a company that sells software subscriptions

This portion applies to Autodesk as a whole:
-Besides Andrew's sponsorship of the Autodesk Black Network, it's clear that most of leadership does not care about diversity and inclusion. There are supposedly initiatives in place to increase diversity and inclusion but nothing has really come of it. The company presented that they increased hiring of women and minorities by X% but when asked more detailed questions about how many of those women were women of color and how many of those positions were leadership positions, the team in charge responded that they can't provide that data."

The company is very flexible when it comes to how you want to work. They're pretty generous with annual leave, and in fact during the pandemic they offered extra company-wide holidays so you could get a break. A lot of the people who work there are smart and great to work with.","The leadership team is a dumpster fire. The CEO lacks any sort of self awareness, let alone a compelling vision, which means it is left to his direct reports to pick up the slack; except they are all too busy in-fighting and trying to leapfrog each other. As a result the culture across the organization has steadily become more toxic. From my team a bunch of people were let go and no-one ever spoke of it publicly. One day they were there and doing great work, the next it was quiet and everyone spent the next few weeks with little to no direction and a sense of dread.

When I said the compensation was good, part of that is the RSUs they offer periodically for good work. Except when they make you redundant you lose them all. They make you sign a gag order in order to get slightly more compensation than the government-mandated minimum, which is the pathetically small amount of money you will receive if you don't want to sign your rights away, or are holding out to see if redundancy can be averted."

Good to see some departments still practicing employees to be themselves, and express their concerns out, for the betterment of the departments. Do not lose this.","Recent hiring of sales leaders in Singapore are appalling. Self-absorbed and highly toxic to the current culture, insecure, primitive(or non-existent) leadership style, selfish, highly concerned about useless matters, and only want to ruin the existing sales teams of their otherwise excellent camaraderie by bringing in more of their ""own friends and enablers in"" just because they do not understand the CAD business and ""want to do things their way"".

Could also be a good thing since it means growth.
526,Autodesk,"Large, mission driven company",2021-04-29,3.0,Former Employee,"Overall great company culture. They did a lot of awesome things to ensure that employees were connecting to the culture and living the mission and values. Throughout the pandemic, they've been very focused on employee well-being and it made me feel really valued as a whole human and not just a worker bee. 

Having a company mission that was rooted in making the world better gave me something to really be proud of. To be able to truly make an impact on the world and its future is something that's hard to find at other companies.","It's a big company with a lot of red tape. There are so many people that need eyes on everything that it really delays the process of deploying anything. 

One thing that I think about constantly with regards to my time at Autodesk is how much I feel like the system is not set up for people of color to succeed. The D&I team has put in tremendous effort towards inclusivity and belonging within the company and it does not go unnoticed. However, that's just one piece to feeling seen and heard within the company. The leaders who make decisions on promotions and merit increases are oftentimes not people of color and with them comes biases. Bias training is great and highly necessary, but if the people who have a seat at the table to make merit and promotion decisions don't put that training into action, who's going to hold them accountable? A lot of these decisions are made without a person of color having a seat at that table and it's very obvious when you look across the organization and don't see any diversity at the top. Instead, you see diversity at the individual contributor level. It makes me question whether or not people of color can see their career grow at Autodesk."

Laying you off immediately when they don't need you anymore.,2021-04-11,1.0,Software Engineer,- Autodesk seems to be on track to be on par with the top players in the market with regards to Compensation.,"- A culture of irony. Autodesk has a series of HR policies and programs to make you feel you belonged, but they may lay you off without a single warning, even when you are a high-performer. 
- Autodesk lays off people while earning a record-high profit during this pandemic. If you are looking for a compassionate company, look elsewhere cause this is not one of them. Some companies lose money during this difficult time and still treat their employees better.
- Leaders not knowing what to do with the organization. Series of re-org after re-org. Autodesk likes to promote leaders that are technically capable but have mediocre/poor people management skills. We became guinea pigs for their substandard business decisions."

556,Autodesk,Where the talented few carry deadweight,2021-04-08,2.0,User Experience Engineer,The company has very nice offices and is financially stable.,"Autodesk is filled with deadweight at all levels of the company, and they survive off the innovation of a talented few. Ridiculous amounts of time and resources is wasted on internal politics that only serve to keep people feeling like they're accomplishing something. The company has a good mission, but most of the employees are running on a figurative hamster wheel going nowhere.

If you're a talented individual who has the desire and patience to play the corporate political game, you will thrive at Autodesk, because the company's deadweight will want to ride on your coattails. If you have little ability or talent, you can easily fake your way through an interview. There's no need to prove yourself afterwards, because they'll just hire more fakers to fill in the gaps. It's only a hop and skip away from the infinite monkey theorem.

This is baked into the company culture, and it seems to be working for them. I personally hate it, and will never return."

There is a great focus on equality at all levels of the org. Andrew, the CEO, is well-spoken, honest, and has shown that he does care about everyone working at Autodesk.

Benefits are nice (in the USA, at least).

The company mission is clear and potentially world-changing. The shift from license keys to named user was executed wonderfully; it's still amping up in terms of profits. The next move into the Make aspects of the world from the existing Design ones is simple to understand at a high level, and Autodesk has provided ample evidence that it is the right move to make.

Our customers build amazing things with our products. Fusion 360 is like magic (and I don't even work on it). Seeing the jaw-dropping stuff that we make possible is hugely rewarding.","Crazy politics. No pressure to deliver.

People hold nearly all senior positions with 10-20 years of tenure. Historical baggage undercuts trust between groups, even when only 2-3 people were present for it. I've had the statement ""well, three CEOs ago..."" said to me an embarrassing number of times by people wanting to block an idea or tell me why it won't work.

Everyone wants to build something cool with no regard to its usefulness or need. This again undercuts trust. There are numerous internal products and services that are well-engineered and don't do anything you want them to. Since adoption is understandably low for these things groups, resort to executive-level dictates that XYZ must be used, further detaching them to build something people want as it now required anyways.

The company is 5-10 years behind the curve in terms of the Cloud. It's pretty normal to see a 10 page White Paper published internally explaining or pushing for technology or pattern that has been industry standard for years already. Workloads were lift-and-shifted to AWS, and some account reps likely got to buy personal islands with how much we spent doing it.

Autodesk's growth strategy is via acquisitions (this is not bad in and of itself). Somehow they don't have a playbook on how to integrate them still (there have been over 70 as of this writing). This leads orgs to be fragmented as the tech stacks, platforms, tools, and processes of those individual companies continue to exist for years after the buy. The plethora of systems means confusion, poor standardization, and lots of poorly maintained solutions for teams.

I had a coach (provided by Autodesk) tell me that many of his Autodesk clients hold out until there is a reorg if they are unhappy. Groups are reorganized frequently enough that it usually only takes a few months. There are a ton of people coasting here. Putting in minimal effort, knowing there is no pressure to deliver. Coming from a startup, it's like progress hitting a wall.

The Security and Compliance groups have created poor cultures throughout the company. The reasons are too long to list here. TL;DR they are policing units that take no efforts in improving security products to their specific needs. Everything is a generic check box that often conflicts or has a considerable gray area when viewed through a specific product lens. They have no authority for punishment and chose not to build tooling that features teams want or need. In the end, they are mean and nagging to get teams to do as they want."

Promotions based on how well you fake it and play the political game.

I've heard a lot of great things about it before, and I'm super happy to find it out it's all true.
The Israeli site of Autodesk is awesome!
On one hand you're part of a truly global, publicly traded, American corporation, with over 10,000 employees worldwide. With offices in nearly every country and products with huge brand name recognition (AutoCAD, 3DMax, Maya, etc).
On the other hand the Israeli site is relatively small, around 150 people, with a startup mentality.
Everyone are super-nice, and super-smart. The energy is great, very positive and go-to mentality.
Great offices in Rothchild, with all the amenities, food stocks etc.
I'm delighted to be part of the company.","It's been 10 months now with COVID-19, and working from home. It's a bummer.

It seems that here, project managers are the lowest of the low and get no respect. Priorities of all other groups seem to trump priorities of PMs. Director level management has historically been not-to-be trusted, and the level of Machiavellian maneuvering is mindboggling. There are a lot of cliques, and favoritism of unsavory types exists. Layoffs and bullies are not uncommon. Opportunities for advancement are quite limited."

984,Autodesk,They take care of their employees,2020-05-29,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Autodesk is a great company to work for. From the established, industry leading products to the cool offices to the smart, down to earth exec team--it's been a great experience so far. It's a huge company, but I never feel like a cog. Employees are given leeway to tackle big problems, and are rewarded for thinking outside the box. The company values and culture are more than kool-aid given to you during onboarding. ADSK consistently hires a smart, friendly, diverse group of employees who take pride in their work.

But what really pushed me to write this review is Autodesk's COVID-19 response. I've been so impressed by the level of support given to employees at this time. Bi-weekly webcasts with the CEO with a live Q+A, frequent and clear comms from leadership, WFH through the end of 2020, a WFH stipend, reasonable expectations around work-life balance, and no layoffs. Autodesk even took this time to EXPAND their employee stock grants to those who didn't yet have options. They are proving that they truly put employees first, and have the right leadership in place. It's nice to feel like your company is on your side.","Things can move a bit slowly and feel disjointed. If you aren't proactive, you can miss out on new processes and best practices that aren't always clearly communicated, and there's a steep learning curve when it comes to internal processes and language. 

While I've had positive experiences with my managers, some colleagues complain about a lack of mentorship or guidance from theirs. 

While Autodesk does value and pay individual contributors well, it seems difficult to move past a certain level of management unless you've been at the company for decades."
985,Autodesk,Mixed feelings,2020-05-28,3.0,Project Manager,"Good brand, some really good coworkers and in overall, pro-employee approach.",Regular layoffs to fix their P&L. Many tenured employees not willing to give a try to new way of doing things. Slow paced.
986,Autodesk,Great place to be!,2020-05-26,5.0,Territory Account Sales Executive,Autodesk shows a lot of empathy toward employees and works relentlessly in creating an inclusive place to work.

Over my 20 years career, I've worked for a lot of different companies and this one is definitely very close to the top. If you are in the tech field, you will get the chance to work and experiment with the latest technologies. Benefits are great and the company invests in keeping the skills of its employees top notch. There is structure (as it should be in a big company) but at the same teams are given flexibility as to how to get things done (as in startup). Life is all about maintaining balance, right.","These exist in every organization, but here are few based on my experience:
- Sadly job promotion is not entirely based on merit. In order to get promoted you need to continuously ask and lobby for it. This exists in all companies (not only Autodesk) but there are instances of people who get promoted without having much people management or subject matter skills - it can be mind boggling! 
- Employees are given the opportunity to make lateral moves but are not always required to take up the necessary training (including certifications) to learn the intricacies of the new position. These employees usually apply some of the knowledge from the old job to the new gig but often times it is not enough. This leads to sub-par work for months, even years."

I have worked at multiple companies and this is the worst place. There are people who are there for 15-20 years, buddies with each other, with an attitude to know everything, supporting each other up even if not complement or qualified. People with terrible management skills manage people. You can’t complain to HR because they won’t do anything. I was constantly analyzed why I said this or that, and from day 1 I was told what areas I had to improve on. From day 1! It was very unwelcoming.  Your confidence is killed from the very beginning.

They claim to want to see you succeed, but when you tell them you need help or guidance from their vast set of experiences, they give you nothing.  Often times, you work in an information vacuum, and when you fail you get hammered.  If you succeed they treat you like a C student, especially if you're not in the ""in crowd.""
People with whom you'll  work are back stabbers.  They claim to be your friend,  then if there's a situation that will give them an edge over you, they will use it.

Honestly the work was too easy and I was used to working in startup and consulting environments and it was crazy that people were fighting over their projects so they had something to show for.  Middle manager has no clue how to do anything and once asked me to put slide deck on the value of my tasks (that she assigned me) so she can present to her manager. Credit stealing is rampant.

- Old and crufty codebase with poor documentation, inconsistent code style rules (mix of semicolons and non-semicolons in a js project), inconsistent file structure

- Manager once told me to get back to work after I spent 8 minutes in Slack chat discussing the pros and cons of a few terms related to testing; got told that I should be coding but had been told that I needed to be more collaborative 5 minutes earlier in the conversation. Typical ""read my mind"" sort of criticism from that manager. 

- Manager seemed surprised that I posted a Confluence doc about the vertical whitespace rules that I and 2 team members agreed on. The project was many years old and no one had written down style rules. Manager said ""I thought all languages wanted zero whitespace"". I had no response to this, I was just flabbergasted. This is one of the most WTF statements I've ever heard from a manager. I told a colleague about it (someone with close to 20 years experience) and his response was one word: ""Run"".  For an example of vertical whitespace in a modern js project: see packages/react/src/React.js in the React github repo (not allowed to link it here) 

- Team member told me ""your question was innapropriate"" after I told them that the condescending response I got to a question was innapropriate. When someone tells you you are being inappropriate you don't say ""no, u"", that's rude. This team has issues."

While it is a company where you can build a long-term career (and many people have, there's a lot of loyalty), there is also a serious issue with lack of diversity at the leadership levels.

They are cash rich and will let you learn and spend money on education (if you are in the right department and a team).,"The unfortunate thing about this company is the middle managers who are in constant competition with each other and cannot collaborate due to too much politics to get ahead. Doing new things are encouraged but make sure you have a successful result, they do not like seeing you screw up even if it was just done as a ""test"". Understand that your position is at the mercy of someone above you therefore be ready to suck up to your manager as much as possible if you don't want to be randomly selected to be laid off.

Employees fear for their jobs with so many reorgs.  Decisions made based on keeping their jobs rather than what is best for the company.  In the company's quest to look progressive - younger employees are often valued over older individuals with strong company knowledge and skillsets.

Management (hub based): All managers in the hub are very unexperienced. This means that nobody has a clue what is going on. Most of them are hired externally, because only the favorites get promoted. They have no clue how to manage people. The fact they were average or good in their previous sales position, does not mean they are capable of managing people. When they become managers (mid-management/team managers), they don't have much imput nor have the ability to make their own decision. These are made one level up (senior management). Team managers have to ask for permission to the senior managent for basically everything. 

Team lead program: Every year you have the chance to apply for a team lead program (trains you to become a manager), but they already decided who’s going to get a spot before people can even apply. Then they don’t even bother to communicate to people that they didn’t get the spot. Also, some people don’t even have to apply and get a spot (there’s like 6 spots and 500 employees) anyways. 

Call center KPI’s: ‘’We are not a callcenter’’ is what they love to tell themselves. However, since mid 2018, we have all the call center metrics and talk time is more important than your actual achievement or how productive you are. Calling a reseller for 1 hour and talk about the weather? Great, 1H TT done. Bringing in loads of business but no 1h TT? Not good enough, you’ll receive an email with name shaming the people who didn’t do 1H. 

Micro-management: the inside sales department consists of severe micro-management. Working from home (even for a good reason), no option. Emails about talk time every day, name shaming. No flexibility. They look over your shoulder all day, for some of them, its quite literally (as in: check what you’re doing on your screen, listening into your calls without informing you). It’s like kindergarden and they don’t trust any of us. 

Politics: Favouratism is the best way to describe hub-based management. If you’re liked, you’ll get far, if not, forget about your career at Autodesk. Want to have a career here? Make sure to play your political cards very right. 

Speaking up: Something they love to ‘’encourage’’. But when you do, you’re out. So basically you cannot say anything otherwise you will pay a very big price. They'll find a way for you to say yes and amen or you'll get fired.  

Perception: Perception is also very very important here combined with favouratism. They don’t care about how you really are, they’ll form an opinion about you and will base everything on this. ‘’Perceived’’ as arrogant? No salary increase. 

Faking achievements: There are many favorites who’s continuously faked their results. Then they get awarded for this by hub management. Even get awards. Real talent doesn’t get rewarded. Neither in salary nor awards. During my time here I've seen many big talents leave because  of this, which is a big shame. 

Career growth: During onboarding and interviews they say you can advance your career within ADSK. Not true. Only if you’re liked and favoured. There have been several occasions senior hub management has blocked people from moving to different positions for no reason. If you’re looking to grow your career, ADSK is not the place to be.  Many good people have left despite various calls to action, as they were stuck. It’s only the favourites who get lucky. There is no career plan like in every other big IT company. 

Retention: Last year many people got fired, some without even knowing they got fired and mostly without valid reason. They will receive a nice severance package as the company has no valid ground to fire people for no reason on the spot.  If they don’t get fired, they leave. Mostly the good people that are just lacking the favouratism.  These are mostly top performers who’ve been waiting for 3 years to get somewhere and don’t get anywhere, so they have no choice but leave and earn double somewhere else. 

Bonus/target/quota: Quotas are not rolled out until the middle of the year. This means that TSR’s only get paid 50% of the variable salary before the quota has been rolled out. HR tends to forget to tell new hires so they come in thinking they're earning more than they acutally are. For the other roles: target changed every month (and therefore they earn way less money than the target they signed for), no stability, capped at 200% etc. 

Salary: Used to be quite high and nice for Barcelona (TSR position), still quite low for SaaS companies. But recently they have gone down drastically. SDR's and BDR's are severely underpaid (similar to outsourcing companies). Big differences between TSR's. This is not based and aligned on being junior/medior/senior, but by how much they want to offer. This causes loads of problems between colleagues, as one colleague could earn 10K more for the same job, without having more exprience etc. You're not allowed to talk about salaries, you'll get in big trouble (because it's not fair).

Salary increase: Doesn’t really happen. Only once per year IF you are one of the lucky ones (read: favourites). They will use everything against you (how you’re ''perceived'' rather than your achievements). If you want to change roles you’d better quit and get re-hired otherwise you get a lower salary as they use an excuse they can only give you 2% more due to your old salary, even if you’re changing to a different department where the salary is much higher. HR will also rather not hire people internally with a lower salary because they don’t want to increase much.  There is no annual increase/inflation increase. People that do get a promotion get at least 10K less than externals getting the job (even if they don’t have more experience). 

HR: Totally not trustworthy. They talk about confidential things of employees to colleagues or managers who shouldn’t be involved, causing the employee problems with both colleagues as well as management. Even when confidentiallity has been signed by both HR and employee. Nobody feels they can trust them as there have been various incidents where this happened. They are also best friends with senior management, so best not to include HR into youre confidential problems, especially when it considers a manager. Also, they don’t inform current employees about vacancies and head of recruitment doesn’t want to push internals to get a job or even help them look for a suitable change, as they rather hire externals. 

Diversity: great that ADSK is so focused on this. However, in the hub in BCN, it seems there is more possitive discrimination than that it's benefiting the hub. Promote the best person, not because it's a woman."

This gives staff lots of opportunity to develop skills and move into new roles that did not even exist. Check the stock price to see how much its grown!

Great company culture - No matter who you talk to in the business you will find knowledgeable, hard working passionate people. Everyone wants you to succeed and they have no hesitation in helping you. This is a great feeling when you first start as its a steep learning curve.

Across the organisation targets are high but realistic, when the office first opened the targets were too easy and people got complacent. Also I can see that a few mistakes were made initially in the recruitment process and some of the sales people had no sales skills at all.  As 
 the company goal is growth, the targets must grow too. Needless to say, the people who could not adapt to change have left.  

Salary is fair and based on experience, if your not happy with your proposed salary when joining then there´s plenty of other companies in Barcelona. The salaries are reviewed internally twice a year. If you work hard, prove your value and go above and beyond it´s possible to get a raise for your efforts.  Great benefits package.

Great international vibe - As the team is made up of lots of nationalities it´s great to work daily with expats from all over the world. The office has ping pong, table football, PlayStation, chill area´s, free coffee and fitness classes. 

Management style is situational based on skill level, ability, motivation, if you need help you can get ask for it in many other places than your direct manager. If you work hard and do your job, you can expect praise and support. If your not pulling your weight or your bringing negativity to the team then your days will be numbered.","For a technology company the data management can be frustrating, lots of time spent on looking for information across multiple platforms. 

The commission model is a tough one to get your head around for sales teams, the way it works is based on territory not individual performance. So the laziest person in the company can get paid the highest mount of bonus!"
1186,Autodesk,More Stability Elsewhere,2019-06-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"ESPP is really quite generous. You can't lose, and it's set up for pretty generous returns regardless of what the stock does.
6-week sabbatical after four years, but... (see Cons)
Involvement in digital manufacturing, AEC, and media and entertainment means that you see a lot of really cool stuff that they have going on, between the offices, conferences, gallery, etc. and it is exciting to be a part of this...for as long as they let you be a part of it.","Constant restructuring restructuring and layoffs to the tune of 10-15% of the workforce every couple of years. In between, they're still having smaller scale layoffs that don't make the news.
Regularly removing products (including valuable, robust products) from their portfolio. If you're recruited and hired to support a specific product or product's capability, there's no guarantee that the product will still be around six months from your hire date. This has the following results 1) Very angry customers 2) The experience and expertise you bring to the table is no longer needed. Even if you're flexible and a quick learning, there's a significant difference between 20 years of experience in a certain application that's suddenly no longer offered and 6 months experience in what's left.
Constantly chasing the leading edge du jour with no real strategic focus, resulting in the aforementioned Cons regarding restructuring and software retirement. By constantly shifting gears trying to chase the latest innovation, they paradoxically become less innovative.
Vacation isn't great: 12 days per year, which never increases with seniority. If you add that to the sabbatical, the vacation days per year really aren't all that competitive with companies that offer three or especially four weeks per year with no sabbatical
They won't tell you about this during the recruiting phase, but they often have a 1 week furlough around July 4 that requires you to use your vacation days or take unpaid time off during that time.
If you're stuck in a mid-career rut and looking to grow your career in a different direction, this is not the place to do it. Stay in your rut until you find something more stable and reliable than Autodesk."

1201,Autodesk,Culture diminishing (non-product team),2019-04-30,1.0,Software Engineer,best reason to work here is because bart is closer to office,"(1) low traffic estore...no big technical challenges...
(2) low salaries compared to market in SF.
(3) lot of politics in the store side...all you need to do is show-off...
take my words... who ever works diligently will not grow here...
who ever show off and pretend that they are doing something will grow...
you don't have to complete what you have started but you just need to do it in a fancy way that's it...no quality required or no definition of done...if you do this way, you are favorite to your manager..

why? because manager can show off this to their upper level...
(4) no proper direction for the management and no body cares about the customer in the ecommerce team...everyone codes but no one troubleshoots :)"

1205,Autodesk,Constant Flux & Stress,2019-04-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"GREAT product and open work environment.   There are no offices (other than meeting spaces), you could literally be sitting next to someone on the executive team on one side and an intern on the other.  The setup allows for open conversation between groups.   Autodesk provides lunch once a week and has beer on tap in the Boston office.  The BUILD Space is truly an amazing facility that full-time employees have access to.","Autodesk is in constant flux with layoffs and reorgs...  Every December and February everyone in the company stresses out about getting laid off.  If you are looking for long-term stability, Autodesk may not be the right fit.  There is no long-term planning or strategy (even 1 year out).  Everything seems to be ad-hoc and very disjointed.  Tons of silos that everyone talks about, but nobody acts upon.  The executive team has secret meetings and do not involve key stakeholders.  LOTS of meetings (even meetings to discuss next meetings topics - yes that's right).  Not a very good life/work balance due to the constant flux, last-minute projects, and deadlines.  Managers pick favorites and are by no means transparent -- despite what they tell you.  If you are looking at upward growth and mobility, your manager can break your career with Autodesk.  Management expects complete honesty and transparency from their team, but do not exemplify it themselves.  Oversharing could cost you your job -- especially if you upset someone."
1206,Autodesk,APAC Premier Expert not recommended,2019-04-23,2.0,Premier Expert,"Decent company health benefits, diversity","Bad teamwork (or should I say exclusion of certain team members): Only people with same language skills get along. This doesn’t sound like the diversity trainings Autodesk is providing.
Micro-management: Unlike the same teams in EMEA and AMER, APAC might make you feel like you’re working in a contact centre (yes, people do check without you knowing - your reporting time to work, your toilet breaks, lunch breaks, what time you leave office, etc). Whereas other geos are more flexible in working hours and options to WFH, you’re expected to report to work on time in APAC unless you want to be criticized (yes, take note some are not happy that you leave on time when you’re a newbie).
Training: No structured training provided and you might be criticized/blamed for not picking things up quick enough and not performing up to expectations.
Although it is a MNC with diverse cultures, I would not recommend unless you like this type of work environment or management style."

Networking within the company","Autodesk-wide is much better than Barcelona hub
Hub Management - Managers often hired externally rather than promoting high-potential employees (this results in taking people for their CV that have no understanding of Autodesk's business and bring little value)
Call-center objectives rather than strategical (talk time versus to whom the sales rep speaks to), micromanagement
Internal Politics - things are not the way the management says they are, favouritism 
Management encourages speaking up, but then the employee gets a tag 'negative' if addressing problems or doubts (lack of transparency, unfair quotas, compensation etc.)
Limited opportunities to grow - not looking at employees as where they could be the best assets to the company when needing them at a particular spot
Numbers reported by the sales rep and languages spoken matter more than person's expertise, field of study etc. 
Unclear quotas till mid-year (only 50% of the variable paid to the employee before the quotas are issued), unrealistic targets
Demotivating compensation - overachievement dependent on the given territory, not individual performance, everybody has equal KPI not reflecting  the respective markets
Salary increases - very limited and not reflecting top performance

They care about our products and customers, and go the extra mile to make sure that our products are the best and our customers are beyond satisfied. We come together on work projects, celebrations, employee resource groups, and informally which makes the working environment comfortable yet stimulating.

My manager is fantastic and my teammates are the best, which makes coming to work a pleasure (and how many times can you say that?).

While the interview process was quick, nice, with many smiles (although the team lead was lacking serious tech knowledge), I soon realized after starting there that it was all just a big fake show. literally my worst career decision.

After stepping in I soon realized that there is no management, no clear product future or tasks to work on, and most of the effort is just to put on a show to the american managers. Other employees said that this is the best place to past the time and real managers are actually in the US and have no idea what really happens here. All the nice smiles during the interview from the HR and managers changed to just ignoring me and others and nobody cared that nothing is being done (work wise) and that everyone just faking it.

Once I realized how it really works there, which was completely different(!) from what was presented during the interview, I started looking for a new place and left few months later. Thankfully.

Unfortunately I read the reviews here only after I joined, it could have saved me a lot of time and efforts to avoid this rat hole!! Take my advice, don't do this to yourself."

1346,Autodesk,This is the place to be!,2018-09-27,4.0,IT Program Manager,"It's an exciting time to be at Autodesk as the company is reinventing itself as a leader in the computer science space. The executive team is embracing challenges and finding every possible way to increase customer satisfaction and trust throughout the organization. I feel like I am directly working on initiatives that help shape the future of the organization. I connect with the mission and vision of the company and can see the organization taking positive steps towards creating a better world. 

The culture is awesome here! I feel engaged and happy in my job, and in my work environment. Even though this is technically a large corporation, it still has a family feel within my division and department. You can tell that managers are thoroughly trained in leadership and communication skills. 

You can really tell the company cares about the happiness and well-being of its employees with its reach of employee programs and events, as well as commitment to work-life balance.  I especially enjoy Autodesk's array of employee programs spanning from company soccer and softball tournaments, gyms, to on-site dog-walking. I also have access to a wide variety of training resources, either digitally or in-person. I feel like when I am ready to make a move into the next step in my career, I have the resources I need to do that within Autodesk rather than moving to another company.","As a millennial in the San Rafael office, it's been a bit challenging to get to know people within my division and department.

The Denver office has a truly collaborative feel.  People are just nice here, and that says a lot when we are talking about 200 people in this office. Located one block from Union Station, the office is really beautiful and we all have stand-up sit-down desks.  Autodesk funds some nice employee-related activities, some that are fun but also those that give back to the community. Also, who offers a SIX WEEK paid sabbatical (after 4 years) - this is an amazing benefit!  There's also a huge emphasis on employee referrals, and the payout is VERY generous.","I don't experience this personally but I hear there is a lack of promotion opportunities for employees in more junior positions.  However if you want to make a move laterally and try something new, this is the place for you.  The Denver office has a lot of other businesses in this location so it's a place to come and stay (it just made not include a salary increase).

However, you need to be prepared for the fast paced work and change as the norm.  You must be a solid collaborator to succeed, regardless of the level of role you are in.   If you are in a key city such as San Francisco, Boston, or Portland you should be able to have a long and exciting career.","Change is exhausting and you can expect to have a lot of managers over your career at Autodesk.  It takes a long time to feel grounded upon entering the company.  This is normal.  Some divisions and team have better onboarding than others.  Smaller offices don't get the same attention as the key cities but there are good things happening, just be aware you're not in the elite centers and may need to make an effort to be seen if you are seeking advancement."

Stop pushing the political views at work. Slack should not be a place where people get to spit out the usual culture politics of the day. Do that on your own time and leave SJW stuff at home.

Consensus mentality is maddening. It is yet another horrible example of an agile casualty. All creativity and ability to design something great is crushed by the constant “all have to agree “ garbage.

Though I was always working towards promotion, earning excellent reviews during each review cycle, each reorg seemed to set me back to square one with a new boss. I was told multiple times that you need to perform at the position you hope to be promoted to for *years* before you’re recognized with a title change and pay raise. You can switch positions internally but even if the role is a higher pay grade, you can only be paid at the same grade the role you transitioned from. 

My last year at Autodesk my most current boss told me I’d be promoted by the end of the year, instead I was laid off during, yet another, company reorganization. 

Autodesk is a velvet coffin. Get comfortable in your role because you’re not going anywhere within the company, you’ll like it there so you won’t really try to leave. Your skills will become stale if you’re not developing them outside of Autodesk because this is not a company you can grow with.

The almighty 'sabbatical' which is every four years six weeks off is the great benefit, but the vacation offered yearly is sub-par, so the sabbatical only compensates for this. If you make it to each four year mark without a layoff.  Many fiefdoms and people who have been around forever who don't seem to care much about customers....accounting/legal departments notoriously numb and tone deaf to customer concerns relayed from the front lines.   The consulting department must always justify it's own existence, and it seems it is now shrinking and the justification being made more difficult by onerous legal and accounting and other priorities which make it ever so much harder to do the already difficult job of making customers happy.

Promotions come to people based on time-served and age rather than meritocracy. 
No directors under the age of 40 and lack of diversity (of any kind) in leadership positions.

Oh, by the way, as mentioned by many - Work Life Balance is a big deal at Autodesk.  It does not mean that you will not work long hours from time to time.  But, when you do, you do not even realize it because you enjoy what you do but also, they make you take a break and they genuinely care that you prioritize your family before work.  At least that was my experience.","It is a big company that is still transforming into its new business model and adjusting to what the market demands.   There seems to be a lot of positioning to what is ""Hot"" and in the process, an opportunity to grow can become challenging.  It seems that it ends up promoting unintended competition to be recognized and hopefully, an opportunity for moving up the ladder.

The Grade level system means well, but, it seems that moving up internally is more challenging than someone being hired from outside.  Someone who have been in the company a bit longer, knows the process, know the people, products, etc.  can be in the same grade and pay level as a new hire.  Similarly, if there is an opportunity for an internal job opening where you can meet about 80% of the requirements, but you are two grade levels below the req., you cannot apply for that role.  Someone outside with unproven track record and maybe meet 90% of the requirements on paper - has a better chance of getting it.

I have been in the company for 6 years and I have experienced re-structuring about 4 times.  Some are company-wide and some on the organization level within.   This is not uncommon for the industry that is changing rapidly.  Do not get discouraged by this comment, it only means that you need always strive to learn something new and be prepared for change and find an opportunity when change happens."

The only benefit I see from this role is probably their representative bargaining power. But having such a manager for every team is considered expensive and ineffective if the company try to adopt agile and empower every employee. Having a traditional people manager is like adding extra wheels to the bicycle for stability, or trying to make all vehicles look alike. 

Career advancement for software engineer stop at grade 12 (senior engineer) or grade 13 (principal engineer), while manager (grade 13) continue get promoted to snr manager (grade 14) and director (grade 15). Heavy lifting is done by people at the bottom while the management ripe all the credits.

Despite all the pro mentioned above, most engineers left within their first 3 years due to frequent reorg, frequent change in product direction, bad people management and lack of advancement."
1497,Autodesk,An entrenched company struggling to renew itself,2018-02-18,3.0,Content Strategist,"The executives at Autodesk should be very proud of one thing: The benefits at this place are off-the-charts amazing. I was fortunate to experience the four-year sabbatical, and it was life-changing. Also, being able to work from home or the office or anywhere and having the purse strings of a deep-pocketed company to purchase and experiment with tools or services I needed to do my work was extremely satisfying. I loved the autonomy that I had in my own personal work choices. Huge! 

The small team I worked with did amazing things together as marketers, piling up record subscription sales and organic traffic (but, it must be said: only because we resisted the go-along-get-along ways of our deep-state co-workers).","The company plays up its position as an innovator in design, but they are struggling with old code bases and an inability to tie together their software into packages that work for people on all devices. Despite how hard they try to convince themselves internally, this company is absolutely not user-focused. It’s full of engineers and middle managers who want a 9-5 job and no surprises; they simply don't strive for excellence. Most of the people I worked with had no experience building SaaS software (or any online services), a stubborn inability to think of users first, and they often struggled with the methodologies of agile software production. I worked with a lot of incompetent people at Autodesk who couldn't move past their old ways of making boxed software that they only had to update once per year. Promotions are very rare unless you are really good at corporate politics. This place is surprisingly boring considering its potential for making industry-changing software."

There used to be an earnest, collaborative environment with a real desire to do the right thing for customers.  Now, many leaders are applying their efforts to jockeying for position or resources rather than leading or managing.  Productivity has ground to a halt, resources are demoralized and actively looking for the exit.
2.  Promotions decisions are not transparent.  While officially, it is all about ""What"" and ""How"", the real variable is ""Who"" you know and ""Where"" you are located.  It is impossible to advance outside San Francisco due to a belief that only resources in SF can be leaders.  It is hard to connect this to the visible commitment to diversity. 
3.   The leadership claims that we want to be a ""customer"" company.  However, actions show the real objectives - satisfying Wall Street.

Find the right team and manager, you will thrive.  Alternative can be quite the opposite experience.","Lack of strong, respected executive level leaders and mentors:

  - Executive leadership team is largely inaccessible other than Town Hall sessions. 
  - Executive leadership team is saturated with experience in Autodesk's historic business model and void of experience in Autodesk's new business models (SAAS, cloud, customer success, etc.).  
  - Executive leadership team is out of touch with customers and their expectations as well as the internal Autodesk workforce.  
  - Executive Sales leaders are ego driven, arrogant and have limited to no self-awareness of their roots.   They routinely take input from a limited few in their inner circles and rarely demonstrate trust across their extended leadership teams.

Annual restructuring events:

- Annual restructuring events are highly distracting, morale killers and lack the needed transparency from the executive leadership levels.  Messaging is perceived as disingenuous.
  - Middle management is left to deliver the difficult message to the masses without real clarity or proper pre-planning.
  - Poor timing prior to the holidays and in the midst of closing year end business.

Opportunities to advance:

  - Advancement opportunities have the perception they are hand-picked for a chosen few and often filled before positions are opened.
  - Very limited opportunity to pursue adjacent roles unless you're located in San Francisco or a major office.  If located elsewhere, no relocation assistance is offered.  
  - Unless you're in San Francisco, Boston or one of the Hubs (Denver, Barcelona, etc.) you're extremely limited if not excluded altogether from any growth or consideration.  
  - Little time is invested in developing and evolving a culture to coach, develop and build talent.  There are development programs, but again, only available for a select chosen few.

A core of true believers still remains, people who care about customers, products and each other.","The true believers are being swallowed up by a crowd of opportunists who are focused only on seeking political favor from senior leadership. Many of these opportunists barely know who their customers are and what they want.

A few years ago, Autodesk decided that it couldn't grow and compete by acquiring technology (it long ago gave up trying to innovate organically). Its new strategy, which has been increasingly visible over the past four years, has been to extract more money from customers who can't switch away easily from its products and to reduce costs by systematically cutting ""experienced"" employees, regardless of performance, and replacing them with interns and new hires. Of course, every company needs to turn over its skill base to stay relevant, but at Autodesk there is a pattern where low performing, highly paid but politically savvy employees are retained while higher performers are let go. What's worse, some of the new hires aren't always top performers (to be fair, some are excellent, but why settle for just some).

The environment has become increasingly political, and a company that has always struggled to listen to customers has become practically deaf to them at this point.

Too many useless meetings. In my organization, our non-technical program management group has taken over.

To make matters worse, it isn't fixing much of anything but we pretend like it is working because politics. I worry some of our agile champions will migrate to other parts of the company after proclaiming success, like a cancer slowly spreading until we have 40 hours of meetings every week.

Morale is down and many solid engineers openly daydream about leaving. The former co-CEO was considered an engineering guy and left - or was forced out - when he lost the CEO race. Current CEO is a nice guy but he was promoted from Chief Marketing Officer, further proving who calls the real shots at Autodesk. Hint: it's not the engineers anymore.

1648,Autodesk,"Great mission, but hard journey",2017-07-12,2.0,User Experience Designer,"- Company mission is super inspiring, and genuinely strives towards making the world a better place
- Lot of awesome initiatives happening with biotech & research
- Lot of work life balance
- Lot of opportunities for volunteer work and extracirricular activities!
- Super convenient location by BART
- Lot of general facility perks, such as onsite gym and access to Pier 9 - I've lasercut a lot of stuff for side projects :)
- Highly encourages making and you have access to the software for free
- Company is pretty much the leader in a lot of the software we offer, so there's bragging rights :) 
- Lots of very smart, diverse, incredible people here! It's been incredibly humbling to work here.","This company is an old, old ship. A lot of the folks here have been here forever (10+ years) and are rooted in dated processes, unwilling to take feedback from new employees, until the new employees either quit or stay long enough to get absorbed in all those dated processes. As a younger employee, this can be intimidating - an older employee, who I introduced myself to in the kitchen one day, offhandedly told me that I probably wouldn't make it to the 4-year mark, as ""millenials are noncommittal"". 

As a designer, the work depends (understandably) on what team you're on- but being a part of a big company, you will be siloed, and a lot of the work won't be sexy visually. There's currently been a movement towards creating global UI guidelines but it's taken a very, very long time to develop and the team that is working on it hasn't permeated all of the design teams yet, it feels that any one team within the company doesn't have much reach across orgs. 

Generally not a huge design culture here - we host a lot of design events for the public, but internally, design thinking is still relatively new to non-designers and pushing that has been a challenge. The designers feel very disconnected, and there's often duplicate efforts happening and not a lot of communication. There have been efforts to bring us together; we have designer all-hands, but it feels that the original gusto has worn off. The company is very numbers and sales driven, and at times so ambitiously so that it costs our reputation with our customers; often I've felt the way we sell and bundle our products undermines our customer experience. 

Some teams do not value or put as much budget into research, or sometimes that research will be introduced too late in the pipeline for any significant design changes to be made before getting rushed into development. 

The people here are very transactional and often look for their own interests. When I was interviewing here, I emailed a designer on another team to ask about her interview process and her take on the culture- only to get back a reply that I should ""consider what I could offer her in return"" for her giving this information and that I should ""think about what I'm asking for before emailing her"" and that she was ""tired of getting emails asking for favors without any returns"". That should have been a red flag as this was very indicative of the silo culture here- asking for any help from any team that isn't yours will warrant a cold response, if any at all- and often to get any help you need to pull favors. Perhaps it's just the size of the company itself, but to me it's never felt very collaborative. 

The company is very frugal and when I was in the offer stage, my particular recruiter was very, very pushy about asking for my old salary and as a result, my offered salary was much lower than that of peers in my same role and level, even after negotiating up another 5k. I have some suspicions that there is a fairly large pay gap between women and POC because of the way they recruit. 

Also, your experience will vary widely depending on which department you are in. If you aren't in the department working on all of the software products, you don't get the same perks: we don't get any catered food, we don't have a winter holiday party, and we generally don't get invited to the celebrations the product departments host."

We are given 12 days of vacation time per year but expected to use 3 of them in July during a mandatory vacation week, leaving us with just 9 days per year off.

• People who design products, are the same people who kill the said products. (Let's try this one one more time...?)
• Overly complex approach to pretty much everything within the company, which reflects in all the products.
• Too many ""cooks"" in the kitchen, for absolutely no good reason. They'd hire 10 mediocre people instead of a single good one.
• Always hiring developers over designers, in turn overloading designers without having enough meaningful work for developers.
• Multi-team, cross country/continent approach is constantly applied, but yields horrible outcomes.
• No place for generalists.
• Hacky, ""good enough"" approach, with virtually no attention to detail is present in all areas of the organization.
• People are building products which they never use, again this has a direct correlation to how these products perform.
• It's always easier to go out and buy a product, than to create one internally. The purchased product becomes bloated, unsuccessful, and eventually dies within 3-5 years of purchase; people are fired.
• Facilities people are horrible for the most part. You'll come into the office only to find that everything has been rearranged for you in your work space/desk - thanks, but no thanks.
• Don't bother with HR, they are useless over here. A bunch of sloths, too.

Autodesk is doing some very cool things in various industries and I believe they're moving in the right direction as a whole. The benefits are second-to-none and I think the compensation was very reasonable.,"The SDR role should be for a college graduate or someone with 1-2 years of experience. ADSK is unfortunately apprehensive to hire young people (without a referral) as it is a bit of an 'older' company/workforce. Therefore, they bring in people that have too much experience doing a call-center type job and get bored quickly. 

There is no upward mobility, pay raises, or varying responsibilities in the SDR role. They are limited by pay grade to actually move you anywhere so they give you the 'lateral movement' and 'create your own opportunities' speech. The problem with the lateral movement is that no one wants to put in 1.5-2 years as an SDR then move onto another product-line and be an SDR again. Also, they have made a culture of hiring from the outside so it's difficult to make a lateral movement anyway or create your own opportunity. During the hiring process, HR and a manager will say you can move into sales ops or marketing, etc. That is just not the case (until they bring those teams locally which is still never clear if they will).

Low-level and mid-level managers were very weak. They, for one, have no time with their teams because they sit in meetings all day. So the aspect of coaching, mentoring, etc was hardly ever present. They also do not have the authority to make quick decisions which hampered the teams.

Their was hardly help with career development like working on other projects, etc. Some people were able to do this, but for the most part your job is to just 'call' day-in and day-out. Also, as of right now, management expects the SDR to be a burnout role due to the huge gap required in pay and experience to move elsewhere in the company. They do not say that publicly, but no one seemed surprised when we had ~10 SDR's leave in under 2 months due to the fact that you can't move into an account executive role like typical SDR organizations offer."

*People are feeling more empowered to speak up when they see something is amiss.
*Great benefits/pay is reasonable / employee learning and development is encouraged.","* On-boarding into the company is a bit challenging and can leave you feeling a bit like you need to figure things out yourself.  Using the Intranet and asking lots of questions is encouraged. There are too many acronyms, it is a running joke, but has underlying truth.
* Decisions can get bogged down in multiple reviews and approvals.  
*Longer tenured employees can be reluctant to bring up issues to colleagues/managers because this was seen as a negative in the past. Hard to break old habits."

It was t until I was physically and mentally broken from the abuse of power of this man, that they realized what this man was doing, and they finally fired him.

There is no training on how to perform in your job role, and limited regular training opportunities. Management will tell you learn from the mistakes you make. This conflicts, because the moment you do make a mistake   management may hold it against you. Do whatever you can not to make any mistakes.  A lot of people lack in the soft skills department.

Tons of overinflated egos run wild, boasting the success of their ol' startup, and amidst this absolutely zero forward progress is made.

Most people that last longer than a few months in Autodesk carry a title of ""principal"" engineer and yet have trouble with basic daily tasks such as version control or testing, being well below average even for junior level in other places. The reseach division (OCTO) is possibly worse, with principal researchers having difficulty explaining their thoughts clearly or relating their work to others.

Flexible working arrangements mean you are treated like an adult. The company has a wonderful 'heart' and sets itself out to make the world a better place (or at least, that's the message from the top). There is some truly inspiring stuff going on in certain pockets of the company. It's certainly a company you can feel good about working for.","First, you'd better be good at dealing with Cognitive Dissonance... On the one hand, you think ""I am working for one of the world's top software companies"", while at the same time, you will see some of the most amateurish, slapdash, naive practices imaginable, not to mention a total lack of anything approaching a process or a plan of any sort. It's bizarre in the extreme. This is certainly the case in my part of the company, but it's hard to say if it's universal. Which brings me to my second point...

Autodesk claims to be one company but is more like about 50. Now, this may be 'normal' for a mega-conglomerate but, at less than 7,000 people Autodesk is hardly 'massive'. The thing is, Autodesk has grown almost entirely by acquisition. That's why it has such a fragmented nature, not to mention the most ridiculously overlapping portfolio of products you can imagine. If Wheel Reinvention were an Olympic sport then Autodesk would be triple gold medalists

The levels of post-rationalisation and ass-covering that many at Autodesk are capable of, particularly in middle management, is staggering. Get yourself into middle management, especially on the Product side, and you can happily crash and burn entire projects at the cost of tens of millions of dollars and be rewarded with a promotion. It is vomit-inducing."

Their product offerings are decent, and their UX is to be commended.","Rudest set of employees I have ever worked with. Constantly late or do not show up to meetings. No notification. Middle management lie to upper management saying that a project is under way, when no kick off meeting or context has been introduced. Middle management shirk work to jr employees or interns on the basis that ""the experience is great for you"" whether or not it has any relevance. Employees send urgent emails while on ""holiday"" or ""forced holidays""."

1843,Autodesk,"Far too Corporate, Disorganised, Political",2016-09-05,3.0,Software Engineer,"Global company with the opportunity to work on large projects and huge, renowned applications used by 10s of 1000s of people+

Access to great hardware and tools. Often a high degree of autonomy, but that may differ from office to office.","Lots of poor decision making - i.e. making a decision without understanding the impact; trying to implement global change without a strategy.

I've never worked anywhere with so many politics. It depends on who you work for and who they work for as to whether you can be given a raise or a promoted. The standing of an office depends on the products it produces and how they are valued. There's a lot of posturing going on because: multiple teams are developing competing products or services (which shouldn't be happening); because acquisitions have been made of poor products but backed by senior people who do not wish these bad choices to be highlighted. I've seen people sidelined or fired for saying the wrong thing, defending the wrong team, or for being associated with the wrong product.

Generally the levels of management make enacting change or having an impact can be impossible. Given the scale of the organisation there is a lot of waster and a lot of poor execution of the vision of senior management. The company is able to make huge mistakes and survive because it has a monopoly on many areas and is making such a huge amount of money, where a smaller company would crash and burn.

It can also be lost in translation as to which team is responsible for a success or failure and much of that is by design."

They politics is also unhealthy -- not in the sense of evil or repressive, but more in the sense of all the decision making happens miles from the work-face...  Senior managers are impossibly remote and irrelevant.  Middle managers have no idea what the actual detailed issues facing the company are, so instead generate a stream of spin and ""initiatives"" which in theory drive the company but actually just gets in the way.  Projects are launched with great fanfare, planned only in the broadest terms, then teams spend some years trying to live with the Realpolitik in a way which still permits them to do something useful.  After that the project never ends, instead it is just quietly forgotten and there is never any objective attempt to determine whether it succeeded.

Work life balance - out of balance"
1934,Autodesk,Was a good company,2016-05-05,1.0,Principal Software Engineer,"Very good work-life balance. People usually just work a few hours every day. 
The pay is not low but not high either. 
The company is not customer facing. And its products have sticky fact -- once the designers start using it, switching to another one is risky and costly. So it is sort of stable.
It is still dominating building industry and 2D CAD area. I tried a few other 2D softwares. They are far worse than AutoCAD.","The reason why I give it one star is because of three reasons (without them the company deserves 3 stars): 
1. when I leave the company recently, there is no exist interview. My manager asked HR but no response. The company doesn't care why you want to leave. 
2. I worked long enough time that I earn a sabbatical, which is 6 weeks paid vacation. I did not get payment for this when I left the company. So I sent email to HR asking for this. I did not get any response either. 
3. Early this year I had a friend who wanted to partner with Autodesk. So I sent an email to a senior sales manager asking how to do so. I did not get response.

Apparently people working there just want to get paid. They are not passionate. This is the reason why I wanted to leave too. Only a few percentages of people really working hard -- I know a few of them. The rest are just lying in their chairs, sometimes making negative contributions.  The company doesn’t pay excellent people enough – a few thousand dollar difference won’t encourage people to work harder and overtime. If you are smart and want to get paid for your contribution, don’t go there.

Not much growth. It is not one of the top three companies in 3D manufacturing industry. Since going from 2D to 3D is inevitable, it is losing its foundation. When their old customers (designers) retire, the company will suffer.

Pay is okay -- can't compete with the hot companies in bay area. Even startups can beat it.  If you just want a job, this is a good company to work with."

They've done it before, they'll do it again. Beware.

If this company didn't own the DWG format they would have died decades ago.  AutoCAD profit has allowed them to buy their way into other industries, and gobble up competition, and then over time release those engineers and replace them with cheaper talent either overseas or right from school.  They have done this time and time again.  It's a modern day form of corporate raiding.

It is a terrible way to run a business, and it is a reason why they can't grow ANY software in house and have it succeed, outside of Autocad and it's verticals.  Virtually all successful products beyond these have been ACQUIRED, and of those products, at least 50% of the engineers are gone within 5 years.  It's sad, really."

Jobs are varied and interesting, but don't expect to work only 40 hours/week -- it is a high-pressure place and many employees work between 50-60 hours/week, often late into the night and on weekends. As a global company, you can expect to have a call with Europe in the morning and then a call at night with Asia. Be clear on your boundaries.","Success at Autodesk depends on how good your manager is.  If you get a young, inexperienced manager, deliverables are unclear and inconclusive causing frustration and confusion. With a more experienced, knowledgable manager, communication is better and expectations can be met.  It's important to get clear direction on ambiguous projects so as to avoid mixed messages. Find out as much as you can about your manager's experience and how long people have been in your group before signing on."

-Excellent working hours. I work an 8 hour day and from home on a Friday

Generally all three of these are getting worse as the Autodesk takeover gathers speed.","This applies to the ex-Delcam office in Birmingham as of April 2016

-Terrible communication.
-Poor senior management though in fairness they aren't helped by the cliquey, siloed and poorly-structured workings of our Autodesk parent company.
-Salary and benefits are low for the Birmingham area which is noticeable considering the bulk of engineers here have Masters and PhDs from Russell Group universities.

A lot of Delcam is explained by it's history. One of the many CADCAM companies to start around the 60s and 70s (Autodesk, now our parent company, started about that time) it was originally a research group based out of Cambridge. Now it's a much larger company based out of Birmingham. The original founders have left but the first generation haven't. The result is a very close knit family feel at the top, but not much room for movement otherwise. Throw in Autodesk, an aggressive, fast-moving company with a poor track record for integrating acquisitions and you can imagine where Delcam is now.

Do not, I repeat do not, come to work for this company."

It's pretty cool to work for the original PC solution for CAD!
-Benefits are top-notch
-Very interesting problems to work on in the AEC/geometry/cloud/manufacturing/simulation space
-Strong marketing and sales organization leading the charge
-Great people tend to work here and you will be interacting with some top minds in the industry.
-Lots of mobility for motivated individuals
-Great office environments

Overall, If I had the chance to work here again, I would definitely take it.","This is a publicly traded company and brings along with it all the politics headaches and periodic ""Reductions in Force"" that accompany any big public company.  There's not much point in complaining about it.  It's all the same thing that brings all the great benefits and opportunities to work on cool problems.
-You will find that innovation, while valued, is painful and slow however, if you stick with it, there are definitely opportunities to innovate.
-You should be ok with not necessarily having your opinion valued on the larger picture items.  There is a corporate direction and that comes from the top, not the bottom in this company.  If you can be happy with that and are excited to tackle whatever challenge comes you will be very happy at this company, If you have vision and want to try and make change outside of your group, you will likely be disappointed.  
-I think you'll find Autodesk to be much like any large company.  If you really want to be able to influence change in an organization, look for a small startup.  I can't stress this enough: You will be successful here if you are happy doing your job as part of the big machine and not necessarily being able to see out to where you are going.  (regardless of what the ""come work here"" marketing hype suggests).  
-That said, note that there is a lot of internal opportunity for motivated individuals.  I've seen developers move to UI, QA people move to sales, developers move to product management, there is a LOT of opportunity here."

The politics are suffocating. Having worked at even larger places than Autodesk, I'm surprised how bad the politics are.
Territorial, conflict averse, and often self-interest kills progress. 
Decisions take forever. 
Major layoffs are the norm now.
You could be a rockstar employee, but if you get caught in the politics, watch your back.

Interesting technologies and new concepts, fun to discuss the possibilities.","In the sales org, you are held to weekly call metrics and activity reporting. If you come from a consultative environment and are used to managing your own schedule, it feels like a step back. There is more micromanagement than you would expect, primarily for the benefit of the bureaucracy. The sales management comes from a PC software sales environment instead of enterprise solutions environment, so the management model follows. Understand what you are signing up for as they make it sound like you are going to a solution sales company in the interview process....

So much potential to create great products.,"Company only cares about pleasing stockholders and not customers.  Would consistently bypass needed product improvements that existing customers were begging for and instead focus on sexy shiny bauble features that would attract new customers.  They didn't care if customers complained because Autodesk's strategy is to buy up any potential product competitors so customers have no choice.  Horrible place to work if you care about producing quality products and giving customers what they need. Also, it suspiciously seemed that ""older"" folks were being ""encouraged"" to leave by offering the juicy projects to younger staff. Politics were toxic. Managers took care of themselves and hung their people out to dry."

2130,Autodesk,Fantastic Company,2015-09-11,5.0,Senior Manager,"Autodesk is a company with strong ethics, and an inspiring vision and mission.  The company and most of the people who work for Autodesk seem to genuinely care about making the world a better place through intelligent design. 

Incredibly innovative and forward thinking in most business lines. CEO is responsive to staff, industry changes and market demands.  

Good benefits, but not the greatest & it will be increasingly difficult to retain talent as other tech companies double-down on benefits. Limited time off during the year is only (to some extent) supplemented by 6 week paid sabbatical every 4 years.  

Telecommuting / flexible work location for a lot of positions, which enables good work/life balance if you are diligent in playing your part to maintain balance (it is easy to work 24-7 & vacation days unless you go offline completely).","Many teams even within the same org operate in silos.  Very little sharing or communication between groups. Few feedback mechanisms between product and delivery teams, unless forged by individuals ad hoc (with such communication supported by their managers).  

Constant changes in management and yearly reorgs cause instability and loss of momentum.  Recovery periods from reorgs/management shifts are lengthy.  For a tech company, internal processes & communication channels are very outdated.  

Stock prices have decreased dramatically, and so has a substantial part of employee savings.  

Surprisingly political once you scratch the surface (which helps explain the frequent reorgs)."

It is a difficult culture for anyone to grow in, but especially for women leaders. HR is useless and only exists to protect the executives.

Since managers can't lead and inspire by their vision and personality,  in some teams managers are encouraged to tell their people in every 1-1 if they would hire them again.  This is from some ""management guru"" being brought in (at significant expense i'm sure)  to advise the Autodesk corporation on how to make a turn around and become a more innovative company.  Regular intimidations of the programmers in an attempt to appear modern and innovative shows lack of integrity that seems to pervade the middle management at this company."

Autodesk disdains experience in their own organization, but jumps at any hire from a competitor thinking they hold the key to success. Long term planning means >12 mos. The company easily tires of new initiatives, fast! Reality is not recognized at Autodesk. Perception guides everything at the company. Autodesk will tell you they are a leader in the manufacturing space. Nothing could be further from the truth. Autodesk is an also-ran, and barely a thought at the biggest and best manufacturers.

Development of professional skills is incredibly important, especially for those working in EIS.

It's cool seeing the Autodesk logo on video game splash screens. I am proud to tell people that I work for Autodesk.

The benefits are incredible. Health, vision, dental, 401k, ESPP, stock gifting based on performance. Healthcare providers frequently tell me that they've never seen health insurance as good as ours. Vision insurance pays for an eye exam each year plus glasses or contacts for every member of my family. The PTO is generous and there is no limit on sick time. Every 4 years employees are provided with a 6 week paid sabbatical to be used at any time within the next 4 years.

Employees are given the proper tools to do their jobs.","While telecommuting is available in certain situations, it is becoming more and more rare to hire someone not located near an office. It often seems as if good talent is being passed over in favor of having chairs being filled in offices.

Opportunities for career growth are based on politics rather than performance. If you ask why then you aren't dedicated to your job.  Some employees are able to jump from job to job and stay fresh, while others are overlooked and become stagnant.

Middle management - my biggest gripe. Employee disbursements look like a bell curve. C Level is pretty standard for any corporation, Once you start going down the ladder into middle management it swells like a balloon. Leave middle management and go on down the chain and it tapers back off. Any given person may have to answer to a number of people, and most of them contradict each other. All hands meetings are mostly spent focusing on one subject that only appeals to a small segment of the audience. Any news delivered can't be 100% trusted because by the time the next one comes around the process will have changed 10 times. Middle management ""interprets"" what they take out of those meetings and regurgitates it in a completely unrecognizable form. Always being told that the division is making money on a scale never seen before yet expenditures at levels below middle management are so tightly restricted that you can't effectively do what you need to. 

Benefits and perks that are advertised heavily on the ""look at why we're so great to work for!"" employment site are either limited to specific office locations or left up to direct manager discretion. If you get stuck with a manager who is afraid to spend any budget on his or her direct reports then you can forget any extras.

Work/Life balance is a mixed bag. It's easy to land on either side of this. Some people really manage that life part very well, while others can easily fall into the work part by saying yes one too many times. While employees aren't told that they live to work, the idea is implied. If you work hard you can't slack up because now your extra work is the norm and doing the standard amount is considered poor performance."

They throw their people under the bus when they get in trouble. 

For example my apps team had a great leader who really changed things around here. He was technical and helped us to modernize everything from bringing in agile development to changing the languages and databases. He was the only member of CIO staff who had any real diversity on his leadership team. But the CIO decided to fire him because it was becoming obvious he was so much a better stronger leader.

2191,Autodesk,Realpolitik,2015-06-29,2.0,Senior Director,"Autodesk is a rich company that benefits from a legacy of market dominance, monopoly power, and accordingly luxurious margins. Even as the company has been forced into increasingly competitive markets, their cash and channel have enabled them to thrive as an acquisition machine.

There is a lot of chaotic, frenetic activity that occasionally results in bona fide internal innovation within the product engineering teams. If you are young and just starting your career in software engineering or related disciplines such as product management, product marketing, etc., then Autodesk is a wonderful training ground. And, you'll be handsomely paid while learning.

Autodesk often ranks near the top of, ""Best Place to Work"" type of surveys. This is mainly because it suffers from what Marissa found at Yahoo: a culture of exploiting ""work life balance"" to the extreme. If you don't mind a work environment where people regularly work 5 hour days and ""work from home"" whenever they feel like it, then this is the place for you. You can also always find a seat in the supposedly overcrowded 1-Market (SF) location, which is some of the most beautiful corporate real estate you'll ever experience.

Finally, if you're pursuing a future as a manager/leader, then Autodesk will give you an intense training in the toughest variant of politics:  the politics of passive-aggressive consensus. While most quality leaders tend to avoid or flee this sort of environment, clearly some folks thrive within it. If you can rationalize this within your own value system, then climbing the management ladder in Autodesk will teach you how to equivocate like a pro.","Autodesk's overall culture can best be described as passive-aggressive, conflict-averse, and consensus-driven. Read through the reviews you'll find here or elsewhere and you'll see this theme over and over again. Talk to someone at a senior manager level or higher, and they'll confirm it (unless they're someone who loves that sort of thing; they're usually blind to it). Everywhere has politics, of course. But Autodesk's culture significantly amplifies the internal politics to many times greater than they should be for a company of this size. Example: making a decision which might take 3-5 meetings over the period of 2-3 weeks in even a much larger, more complex company can easily take (no kidding) 15-20 meeting over a period of 6+ months. And even then, the decision or agreement is at least 50% likely to be reneged upon by some passive-aggressive manager who had no intention of cooperating, resulting in a reset of the entire decision process.

The politics are most intense within the corporate GnA functions, most notoriously corporate finance and IT. Deep in the recesses of the back of the back office, the politics amongst the heavily bloated middle management and their executives truly defines realpolitik. Coercion, threats, dishonesty, doublespeak, intimidation and deception wrapped in euphemisms and culture programs are the norm. 

The bottom line is there are a ton of massively overpaid directors who enjoy working 20-25 hour work weeks, living in Marin, and never having to miss one of their kids' midday sports. They've managed to carve out their little feudal fiefdoms, and if you find yourself in any sort of situation which requires their cooperation--or worse their agreement to change anything--then prepare to defend yourself from an onslaught of smarmy politics. While I could provide examples, I'm pretty sure they would come off as exaggerations or hyperbole. All I can say is, Autodesk is a place where the unimaginable happens every day:  especially within the realm of politics.  

Lastly, Autodesk is a place people intentionally try to go to to retire. It is a lifestyle company. Many people don't go there to work hard, they go there for generous benefits, flexible work schedules and generally not to have to think too much. The company has an abnormally high tenure. There are lots of 15-20, even 25+ year lifers who enjoy ""untouchable"" status which they happily exploit. If you're a manager, you'll end up with at least a few of these folks on your team. All I can say is, good luck. Many of these folks literally have zero experience anywhere else but Autodesk, and they will not even recognize skills, experience or ideas you may have brought in from elsewhere as valid, let alone sometimes better. 

This matters because Autodesk has an incredibly effective ""tissue rejection"" culture. You can be there for years, be very successful, and still end up crossing paths with an untouchable lifer and find yourself on the fast track out."
2192,Autodesk,Thoughts from an Autodesk veteran,2015-06-27,5.0,Strategy and Marketing Executive,"I never expected to be a veteran of Autodesk or any company for that matter.  I like change.  I like big ideas.  I like to make big ideas happen.  In my 10+ years at Autodesk, I've had many different opportunities to work on big idea initiatives and drive positive change in the company, and this is the main thing that has kept me here.  If I were to find an opportunity to make a bigger impact somewhere else, I would probably take it.  I've considered a few opportunities at other companies over the years, but none has been as compelling as what I've been able to do at Autodesk.","Since Autodesk is a company that embraces change, those who are uncomfortable with change are typically uncomfortable working here.  While this isn't a con per se, it's something that people who are considering working for Autodesk should understand."

The longer you are there, the more you feel like there is a ""target"" on your back for termination. The company seems to be moving back towards more outsourcing. Opportunities for growth and advancement are there, provided you are extremely vocal about wanting them and willing to ""push"" yourself into those areas. For example, if you want to be involved in a project that offers new technology, but may not be assigned to it, you need to find ways on your own to participate and help with the project un-officially, hoping you'll be noticed. Also, there are too many meetings and too many org changes which do not provide any stability."

Work environment
Autodesk is one of the few companies who have managed to truly integrate the culture,  meaning and philosophy of their brand and what they stand for, into the facilities and  work environment. All of the primary offices are beautifully conceived. The workplace environment is well thought out, promoting open working, hot design with ample call booth and meeting rooms to hop into.

Here are some of my observations about the folks at Massachusetts offices.

There is a lot of talk and say about how they like to hire best people. But then when they get them, they do not know what to do with them or support them.
Product managers who are actually good product managers, are given an additional responsibility of being people managers. Well guess what they suck at it!

There is way too much of a focus on processes, politics and bonuses. That is why for years, this place has suffered from lack of innovation while Adobe's of the world have already gone to the cloud. They are way behind in cloud and use very old stacks where they actually are cloud based.
These guys are just starting. Even small things such as build environments change 2-3 times because there are way too many chefs in the kitchen.

There is way too much dependence on overseas teams for development who suck at software development. It is all about management (time,cost and resources) and less about leadership. 

It is no susprise that they are trying to reinvent themselves as a company, culture and business. The move to the new building later in the year is a huge indication of that. It is understood amongst the manager show have been brought in from mostly startups recently, that
this move will cause ""older/leecher"" workforce to leave on its own and younger intern/junior engineers to join in hoards. 

Well if you are interviewing here, keep in mind: this is still a big company but influx. I would not advice joining if your are starting a career, albiet you will be paid well. Other folks, you know better!"

Additionally, if you work in Europe and spend time working with US employees, be prepared for a poor work/life balance. You will get nothing done if you don't make yourself flexible to CA, and if you get nothing done you don't get noticed, leading us back to the point above.

Work/life balance depends on your manager, but overall, there seems to be an effort to help people balance their work for their own situation. Every four years, you are eligible for a six-week sabbatical. Besides that, you get Christmas Eve through New Years Day off so you can focus on spending times with your loved ones. Working during vacations, sabbaticals, and the week of rest is generally frowned upon. Work from home is allowed. 

One of the coolest things about working with Autodesk is that you are empowering the people who will change the world.

- Israeli office 'simple employees' usually nice, friendly and very devoted. There's weekly soccer, choir, and some employees even go travelling abroad together annually!","These cons relate to the Israeli branch only.

- Israeli office lost its startup spirit and intimate family company-like feel due to poor management (and not due to organic growth).

- It is not uncommon for promotions to be affected by nepotism and internal politics rather than merit

- Little care for the personal growth and career progression of existing employees.

- Managers often treat employees in a patronizing, antagonizing and unappreciative manner.

- Poor management leads to cumbersome project progress, and project-related decisions are made based on internal politics rather than what's best for the project and the company. Cross-site projects are especially ineffective.

- While a couple of years ago the products developed at the Israeli office were at the forefront of technology and company strategy, most of the current work is focused on MAINTENANCE, without innovating much.

Because of the dominance of the products used in the industry, you are able to meet many cool people in the industry and see the projects they work on, which are sometimes setting the benchmark in what they do. Overall very exciting stuff!","Way too much emphasis on MBAs and management type idiots who have no clue about the actual workings of the industry, and the majority have no personal attachment or interest in computers, software or computer graphics (they have not used any of the internally developed products and cannot differentiate theirs from the competition). These people are sapping the life-force of the company, from the people who can actually contribute to the health of it. Sad, but true. Autodesk has an incredible legacy, and honorable roots... once upon a time."

2325,Autodesk,"Good firm, beware the Autodesk Antibodies of Change",2014-08-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great salary, great benefits, great stock options.  If you're looking for a company to ""dock into"" and ""work to live"" (versus ""live to work""), then Autodesk a GREAT company.  It has a killer recipe for generating revenue, and protects that recipe at all costs.  So the company is healthy, and the benefits are great.

The customers LOVE the product.  And the people that you work with, for the most part, are pretty great.

For what it is (a technology commercialization firm), it does it very well.","In  order to really thrive at Autodesk, you have to understand that Autodesk is NOT a technology development company. it's a technology commercialization company.  The only real innovation that happens is around acquisition (of other technology) and (re)packaging of existing technology.  

And they definitely are not big fans of change. From the smallest internal change to the bigger, more systemic changes - the Autodesk Antibodies of Change (which are everywhere) will choke out any attempts at change in the company.  It's not done overtly, but rather in a very silent, passive-aggressive manner.  Which is pretty much the dominating cultural trait in the mid-senior levels of the company.

The fear of disrupting the revenue flow permeates the management layer.  They actually teach a leadership course where the primary objective is to teach the new leaders how the revenue flow works, with a half day spent on showing how many things can negatively impact or harm it.  It drives every management decision and forces an incredibly conservative approach to nearly every aspect of running the business.    

So if you're looking for a company where you can step in and make great things happen...keep looking.  Autodesk is not the place for you. Most folks who come in with new ideas  or an agenda (wanting to grow, develop, advance), are often weeded out within 18-24 months. Risk-takers do not fare well here.  The company thrives off of homeostasis, process and systems, and attempting to make any sort of novel impact is ...in a word...exhausting.  

Most of the 'deskers (employees) are with the company for 10+ years. They are heavily invested in keeping things (all things) the same.  

So change doesn't happen quickly - unless it's a re-org. 

Which happens about every year."

Office culture: Sink or swim, there is little to no help or direction. You need to be of the mind set to be willing to just try something and maybe fail, then accept the consequences. Human Resource Dept, Recruiting, and the senior Leadership teams are among the worse I've dealt with in 30+ years. Recruiting - they do not respond, nor do they provide feedback to individuals on whether they've been selected, or passed on - just rude.  Management teams, they grows teams and then dismiss resources with apparently little thought of the impact it has on individuals and team members - which can be devastating. It would be far better to shrink/grow with contractors rather than impact FTE's consistently.  And HR - non existent!  I had a resource visiting from another country hit by a car on the way to work, broke his ribs and had internal bruising.  He was delayed going home for over a month due to the injuries.  HR did very little to help this young man - provided no direction or help.

Benefits are very good.","In the earlier days many people brought their dogs and personal items to work, individuals had offices, there was a very loose dress code, and unique individuality was encouraged. Lately this has been replaced with ""open"" workspace areas (read fitting more people in less space), a shift towards more corporate khaki/button up culture, and much less individual expression in the office. It seems that the higher positions in this company are becoming more money hungry.

Unfortunately since it's such a large company, they can afford to peg individuals in very specific roles, with little flexibility for learning new skills or branching out. The pay is OK, but don't expect much of an increase year-over-year unless you're a ladder climber who can drown out others and make yourself visible to those a few rungs above you. It doesn't really matter how much work you get done - it's about inflating your image and being seen.

-I witness hiring of new employees and managers, and most of the time, I sit and just shake my head and ask how did they ever get this job.  Again, it's who you know.
-One manager was trying to win a prize on the radio during work and is still employ  to this day.  It's also sad to know that everyone in the department knows that the best thing she is good at, is ordering food.  It's also sad to know that her manager knows this and will not let her go, ""a lot of red tape to go through.""  
-Another employee has been employed for over 10 years and how she gets her work done is to ask 2-4 different employees to complete her work.  She reaps the credit and then complains about those same employees if they did her work incorrectly.  And get this, she still asks new temp hire's to train her in systems she has been working on for those past 10 years.  Again, her manager knows this as well as the whole department, but she is still here.
-We have employees here just collecting a good pay check and stocks and of course medical insurance by doing the bare minimum to nearly nothing.  They walk their dog 10 times a day.  10 smoke breaks.  10 coffee breaks.  1 hour lunch.  15 minutes legal law breaks for 8 hours of work.  Just to name a few.   Where do you find the time to put in ""work"" at your job?
-You ever seen the movie Office Space where they have the two independent audit guys come ask every employee ""What it is do you do here?""  If that happens here, you will start seeing better hiring.

Benefits, Work/Life Flexibility, Job Rotations, and a business in the middle of transformation (aka job security)

There are too many benefits to list them all.  That is why Autodesk is often in the Top 100 Places to Work.  Specifically, two six-week sabbaticals and a fully-covered child birth have been much appreciated.

Work/Life flexibility is not be confused with work/life balance.  Autodesk allows most employees to work anywhere and anytime.  This includes working on weekends, evenings, or while on vacation.  In exchange, you can take an afternoon or day off to attend family events, kids sports, etc.  If you get your work done, you 'earn' more flexibility.

Job rotations are often a substitution for promotions at Autodesk.  Personally, I've gained a wide range of experience by taking advantage of four rotation opportunities over my nine years here.  This approach has helped me to build an understanding of the various impacts of change on our customers, partners, and fellow employees when large change management efforts are introduced.

Transformation to newer subscription business models is generating more challenging work than there are employees to support it.  This has created a strong sense of job security for those individuals working on the products, projects, and systems that support the new business models.","Since there is always a huge funnel of ideas needing prioritization of corporate funding, the leadership team often changes it's mind and strategies, based on new information.  This occurs on a weekly basis and can create a sense of wasted cycles for those involved in enablement of management strategies.  It has also generated less than ideal customer experiences, as portions of the budget were throw-away work which could not be leveraged to support the latest weekly strategy from leadership; thereby leaving fewer funds for finalization of polished customer experience.  For a company trying to transform itself, this is too be expected.  This review is just setting expectations for those interested in Autodesk; expect weekly change and be comfortable with ambiguity.

We often find teams that do not get funded, off building skunkworks solutions that lack elements of customer experience polish you'd expect from a $2B company.  

Promotions are rare at Autodesk.  HR tends to recommend against promotions whenever they are raised by managers.  It's not always clear to employees what they need to do to receive a promotion here."

So many of the people at the top of the company are old cronies and they let each other slide. The newer senior managers, such as the the CFO, bring a level of professionalism to their teams that the others often lack. This is the core issue behind all the reorgs and other tumult that others have written about here. The real problem they need to face is that they need to get a good portion of the exec staff and some of the others OUT and bring in people who will create an environment that requires the exec staff to make changes in both channel and customer programs that reflect how business is done today. Some incompetent people pretty high up (Directors & above) are kept on by their cronies while dedicated, hard working people are jerked around by changes in strategy."

If you're in a product group, you will likely get more; support area, a lot less.  The CEO is smart and knows the business, but he also has a brusque no-nonsense and often unnecessarily ""rough around the edges"" style that can be intimidating and not invite people to give open feedback.

I love getting to work on interesting projects with smart people, and I've had the opportunity to lead a large team and take on more responsibility each year. The great thing about Autodesk is that hard work and good results are rewarded with more resources to scale those results, not simply more work. This is a real contrast to larger tech companies who are constantly cost cutting. Another thing I really like is that no matter what function I interact with in the company from finance, legal, marketing, engineering, IT, HR etc., people tend to be really good and fun to work with on the whole. It's refreshing when marketing and legal can actually get along! There are also awesome benefits for U.S. employees like a 6-week paid sabbatical every 4 years. That sabbatical is a huge retention factor for me.

Working at Autodesk is a privilege; you get to work with some of the brightest and most talented people on the planet, who love what they do.","Autodesk is a bit decentralized, making it a bit chaotic if you need to bridge multiple industry groups as part of your job. Autodesk lacks a culture of grooming great managers. It hires very talented people, and it does invest in them, but there is no general ethos of building people up to make them great leaders; you need to figure out how to do this on your own, and find your own path. Also, Autodesk acquires many companies, and typically the leaders of acquired companies get moved to key management roles, leaving the folks who have been in trenches still in the trenches.

The company gives only one earned day leave per month which can not be used ahead of time.

3. The people in the upper echelon gets promoted by being good at internal politics. 
4. Some of the managers may not have a good understanding of the area they are trying to manage.
5. The company does not have a good understanding of simulation business but wants to be a simulation leader. Upper management does not even understand the difference between a convergent valid solution and a convergent garbage result when it comes to simulation and as a result they are pushing for low cost, snazzy looking simulation products for the future which would end up giving garbage results for any complicated simulation especially in FEA / multi-physics domain.

2593,Autodesk,I'm surrounded by geniuses,2011-12-14,5.0,Principal Interaction Designer,"A great place to work, i'm constantly impressed with the level of talent of the people I work with, smart, clever, easy to get along with and always at the top of their game.","Sometimes it feels like you can't change things from the bottom up, however it is very easy to go talk directly to senior management, to get your voice heard, so its rarely a problem."
2594,Autodesk,Excellent and interesting experience.,2011-11-30,4.0,Software Engineer,"good chance.
new technology.
good salary.
chance to travel.
stable.","not comparable salary.
treat people from different country different salary."
2595,Autodesk,"Amazing company, products and people!",2011-11-21,5.0,,"Fantastic products and company strategy and direction are inspiring!  
Excellent work/life balance and people are smart, talented and respectful.    It's a dynamic, global company with tremendous opportunities to challenge yourself and grow.   Great office environments and benefits are outstanding!   The executive team is intelligent and down to earth.","Performance needs to be dealt with more aggressively as there are some people who are not meeting the current bar of performance.    
Global company means meetings at odd times but the flexible work environment enables you to work around this so you're not working 24 hours a day!"
2596,Autodesk,Incredibly smart and driven team that strives for quality,2011-11-18,5.0,President,"Very smart engineering team that strives for high quality code and product dev, including attention to detail, clean well-architected code, and taking the time to do it right, instead of rushing something out the door.  Both the head of engineering and lead architect are always willing to listen to feedback and take other peoples ideas into consideration.  Free drinks and snacks.",Demanding work environment that may not fit the typical 9-5 lifestyle.  Low tolerance for imperfection or sloppy coding.  Very little in the way of fun company activities.
2597,Autodesk,Great time to work for Autodesk,2011-11-10,5.0,Senior Business Manager,"I've worked for Autodesk for almost seven years.  I worked for four other employers previously; non-profit, for-profit, Fortune 50, high-tech, no-tech, ect.  This is the best of them all and I'm not thinking about leaving.  Autodesk has the benefits of an established company in a fast-paced and innovative industry.  It is truly a global company with equal amounts of revenue coming from AMER, EMEA and APAC.  It is a good company; kind to the environment, fair to employees and contributes positively to the communities where it is located.  Carl Bass, the CEO, socializes with employees, especially on a field, track or court.","Often long and odd hours; calls at 10:00 pm and 6:00 am.  People get in here and stay, so you really have to impress to get ahead.  Poor performers are not always dealt with so you have to work around them."
2598,Autodesk,basically it is a good place...,2011-11-10,3.0,,"Work life balance. Not sure about guys work in other project, but working time is quite flexible. 
Nice building and working condition. 
Medical insurance covers the whole family.","Promotion opportunity is limited.
Desktop app is not hot in the market now.
Some unqualified colleagues. It would be a disaster if happen to work with them.
Not a good place for growth."
2599,Autodesk,"Good employees, cool products but management could use improvement.",2011-10-31,3.0,,"Decent work life balance most of the time
Good benefits plus 6 week sabbatical for U.S. employees every 4 years
Really like the new consumer products area Autodesk is getting into
Casual work environment","Too many meetings about nothing
Pay is mainly in the mid-range, although senior management is paid very well
Individual contributors are not well compensated - you need to be a manager to have a decent salary
Most mid-level managers manage their teams poorly - they need more training
Non-revenue generating departments are extremely tight with their budgets and stretch their employees
Annual employee survey doesn't show much results
Carl Bass doesn't have company wide meetings"
