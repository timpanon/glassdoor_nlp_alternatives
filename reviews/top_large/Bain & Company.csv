59,Bain & Company,Awful workplace but go for it if you can,2022-03-16,2.0,Senior Associate Consultant,"-Exit opportunities. Bain is Bain and if you made it in, you will have a fun, lucrative career that will be what you will make of it.
-Transfer opportunities. You can get a transfer to another office that might actually be a better experience.
-Learning. People here are very smart and will push you to be a great analyst. Additionally, Bain's international training programs are the best in the business, and the learning materials are awesome. If you have the time and curiosity, you can immerse yourself in fascinating insight.
-Perks. Not during COVID, but it's great to travel around and have expenses generously covered.","Toxic environment, period. Where do I start?
1. Feedback is never genuine. You could grind to improve on something mundane just to be beaten on it over and over. Once the hounds smell blood, you can never recover. Your cohort will dwindle and soon enough it will look like a season of survivor. This also harms the relationships you create while in Bain because it's just a long struggle and not something you reminisce.
2. The managers and the partners are mostly unpleasant. Mentorship is not genuine at all, there is no sense of collegiality, and there are no sources for support. When I first got in I couldn't get a 1:1 with my mentor for months, and everybody knew that the guy just doesn't like being there so what could I possibly learn from him or get help on?
3. Nobody has time, ever. Especially since COVID. Nobody has time to give you feedback or have a PD chat. Nobody has time to befriend you. You will be extremely lonely and just wait for it to end. Pre COVID this was different but the culture has not recovered.
4. Diversity not only doesn't exist - this place is openly discriminatory. I constantly heard misogynistic comments from managers and consultants, such as ""women don't do well in these interviews so we had to change them"", or ""women can't drive"". I really don't want to know what they have to say about non-white or non-straight people. Women are told that if they feel that their team doesn't want to hear their opinions, maybe they should stay quiet and learn.
5. HR, like in most corporate places, is a rubber stamp. Please don't go to HR if you have issues, and just try to stick around long enough until you find your next step.
6. Many people here get physically ill because of how much they have to work and how much pressure they are facing. It's not that hard to extend deadlines with clients or work more efficiently - but Bain doesn't teach you that. Instead, you will reiterate font sizes until your head drops on the keyboard. 
7. The up-or-out structure is not what it used to be. You don't get long severance anymore with decent time to look for a new place, and there is no real process to get you on track if you're not doing well enough. You just get a call one day saying you're done and good luck. Even the manager on your case might not know and you'll be the one telling them. Yeah they put you on a PIP but it's maybe 4 weeks long and there is 0 transparency about the whole thing. It has become a theme in this office that talent is not nurtured or discovered - their job is to find bros like them who will become abrasive managers and partners with the ability to squeeze any drop of productivity from the consultants and generate big buck for the firm.
8. Just to reinforce the pros - despite everything I said, go for it. stay for 1.5-2.5 years, that's enough, don't dig through reddit forever to learn that you need to leave as a manager. Get the fast learning of the first year and then start looking outside, there will be something waiting for you and I thank Bain for that."

There are serious question marks about the skill set and capability of the newest local leadership, that started in Oct 2021. There were multiple issues at recent company offsite during Nov 2021. Please are well aware of abusive attitude and late-night alcohol related problems at that particular event. Additionally, the global leadership keeps distributing the personal phone number for WhatsApp chats in meetings and townhalls to everyone. Not sure, why he encourages people to talk on third-party social media platforms, that Bain has strictly prohibited for any official usage. These are not healthy traits for any good leadership personal."

They are non-existent for employee grievances. They would only cater to their own personal interests e.g. development and promotions for HR individuals only. 

However, other business functions (e.g. TSG, Finance, KM, Marketing, IT) are lowest priority and they do not care about them. 

In the offices at GBS (India and Warsaw) and BCN (India), the situation is truly alarming. The senior most office leadership is in sync with corrupt HR practices. Employees are not offered any flexibility and their opinions are tactically suppressed. Often fake surveys are run and any genuine suggestions from these are never addressed."

They do not want you to stand up and express yourself anywhere. Every year, they run a fake WWES survey in the office and coach (or literally instruct) during the whole year and meetings to fill higher ratings for the office.

They have hired a bunch of incompetent people in a team, so that everyone keeps saying - 'Yes Boss'...Not only the team is inexperienced but they lack skill to deal with complex matters, such as salary benchmarking, experienced hiring, etc..

The leadership team keeps sending emails about new and existing policies every week, so that people are reminded that they cannot talk or escalate their genuine issues to anyone.

The local office leadership doesn't even know to draft proper emails. They only loves to discuss about a favourite topic i.e. Alcohol and that's it. The employees in general do not connect to the language and expressions. They always toes the line with a particular team to ensure their internal harmony."

HR will tell you that they can't do anything because of ""company rules"". Partners will tell you the same. Colleagues will feel bad for you but cannot really do anything.

388,Bain & Company,"Bro Culture, Micromanaging, and Poor Pandemic Response",2021-11-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits are pretty good.,"I feel like this place did a 180 on me. My experience has not matched what was pitched in the interview.  I don't think anyone here is trying to be toxic but they certainly exhibit these behaviors in my experience.  Since starting here I have personally experienced gaslighting, micromanaging (wanting to read your emails for example), being interrupted, having my expertise questioned, etc. I do not feel heard and I do not feel like I have the autonomy needed to do my job. Unfortunately, this is a common experience for those in my demographic.

There are other cultural things that make me uncomfortable as well. There is so much pressure to participate in extracurricular Bain activities e.g. Bain band, pub crawls, etc. that I don't feel like I have a choice in saying no. If that's you're passion, by all means, jump in and have fun; but that's just not for me. The idea of singing songs about my workplace (as they do in Bain Band) is 100% offputting to me. We work here, this is not a capitalist worship house. It's also not super-inclusive to encourage constant after-hours activities (which are often at a bar). Imagine what that would feel like if you had a family, cared for a parent, or didn't drink for one reason or another. I'm not saying I'm against all work events or drinking at these things, I just think they could be more mindful of how this can make others feel. I personally feel obligated to attend lest I want to limit my professional goals. 

They also do these really bizarre reply alls -- to the entire office-- that are at best a waste of people's time and at worse inappropriate. I'm sure I must sound like a killjoy at this point but dang...I just think that folks should be able to opt into how social they want to be with people. I don't need to know about everyone's business to do my job. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of awesome people here and I think it's great to make friends at work. I just think it should be more organic. I don't want to have to comb through 100 emails har-haring at something that I'm not even involved with just to get to my actual work emails.

They've also had a really bizarre approach to the pandemic in recent months. Lately, there has been a huge push to get folks back to the office. Sure there are precautions they have in place, like twice-weekly testing, but it's still an odd choice to pack folks into the open floor plan (most people maskless to boot) just for the sake of it. What's really odd is how jovial they seem to be about it. They'll email out pictures of crowded lunchrooms, meetings, etc as evidence of how great it is that folks are back and then offhandedly mention the breakthrough cases that happened. I get that there is a value in being in the same space every now and again but to what end? We can't simply will the pandemic to end and folks are working perfectly well from home. It just comes off as that old-school management thing where they want to watch over your shoulder all the time.


There are also a lot of issues with the values and historical decks/content that would 100% not fly today(but are still being used for some reason). For example, they want you to have an ""insurgent mindset"" which is just really gross sounding. A lot of what they do feel like 1984 doublespeak to me. For example, a few women on a recent panel talked about how great Bain was to them when they became mothers. They both mentioned stepping into lower roles so they could be with their kids more. Now on the one hand this could be a great thing...if Bain is helping people with kids find the right work-life balance then that's cool. Unfortunately, I didn't get that vibe. I might be reading into it too much but their stories made it sound like leadership roles at Bain require so much work after hours that it'd be very difficult for parents (especially mothers ) to maintain them. I'm not saying this is the case, this is simply my impression of what was shared. 

Overall I just think this place is designed for people with very different backgrounds than my own."

Bain differentiates vs. direct competitors especially on that last element and clients recognize this
- Diverse assignments in terms of client, industry, topic, role and team composition. You're not being asked to specialize until the senior manager level, which is great for diverse experiences initially. Specialization later on comes at a natural moment when you take on increasing project and client responsibility
- Family-like culture that goes beyond just being good colleagues, especially in Amsterdam. This is reinforced because of the staffing model that is more local than McK or BCG. Many friendships for life are built. There is so much social activity that you'll have to be selective to not drown in it
- High flexibility in the career path you want to take - much more so than at McK and BCG at the time I worked there
- Good compensation, roughly at par with McK and BCG","The hours are the biggest drawback. The Amsterdam office aims for a 55 hour average work week and takes action when hours escalate. However, in the end it remains a personal responsibility. You have the choice between a 80, 90 or 100% solution and there is always another challenge to tackle if you want. There is quite some variation in hours between colleagues based on their personal preferences, ability to do the 80% solution and ability to say 'no'. In the end, it's in your own hands. And of course there will always be the occasional spike before a big deadline or when something unexpected happens, when you give the extra push with the entire team (which tend to be great moments actually)."

- Massively underpaid for the sacrifices you need to make. You work in the same team as people from other offices, but some of them earn 2x as much as you.
- Workforce of insecure overachievers creates culture of fake and embellished upward feedback. If you express sincere feedback that is slightly too critical, you will be immediately seen as a threat.

There truly aren't weak links in this chain, I've never worked in a place where I am so appreciate and supported by my co-workers. It's generally very invested in it's employees and the benefits are very thoughtful. 

There are a lot of places to plug in, but you really have to be motivated and self-starting in order to go anywhere here. In the assistant position, potential growth is extremely limited and there is not currently a path for assistants to be promoted within the company.","There is zero wage transparency and many antiquated compensation practices that negatively impact BIPOC and women for hourly employees. 

If you're expecting salary growth, this is not the company for you. There is one promotion available to assistants with a significant raise and after that you're done. This promotion is based more on the needs of the company than the qualifications of the employees, so you could be waiting for less than a year for a promotion, or you could be there for 4 years. 

Raises are typically awarded at about the rate of inflation and are non-negotiable. If you are comfortable with your salary offer, you'll be fine.

Manager Assistants support six people and are not allowed overtime. It's a response to the pandemic that they are currently planning on making permanent. Do not factor in overtime to your compensation because they expect you to keep your hours under 40 a week (and it's not a 40-hour a week job, closer to 45-50 if you're working at a sustainable pace)."

* Breadth of experience - In 2 years, I have been exposed to cases in more than 6 industries - a great place to learn about a variety of industries and functions
* Benefits - Bain really tries to provide the best suite of benefits to its employees and their families (healthcare, parental leave, etc.)","* Work-life balance - even with the shift to WFH, 65+ hour weeks are not uncommon. There is a lot of variability in that weekly schedule as well"

From the global pandemic, important social issues and stressful political issues that were affecting all of us, the company really proved that they truly cared about their people. They not only offered physical, emotional and financial support, but they also took additional steps to create fun and uplifting work environments for everyone. Simple things like encouraging virtual team events and creating ways for us all to stay connected, it really made a difference when things were difficult as we sheltered at home.

Terrible hours (they are both long and intense), more than the average of the industry in my region (colleagues from Mck and BCG all agree I have the worst hours of all);
Projects are way understaffed (literally all my projects had people “on top” because the price we charged from the client is too low for the scope agreed; my current project has THREE TIMES the amount of people agreed with the client and even then I’m working 85 hours a week);
Only one way to be: Bain says they are focused on diversity but no profile is accepted other than the typical consutant - highly extrovert, absolute great at analysis, over deliverer (even at the costs of people satisfaction and even when the client was perfectly satisfied and happy with what we had initially agreed on).

- Slow career path if staying from the AC position to Consultant - you go through the same ~3 year career progression as someone fresh out of bschool with no consulting experience (given more difficult roles, paid the same, promoted on roughly the same timeline)
- (True of many consulting roles) Lack of ownership for the results of your work - infrequently involved in implementation and operationalization"

Excellent client set 
Interesting work (most of the time) 
Fantastic training programs","At the firm level, there is a focus on sustainability - but sometimes this gets washed away by individual case teams, especially since WFH started. Raising these issues to your direct manager/sr. manager can only help in the short term (1-2 days of focus, and then return to the norm). Far too often LT gets defensive during sustainability conversations where junior/mid level team members have to justify the hours they have worked.

Overall leads to junior team members not speaking up about sustainability or motivation issues, because who wants to get into an argument with their boss' boss on how much work you do on a daily basis? 

For many cases, have seen LT promising to do work outside scope and not bring in additional resources, which then burdens the team. 

Post covid: Weekend work (used to be taboo at Bain) has become the norm, super late nights (1-2am) and early mornings (7-8am) which used to be 2-3 days / week have become modus operandi. HR is working to improve post-covid sustainability, but won't be very successful till case teams stop doing work outside the scope. 

Also, 15 days of paid leave is not sufficient or in line with India's market practice. Needs to be improved.

1541,Bain & Company,People come first. Period.,2020-08-17,5.0,Senior Manager,"- Incredible team of people. Lots of companies say they put their people first, but Bain actually does it. Let's acknowledge upfront that that makes a lot of business sense in a world where people are the product, but Bain truly delivers. Some examples: I had a team who fought for me, who pushed against the odds and the statistics, to get me the opportunities that were exciting to me. I had someone who worked for me who dropped everything when her peer's father caught COVID - this led to some crazy hours and stressful days, but this individual believed in our operating principle ""A Bainie Never Lets Another Bainie Fail"" - something that has permeated everyday of my career here. My path hasn't been standard but I have felt deeply supported and seen as an individual at each step of the way. 
- We do great work for our clients. Cliche, I know. But as I work with my clients, it's clear that Bain is different. We focus on delivering value that the client can actually realize - it's not about the academically perfect answer or something complex that will require 5 more years of consulting. It's about making the client successful. 
- Can't get thru 2020 without mentioning COVID. Bain went work from home before SF city ordinances (which were some of the earliest in the country) and has put employee safety first at every step. This includes people moving across the country to be with family or needing flexible work schedules to manage child care or other WFH needs.
- We aren't the most diverse company and have struggled to recruit and retain people of color and LGBTQ individuals. And I've seen Bain step up this year to fix this. Including massive financial commitments, changes to our operating principles, Diversity committee to report to MD to evaluate and track stats, an Americas-wide Juneteenth training on systemic racism and what it means at Bain. We are nowhere near the end of the road here, but as a gay woman, I believe in what the leadership is saying and setting out as a goal and direction for the company.","- it can be a bit of ""you put in X years, you get Y reward"" but I do think that's shifting over time
- If you aren't starting as an AC (right out of college) ... it can be alienating - the ACs who work here get such incredible opportunities and boosts that those joining out of biz school never had... I've heard many people discount how hard it is to get into schools like HBS and GSB because ""it's just expected."" As someone who fought for that degree, it can come off as cavalier, discounting, and perhaps ""holier than thou"" (oh you had to work for this thing that was just a duh for me? poor you...). Have to develop a tough skin and know that your path was worthy and real and important to survive that egotistical stuff."

From our office head down, I feel as though the support and care are genuine.
Bain is able to make coming to work fun! There are so many social events that you can get involved in, which also foster interconnectivity between different departments/people.
Bain has handled COVID in a way that has been supportive to the employees by allowing budgets for home ergonomics and technology to optimize the WFH set up. Although many things are unknown for the world right now, I feel as though Bain has been communicative throughout the whole process.

1692,Bain & Company,Best consulting firm to work for,2020-04-27,4.0,Consultant,"Great culture - people tend to be very supportive and willing to help if you need it. You get to work with major companies - often the biggest or top 3 in their respective industries. There is a greater emphasis on client relationships vs. other firms, and more client engagement. This translates into longer-term cases with the same client. This can be pretty rewarding since you not only get to develop a strategy or an improvement plan, but also help implement it (or at least begin to implement it). Travel is not that bad - although you travel frequently, Bain staffs on a regional level, meaning that you won't be flying across the country. Instead, you will typically be in the same state/one state away.  Great pay & benefits. Very clear career progression path (with tough cut-offs), but if you make it to the next level, pay and responsibility increases are substantial.","Typical cons endemic to consulting as an industry - your work doesn't always get used by the client. Even if the work does get used, many cases are short (as consulting services are expensive), so, you don't really get to see your recommendations be implemented, but end up moving on to the next case - although at Bain that is less likely to happen than at other firms, since there tend to be longer-term client relationships. Also, the hours can be quite brutal with some weekend work. In general, it is hard to have a balanced life during the work week - you are not going to be taking community college classes and grabbing drinks with your friends on Thursday nights. If you want to have a gym routine, better try to go in the morning before work. However, that's a trait of consulting as an industry, and is not specific to Bain."

1779,Bain & Company,This might be the best job I've had yet.,2019-12-18,5.0,Consultant,"The work: 

Working on some incredibly interesting problems, with incredibly smart people is exhilarating. From driving forward AI in cars, to driving sustainability in farming and agriculture.

The people:

Imagine picking some of the nicest, most intelligent people in a workplace, and then having an entire company made out of those people. Everyone loves to have fun, and goes the extra mile to make sure work can be fun.

The perks:

Bain will take care of you. They'll make a lot of nuisances in life go away.","Monday morning to Friday afternoon, Bain owns your life. Depending on the project, this can mean going home at 5-6pm everyday, but it can also mean long hours, stress, and tons of unpredictability."

Great Location
Great interior design, lots of space to choose from to do work
Free coffee, bananas, food options","Double standards, favoritism, management is absentee or not willing to listen to employee concerns and create actionable solutions to benefit the employee and the team.  

They tout ""one-team"" oriented environment and being ""at cause"", but that's only when it's convenient for them.  When push comes to shove (when you attempt to be ""at cause""), and they have to ""deal with you,"" they will make you feel like YOU are the problem.  This is also because they lack the skill-set to effectively mediate a situation.  Do not try to voice a concern, this will only make YOU look ""difficult.""  

Basically, they are about themselves, not you.  If you have a problem, they will turn it against you and then have HR gang up on you to make you feel like even less of a person.  I've seen this happen with almost every person I've ever worked with in Graphics for the last 10 years, and it's getting worse by the year.  If you don't mind being a grunt without a voice, this is the place for you.  I didn't often seen happy faces walking down those newly designed halls.. most people seem miserable and unfriendly.

-High touch professional development team helps you feel like you're not just a cog-in-the-wheel, I feel like I've had a very personalized journey through Bain over 6 years
-Best culture and combination of high performance people that actually treat each other well
-I feel prepared to go do so many different things, and at the same time I've continually opted into the role and the path here","The two things the firm is working to address are consistent with what I would observe:
-Sustainability - this is a hard job. A really hard job. The culture is super high performing and the problems we solve are not easy. This means that it's hard to turn your brain off of the work even if you leave for home at a reasonable hour. The upside is that relative to other consulting firms, the home office staffing model does very materially make this more of a sustainable place to build a long-term career in consulting. I've been here 6 years and could not have possibly done that if traveling 4 days/week as at many other firms. 
-Diversity and inclusion - consistent with many aspects of the corporate world, Bain is behind where it wants to / needs to be on the dimension of consulting staff diversity. I've been encouraged by how"

There are ways to minimize time away from home - like working with private equity or local clients - but I haven't historically prioritized those in my planning, which means more time on planes and less time to be with friends during the week."

1939,Bain & Company,4 year Bainie in Dubai,2019-09-01,4.0,Consultant,"The consulting experience is probably the single greatest business-world crash course you could hope for in life. I came to Bain straight out of university, so I feel myself having been modled into the consultant mindset early. From strategy projects, to on-the-ground implementation, to developing the ability to master a subject matter quickly (""achieving expert status""), high-value communication, and even general organizational business experience getting perspectives in accounting, finance, ops, or sales. Overall I would say there is only pros from a career perspective for 2-4 years. 

Bain is renown amongst the big 3 for its culture, and I would have to say it has the best systems and people in the business. Its not like the others are bad, I think overall everyone has a high caliber workforce and great people, its just that Bain takes pride in making people the center of their employee experience, so they just take a bit more care for it systematically, and they look for the people ""it"" factor in their hires. I can't say that I've met any ""bad"" people though at McKinsey or BCG though.

Compensation is great, benefits are great, the trainings are super valuable, and the miles/hotel points were all great perks. I made friends for life here to, so your peers tend to be really high caliber folks you will likely keep in touch with for the rest of your life. Its an intense period, and you spends loads of late nights and airport time together, so bonding with good people is key.","The one major con would be work life balance and working hard, but I honestly find that it helped me develop a much stronger work ethic in life. If you're willing to sacrifice, it will pay off in the long run. 

Culture is there at Bain worldwide, but the project quality and work culture really depends on your office. The Dubai office is governed by Dubai clients, which tend to be a lot of implementation projects. The main sectors are Gov, Oil&Gas, Banking, Telco, and some cool Retail or M&A projects sprinkled in. The internal culture in Dubai is probably not as strong as in other Bain offices, because the clients here can be extremely demanding and in need a high quality people to get work done, which often lands on the consultants/managers. I would say that in comparison to other Bain offices though, the Dubai consulting staff is generally more developed early on in their careers, so its a great ""step up opportunity"" for you to learn fast and gain lots of responsibilities early in your career. Don't be mistaken though, its definitely an intense, often frustrating, work life balance. 

Longer term projects are also common in Dubai, so less flexibility, and that breeds a bit more internal politics than one would like to get projects that you like. But playing the game is also valuable learning lesson for industry. Its been 4-5 years since my Bain days though, so all that may have changed at this point. I wouldn't take back my time there, I think its an excellent career launching pad.

Senior management was a bit harsh and unrelatable in my time there. The good partners tend to already be booked out in terms of mentorship, so it was difficult to find a mentor you could really get behind, but once I did, I stuck with him and learned probably the most from him."

Working on very interesting, challenging problems for household name clients","All of the cons are inherent to consulting / client services - think Bain does a fantastic job of managing where possible. That said:

Sustainability - the work/life balance is a struggle for a lot of Bainies, from AC through partner
Stress - working on big problems isn't easy :) the ""constantly steep learning curve"" is real. You have the training, the tools, and support, but it's still hard.

The skills -- you will learn and you will learn fast. The biggest thing I've taken away from Bain is that there are a number of questions out there that we haven't seen before and don't know how to solve, but we will figure it out.
The company -- this company does so many things right; they have a very clear rubric for what is expected of you at every different role, and you can see how your role will grow and change over time. They also do a great job of giving reviews, both formal and informal to ensure that you are growing and developing over time. They also build in a lot of time to build the culture and develop a workplace that makes people want to show up.","You don't have complete control over the projects that you work on, so you may end up doing something that you don't like.

Culture is definitely more open/fun than at competitors. Everyone from partners to support staff is happy to joke around which makes the long hours more bearable.

I learned a lot about analytics, project management, and prioritization while there.

Great connections fellow consultants and clients.

Leadership knows the firm needs to improve in terms of sustainability and diversity. They've got a lot of work to do but I also believe they genuinely care.","Work-life balance is going to be pretty bad most of the time (~60+ hours/week) and really awful every few cases (~80+ hours/week).

Good thing, as it accelerates careers for top performers, but not different from any other consulting firm - even heard actually slower than BCG or McK.
Branding helps when applying for future jobs.
Nice colleagues - made some good friends at Bain.","Sustainability is an issue, but not as bad as some other offices though.
Lots of biases on evaluation and even inaccurate assessment of work quality from upper management when they don't look closely at Analyst's work - ex.: if very inexperienced CTL or Consultant is overseeing team, Principal will believe what gets to his/her ears 100% without understanding the full picture.
Very hypothesis driven culture should be a good thing, but majority of the hypotheses are not actually tested as analyses are (very) poorly done to ""goal seek"" wanted results - I've seen several examples of that. Biases from upper management will for sure impact the results of your work as they are more worried with long term relationship and matching expectations from senior clients - so don't expect to change the world or do cool analyses, but otherwise expect to be one more piece of the puzzle for the relationship - it is a sales organization at the end of the day.
Some managers/partners in the LA office can be arrogant or hard headed.
Boring projects in the LA office - very few strategy projects, majority will be more operational.
Bain is a lot behind other top consulting firms in terms of digital work - just recently started hiring talent specifically for digital projects. Not sure how are things now, but it was chaotic and no one knew what they were doing."

The culture is toxic. Most of the employees are incredibly unhappy, but stay for the perks and job stability. It is considered taboo to ever speak against the company culture. Anyone who voices their discontent is labeled a ""bad seed"" and quickly pushed out.  In regards to the day-to-day work: The work is the same recycled solution and there is little space for innovation and creativity. In one of my cases, I observed consultants actively fabricating data in an attempt to sell an ""answer"" to the client. When I brought this information up the ranks, even up to the Partner - it was pushed under the rug and I was punished for not being a team player.

2.  Can't remember anything else","This is the only section that defines how working at BCC is like.
The company has the worst kind of ethics related procedure. Nothing is followed according to the ethics provided in the charter but is dependent on the whims and fancies of the group manager and team manager. This entity lures people from the market on the behest of it's respectable parent organization - Bain and company, but it's nothing close to it. I will break it down to discuss the different paradigms.

1. Culture

The entity is run by a cartel of group managers and their flatterer(team managers) who do things according to their will without any check. People at senior level are mostly not qualified enough to answer queries on the function they are handling. If they find out that you know more than them, get ready for an egoistic clash and a round of denigration on most of the matters.
If you are a lateral, you are in for a ride. I think this is the only company that very strongly differentiates it's hire as laterals or home growns - with most of the benefits going to the homegrowns since they have grown by agreeing to all fancies of the management. They have reviews and analysis by laterals vs homegrowns which definitely all the time makes the laterals feel like an outcast.
The easy way to success in the organization boils down to being a bootlicker of the senior management, have no views of your own and never challenge them in terms of knowledge - even though if you know more. If you do the above, you are sure to go places and earn promotion otherwise you might end up in a spot where they continuously find ways to mentally harass you.
No respect for a work life balance and I was amazed to see that senior people here most of the times don't have any work and are just passing time in the company - getting complacent with their own inability.
The senior management does not have industry knowledge and cannot groom you accordingly- chances are you would know more than them, only exception being if you want to be a master politician and harasser of people.
Concerns to the HR are never heard since every news goes out to the senior management who then dictate accordingly.

2. Work

In bold letters - This is not a strategy firm. It has all that of tactical work that no one in the industry wants to do and hence is sent to this great place. Working on shards of the complete glass, you never know what the project is talking about. If you have worked in the industry, you are coming to a place that will add aryabhata's zero to your resume. It would get so difficult to define this work outside and you would as well be in a state of demotion - a confidence shattering experience. All manual activities that the bain teams don't want to do are sent for disposal at this place which is definitely not a great motivation. The senior management is even scared to add new avenues as these things don't fall under their comfort level and it's been ages since they have actually worked up on something that would value add or is more relevant in the industry in current times.

3. People 

Be a flatterer and you rise without any work as well. Be an efficient worker merely keep yourself alive under the scrutiny of the big bosses.
The young freshers are quite good and smart, can't say the same about the senior management since they run it more like a shop or their own property. These people live in their own world and deem most of the laterals as culturally unfit - coming from the people who have stayed their entire life here and saying it to people who have actually done meaningful work globally - that's how irony looks."
2119,Bain & Company,Not for me,2018-12-22,2.0,Knowledge Management Specialist,"It’s your typical consulting firm in terms of nice office space, unlimited beverages, etc. If you’re into the frat boy lifestyle, the company parties can be fun. Coworkers are smart and driven. You’re allowed to work from home once you’ve been at the company for 1 year.","The hours are unpredictably long and grueling. Toxic leadership creates unnecessary stress, and there is no ability to “manage up” given most leaders are untouchable. Very slow to innovate. Hires smart people but does not let them think for themselves. Prefers to have employees who are willing to put their head down and take orders versus get creative and try new things. Consulting support staff are treated as second class citizens though they are key contributors to the company’s success. Don’t expect to be shown appreciation for your work — excellence is the baseline expectation. Career path is uninspiring, and path to promotion is over engineered. Promotion takes years, and if you’re one of the lucky ones to get there, you’ll just be continuing doing much of the same work."

Bain only applies for H1B visa once, and if you don't get it they will not re-apply, while most other consulting firms will offer to re-apply. 
Bain's policy is to send you to an office abroad (you have no choice in selecting it, it's rather selected on demand) and then you are brought back on L1 which ties you to the company for as long as you stay in the country. This means that if you don't get promoted or want to leave, you need to leave the US.

+Home office model means you get to know your office very well, and are invested in and mentored heavily

+""Generalist"" model means everyone's brains are trained to recognize patterns and ask critical questions regardless of industry, which means inexperience is still valuable and people carry a degree of humility with them into new projects

+Staffing manager that places you onto cases removes the ""hustle"" and a lot of the politics from landing a good project. A neutral arbiter is looking out for you, and taking your development needs into consideration alongside project needs. 

+Great comp, benefits - makes long weeks feel doable","It's not a job for someone looking for a super easy/sustainable lifestyle, at least in the more junior ranks  - you must really want to be doing this work, or working with these people, to be fine with 9pm meetings and a lot of change 

Though it's incredibly down-to-earth compared to other consulting firms, there is a degree of entitlement among people who have been at the company for a long time. Attitudes of knowing more than others, or being better by virtue of which school/MBA program you went to, show up sometimes more than I'd like.

The reality is, in SF, most of the work is private equity deals. Even if you're sold on the healthcare or retail practice, chances are you'll be doing diligencing (which is tough, long hours) for at least 6 months.

Being part of such an organization and accompanying it along its journey is definitely a worthwhile career path.
 
However, in a world that is getting more and more interconnected every day, an interdisciplinary and cooperative approach is key to managing the likewise increasing complexity. Therefore, even better than accompanying one organization along its journey is working with a great range of different organizations from various industries to be able to identify meta level patterns of competitive advantage.
 
I experienced that working at Bain gives one the opportunity to support top level executives of leading companies, driving their key programs and resolving their toughest problems. Therefore, one can really have an impact that, in hindsight, will be seen as industry-shaping.
 
Within Bain you can feel the ambition to create value for the customer every single day. More importantly, the pursuit of true results, i.e. sophisticated concepts AND their pragmatic translation into measurable business success, is omnipresent.
 
What is special about Bain is the great proximity that has been created within its global network. People from all around the world feel deeply connected and work closely together, a precious experience I wouldn't want to miss. Meeting extraordinary people in a rather ordinary frequency makes you sometimes even forget how quickly you learn new things about different places, people, and yourself.
 
And most astonishing, even if you sometimes work long hours, there are so many occasions and opportunities to enjoy your time, party with friends, and discover the world.
 
It is a great pleasure to work with Bain and to be part of its global team.",It is challenging to keep your work life balance at the optimum

However, if you want coaching for anything and everything around ""Un-professionalism"" ""Politics"" and ""Unethical practices"" your search ends here. Say yes to them only if you want the below:

2.  Lots of off-sites - If you are a holiday/travel junkie
3.  Lots of parties - If thats your mantra in life
They do throw lots of other perks at you like we throw peanuts to Monkeys in a Zoo. But, remember they still think u r a MONKEY!","""All all all everything"" 
1. Sr Management (GM's): GM group is a small happy family and its a family run business. Company is very dynamic as decision making changes every hour depending on the their mood. GM's have full control on Appraisal system and policy formulations and are happy to screw careers without reason. Very mediocre leadership, most of them are adopted for life but would not qualify for a reputable position elsewhere!  To survive this breed you need to be an office pet and get their coffee on time. Spineless HR is not only a mere spectator but believes in openness and transparency as nothing with HR team stays confidential. Highly paperless organisation as performance reviews are completely verbal and without facts.  
2.  Culture: This place has a great culture of disrespect, humiliation and unethical Behavior. Anyone who questions this is a ""Cultural Misfit"".  Any kind of meeting/presentation is a joke as people are eating chewing & refilling the free food with no respect to the speaker who continues to present, really shocking!!! Mind blowing spy culture, the GMs have rogue agents in every nook and corner and will even report what you had in lunch hence beware every move you make is being watched - this is an essential requirement given GM's are not in office 90% of the time. Non meritorious boot-licking culture.
3.  Discrimination - This is core to the companies DNA.  Basic flexibility comes to you with designation - GM's stay at home for petty reasons, however anything below you are supposed to choose between a sick child and coming to office. Discrimination between Laterals and Home grown is also in your face.  Laterals are considered low life's as even returning their greetings is a crime, let alone following their instructions as a senior. Out of sight, out of mind meaning newbies are not marked in email communications pertaining to your own projects and have to beg to be kept in loop.  
This is a  body shop manufacturing goons of the highest order. Hence, if you are bored of being respected, professional and Ethical look no further and join them. All your nightmares will come true."

I don't think there is a better place to work after school. There's a culture and a spirit here -- created both organically and systematically -- that drive a supportive, mentorship-driven, and feedback-based culture that permeates everything we do. You'll be given opportunities to step up and act beyond your years, and you'll learn as much, as quickly, here at Bain as just about any other job out there. But you never be alone as you do it, because there will be a team and network to support you the whole way through.","The long hours and travel can be frustrating and exhausting. The learning curve is real, and it's real steep. When you feel like you've half-mastered something, there is another task ahead of you, and it can be hard to keep your head up unless you're resilient and determined to keep improving."

The opportunities of working with top-notch clients and the ability to make an impact on their organisations is an incredible start to your professional career. On top of this, in my experience, the company genuinely cares about the development of its employees and creates a supportive environment with regular coaching and mentoring interactions. On a personal level, the people you work with are likeminded, fun people to work with which makes it a great environment to spend time in!","Of course, there will be moments when it will not be your dream job. For me personally this is when the hours are sometimes long and you feel not a lot of personal progression. But again, this specific situation is when the supportive culture provides you with a network within the organization to fall back on and bounce back stronger."
2476,Bain & Company,"Interesting work, fantastic culture, brilliant people",2018-06-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture is fantastic and the company really invests in building and maintaining a great company spirit. This ranges from global events like the Bain World Cup, or opportunities to share anonymous feedback to management on a weekly basis.

The work is interesting and varied, you'll learn quickly and get exposure to several industries and capabilities.

The people are great and it is a very collaborative and friendly working environment.","Work life balance is not great, but given the industry it is really well managed, for example teams will usually try to accommodate personal plans and there is no expectation to work weekends (although inevitably people sometimes do).

Gender balance is bad at the senior levels."
2477,Bain & Company,"Energizing, collaborative, & ambitious place to work",2018-06-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The teams I've worked with are pro-active, supportive, and always willing to coach each other or help pick up the most minute tasks. There is a true team spirit here that extends beyond the project content-- we also help each other reach professional and personal goals and often socialize on weekends or holidays. For example, last weekend's Bain World Cup brought together 1800 Bainies from our ~40 offices for a weekend of fun and ""casual"" sports competition in the middle of London.  

Another big positive is that you will constantly be challenged to push yourself and learn new things. No two days on the job are alike and those who adapt best to constant change and tackling new problems with positivity will go far here.

Bain's concept of ""Build your own Bain"" encourages you to seek your own path at and outside the company, whether that be specializing in a certain industry, transferring to another Bain office, or taking time off for an externship, temporary leave of absence, or MBA.","As with many jobs in this sector, the ~60 hour workweeks make it challenging to stay in contact with friends and family who are used to working ~40 hour weeks. Although Bain Amsterdam travels much less internationally than other offices or consultancies, those travel cases do quickly lead to 3 months' living out of a half-empty suitcase feeling. There are various options such as refusing travel cases, mitigating nights away to 2/week, and setting up videoconferencing with clients that I've seen used to mitigate these effects."

Bain also does a phenomenal job of involving spouses and family in that culture.

Bain has some ""work-related"" pros that are often overlooked.  Bain doesn't sell small teams (1-3 people) like other firms.  You're usually on a full team (4-6 people) which builds in support and collaboration.  Travel is much more flexible as Bain staffs full teams from the same office.  There's always some social impact opportunities flowing through my inbox if I want to volunteer to do some good.

Airline miles and SPG points!","Very demanding work hours (70 hour plus weeks are not uncommon, can go up to 100 in the worst case)
At any point, ~30% of the projects running in the office are mismanaged - leadership is such that is working on the industry for the first time and hence is clueless about what direction to steer the team in and the team ends up boiling the ocean. This is esp. the case in India where Bain is relatively new and does not have too many experienced partners
Unpredictable, frequently changing priorities 
Too many layers (AC, Consultant, Manager, Principal/Partner) - 4 layers above the juniormost person, each making suggestions and giving comments, leading to a lot of rework, esp. because there is no one right or fixed way to solve the project so every one tries to do ""value add"" 
Limited opportunity to specialize in 1 industry or capability area in the first  5 years - so you remain a generalist for the first 5 years
No operational, hands-on experience - you only recommend, never implement
Too much focus on making slides look pretty instead of testing recommendations on practicality

4. Direct campus hires think themselves smarter than lateral hires and tend to directly insult them on face
5. Low quality of hiring since past 1 year. Especially, they have started hiring people from Tier 2 colleges also at PL level which creates an imbalance because they hire analyst from Tier 1 college and PLs from Tier 2 college
6. They have crazy amount of hiring since past 1 year and because of which the quality of work that now BCC gets is degrading day by day. Just so as to keep the staff occupied, BCC just picks up each and every random sh*tty case."

It still feels like the best decision I could have made coming out of an MBA program was to join Bain.
- Supportive culture: Bainies are held to a high standard of performance but there is a strong culture and structure of support
- Fun culture: It's very work hard, play hard. Long hours are somewhat off-set by the emphasis on ""having fun while we work,"" whether that means volunteer service days, internal Bain band shows, international intramural soccer tournaments (""Bain World Cup""), summer off-sites in the Hamptons or Poconos,  training in Barcelona, Lisbon, Dubai, LA, Miami, Phuket...","- Work hours: It can be a real ""grind"" sometimes. It's client services, so this is to be expected but there is a serious burn out factor on this job that has to be carefully managed.
- Strong culture of feedback is both a positive and a negative. It's crucial for the ""up or out"" environment. It's not political at all, but it can thrive on people's insecurities. Everyone always feels like they can do more, can do better etc.
- Diversity: It's very white, quite male (at management levels)- depending on the office. Diversity is clearly very important to the company, but change can look slow. New York is leading the way though, but that is to be expected given the makeup of this city"

1. It is very important to the leadership that every team member enjoys being part of the team: In fact all team members assess the case they are working on every week and ""we are having fun working together as a team"" is one of the criteria! 
2. People are extremely accomplished but still down-to-earth: this is engrained in the culture of the company, valued and constantly reinforced by the leadership.
3. the saying ""one bainie never lets another bainie fail"" sounds extremely cheesy but it is very, very true. There is no elbow-culture and you can count on the strong support of your colleagues any time in any situation","long working hours.

2949,Bain & Company,Peak consulting,2017-04-21,5.0,Manager,"Intellectual challenge: 
Bain offers an opportunity to work on a wide variety of intellectually challenging problems across multiple industries. Companies only hire Bain when they can't solve the problem themselves, so you know these aren't minor issues being addressed. Plus for someone at a relatively early point in their career Bain offers unparalleled access to key decision makers and an ability to effect rapid change far beyond what you'd see in many companies (especially large ones) at the same tenure.  Finally, as you get more senior you also have the ability to build more industry/function-specific expertise, which allows you to develop a valuable knowledge base should you choose to work in that area in the future. 

Culture:
On top of the intellectual side of things, Bain offers a great working environment with people who you actually enjoy spending time with (many of my close friends have come from Bain), and who won't hesitate to support you when you need it. Lots of consulting firms offer interesting, challenging work, but Bain's culture helps make that work more enjoyable.","Sustainability/predictability:
Because this is a client services business, the workload and requirements for a given case will often revolve around the needs (and sometimes the whims) of the client and the leadership team that serves it. This can make it difficult to predict workload, travel and other requirements too far in advance, and sometimes takes control over your own schedule out of your hands. Bain does its best to try to be flexible in how, where and when you work, but in the end the needs of the client tend to come first, which can mean work/life balance can take a hit at times.  Hours are similarly variable, but longer (60+ hour) weeks are not uncommon, particularly for shorter cases or in early stages, and travel tends to compound this (although Bain requires less travel than others)."

3008,Bain & Company,Great company but may need to reconsider parts of model,2017-01-30,3.0,Associate Consultant,"- Friendly, fun, supportive culture 
- Strong commitment to diversity that isn't just window dressing
- Smart, engaging colleagues 
- Great pay and benefits 
- Overall great projects that are strategic (usually) and interesting 
- Amazing training programs","- Lots of cases that continue to roll and PMO cases seem common (trying to sell ""programs"" not ""projects"" to clients) -- results in lackluster PD opportunities or fewer case experiences
- Little to no control over the cases that you get on (especially in smaller offices due to the office-based staffing model) 
- No ability to specialize at all (while many go into consulting to do many different things, at a certain point you will realize that you love certain topics and hate others and want to have some degree of focus)
- Review methods are flawed. Small, non-consequential incidents are frequently cited as examples in reviews, and the review process always feels like a lot of last minute crunching. 
- Culture that places too much emphasis on Associate Consultants to bring ""energy"" and ""culture"" to the teams. What's the point in doing so if one coordinates everyone's schedule to plan a team event that no one ends up showing up to or is late to -- on top of all of the other work? 
- Weaker in certain areas vs. BCG or McKinsey (e.g., healthcare, social sector). PEG is overhyped.
- Culture can feel overly ""fratty"" as expected by a young firm -- one can feel looked down upon for not attending social events are not wanting to get as ""crazy"" as others
- Getting promoted to the post-MBA position seems quite rare vs. BCG or McKinsey, where a large number of entry levels are direct promoted."
3009,Bain & Company,"More work than you would think just isn't that interesting or impactful at a personal level, but experiences vary wildly",2017-01-30,3.0,Case Team Leader,"- The people and culture are by far the biggest pro. Very smart and passionate, like most of those in the industry, but Bainies generally are more down to earth and supportive. I don't think the ""fratty"" tag applies anymore, but the people generally are fun in their nerdy ways.

- Brand name on your resume helps you get your foot in the door in many places (if you want to do strategy... if you don't, then don't wait to long to get out).

- Global trainings are fun and great way to network across the world.

- If you want to limit your travel (to the extent you can in consulting) and actually get to know people in your office, then Bain's office staffing model is a much better fit vs. a McKinsey type of model. I actually had a few cases locally.","- Yes, there is some exciting work but the proportion of heavy project management and process-oriented cases is way higher than I was led to believe during recruiting. Lots of merger integration, PMO and organization projects. I didn't join consulting to build Gantt charts and org structure boxes all day (not that there's anything wrong with it inherently but it's not a good fit for me). Management has also said they plan on competing more in battleground areas like procurement going forward. Expect mix of sexy strategy cases to go down.

- The flip side of the office staffing model is that you have less control of what you get staffed on and are more likely to get put on projects you have no interest in. You wanted a customer strategy case in tech? Too bad, there's a 6 month merger integration case in industrials staffing up and you're the only person in the office available for it. If industry matters to you, think hard about which offices you want to join and ask during recruiting what they work on most. Staffing is often a black box and you have no idea why decisions were made without any input whatsoever from you.

- MBA hires new to Bain are poorly integrated vs. returning Associate Consultants and are definitely lower on the totem pole. This is especially evident in geographies where MBAs aren't quite as prevalent as in the US (Europe and Australia for example) but it holds in the US as well. Some offices are really really bad at this so do your homework.

- A lot of tech, tools and shared services are way behind competitors. You'd be surprised at how much low-value add grunt work you'll have to do compared to other consulting firms that efficiently allocate it and optimize work based on what different roles do best. One example of this is how much time is spent doing expenses because of an antiquated system. I had been hearing for 2 years that the expense system was being improved but nothing had yet been done and people still had to spend a silly amount of time on it.

- Standard for professional services, but the quality of life just isn't good despite what you hear during recruiting. I don't know why people insist on saying during recruiting that 55 hours is a typical week - it's not, 55 hours is a great week. I can count on my two hands the number of times I worked less than 60 in three years."

Therefore, Bain is the exact right place for me to start my career and to prepare me for future steps/ developments.

And at Bain & Company you enjoy such great flexibility. Furthermore, and this is amongst the most important aspects of an attractive employer, young professionals are granted the possibility to create impact: they can derive solutions with guidance from the leadership team independently, have exposure to (senior) clients from which they can learn a lot and can implement the developed solutions to actually implement the change in the organization(s) thereby further developing an amplified skillset.

I remember having to chose between consultancy firms, finding very hard to know what the differences are. In hindsight, there are things to know, that would have made this choice a lot easier. To name a few (up to you if you believe they fit whatever you are looking for):
- Bain has a clear true north approach; be honest and open about your approach and answer, especially in the internal and external communication
- Bain serves the largest, most impressive clients worldwide 
- Bain has a distinctive focus on Private Equity (vs McKinsey, BCG), which allows you to see a different side of consulting
- Bain has super supportive and collaborative culture and vibe in the office; colleagues become friends (of course not all of them) and a Bainee never lets another Bainee fall 
- Bain implies humor and a 'don't take yourself too serious' attitude - but at the same time our work is taken at the single most important thing
- Bain's Amsterdam office is still small enough to know everybody in person, which makes it even more collaborative and fun
- Bain has great opportunities outside of Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Europe!","- Working at Bain requires to have some balance - it is always hard to find the balance in work, social activities with work and your social life pre-Bain
- You will be challenged every single day, and although there is always guidance and help available, you need to be up for a challenge and enjoy the ride

3170,Bain & Company,Joining & staying at Bain: a no-brainer,2016-10-06,5.0,Consultant,"4 years ago, I joined Bain Brussels as an Associate Consultant Intern.
At the time, I was excited by the opportunity to crack some of the toughest business problems encountered by CEOs with a group of smart, driven people, and my expectations have not been disappointed.

The work I’ve had the chance to do at Bain has been incredible.
From driving a full-scale strategy and organization transformation at a global industrials company of 16,000 employees to working on some of the world’s largest mergers in consumer goods, I feel I’ve personally been a part of meaningful results for notorious clients.

What I didn’t know 4 years ago, however, is that I would end up getting to do this great work with mentors and teammates who would become some of my closest friends and advisors, and who would be so personally committed to my success.
For me, Bain has offered an incredible mix of problem solving with real, enduring results and a supportive, fun culture that I couldn’t have found anywhere else.","At Bain, you never stop learning. In practice, it also means that you're never really in your comfort zone... but that's the very reason that makes up all wake up in the morning."
3171,Bain & Company,Bain & Co review,2016-10-06,5.0,Manager,"- No other company that is so true to its values, the people and the leadership team really live the company values
- Bain & Co always puts the client's interest in the first place. There is no room for politics and selfishness
- Quality of the people at Bain & Co is something I have never seen before","The job is amazing but asks a significant personal investment (often travelling and therefore spending less nights at home, working long hours at times, etc.)"
3172,Bain & Company,Growing at Bain,2016-10-06,5.0,Consultant,"Bain&Company has for me been the most terrific start of my career. Over the past four years, I've been able to do projects in telecoms, CPG en private equity and across all sorts of capabitlies: Pure strategy, Cost Savings, Merger Integration and both DD and VDD work.

Apart from the many opportunities I got within Bain, I also got to experience New York City and Columbia University in particular for my MBA. Bain fully supported me to take an educational leave for 18 months in order to complete the MBA program at Columbia - an amazing experience, I would otherwise have never had a chance to do. 

Thirdly, Bain is a place that really helps you get the best out of yourself: there's a whole network of supporters behind you that help you truly become the best that you can be. On your case team there are weekly professional development chats with your manager, which help you develop in your day to day job. Additionally, you select your own personal advisor, that helps you make the bigger career choices and helps you succeed at Bain in the long run. Laslty, there are many 'informal' advisors: people that I have worked with, people that I've gotten to know socially, or anyone else in the office, that is always there to chat about whatever career question you might have. 

Last, but certainly not least, is the enormous impact I've seen our teams have at our clients. Probably my favorite case was a merger case, in which we first carved out a specific part of a large food conglomerate, to later merge this carve-out with a specialized player in the market. Te merger created the #2 player in that market and was completely up and running in two years time - something I didn't think our client and us could make happen at the start.","Though Bain is a great place to work and I would always recommend anyone to go and work here, the hours can be long. We have demanding clients and demand a lot from ourselves - a combination that can result in longer than average working days."

-Very interesting and high impact projects (my experience has been mostly in healthcare in the SF office) and excellent private equity group
-Awesome training and mentorship (very useful as an advanced degree, clear goals and stepwise increase in responsibilities)
-Very sustainable (big emphasis of teams; lots of families; I can do it and I have a 2 year old)
-Local staffing with opportunities to travel if you choose to
-Close knit office culture (partners are easily accessible and supportive; local staffing really helps you develop relationships with people in your office)

There is a significant investment in personal development and a culture of frequent constructive feedback and support. It's not uncommon to have a meeting every two weeks to exchange feedback and ensure that you are on track. The office-centric staffing makes it easy to connect with others in the office and develop and maintain mentorship relationships, which really supports growth over a number of years. This isn't somewhere where you're expected to churn through people every two years -- while people do leave, it's to pursue their own interests with lots of support from Bain rather than because the job/office isn't supporting them/burned them out.","Like most professional services, this is a demanding job. Although Bain practices travel as needed, you may still be on the road for 2-4 days a week, depending on the case. The nature of the personal development structure means you will always be pushed to be a little bit better than you were yesterday, which is great but can be uncomfortable if you are looking to just rest on past success."

Strong supportive culture - It's in the DNA of Bainies to support one another, coach, and mentor. I feel like I have an amazing set of mentors supporting my career, all the way from Senior Directors to my peers to our ACs. 

No better place to start your career - I am in awe at the opportunities Bain creates for our ACs and Cs to develop the general manager mindset. We constantly push our teams to deliver the best work we can, and as part of this we stretch our people to learn new skills and build towards their personal career goals.

We embed the idea of ""results delivery"" in all of our work, so that the solution we identify can be successfully implemented by the client once we leave.

As a former AC, I truly believe Bain is the best possible place you can start your career. The company cares deeply about your professional development and it comes through in global training, in bi-weekly professional development chats with your Manager, and in coaching sessions with your mentor, your colleague and your Professional Development Advisor (3 different people!)

The people are also amazing :)","It's a professional services job so at the end of the day, it's the client that makes the final go/no-go decision. You can have the perfect solution but if the CEO has different ideas, then there's nothing you can do about that. 

As an AC or a Consultant, you own your workstream and get to develop an idea from inception to client handoff, but often times you don't see the FULL lifecycle of a particular idea or solution, like you would at a startup or as a product manager."

In my first year at Bain, I've worked in functional areas including: Growth Strategy, M&A diligence, PE diligence, Performance Improvement, and Organizational Strategy. I've worked across industries including: Agriculture, CPG, Industrials, Restaurants, Sports, and Healthcare. I came to consulting to gain breadth in problem solving across industries and have experienced exactly that. 

The impact on our clients. I've had 2 of my cases show up on the front page of the WSJ this year and have been involved in helping to save a company running up against debt covenants with their banks and financial sponsors. The work I've been involved with has been innovative and transformative and having a seat at the table to work through these solutions has been very rewarding. 

The support and people at Bain. There have been numerous times when my team has worked late evenings and weekends to help me out when needed (and vice versa). No one is left behind to struggle on their own. I feel like people are really invested in my success and I've been able to maintain these relationships long after a case ends. 

The brand. I started receiving calls, LinkedIn messages, and emails about potential exits less than 6 months into my job at Bain. The skills and executive presence you get as a Consultant are very sought after in industry.","It's a demanding job which sometimes requires travel and personal sacrifices.

I can't imagine a better place to develop myself the first few years after college. The quality of talent pushes me to a level of excellence I rarely find my friends in other companies being held to, the level of investment others have given me has been unexpected from a personal and professional level, and the work I am given is challenging but helps me grow further. 

I don't know many places where my supervisor and managers make it priority to give me feedback weekly and if an unplanned event (client meeting) occurs, still honor that commitment to personal growth if it means staying at the office at 9 pm with dinner.","You are constantly on that once you're ""off"" you feel the burn from all the work.

 - Nice people: As simple as it sounds - the people here are genuinely kind, positive and helpful people. Bain hires for smarts and fit... and fit is important. This makes for a very collegial, non-competitive work environment and culture

3292,Bain & Company,Wins Best Place to Work for Good Reasons,2016-08-12,5.0,,"I'm not sure if I can add anything to what's been written by others except to say it is all true.  You're constantly surrounded by super smart people who are also super friendly.  There's just no comparison to the experience at Bain.  The work challenges you to develop faster than you've ever thought possible.  The people you work with become lifelong friends.  You have a never ending stream of amazing story-worthy experiences.  The compensation is generous and fair (granted it isn't stratospheric like some finance/PE comp, but let's be real here--this is still one of the fastest most reliable paths in the world to the ""1%"").  And if and when you decide to leave, the door to opportunities swings wide open to everything from traditional corporate and operating positions to entrepreneurship (one of our former associates got the highest ever investment subscription on Shark Tank for his new venture!).  Finally as an alum, you have an open invitation to come back which is a huge safety net particularly if you're thinking about starting a company or doing something that could be risky.  This is absolutely positively the best place in the world to start your business career.","Travel is probably the biggest downside--true with any consulting job.  But!  Invest early in establishing your network of internal promoters, and there are lots of ways to manage your travel demands.  The geographical model of staffing at Bain really makes it much easier to do this than other industry-based staffing models.  There are also some offices where the industry cluster naturally creates lots of local case opportunities.  And if you stay at Bain for a while and progress in career (and life) and things like new babies, medical issues, etc., come up that require a period of greater accommodation, Bain is amazing for coming up with ways to help match the rhythm of life (e.g., local IP development case for a few months, temporary or permanent rotation to a practice area role, staffing on a local client, etc.)."

Staffing model is designed to ensure that you get a range of experiences to develop a well-rounded skillset, preparing you to advance to the next level (a general manager skillset is very transferable to many jobs outside of consulting).","You will work hard in exchange for those professional development opportunities and interesting problems--that's the deal you make.  As a more junior consultant you have less control over your schedule, but that increases significantly as you gain tenure.
If you know that you only want to work in a very specific area from the beginning of your career, the model is not designed to accommodate that (and it wouldn't be in your best interest to do so, from a skill development perspective). You are allowed (and expected) to specialize, however, as a manager.
From a long-term perspective, the job changes significantly several times over the course of your career--the best consultants are not necessarily the best managers are not necessarily the best partners, but you must play every role along the way."

The amount of support, from consultants to partners and everyone in between, was truly outstanding. 10 weeks at Bain was enough to convince me that consulting and Bain were the best choice for me on where to start my post-MBA career.",Really nothing negative to report.

3509,Bain & Company,Best career accelerator,2015-10-29,5.0,Consultant,At Bain you have the privilege to work with exceptionally smart people which means that you have the chance to constantly learn from great people. In addition - and I believe this is a big difference to some of the other consultants - Bainies are in general quite humble and well-rounded e.g. we had tons of sports activities and parties.,Long hours (60 hours was considered a great week) in average I ended up with 75 hours per week over a period of 3 years. Travelling is also a big downside... At the beginning I enjoyed it a lot and of course one collects tons of bonus miles and hotel points but if you have family it becomes difficult – that was the main reason why I decided to leave Bain.

3517,Bain & Company,Great place to work due to supportive environment,2015-10-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Being a consulting firm, Bain knows that their only assets are their people, so they invest incredible amounts to grow and support their employees.  This is done in numerous ways:
-Training: Every year or two, you attend a global training for 5-10 days with everyone from around the globe of your tenure.  These are both fun and hugely informative/helpful to development.  They also create a global network, so that you quickly know people from several other offices
-Mentorship: Bain will assign you mentors of differing levels, but the most important (and impressive) aspect of mentorship are the un-official mentors.  Within 6-12 months you have a strong network of people you have done cases, worked on recruiting, or generally interacted with who all are willing to take time out of a busy schedule to grab coffee and chat about anything that may be concerning you regarding the job.
Overall culture: Bain is a shockingly fun place to work.  Some work events (such as the holiday party and offsite) are some of my favorite social events that I look forward to each year.  Several of my co-workers have also become some of my best friends over the past few years.  The company understands that happy customers stick around longer, and they invest a lot of time (and money) to keep people happy","Most of my complaints/concerns are related to the consulting industry overall.  I think Bain does a better job of promoting work-life balance and limiting travel than other major firms (and I know many people at all of them), but the hours can still be long and tiring, and more importantly are very unpredictable as we are often responding to client requests.
The one thing I think is more of an issue at Bain than other consulting firms has to do with the types of cases.  I've been at Bain for several years and have seen a marked shift towards longer engagements.  The norm now seems to be for people to be on the same case for 6-9 months.  One of the appeals of consulting is to work in lots of industries on lots of problems, and this is greatly diminished if you only do 3 cases every 2 years."

Those managers and partners are going to knock down barriers for you, connect you where you need to be connected, guide, support, direct and re-direct you.  The office support staff is going to fix your computer after you spilled coffee on it for the third time, find you the unfindable data source, and smile and hand you a baked good after you ask for help re-doing dozens of slides.  You are empowered and accountable but you are not alone.  And the best part is you can't fail.  Because after all, what all those people are reinforcing is that a Bainie never lets another Bainie fail.","Here's how you know you've made it at Bain.  The reward for doing a good job is getting a bigger, tougher problem next time.  Meaning, you are always solving the easiest problem you will ever solve again.  This takes a lot of resilience and active managing of self-expectations to remember that you are not actually getting worse, the problems are just getting harder.  So my advice is to remember that.  And then take a second to realize that it would be a lot less fun if the reverse were true.  And isn't that precisely why you wanted this job in the first place anyway? It sure was for me."

Beyond the traditional multi-industry, multi-functional exposure management consulting offers, Bain has a strong mentorship culture in which everyone from the top down takes an active role in professional development. Coaching is more of an ongoing weekly conversation than a quarterly review. At any given point you have a team of people heavily invested in seeing you develop through your Bain experience and not only accessible to you, but eager to assist in any way they can.

And fun!","Client services is always fundamentally challenging and comes with some lack of control, but Bain does a great job helping to make tradeoffs with our clients in order to balance work-life tradeoffs. Doesn't work 100% of the time, but it's awesome that the conversation happens regularly."

-Really interesting work (most of the time)","- High level of ""intenseness"" can feel like you are drinking from a waterhose in the first months
- Need to learn the right way of doing things very early on
- Extremely long hours at times (say goodbye to weekday socialising)"
3606,Bain & Company,"Amazing culture and people, but work leaves something to be desired",2015-09-13,4.0,Associate Consultant,"The culture and people at Bain are second to none. All the firms will say this during recruiting, but after observing how junior employees interact at the top firms through various friend groups, it's evident the people at Bain enjoy each other's company more so than elsewhere. Even more impressive is how consistent the culture is globally, as seen at global training and Bain World Cup. People tend to be incredibly fun, approachable, and humble. Strongly recommend as a first job out of college.","Unfortunately, while the people are amazing, the work is far from that. The hours can be long, but not horrible like banking. That said, it is generally unpredictable and there can be extreme periods leading up to key deadlines. It is also hard to make plans with confidence during the work week. 

The greater issue is that for a junior employee, the work is menial. There is a strong mismatch in terms of the qualifications of the ACs and the work they're asked to do, in that ACs are certainly capable of more. The work might be challenging initially, but once the approach is figured out, it becomes a matter of repetition and grinding. The learning curve begins to plateau around the 1 year mark. Many late nights will be spent on grunt work, administrative burdens, and tasks which will be asked to be re-done multiple times. There is generally a lack of ownership in that ACs do not get to define their own work, it's more so coming down from the top. You do not spend much time ""problem solving"", which is probably what draws people to the job. Clients are big companies, often oligopolistic, usually trying to defend their turf, so there is not much innovative thinking behind the ""answer"", and more so identifying best practices and optimizations."

We are all too busy helping our clients succeed.","As with any top consulting company,  the lifestyle can be challenging.

As a fresh college graduate, I am hard pressed to think of another industry that will offer the same types of opportunities. 

Bain specifically, has an amazing collegiate culture that it's hard to tell friend from colleague at times (can be both a good and bad problem). The SEA office is also very diverse (our second most prevalent nationality is Italian), which makes for an interesting set of colleagues nonetheless.

Being in the SEA office specifically can also be really helpful to professional development immensely - I've had a lot of exposure to senior clients very early on, even in my first year that I find my colleagues in the US don't experience as much. Also, since we are a less developed market, the projects I work on are very  much growth oriented with many ""2020 Ambitions"" strategic projects thrown into the fray. There is a huge opportunity to work on really high-level, less process-oriented projects that one is more likely to work on if he/she were in the US.","As much as the projects here are great, there is also limitations to what we do - there is less data in less developed markets for example and clients are not as sophisticated as they are in the developed world.

I have used this criteria for most of the major decisions in my life and I have yet to be disappointed. Bainies are absolutely excellent individuals. They are driven, smart, funny and kind. I absolutely adore coming to work because the people are fantastic. Additionally Bain provides a lot of training and support.","The work life balance is challenging. Either you'll be working long hours 10+ on some days, or you'll be traveling to another city most days of the work week.

3673,Bain & Company,SAC Bain Review Germany,2015-06-22,5.0,Senior Associate Consultant,"Bain is by far the strongest in ""people"" as the key asset in the consulting business. It's not only about the focus on results or the market leadership in sectors such as Private Equity consulting, it's more about being surrounded by inspiring people, whether colleagues or clients, who always challenge you to give your best. I've been through the entire recruiting process of all so-called MBB firms or the top tier, and in Bain I've noticed how unique it is to have a firm made up by authentic individuals who yet have an unbelievably strong culture in common. Finally, Bain offers more flexible and variable career options and programs to juniors compared to the main competitors in the field.","It is really hard to find or point out cons at the best consulting company to work for, as stated by several ranking. Nonetheless, there is always room for improvement. Bain is not the biggest consulting firm, but has always been within the top three, and it's not only about size anyway. Notwithstanding, there is clear room for Bain to expand. So I would say one of the things missing would be even more offices in some of the hot zones at the moment."

It is amazing how they are able to bring together such a diverse but compatible group of people, and how heavily they invest in your ability to build bonds within your classes, teams, and office across all levels of the organization.","Overall Bain is definitely less travel heavy that it's key competitors.

Nice bright office that is conducive to natural interaction.,Abrupt inception into work and office. Superiors open to communication but too busy to listen to suggestions. No extra pay for overtime.
3676,Bain & Company,Consultant,2015-06-21,5.0,Consultant,"People are extremely nice and supportive. I have offers from other top consulting firms and  have friends that work at those places. Bain is the only one with a unique culture that focus on people. I spent a lot of time at works, but I genuinely consider bunnies are my friends. We hanged out outside of work quite often. There is no sense of competitiveness amongst Bainies unlike other firms.","Like any consulting jobs, the hours can be long. It is hard for employees to maintain a sustainable lifestyle. Partners travel a lot also"

3678,Bain & Company,Best consulting firm? Bain & Company.,2015-06-19,5.0,Senior Associate Consultant,"There are lots of great examples underlining why working at Bain is an exceptional opportunity. After many discussions with friends employed at McK and BCG, I'd like to write about two that stand out for me:

-""Generalist approach to staffing"": compared to other firms in which you have to commit early to an industry or ""competence center"", Bain pursues a ""generalist approach"" to staffing giving you the opportunity to cover as many industries/ functions as you like. This is a great deal who wants to get the most out of consulting possible. It basically never gets boring and you never feel like limiting yourselve to one area unless you want to.

-""Diverse development opportunities"": Bain's commitment to staff development goes far beyond the industry standard. Besides supporting an MBA or offering international office transfers, Bain has diverse development opportunities like for example a) ""externships"" (work in your favorite startup for up to 6 months while receiving your full salary) or the b) ""experience track"" (pursue your interests through a language course or summer school while receiving your full salary and support for tuition fees).","Working long hours is usually considered a ""con"" but honestly, EVERY AMBITIOUS PERSON will work long hours no matter in what industries he/she is in."
3679,Bain & Company,"Highly demanding! But would I do it again? Hell yea, it's worth it!",2015-06-18,4.0,Senior Associate Consultant,"Bain has given me tremendous opportunities to develop over the past years - I've been staffed in multiple countries, on multiple projects and I can already confidently say I've seen a lot and gained massive experience!

Every project is a new challenge and brings new learning. I get the chance to work with extremely smart and ambitiious people who at the same time are down to earth and nice, buffoons are just not accepted here!

Finally, the office and company wide social events are a blast! :)","Before opting in for Bain, one has to be honest with himself - working here is not a piece of cake. Our Clients are top-notch but also very demanding. The quality of our work is outstanding. But to deliver all this, hard work needs to be put it, sometimes a lot of it. This may come in conflict with your personal life, particularly when you travel a lot and don't get to see your family and friends as often as you would have wished for. Nevertheless, the firm is truly committed to make things work and very flexible in terms of personal needs - I highly appreciate it!"

The mentorship programs at Bain are unparalleled. The leadership team has a vested interest in all of the associate consultants, and the focus groups (Women at Bain, Global Development, and others) all ensure extra support for different communities and interests. 

I couldn't be happier with my employer and the people that I get to work with. Throughout my first year with the company I believe I have grown immensely in my work and inter-personal skills.","As in all consulting firms, you don't always get to choose the content of your case or the type of work you will be doing. I often enjoy the people I am around more so than the work that I am doing. However, one of the benefits of this type of work is that everything changes, and one bad case will end and likely transform into a new good one."

All rounded off with global spirit events such as the Bain World Cup with more than 1,200 attendees this year competing in soccer and volleyball and celebrating together the Bain culture","Like in any other top tier management consultancy, nights can get long.

3699,Bain & Company,Know what you're getting in to and how you'll get out,2015-05-31,4.0,Case Team Leader,"The Bain Manufacturing Process is a solid approach for structured thinking and project management...
The people are hard working, intelligent and generally sincere...
The name on your resume is valuable and does open broader opportunities...

Overall the company is a good company and the experience a net positive experience. I enjoyed the majority of the people I worked with, felt they challenged me and gave accelerated my development. I am an industry hire, which is rare at Bain: I joined the firm as a consultant with 12+ years of experience and my reasons for coming to the firm were very specific: it was the last chance I saw to have an intense investment in myself and it brought optionality to a career that was previously focused on two industries.

The case work was high profile (though not groundbreaking or innovative) and the work we do - by and large - has a big impact on Fortune 20-50-100-500 companies. The work I have been on has received national attention. This can be a reward unto itself, if this is something that is important to your career or self-worth.","...but the application of the Bain Manufacturing process varies from office to office, case type to case type and manager to manager.
...but there are some people the idealize how they want to be without reconciling it with how they come across or treat their case teams.
...but it comes with a cost around your health and wellness outside the firm.

The firm has developed its own language and uses it liberally. The issue is that it leads to a form of laziness: the consulting staff - particularly managers and case leadership - rely on the language for direction and it becomes a form of leadership shorthand. It's the equivalent of an MD's scrawl: fast and expedient, but highly susceptible to misinterpretation. This can lead to a high degree of frustration with case staff. It's compounded by the fact that manager to manager, partner to partner, etc., use terms like ""answer"" and ""80/20"" differently. They use it similar enough that you know the general idea of what a manager wants, but the portion that is different can lead to high yield loss, or worse, feeling like you're not being leveraged to best affect the team. The company relies on terms like ""process driven"" or ""answer driven"" to communicate messages, but those terms mean different things for different managers. The result is a highly frustrated team.

There is also something that occurs between Consultant level and Manager level. A slow evolution begins where managers and above start to lose touch with the volume of work required to deliver against requests. Partners will make a request and managers will promise delivery by the EOD when it actually requires four times as much work. The issue is that the work WILL get done. Even if it means working until 3:00, 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning. Because additional requests don't bump out the timelines for the work you already have on your plate, they just add to it. This is a function of being in a client services business. This is the function of having partners that are unwilling to have backbone and push back against clients when they change the scope of work. This is a function of an industry that is willing to churn through high volume of bright, intelligent people, because they know they can replace the cog. That's not an indictment on the industry or Bain; it's just the way it is. What is an indictment on Bain is the fact that they market themselves as not bowing to this kind of systemic pressure, that they're different. They're not. It's a competitive environment for clients and Bain is continually trading consulting staff well-being for winning a bake-off: as long as that continues to persist, the sustainability will suffer.

There is also a bit of arrogance within the firm, and while understandable, it has turned me off to some of the brighter aspects. I've seen people reach a certain point around the five year mark, where they fall in love with the Bain way and lose track of the always learning mentality most had early in their careers. They assume an attitude of ""I've arrived"" and ""I know all there is to know."" Having gone into my Bain career with the idea that I was going to be a sponge and soak up as much knowledge, expertise and skill-building as possible, this has started to be the biggest detractor to my experience. It's more pronounced in some that others; however, it's generally systemic."

Personal development is a priority, so you learn a lot quickly - and training is awesome (and fun). It is a truly global firm, and from the get-go, there are opportunities to build friendships with friends globally - and you will, since Bainies are very diverse but in unity a 'friendly bunch'. Even as employees 'at the bottom of the hierarchy', you're made to feel personally valuable. This reflects in the flexibility, opportunities and work. The superlatives continue elsewhere too (amazing offices, events, perks, tech, externships, flexible promotion, transfers (especially) etc.)","Everyone at the firm is exceptional and the work is often stressful. always demanding. Naturally it's constantly challenging to keep at the pace. It can feel perhaps too cliquey at times. Travel can be rough (though you're generally treated well) - although probably less so than at big competitors due to an office-driven staffing model.

It is an incredibly supportive and inspiring group of people to be a part of. Day to day, your supervisors are aware of your contributions, professional development, and truly care about your experience on the team. In addition to your case team, you also start with a class of consultants at your level and they quickly become your friends and a great business resource. 
- Interesting and varied cases: In my first year and a half, I’ve gotten to work in over 4 different industries and across practice areas (strategy, merger integration and PE diligence). I like that no case is the same and that I'm constantly needing to learn something new. As a consultant, I’ve started managing more junior team members which I find rewarding as well.
-The firm gets all of the people stuff right to make the job sustainable and enjoyable – Temp checks to make sure teams are successful, inspired and happy. Ways to recognize good work in the office. Global trainings (Miami, Dubai, etc.) to prepare you to be successful for the job. Fun stuff to reconnect with the office or others in your class (Summer Meeting, Bain Band, Bain World Cup).","-The client problems we're solving can be tough to crack. In particular, it is difficult for big organizations to change and, at times, setbacks can be discouraging. Sometimes we’ll need to have multiple meetings on the same topic to get client buy-in throughout the organization which can feel tedious.

I was often impressed and inspired by leadership's dedication to doing what was right for the client, and simultaneously trying to protect sustainable work-life balance and continuously cultivate a fun, connected office/firm culture. I loved and benefitted immensely from the focus on professional development, mentorship, regular and real-time 360 degree feedback, and learning (with learning lunches covering a wide array of topics beyond what's most relevant to case work).","Work-life balance is still variable, depending on the client, case scoping, and team leadership.

Bain is outgrowing its competitors which means there's tons of opportunity here.,"There are currently a number of legacy clients with large, long-term programs, which means there's less variety of client work at any given time.

Relaxed, informal culture that gives you the opportunity and skills to succeed.","Long hours, and the fact that you are never the one creating something; the hallmark of success at this job is helping someone else succeed."

Focus on travel only as needed.  Get to spend a lot of time in the office with teammates and colleagues.
*thought provoking work and generally great teams and clients
*exit opportunities are great and if you just want a break, easy to take a sabbatical or transfer for a 6 month period to another office for a new experience","*Only a handful of non-white candidates end up getting offers and coming here.

Plenty of personal time off, the training has been great and my colleagues are fantastic. It's so nice to work at a place where I never have to say, ""that person is an idiot,"" because pretty much everyone at Bain is intelligent and thoughtful. My supervisors have been extremely supportive, I've been able to work in a way at Bain that I haven't been able to at any other company. Bain has an entrepreneur spirit in that you can ""build your own Bain."" At Bain we do the things we want to do and are passionate about, not just the things that just pay the bills.

I've worked at many other companies that people consider glamorous and are great for the resume. The management at Bain is fantastic, I promise you, it will be hard to find a better company to work for.","If you're non-consulting staff there is a divide and you will feel it. Consultants are the bread and butter of the company (it is a consulting firm, after all!) and you will be reminded of this occasionally.

And you get feedback and coaching in a highly structured way that pushes you to your limits, developing your skillset a a breakneck pace. Finally, the compensation goes up very quickly - you won't be a billionaire, but money becomes a complete afterthought.","It is hard work and you have to be at your best every day. There will be times when you will get pushed to your limits, and of course that brings with it the expected stress and long hours. And traveling away from your family sucks."

Some of the best tools available that enable employees to do their job in the most efficient way.  An unmatched culture that is focused on having fun, delivering client results, and investing in employee development.  A flexible working environment that is not about face time.",Not many cons.  Sometimes it feels like the consulting staff is treated preferentially to other employees which can effect morale with the support staff at times.
3841,Bain & Company,Amazing impact - the respect that we as a Bain team get from clients is really powerful,2014-09-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I truly feel I am getting the best ongoing business education possible, on an ongoing basis.  Among my peers outside of Bain, it feels like as one ages, more doors close, e.g. your focus narrows - but with Bain, I feel like I keep adding to my portfolio of skills and my set of future opportunities actually broadens.

Second - frequently said but said because it is true - the people at Bain care about each other, collaborate, and have fun together.  Teaming with those around me is consistently a pleasure.","Expectations are quite high - our work is expected to be excellent, and we are a client-service business. Consequently there are some stressful moments and some late nights.  An acceptable tradeoff for the great impact, learning, and people, for me."

-The office based staffing model makes Bain more sustainable than other firms; I interned with another consulting firm where I traveled 4 days a week and was only in my home office on Fridays. I found it unsustainable and felt I didn't know the people in my own office. At Bain, when you don't have client meetings, you can be in your local office. This means you have a more reasonable travel schedule and you really get to know your colleagues. 
-Compensation and benefits are great - can't complain, comparable to similar employers
-Bain is serious about your development. It's viewed as an apprencticeship and your team really invests in your professional development, regular check-ins to talk about what you're doing well and how you can do better.
-If you work here, within a matter of months you will start getting multiple solicitations to go work for another company at a level that would be hard to crack into a few years out of business school; I've been recruited almost more heavily here at Bain than when I was in business school.","-The nature of client service is that you'll have an unpredictable schedule. I've averaged 60 hours a week but it's felt managable so far. If you rotate into the Private Equity Group you won't travel at all but you'll expect to work longer hours due to the nature of the work.
-Yeah, the only down side is the work life balance - this is not and will never be a 9-to-5 job, but you probably know that already."

You will get a ton of exposure to different industries and types of cases","Bain has gotten much more implementation focused. I found myself often being nothing more than a workshop planner, building ppt templates to keep people on track. Also, the sexy, pure strategy cases seem to be fewer and far between. I am also not entirely sure about the value proposition of consulting anymore. It used to be that it was a great alternative to Finance, where you still made great money and got to do a few different things before transitioning to the corporate world. Now, it seems like if you are interested in technology or want to do entrepreneurship, you should probably skip the consulting route completely and instead go work at a startup. With the new crop of tech companies (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), you still get great pay, benefits and get to do cool things without necessarily dealing with all the client services BS, the travel and the long hours."

Unfortunately, that's not the work you do as an associate consultant; your role is to execute perfectly. It was hard for me to work long hours or be on call, spending ~30% of my time doing quality control (I'm not a very detail-oriented person). They expect you to feel ownership and responsibility over your work stream, but you don't actually have much ownership (I'd say on my teams they encouraged me to speak up and take a 'first pass' at higher level work, but there were always lots of iterations based on small suggestions at each level)."

The operating principles of 'presume trust' and 'be open, honest, and direct' embody the Bain experience and have helped me develop in my personal life, as well as in my professional life. The step-up opportunities for someone just out of undergrad are incredible: the level of client exposure I had within my first six months is way more than I could've hoped for. Perhaps the best part, besides the people, is the seriousness with which professional development is taken. I learn something new every day, and that's absolutely invaluable to me. I feel confident in my work and in my trajectory knowing that I have a full team of mentors, guides, and peers here to support me. What truly encapsulates all of  for me is that I unquestioningly refer to Bainies as my friends, not my colleagues.","Lifestyle, as with any consulting job, can be demanding and tough."

For some, that's not the right fit, and they likely do not pursue the job (and/or are not given an offer). For others, like myself, it is the most attractive aspect of the firm, and largest differentiator for Bain among its competitors. The work is great, and the clients are all top level, and both of those categories are equal to peer companies. But its the people that make Bain really stand out.",Can have some large peaks and valleys in hours; seemingly more peaks than you would like; travel can wear on you after a while (though Bain does do the best job among companies I've seen in reducing the travel required)

Full stop. The training you receive is unparalleled, the people are the coolest, kindest, most interesting people you could hope to befriend, and the brand name opens doors all over the world. Your colleagues will challenge you to be better without ever being cutthroat (no one discusses ratings, ever), and in many cases will be your main social group outside of work - not out of necessity, but by choice.","The work is hard, the hours are long, and you don't get paid as much overall as a banker.

I have come across some bad apples though, they do exist even at firms like Bain but generally people are smart and genuine.

There is so much flexibility to pursue things your want - leave of absences, international office transfers, externships are all common and a nice way to give you a break from consulting if you need it (you probably will).

Needless to say the skill set you develop and the speed at which you develop it is invaluable.","There seems to be a trend for people to work longer hours, the 55-hour average week doesn't exist. Overscoped/underresourced projects are more common than not and everyone I know has been driven to the ground on multiple projects. Working in consulting builds a great skill set but it comes at a cost - practically no work/life balance during the week unless you are happy seeing more of Bain than family/friends etc. It can be really cliquey and there are people who have few friends beyond Bain.

Compared to corporate salaries, consulting salaries don't appear competitive given how hard you work, however you need the skill set to transition to corporates."

-It can be hard to strike a balance between work and personal life, but the company tries to do what they can to help.  Really depends on the case you're on and the manager you're working for.
-Not everyone at the top (Partners/Directors) are aligned with our working principles (especially transfers from other firms) which sometimes translates into uncomfortable conversations around where priorities are between family and work
-If someone demonstrates ability within a certain capability/industry some Partners will unofficially 'ringfence' them into their teams, making it difficult to get broad exposure

Bain still is the best place to be in consulting. Firm is going from strength to strength in its financial performance. The upside of being in an environment with this much growth is you can control for the quality of the projects the firm takes on. As a result, I find myself going from one fascinating challenge to another. Have been at it 10+ years and feel like the learning curve continues to remain steep.","Consulting is just a hard job - hours, travel and pressure of being in front of a client remain the big challenges in this job.

The challenge is immense, but I love helping specific individuals at my client to succeed and seeing the collective results of our work together.  At every turn I am supported by a team of Bainies at my side.  We are a team, and we team with our clients.  Every year I think about whether Bain is the best place for me to continue to reach my personal full potential (across all dimensions -- career, personal, family), and every year I choose to stay at Bain.  I know I am having an impact and am developing into the best person I can be -- as a business leader, colleague, wife and mother.","Having an engaging and worthwhile career means making some trade-offs.  I travel 2-3 nights a week on average, and I work hard.  However, I do not believe I work any harder than my business school classmates who are also career track/high potentials."
3998,Bain & Company,"Drive real changes to solve big problems, while learning a ton and having a clear career path",2013-10-08,5.0,Manager,"- Interesting, impactful work: There is rarely a boring day, much less a boring project. The problems we're solving are usually what's written in the WSJ about our client - big, complicated challenges, often challenges that are leading issues for that entire industry.  And my clients regularly tell me (over many years now) that they would have missed huge opportunities or never driven the required changes successfully without our help.

- Continuous learning curve: The people above you really want you to be successful and offer a ton of valuable coaching and feedback.  You are constantly improving yourself.  And those skills will be valuable no matter where you go - you get really good, for example, at separating what matters from what does not, or at making difficult changes happen in complex organizations.  

- Great people: You have incredibly smart and interesting collegues.  Yet they're also collaborative, supportive, and relatively down to earth for folks with fancy degrees.

- Smoothly-functioning meritocracy:  There's so much less office politics and similar nonsense that you experience at so many companies, even well-regarded ones.  At Bain the people who deserve to get promoted get promoted, you get more responsibility as soon as you're ready, most everyone gets along well with each other, and the pay and benefits are consistent and generally very good.","- Lifestyle can be challenging:  First the positive - there is more scope to manage your lifestyle than many people think.  Once I've gotten comfortable in a role at a given level in Bain, I've found I can create great results for clients in 50-55 hours a week.  However, when you first join or when you are shifting to a role with more responsibility, it's probably more like 70 until you learn how to do it right.  And you can never completely avoid the travel, the unpredictable client requests, checking email regularly even when not working, etc.  Client service can be a tough business and despite a lot of effort and good intention Bain hasn't cracked that nut yet.  If you really enjoy this job, though, you CAN make it work - it's possible if not always easy."

Additionally, Bain's clients include the top companies in most industries, so there is always an opportunity to work on very interesting, challenging and important business issues.  Finally, given the project nature of the work, there is tons of variety, providing a new and interesting business problem to work on every 3-6 months.","The negatives of the job include travel and long hours.  Many clients are not based near the office and require some regular travel.  This can get tiring week-in and week-out.  The hours can also get long, depending on the project (65+/week).  However, neither of these two factors is necessarily the case.  There are plenty of locally-based or light travel options, and while some weeks have long hours, they are balanced by shorter weeks or down-time in between projects.  Finally, given the size of the company, advancement is very structructured without much room for flexibility to accelerate or decelerate based on individual needs and abilities.  For those who like stability and structure, this could be a positive thing."

-A true Meritocracy: The promotion process is truly based on merit which give all the employees motivation to focus on doing the best they can for solving the clients challenges  
-Great culture: Teams are extremely supportive which creates a ideal atmosphere to work in",Bain probably has one of the best work life balance in consulting industry but at the end of the day the work load is not predictable making it difficult to plan your schedule during the week.

I absolutely love coming to work here and truly miss the office and our people when I'm away.  That's a rarity and something I cherish each day.","Client services is inherently challenging when it comes to work/life balance. Bain has a huge number of systems in place to track work/life balance and ensure each person has a great experience overall, but consulting will at times mean travel and late nights.  Overall, I've found the firm and the people to be extremely flexible and willing to help you make this career work.  Everyone here is invested in their life outside of Bain, so we are all aligned towards the same goal!"

You will not find a more thoughtful, intelligent group of people who truly view the client's business as their own, and work hard to solve the problem (while remaining humble).","The work/life challenges exist, as you'd expect in any management consulting job. Occassionaly, you could find yourself working on a project that you are less passionate about (e.g. in an industry you don't really like), and that makes the work/life trade-offs more difficult."

- Open to discussing career outside Bain and supporting transition","- Work life balance takes a pounding with all the travel
- Something which is probably not totally avoidable, but sometimes work which is done is to keep the client happy and not because it's going to be adding significant value. Also, commercial priorities lead to doing work where Bain's probably not the most qualified in terms of capabilities.

Local and global training, formal mentorship and sponsor programs, diversity initiatives, customised learning, learning through apprenticeship - that's all Bain.
The Bain culture is very strong and cemented on genuine values that resonate with Bainies. People are very smart, but pragmatic, fun to work with and down to earth. We help each other out. You actually DO want to see these people on weekends!","As in any other consulting job, the hours can be long and a bit unpredictable. It is really about getting used to it. But I think Bain is amongst the best in the industry in terms of actively managing sustainability and ensuring that flexible options are available so people don't get burned out"
4135,Bain & Company,A fun culture of highly intelligent people collaborating to bring first-class results to clients' toughest problems,2012-09-14,5.0,Associate Consultant,"Fun loving, yet hard working culture. You will want to be with the people you work with, making case teams a truly enjoyable experience. Bias towards coaching/mentoring really pays off for new starts, and encourages those who become senior to pass it on to their mentees. Encourages a one team attitude throughout.","You will travel for this job, so don't come into it with any misperceptions."

This is a great place to work out of school, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.","Consulting industry means a lot of travel.  Generally low comp relative to some other options.  I think the lifestyle can also get tough at times, so be prepared for some long hours occasionally.  At those times, the job doesn't seem worth it, but if you look over a 3-6 month period, I always felt very happy to be where I was."

Fantastic culture, you will become part of a worldwide family and make friends who will be with you for life.","Can feel distanced from true products and services, often feels like you are just giving advice rather than taking action.

4141,Bain & Company,"Incredibly smart and hard-working teams working on high-energy, high-value client-services work",2012-09-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Teamwork and culture are the focal point of Bain.  You will be challenged and stretched with the level of responsibility given to you at every stage in your career, but you will be given every amount of support from your teams to be successful at what you do.  As far as client-services work goes, the problems Bain is brough in to solve are often at the forefront of senior executives' minds.  Bain works hard to deliver practical results that the client can use, instead of an array of unprioritized opinions.  There is a deep focus on driving to an answer early on during cases, instead of waiting to turn over every rock and then deciding the best path forward.  Answers are developed collaboratively with the client, which helps maximize the likelihood that clients will take to action even after Bain is finished with their deliverables.","The job will take as much from you as you will give it.  One must learn to set boundaries and proactively manage work/life balance.  Bain is very respectful of work/life balance and personal priorities and committments, but only if you are actively voicing them and communicating them to the team.  Balance can be achieved on this job, but it, too, will only come with thoughtful work and planning."

Developing a superb platform for future career opportunities.","Long hours and significant travel.  Difficulty in ""turning it off"" at the end of the day - often an expectation to be available late at night and/or on the weekends.

- Workable lifestyle
- Multiple opportunities outside of work 

Bain is a great place to work post-MBA. I have colleagues that are younger and engage in multiple additional opportunities including the Bain Band, non-profit work, and recruiting, as well as colleagues who have young children and still find time to balance their case work while spending time with their families. Los Angeles in particular is a smaller office within the North American system and within 3 months you'll definitely know everyone's name (as opposed to just randomly passing them in the hall and awkwardly nodding)","- High turnover (typical of consulting)
- May have to spend some time in your car

Like any consulting you may be staffed in a case that involves significant and / or inconvenient travel (but there's always Starwoods) or with a manager whose working style differs from your own. But these apply to the field in general more than Bain and I think the company does a good job of utilizing a regional model to minimize excessive or unnecessary travel and having multiple opportunities for upward feedback including monthly case team surveys that are displayed in the office kitchen to help improve case team dynamics."

There is a strong focus on results and efficiency which optimizes the work we do and the outcome for our clients. The company does more than help other companies grow their profits,they are also very commited to driving social change and have both a formal and informal way for employees to get involved.  There are great flexible career path options to enhance work/life balance - I'm taking advantage of one right now.  And if you decide Bain isn't for you, it's a highly sought-after training ground for other careers (headhunters call all the time) and there is a strong alumni network to leverage for connections.","As with any consulting firm, being client-facing comes with two big cons: travel and schedule unpredictability.  Bain tries to minimize both (e.g. not being away the full week if on a travel case, planning key client meetings in advance, anticipating the unexpected), but there's always an element that will remain uncontrollable."

However the growth is coming at the expense of the employees. Long long long frustrating hours working without any direction or definition from upper management. Employees from the other global offices coming to do thier rotation programs also find the work culture incredibly different than offices abroad. The India offices come last on the employee global survey continously for the last 2 years in all benchmarks. They Manager group especially is very clueless. Trying to over deliver to impress clients and partner group, the work done is probably 3x times expected by the client. Weekend work is a norm and one is expected to work around 80 hours a week.

4177,Bain & Company,"Absolutely terrible, would not recommend firm to anyone",2012-02-17,1.0,,"Good reasons are 
1) the people -- consulting attracts the best / brightest students, and Bain is an awesome firm in that regards.

2) The support that the junior Bainies give.  Most people there Consultant and below (that's the level immediately post-MBA) are good people and support each other however possible.

3) Work-life balance -- obviously consulting stinks but at least Bain tried (weekly health checks, meetings on how to make life better).","1) Incredible sketchiness.  The partners / managers are more interested in lining their own pockets with money than providing useful advice -- case in point is that the managers / partners are much more concerned with extending cases (calling 'rolling' in consulting lingo) than actually providing good advice

2) Cult-like intensity.  The excellent reputation is proactively managed, such that I wouldn't be surprised if this point is followed by tons of comments that support Bain and try to paint me as a bad apple (for the record I wasn't).  There's also a strong culture of following, simply because there's so much direct feedback.  Bain did not appreciate diversity whatsoever -- any divergent thoughts / actions were quickly fixed, and the vast majority of leaders ended up leaving the organization as quickly as they could.  

3) Incredibly political.  Everything in Bain, including your feedback review, is group driven -- if even one senior partner takes a stand for or against you, it either jump start or completely destroy your career (I have seen it both ways).  Most people join consulting because they're risk averse and that only gets worse as people get promoted -- as a result everyone in the higher ranks just tries to blend into the crowd and not rock the boat.

4) Limited skills learned.  A lot was said to me about how the skills I learned would be helpful later, which is completely false.  At Bain (and other consulting firms), we perfect our analysis / presentation skills -- but to be perfectly honest, unless you're already great at those, you're not getting hired in the first place (and you're certainly smart enough to do whatever you want to begin with).  I'm not sure the extra 10-20% of refining your thought process will make any substantial difference.  Bain does not teach leadership or implementation in any way, shape, or form -- and the risk aversion you learn at Bain will get in the way of whatever you will do later.  At best, I believe it's a wash.

In summary I would not spend a year or two here, and I would certainly advise against staying longer than that and trying to make partner.  And by the time you make partner, the industry itself will be in decline and your margins (and take-home salary) will be far lower than what they are now.  And besides, too many things can go wrong in the meantime -- and it's not like a manager is really qualified to do anything in the workforce other than stay in a strategy role in a large corporate.  If you want to stay in strategy then by all means... but for the other 99% of us, just do what you want to as soon as you can."

Great way to gain additional post-MBA experience while exploring a variety of industries
Opportunity to work with clients at a very high level","Lots of inconsistency at smaller offices.

Growth of Atlanta and Dallas offices exceeded the ability to attract candidates at the level of quality of other North American offices, especially at manager level where they've been brought in by lower-caliber firms. 

Reality of travel is that once you get away from an office in a city that has a big base of potential clients, you'll be on the road all the time. Staffing has also become national. Can be hard to build mentors within your home office if staffed under managers based elsewhere.

Some consultants work for the same client for case after case."

There is no holding back or cutting corners.,"Working in the administrative side of the business, chance for job growth and promotions are limited. A lot of the upper level managers have been here for a long time and are not going anywhere. There is very little chance to move up. There are no mid-level managerial positions and your career path can be very ambiguous at times. Hiring practices for open positions can be a lengthy process as the company looks to hire Senior level people at Junior level pay."
