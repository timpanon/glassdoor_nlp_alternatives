I get to come late to work for 1 minute or 2 minutes at the most ( which btw was because of queue from covid controls) and they make me a formal meeting for a warning. 

Needless to say I got out and it's them who lost probably one of their best employees in history within their team.

Furthermore I constantly asked my Team Leader and Supervisors to give me further training to prepare me to become a team leader but this was never done within 1 year time.

Long story short you are treated like a number with no criteria to adjustment by management. None of my efforts and hard work were overlooked for the measly 1 to 2 minutes that I was late twice for in my career.

I went on to retire after that. Because I can"

59,Bet365,No work-life balance,2021-12-30,2.0,Customer Service Advisor,"Work with lots of people, opportunity to make lots of friends. Good wage.","You sell your soul when you sign the contract. You will regularly be working 7 and sometimes 8 days in a row, then two days off and another 7 days. You work 3 out of every 4 weekends, and if a sporting event is on then you can go without a weekend off for months. It can be very cliquey, and it's not what you know but who you know to progress within the company. 

Extremely strict on break times etc, you have to pop a code in your phone so everything is timed and if you go past by 1 second it will lead towards a disciplinary. Unrealistic service targets, for example average chat times, email response and phone times need to be within a certain range but this depends entirely on what the query and who you are speaking to is (one email can range between 10 seconds to respond to up to over an hour if complicated - and this is not the advisor's fault). Customers are some of the rudest people I have ever spoken to in my life, and more contact is negative than positive. 

Don't expect to get a parking space unless you're on an early shift or work nights, there is no where else to park locally without getting fined.

Shift times are any time between 7am-11pm.

The customer service department needs a serious shake up to reduce the constant staff turnover. Treating people less like children, offering more regular shifts and realistic targets would be a start. I have heard from other people that other departments are nowhere near as bad."

Horrible shift pattern: Work 7 days in a row; only 11h rest between shifts.

Toxic environment: Colleagues and superiors stab you in the back and gossip about you.

Open plan office that does not facilitate concentration. It feels like working in the middle of an airport at rush hour.

People who work there are almost all from the Stoke area and do not speak English but an incomprehensible dialect and make no effort to be more understandable.

Promotions are not made on the basis of merit-based criteria but in an absolutely arbitrary way. 

It's a place where you feel like you're just a machine, you can't express your personality in any way."

65,Bet365,"Great salary, but stressful",2021-12-24,4.0,European Customer Account Advisor,"- The training is long and in-depth as you get more than 2 months of training to cover the main areas of work. There is a lot of information to be taught so the slower and longer the better.
 
- Reading and being updated is essential. Since the information in the company is always changing with new security and verification procedures/ internal tools/ licences/ laws in different countries getting introduced each month, you need to be up to date with all the updates. If you dread that your job is getting boring since you already know everything there is to know already, you can be sure that you will not stop paying attention to everything that is changing with this company, which will make you feel that there's a tone of fresh air with every change.
 
- Change is challenge. Since everything is constantly changing you will be faced with a lot of mind puzzles and challenges which some days will feel really satisfying. Especially when tackling difficult issues and difficult customers, you will start feeling more and more fulfilled.
 
- The pay is really good and I cannot stress that enough. Most of the people that stay years in this position only stay for the money. There's nothing more to it at the end of the day, since money enables you to have fun with everything else that you want to outside of work. Bonuses add even more money at the end of every three months which is also an important plus.
 
- Many days for holidays. You basically have the option to manage your holidays into having a week off every month or two weeks off every two months. Every 28 days you get a ""long weekend"" which are the 2 days off at the end of one week (Saturday - Sunday) and the 2 days off at the beginning of the next week (Monday - Tuesday).","- People are strict and by the book with everything. I understand that having a professional attitude is important and I agree with it, however at times it feels that I'm not working at a company with humans. When I began at the company we would get angry looks from the upper management if I had a conversation between co-workers, not even while laughing, which was never heard in the office. I'm all in for efficiency and punctuality, but sometimes you just want to feel like you have a personality in the office not that you're just there, in the office, working again, as you did the day before.
 
If you're doing your job right and at the time that you are asked to do it, then everyone from the low to the higher management will have a very professional and polite approach towards you and I enjoyed the positive feedback about my progression but I cannot get over the overly strict attitude.
 
- Strict gets a second point. No mobile phones during the shift, no talking, no music, you have to request and wait for permission to use the bathroom, every single thing you do (emails, live chat, phone calls) gets timed and recorded. It feels that there are no times in the 8 hours of the shift that you are allowed to stop and breathe at a moment.
 
- No group activities and no team building. For the most of my first year in the company I didn't know or say hello to anyone. It seems that impersonal and cold behaviour is awarded so I didn't aspire to be social. I got to meet some of my co-workers outside of work since socializing was nearly impossible during the shifts.
 
- It can be very stressful at times which can be difficult to deal with once you are out of work. The nervousness unfortunately leaves work about 1 hour after having finished the shift 

- Shifts and different times of work. You could be working during the morning one week then during the evening. It could be challenging to manage to.meet people out of work considering that you get to work Saturdays and Sundays and possibly late shifts."

67,Bet365,Zero trust in employees,2021-12-17,2.0,Project Manager,Well equipped offices. Pay slightly above average.,"bet365 has to be the most weird place I've ever worked at. The culture is very much one of distrust for their employees. Micro management of staff is ingrained into the culture. This manifests itself in a number of ways: (non-Agile) Daily calls where you have to go through in detail what you'll be doing that day; During lockdown you'd receive a few calls a day from your manager at random times, with nothing in particular to discuss; I once asked to book a holiday and was asked by my manager where I was going. Not in a friendly, inquisitive way, the question was asked in a way that suggested the location of my holiday might have a bearing on whether it would be approved; The line between private life and work life seems to be blurred at bet365 compared to everywhere else I've ever worked and that can be uncomfortable at times.

The company has expanded massively over the years and as a result, many of the people working in middle to upper management (not all) have little or no experience working anywhere else other than bet365. Not all, but many of them are out of their depth in these positions and tend to protect their positions by insisting that their reports do things the way they would do them themselves, the only way they know. Coming in with a broad experience of the IT industry is fruitless because any new ideas and suggestions are quickly quashed. The result is that bet365 have very fixed, narrow minded and often, just simply incorrect, ways of working, processes and procedures. For example, they refer to system testing as UAT for some reason. When you enter as an experienced hire this can take some getting used to."

The company prides themselves on building before buying even though they're more than happy to spend a small fortune developing something with a half arsed approach when there is a perfectly, well reviewed and tested, free alternative.

Be prepared for ""this company is striving for an Agile way of working"" and ""A comprehensive backlog of work"" in the interview stage, you'll later find out these are lies. Any suggestion of moving to a more Agile approach or even simply a methodology will be met with ""we don't do that here"".

I was advised internal/business systems are not the same as other areas of the business. So its possible some areas are ok from what I could hear. However, if your a time served BA, I'd strongly recommend looking at the 1000's of other opportunities out there, you wont get any external training and you will not work Agile nor learn anything new in this area."

100,Bet365,Toxic and Machiavellian,2021-09-30,2.0,Forensics,"I’ll try to be objective and preface this with that there are some outstanding engineers and competent managers in the business. I was also fortunate in having multiple pay rises in my relatively short time there. Additionally, I have met some great people and keep in touch with them regularly. Certainly, one of the most interesting business domains I have worked in. 
My advice, this could be a good opportunity for someone starting out in their career especially if they do not have the formal qualifications for a technology role. They have an incredibly low barrier to entry and do a good job of upskilling their staff. Not for the long term.","My reasons for leaving the business were principally due to the culture, having spent time in the industry beforehand I have to say I haven’t seen anything quite like it. One of the most toxic/ Machiavellian work environments I have ever had the displeasure of working in. They do pay over market rates (I’d assume out of necessity) but there is no premium you can put in knowing your colleagues and managers have your best interests at heart. Due to the business’ financial successes, it seems everyone got fat and happy, so no one asks any questions. Middle management have carte blanche with seemingly very little oversight. They certainly exploit the fact that there are limited opportunities within this industry around the Stoke office specifically. This contributes to the underlying anxiety, and I believe the root cause of a lot of the office politics. They do struggle to keep hold of good people and management practices/ technologies are dated, so it won’t be like any other technology role you have worked in. My experience completely unmotivated me, please don’t consider this for the long term."

This could be managed at a higher standard, especially for a company like bet365. 

- Working late shifts. I get it that we need to work weekends but in our department, we have to work late shifts which won't make a big difference if we finish earlier. It ruins one's work life balance. 

- Management is strict, if your late even for 5 mins, they make a big deal out of it.

On some occasions however, the customer is correctly wrong, and too dense to fully understand why... however they are few and far between. 

Such is the nature of Customer service jobs, you can grow to be bitter and twisted, however as the pay is as good as it is, it can leave you feeling as though it is worth seeing it through....for your sake, don't. 

The fact that the company has such a large turnover of CSA's, and staff taking time off for mental health reasons should speak volume, and whilst they do have an app for Mental health Care, it's a bit like sticking a plaster on a shark bite.

Company has a lot of income, from around the world, so is therefore financially strong and secure. 

The scale of the systems, and the extent of the market mean a lot of interesting problems that can add a good amount of variety for the interested developer.

Corporate culture is preferred for some people, with departments for each specialty, HR department, large teams to be part of, etc. Perfect for those that want a 9-5 job that is ticket-shifting work which doesn't require too much brain-power, and let's you switch off when you leave the office (assuming you switch your work-phone off and are not on call - for those then it can be brutal some weekends).","It is as you would expect with a large corporate environment; large open-plan offices with many rows of back-to-back desks with little room. Everybody has identical corporate PCs, with hot-desking throughout, so there is no personalisation of your PC or desk area - this means that every day you have to set up your monitors for example. Overall you have little say in how things are run, there are only a few people who are in a position to make decisions, from technology to the exact software/plugin/package you wish to use. This goes for your local machine up to the traditional infrastructure.

To clarify, imagine you decide you want to use VSCode for your development; you must attempt to find an install package that has been stored on a network drive after it was approved and scanned previously, or you need to raise a ticket with the specific reasons and file you want and then wait for approval from your line manager. Once you have waited for the approval, which likely will take some discussion between them and other staff, then you have to wait for a member of the Infosec team to download, scan it and send it to you. You may then install it and start configuring, first thing you have to do is start turning off all possible telemetry and auto-updates. At this point you decide you want a few useful time-saving plugins, you mustn't go to the plugin section of VSCode and install them, you must follow the same process for each one and side-load them into the software. 

Once you have managed to get set up and working, completion of a ticket must be achieved within the strict boundaries of what has been done before. Any out-of-the-box thinking will mean potential days, or weeks, of meetings with senior staff and many layers of this seniority, sign off and discussion. If you want to pull a few NPM.,Maven or Nuget packages to do a bit of investigative development, then you need to find exactly what you need and build a case why you need each one and wait for the approval, scanning, download, etc. If you are unsure what you need until you get to use it, then you would most likely have to do that at home after-hours without access to any of the code. There is no reason you can't do all this, but most people won't have the stamina.

Compare that to other work environments; Download VSCode, 5 mins later, install a few plugins, and download a few packages and start to get creative with your development. Throw out ideas, try others, enjoy, and have fun, which ultimately leads to a good solid solution.

Worth noting that there is information announced from the company to the press around technology that can be quite misleading, such as articles like ""How Kubernetes has simplified Bet365's software deployments"", when the technology is used in only a small area of the business. These are very much advertisement-led pieces, so don't take too much stock in them."

On-site canteen and tea ladies that bring you drinks (they don’t want you leaving your desk)

Good if you have limited career ambition and just want a well-paying, guaranteed stable job","I worked for bet365 over 5 years across multiple teams, so it’s fair to say I’ve got the T-shirt. Most of what follows is primarily for the Stoke office. I initially heard much nicer things about the Manchester office, however over the last few years many of the incompetent Stoke managers have since relocated there, or now manage teams at both locations simultaneously, and as a result my former colleagues now tell me things are going south fast and the Manchester office culture is now just as bad.

Firstly, as many others have already said, the parking situation is terrible. To have any chance of getting parked you need to be there before 8.00am (and this cut-off time is only getting worse), otherwise you need to pay to park on a council car park, or park in one of the nearby retail parks or housing estates and hope you don’t get a ticket (or spend your lunch break moving your car and then make up the exceeded break time you went over). Either of these then means at least a 20 minute walk to the office. 

Then between 5 and 6pm everywhere is grid-locked so you won’t get out, and so straight away you’re on at least a 9 hour day (god forbid you put down your headset and leave at 4.55). Management simply don’t care or acknowledge the parking problems, because they have their own priority parking spaces (yet still choose to park in “our” spaces whenever they wish to). Each time I have driven past the Stoke office, even during covid the car park is always full.

As others have also suggested on here, it looks like management have taken to writing fake positive reviews, so I would encourage others to take these with a pinch of salt and instead read all the other lower rated reviews, as I can’t say I disagree with any of them. They are constantly trying to put on a big façade at corporate promotion events and pull the curtain over how it really is.

Now I know office politics are part of any company, but at bet365 it this is especially horrendous and particularly with the middle-management. Everybody is constantly trying to cover their backsides, denying everything unless it is in writing and looking for any excuse to shove the blame downhill so they can then brown-nose their superiors in an attempt to look good. After 5 years I can safely say, the real problem was just bad management, not the employees (and you wonder why there is such a high staff turnover on lower tier roles…)

The company has already gone through its major growth stage in Stoke, so the majority of people are only in the positions they are because of being in the right place at the right time. Unless you are part of one of the newer more niche teams, there is little chance of being promoted unless someone above you leaves, and this rarely happens as these are high salary roles for Stoke.

Then you have little cliques of managers and their mates who group up together to form a holy inner ring, impossible to penetrate without lots of “extra favours” (take note ladies) or “oh can you just do me this and stay late to take one for the team”. If like me you have a family, it’s just not feasible to put in the extra unpaid effort required to be considered a good employee. While as usual, upper management are either blissfully unaware, or simply just don’t care as they sit in their ivory towers. Also I'm told working from home options are now only for ""priority employees"" whatever that is supposed to mean.

So it really is a case of just sit down, shut up and do as you’re told. Any suggestions to improve the day-to-day processes just get shut down (i.e “that’s not your role”) or stolen by your superiors and passed off as their own. There are bi-monthly 1-2-1 reviews but these are pointless as they are always rushed and then they will just fob you off with false promises and “business as usual” speeches.

For those of you that care about company ethics and responsible gambling, in the words of my former team leader “we must always just do the minimum to remain regulatory safe – every other gambling company is the same”. Lots of the business is also based in Gibraltar and Malta for tax reasons, so take all of that as you will…

I haven’t given one star because there are some really good benefits to working here, but over time the money becomes less and less attractive as you have to deal with all of the above every single day (this includes making up time spent on toilet breaks and filling in timesheets saying what you did every minute of each day). There are pass scans on every door (security is very OTT) so they know your exact start/finish times. 

I could write a lot more but I am sure you get the picture – I haven’t even talked about how badly managed the projects are! Working for another company just 8 months has made me in hindsight realise just how truly toxic the bet365 working environment was. To anyone who wants to work for bet365, good luck to you, don’t let them bully you into the ground. When they start treating you like just a number grit your teeth and if you want to keep your bonus don’t lash out."

Secure job","This is an ideal position for people that don't really care about technology and are looking for a place to retire.

There is an apparent lack of architecture and there is tendency to reinvent the wheel and do everything in house, even for proven solutions which are used everywhere else in the world (e.g. Json format). This is partially explained because the majority of the people in the higher technical ranks have been here forever and are completely cut off the new trends in the outside world.

Since joining, my skills took a massive nosedive and after leaving the company I really struggled to get a new job. I feel really sorry for people just starting their carrier because of the way they will be shaped they will be highly unemployable anywhere else. There is also a huge blame culture and people are very scared to introduce any change to make things better. Testing, dev ops and automation are also quite behind, everything is pretty much manually done.

The culture is similar to a company from the 90s, there is no real belief in remoting work or any other trends and the mentality is very cooperate, it is far away from a modern tech house. The team leads don't really care to promote any culture and rather focus to simply get the job done according to the ""business needs"".

Salary is above average for the region but expect no other perks such as training budget or certifications as these are considered as useless in this business.

As a summary, if you have no plans for working anywhere else then feel free to join, otherwise don't fall into this massive trap and look for something better.

P.S. One thing which is quite outrageous is the amount of 5* fake reviews. I wouldn't have otherwise been bothered to write a review but people deserve to be warned."

Never praised for positive work but anything done slightly incorrectly is raised and you are spoken to in a negative way constantly with no acknowledgement to how far you have progressed. Severely micro managed with chat times and phone times being severely monitored on the quantity as opposed to quality, but bonuses work off the quality. Holiday requests are not accepted until last minute with a lot of dates blocked out, you can not plan for any holidays. Even when booking holiday 6+ months in advance, 6 weeks before your holiday period is requested for and there is still no response yet you are not allowed to book holidays until they have been accepted. Have to log in early everyday at least 10 mins to be set up and ready to go live on contact once you start, yet you are not paid for this and it is just expected and will often finish late, easily 15 minutes a day unpaid. You really are just a number and are not needed. Constantly having new staff and training coming in, they put it down to ""it is not the job for everyone in terms of hours and dealing with complaints"" when actually this is not the issue at all, and how you are treated is not nice causing people to leave, the job is very manageable. Poor staff welfare, when stating you are stressed etc this is missed and never picked up to see if you are okay, and asking for a favour for a day off/early finish it just won't happen no matter what the reason, but will still ask for overtime favours regularly but give nothing back."

People therefore don’t dare ask to go for comfort.

It is really sad to compare the customer service department now compared to 3-4 years ago, it is not going downhill, it is falling off a cliff. I must say all friends in other departments that left cs can’t say enough good about other departments, and how they are so relieved to leave cs( although they block internal transfers for 3-6 months and make you wait to leave customer service).

One day you start at 8am, one at 11am one at 3pm till midnight. It could happen often that you have 3 midnights shifts and then one 8am shift and one 11pm shift in the same week. You will have no private life.

A lot of disrespect happens at bet365. This was the reason I left and not from the customers side!

Don’t get a company accommodation, that’s their way to own you. You will not be officially registered or get a proof of address. 

You can’t just go to the bathroom, you always have to ask for permission, it can take up to 2 hours till you get a yes.

Great atmosphere with very little office politics or blame culture. Everyone is supportive and helpful, and there's no room for ego.

As a woman in a tech role, can confirm this is a welcoming environment that doesn't allow for the machismo that some tech workplaces indulge. There's female representation and a decent gender balance at all levels of management.","Car park isn't big enough for volume of staff - people often have to turn up early to get a space and there isn't much free/cheap suitable alternative parking nearby. For those who travel by public transport, access is decent with fairly regular buses. Might be good to offer a shuttle bus from Stoke/Hanley/Newcastle to allow staff to park at home or on other public car parks and then travel to the office together.

Restaurant is good in that it's open 24/7 so even those in the business who work nights can get a meal, but food on offer is fairly average and monotonous, and prices don't seem to be subsidised much if at all.

Although skills development on the job is good, there aren't many opportunities provided by the business to go on courses or gain qualifications - a bit of investment in this might be much appreciated."

273,Bet365,Probably the worst job I've had,2020-10-31,1.0,Software Developer,"Good office location, decent pay","Favouritism, lack of culture, terrible onboarding experience . HR, recruiting agency and management are full of lies, I joined during COVID, and because of this I was promised during the interview process that I would come into the office just 2 times a week, and work 3 days remotely.
I was also told I would onboard remotely, they would send me a laptop maybe an external monitor and other gear about a week before joining them.
HR confirmed this in an email, and on the phone about 2 weeks beforehand..but 2 days before my first day I get told that I need to come into the office to ""meet the team"" etc. I said ok, that's alright, at least I get to meet the team, maybe I need to pick up the gear myself from the office.

So I do that, but to my surprise the office was pretty much empty ..about 4 people max from my team were in every day, out of 20. Everyone was using desktop PC's, I then get told I need to come into the office every day, and find out everyone else is on a rota and they work remotely for 3 days a week just like I was promised..but apparently they didn't trust me as a new starter to do that?
Most seniors didn't come into the office not even for one day, so I never met them, so much for ""meeting the team"". Then I get told nobody gets laptops in the company..and if I were to work remotely, I need to use my personal PC.

I also find out from other ""senior"" members that usually its just seniors that get this ""perk"" of working remotely. Also I was told by my recruiter that the work schedule was 8h a day with an hour break, but then I get told by the same ""senior"" that it's only them who have the 1h break, and the rest of us have only 30 minutes.

I also get told in my first week that I need to take a whopping 30% of my holidays in the next 2 months otherwise I would lose them entirely?(orders from upper management)..at this point I was already getting sick of the lies.

They work in a very old school way, no SCRUM or AGILE really..they stuck me with the worst type of work that nobody else wanted to do, bugfixes on some very legacy projects. I was told I was hired for my front end skills, I had experience leading a front-end team working with modern JS frameworks , yet most of the work I was doing was .NET MVC..and some occasional css, almost no JS.
The codebase is atrocious, at least on the frontend..and whenever I brought up a way of improving the codebase and doing some refactoring, the senior dev would just shut me down and tell me just to add more code on top to fix the issue, there was never any initiative to improve anything.
With some exceptions, most of the seniors are too busy, or too uncaring to help you out, and they frequently just ignored your messages.

There is absolutely no team spirit, people just have a tendency of working on their tickets..and struggle by themselves, people don't tend to help each other out. Their codebase is very poorly documented, and most of the knowledge lives in people's heads , their projects barely have any documentation and information is siloed to just a few people.

The tech they use is very old and outdated..and they have a lot of in house built libraries and systems, that are not documented at all, getting up to speed with them is a nightmare and you just end up poking around to figure things out.

They are absolutely paranoid when it comes to security, nothing can be downloaded from the internet not even for development purposes like libraries and packages., code editors etc..They block youtube and other websites on their network, so you can't even watch tutorials to get up to speed with a certain technology if want it.
You can't even attach screenshots on their messaging platform, so people can understand what section or page of a website you are talking about, and you are constantly reminded that the conversations are ""routinely monitored"" whenever you send a message.

The office is in a good location close to Arendale, but their kitchen is extremely small considering how large the floors are and how many people could work there. There are also just 4 small rounded tables to have lunch..and there is no break room/area so people could disconnect a bit from their work.

There is no culture in the office, people generally are mindless drones who don't even say good morning to eachother when they pass by.
This is somewhat different depending on the team, some teams seem to be more social, but mine definitely was not.

Just to exemplify how bad things are in their teams, one of the worse things was the ""senior"" developer who was assigned to get me up to speed and ""upskill me"" with their internal libraries and projects. He actively avoided me in person and even ignored my messages, often setting his status to ""Busy"" right after I would message him with a question. I got the feeling he hated the fact that he was stuck helping me, he would just ignore my PR's for weeks and weeks just because he didnt want to deal with me at all. He lacked patience, and was really bad at explaining concepts, and would try get rid of me as fast as possible. The other developers were usually too busy to help me out, so I was always stuck with his ""help""..

Definitely not the best place to work as a developer, even worse if you are a frontend dev used to a modern tech stack and I can imagine how bad it is if you are a junior, the lack of support and guidance from the ""senior"" developers is something that you should be mindful of.
Of course they don't mention any of this during the interview process, they keep talking about how their custom built libraries are better than what is out there and they are specifically tailored for their needs..but after you have a look at the library code you pretty much have to restrain yourself from not bursting into laughter. Also none of the devs who wrote these custom libraries are still around in the company..they were mostly written by contractors who have long left the company.

This pretty much sums up my experience working there, and boy am I glad it is over!"

The company has no culture, or does not keep up with the culture, the role of the Advisor is to lie to customers, and hope that customers accept and do not curse, as all processes are delayed and bet365 thinks it is right.
We at the customer service receive conflicting information between the supervisors and managers themselves, each one says something, the truth is that there are a lot of people in charge and few people who know what they are doing.

When they needed us to work from home, we worked for 5 month, without enhancements on our salary, when we need for 5 days , they say its not possible.

My manager was understanding and I couldn't really fault the place. Pay was great, good performance was noticed and rewarded. Very happy.

Worked from home during the first lockdown. Was happy with how the company handled it and was happy with how the company handled the governments push to get people back to work. I can't fault the companies response to ensuring the office is as safe as possible, they have installed hospital grade virus killers all around the building, desk screens, hand sanitisers, etc.","The government has now said that anyone who can work from home, should work from home. Software developers can work from home, we already have remote developers and already worked throughout lockdown. But since the company has spent so much money securing the office they are now reluctant to follow official government advice.

The advice is clear and yet we are told the company is ""investigating which roles can effectively work from home"". We've done it for 5 months already! They know we can. They're just stalling and hoping we all forget. We won't forget.

They also introduced a half-baked WFH policy which goes completely against the idea of WFH being flexible for the employee. We have to get prior management approval, multiple days in advance, which is just completely backwards.

The company touts as itself as being a tech company and while there are some great people there, upper management is stuck in the past. They need to get with the times and offer real flexible working, then let line managers decide whether an employee is effective at their job or not. Don't take it out on everyone just because of a few bad apples."

I felt like a human robot, felt miserable everyday I had to go to work. You work like crazy and by the end of the quarter they might not pay the full bonus (huge disappointment) . You are not heard and seen for the good things, but if you do any kind of mistake you are called to the meeting room for them to warn you. Some supervisors take things personally and will be “picking” on you. Don’t even know why they have CS honestly, CS can’t solve anything, they are just holding the fire for other departments who make mistakes. You hear complain from the customer and from the team leaders/ sups..not a gratifying job at all. They don’t do any kind of team building or try to make people a bit more happier or a more welcoming environment. I felt relieved quitting the job."

New procedures keep on piling weekly but there are no trainings at all and no pay rises for the constant increase of responsibilities. Equipment is mix and match - you won't find same size or brand monitors on the same desk. Computers are old and slow and the company (in the face of CS management) has no interest in updating them. No team buildings, group activities or any type of social benefits. Just keep your head down on the PC and follow the ever increasing procedures mindlessly. Poor rota which totally messes your biological clock, swapping shifts is frowned upon and rarely allowed. If you are late (even 1 min) you are required to make up the time.

308,Bet365,Stay away! Stay well and truly away!,2020-09-15,1.0,Customer Service Representative,I have to say something so... NOTHING!,"Now this is where it gets interesting. I remember even walking into the office at Alcatraz... oops sorry I mean bet365 I felt that I was walking into a maximum security correctional facility. That very first training session where we were told not to even bother taking our notes with us at home and not to plug our phones into the sockets just in case we were trying to steal information (from an electricity socket I know, don't get me started).

As the days went on to weeks and weeks onto months I quickly began learning that life at bet365 is like the prison courtyard where you need to make certain friends to survive and that you had to follow the all so stringent rules or else you'd have to answer to the prison warden! On the odd occasion you're allowed out of your cell for a break, you know that you must ABSOLUTELY return on time and not a nanosecond late as breaks are timed to the strictest. If you're slightly late make no mistake about it the break police will be on your case like Johnny Cochran for OJ Simpson.

Now I know what you may be thinking, this guy is clearly exaggerating comparing a company to a prison, but see here's the thing. At prisons, prisoners are actually allowed to speak to each other, at bet365 you can't even do that as it is strictly against the rules. You're expected to dig your eyes into that computer screen the moment you start work and everything else around you just doesn't exist.

To conclude, the slightly above average salary that the company offers is nowhere near worth my sanity so all I would say is don't get blinded by the money. That's about all they have to offer. For a gaming company, these lot really don't embrace the culture of most gaming companies where work and fun blend together and that is a huge culture shock if you come from a gaming background.

APPROACH WITH CAUTION!"

- Stupid policies that make no sense (You can only hold one hot drink at a time).
- Military Camp office environment, sign up if you enjoy looking at grey, boring, dull carpets and the same blank white walls all day. The offices are the exact same around the globe, so even a transfer won't change that!
- If you don't sniff managements arses, you're not getting a promotion.
- Don't even think about sitting in a seat which is not allocated to you, management will be onto you like ninjas. If it's too cold where you are seated, don't bother opening your mouth, specialists aren't allowed to do anything without kissing the golden ring beforehand.
- Lose enhanced pay benefits if you are sick.
- Shifts patterns are badly managed, you can forget about a work-life balance.
- Don't sneeze or fart or you'll be pulled into a meeting for being 'Too Loud' or having 'Bad Office Conduct'.
- Don't get your mobile out of your pocket unless you're a supervisor. If you are, you can sit on it all day and tell specialists it's against the policy to use your phone at desks. 
- No extra employee benefits other than Tea/Coffee (When the coffee machine works, it's dreadful anyway). if you complain about the benefits, you'll get told to think about how much the job pays.
- No confidentiality between agents and supervisors, your personal life will be right in their WhatsApp chat the minute you tell them something.

The list of cons could go on forever, these are just a few to say the least. Would definitely not recommend working for this company, worst one by far!

The inter-team politics and toxic work environment has to be seen to be believed.

Everyone in a senior role seems to be on some sort of power trip. Like its the first time in their lives they've been given a bit of responsibility and they are using this authority as an excuse to bully people underneath them.

The quality of all codebases is similar to what you would expect to find in an old school software house. Massive libraries consisting of hundreds of projects, with very little structure and little application of design patterns.

It is clear that the company management do not value talented developers at all. Their strategy is to simply hire as many developers as possible to pile features upon features. When you can't work through them fast enough due to the technical debt you then start to suffer burnout, and the team leaders start abusing and belittling you.

I would strongly advise anyone thinking of working here to avoid at all costs. I cannot wait to find a new job so I can hand in my resignation."

325,Bet365,Fantastic Company So Far! (Graduate),2020-07-30,5.0,Database Administrator (Database Administrator),"One of the key differences that I’ve clearly noticed is the respect you get from your peers and managers in the office. Colleagues support you and don’t mind you asking them any sorts of questions that you think are silly. They clearly understand that by asking questions, you will learn the ropes much more easily. Although in University you would get support, this would primarily only be during the lecturer’s office hours, whereas everyone at work has a fantastic knowledge and are fine for you to ask them anything, anytime.
It was evident straight away that bet365 want me to continue learning. I honestly feel like I’m back at University sometimes with the amount of learning I’m actually doing. Senior members would give lessons using real world examples from bet365, which is fascinating and a great way to teach using the bet365 infrastructure. As well as this, a free subscription to Pluralsight is also given to us to allow us to learn, as well as encourage self-learning when there is not much work to do.
I am also being sent on a range of third-party courses all arranged from bet365. This is a fantastic commitment and investment into me, which I greatly appreciate. I feel highly valued and an important cog in the team, despite only being here for 2 months. The amount of time, money and resources that have been used on me so far is fantastic. I also have weekly one-to-one meetings with my manager where we discuss what I’ve done in that week, and also about how I am doing as a whole. This is great because it promotes a strong relationship with the manager, which makes coming to work that much better. I’ve worked part-time jobs during University where the managers only cared about meeting sales figures, whereas bet365 clearly value and respect their staff.","Quite long working hours but I'm use to this from University.
Coronavirus had meant that I had to onboard from home. However, they sent me a laptop and all the equipment that I need

Lots of interesting members of staff to learn from once you get to know them","Although I find my work interesting and challenging, at times tasks can be very tedious and repetitive. It feels like there is a lot of opportunity to improve the day to day processes yet nobody really seems to care.

My biggest complaint would be that there seems to be an overall negative culture within teams. Lots of people backstabbing, stealing credit playing politics. It’s just not at all necessary when we should all be working as one big team!

Many benefits are exclusively for senior members of staff. Ultimately people in lower roles are working and delivering much more while senior members just take the glory, so consider expanding out the benefits to others also.

I see a lot of hate against team leaders. My experience of the middle management is not that bad however I can see evidence of the issues others are complaining about happening. The reality is that team leaders are often trying to manage a situation with pressure from the upper management, so understandably some things slip through the cracks and people feel neglected.

COVID movement to working from home seems to have been embraced well. However I feel the same bad office culture between staff still exists whereby people are trying to just point-score and one-up themselves over colleagues in an attempt to look good."

- Do not plan important life events such as a mortgage to buy a house, have children, marry: bet365 do not care about its employees and with the excuse of political events (such as Brexit) will deliberately change your employment place in another country, of course they pay you if you decide not to move, but you lose your job, not funny at all. 
- Do not ""decide"" to face a serious surgery: you are so valued as employee that they clearly show that they prefer you to leave the company.
- Do not dare to watch your phone for a couple of secs or an innocent ""not related to work"" internet page in a 10 (ten) hours workingshift: Big Brother is watching you and a diligent supervisor will remind you that you risk a warning for this really bad attitude. 
- Do not trust management: we were strongly reassured company would have not relocated by management when the news spread across on newspapers, well maybe they were not aware, but guess some of them looked for a new job in the meantime. 
- Do not complain for Air Condition power: you cannot change your sit as they are obsessed employes are always cheating so they want you to be all together where the diligent supervisor can be sure you are doing your job properly, he/she will eventually reassure you that you feel cold because you are from south of Europe.

339,Bet365,"Unscrupulous, Draconian and Toxic",2020-05-25,1.0,Senior Software Developer,"Nothing of any substantial positivity is really worth noting, other than the fact you’re pretty much guaranteed to always have a job due to the fact that staff turnover is so high and company profits are so substantial.

Bet365 have made a large PR story about retaining their staff throughout the covid pandemic, however with their profits as they are, any other course of action would have just been insulting to its employees.

Any other sort of “benefit” they claim to offer is standard throughout most large companies.","I am extremely disappointed, although not at all surprised, to see that the bet365 in-house recruitment team are impersonating developers and writing fake positive reviews. They are taking heavily adapted quotes from innocent developers and splashing them all over their advertising banners to create the illusion that their bad reputation is no more.

This absolutely could not be further from the truth. Throughout my time here the upper management did not once change, and as the gambling industry continues to grow organically I suspect the overall management strategy will never change.

So why did I stay for so long? I was foolish enough to think that over time the working environment would improve. Every year they promised that if I continued working hard I would be in for a major promotion. Of course this never happened, and having being chained to a lengthy 3 month leaving notice period I struggled for a long time to find alternative employment.

Here are just a few of the things I experienced on a day-to-day basis:

•	Extremely poor communication across all teams. Emails taking forever to be replied to, with so called “team leaders” never chasing anything up for you until it became urgent to them personally. They then start blaming you for making no progress

•	Extreme office politics and favouritism. If you weren’t “one of the boys” then it was almost impossible to gain visibility and recognition from upper management. Many skilled individuals were continuously passed over for promotion because they didn’t share an interest in their bosses favourite hobbies

•	Extremely dull and boring office environment. Nobody was ever smiling, you’d be lucky if anyone even wished you good morning

•	Team leaders taking all the credit on the rare occasions that tasks did go well. They definitely didn’t inspire, and actively encouraged a blame culture

•	Was frequently asked to work more hours than mandated, all unpaid. I suffered verbal abuse if I refused or when I admitted to having made mistakes

•	Work load was always shared unfairly between colleagues. The more interesting work always went to management favourites so I was never given much of an opportunity to learn new skills

•	The HR department is not at all neutral and always sides with the management. I felt heavily discriminated against

•	Heavily male dominated environment. Insults in the way of banter, that type of thing. Because of this females are greatly pedestalised and can do nothing wrong.

•	A mad rush to get parked in the mornings. Coming in early to avoid the traffic resulted in management telling me that I couldn’t leave until after 5pm no matter what."

341,Bet365,Disappointing company culture and management,2020-05-08,2.0,Junior Software Developer,Free drinks and relatively cheap lunch canteen,"Experience of this company seems to vary depending on location and department, but for me overall I wasn’t impressed.

As a junior developer it felt that I was just being used as a resource to perform tasks none of the other members of staff wanted to do. More naive junior colleagues may not realise they are being used like this. 

I learned quite a lot at first but after a few months tasks became repetitive and I wasn’t really learning anything more useful. The codebase is also very outdated in terms of design patterns and coding languages in most places.

While fellow colleagues can be friendly, I felt there was a strong backstabbing culture, as if it was every man for himself. Over time I also lost respect for my team leader, as it became obvious that he was only in that role from being friends with upper management rather than his actual skillset, and from what I've heard this seems to be the case across all departments. I don't think my department manager even bothered learning my name.

Security was also very OTT with strict break times. No other company I've known operates like this, it just feels like they don't trust their employees.

Overall I don’t regret working here as it provided me with a stepping stone to better things. However in hindsight a lot of the things the recruiters originally promised were just blatant lies. I regret not leaving sooner, instead of allowing myself to just be used for basic mundane tasks."

Reasonably high quality and well priced meals available in the restaurant
Free Costa coffee whilst on shift
12 weeks free rent in a company house when relocating to Stoke for the role","Barbaric and antiquated practises regarding taking breaks during your shift, you would be required to dial in and out of your phone every time you left your desk to get a drink or go to the toilet. If you then went over your allocated 10 minutes for the day this information would then be flagged and sent to the whole of your team by the supervisor…I wish I was joking.

Linking in with the previous point it was openly stated during training and whilst I was in the team that sickness wouldn’t be tolerated. I took a day sick and was told if I had 3 separate illnesses whilst I was on the graduate scheme I would be taken off.

The shift pattern allowed no time for a social life or any sort of life outside of work due to the bulk of your hours being on evenings and weekends. You would work 3 weekends out of 4 and generally all bank holidays other than Christmas Day which even some grads had to work. 

If you ever wanted a day off it would need to be submitted weeks in advance to the rota team and then be authorised by your supervisor and manager resulting in people not bothering to book time off and just getting days leave allocated to them at the end of Feb/March each year.

Zero flexibility with your shifts the notion of ever leaving 5 minutes early for whatever reason simply wasn’t an option, you could potentially get stuck on a call/live chat at the end of your shift and finish 30 minutes late or even longer.


Phones were banned from the office completely yet managers and supervisors swanned around the office all day long taking personal calls right in your face as if to say I’m better/more senior than you, linked to this was that graduates had to wear suits whereas everyone else other than managers wore casual attire which made us stick out and created division. 

When I first joined I wondered why the toilets always seemed to be locked, especially as the food which I had was actually the best thing about the place, they were always full of grown men using their 10 minute comfort breaks to check their phones during shifts…

 Ultimately the ‘Graduate Scheme’ is a fast track call centre manager role and has nothing whatsoever to do with sports betting you just happen to be working for a sports betting company. You do 6 months as an adviser, then 6 months as a team leader then you’re a supervisor, that’s it. If the recruitment team would have explained that then there would be no way in a million years I would have taken the job and the last people you would want in the role would be free critically thinking graduates as you’ll just be beaten over the head with a proverbial stick and made to conform until you are institutionalised into a bet365 subordinate stooge."

378,Bet365,Working for this company has destroyed my career,2019-09-28,1.0,Software Developer,I was offered a competitive salary,"I joined this company because I thought it would provide challenging and rewarding work, along with the promises of frequent reviews and the evidence that other people had achieved fast career progression within the Manchester based office. 

Two years later I am still in the same role, doing mundane, glorified support work on a very legacy codebase. My team leader is extremely arrogant and naive. He has no interest in helping to develop the people within his team, only delivering work as fast as possible by putting pressure on everyone to cut corners.

So called senior developers have little desire to educate others. It's as if they are only in those roles because their face fits. Often they are encouraging implementations of anti-patterns to get work released as fast as possible, in order to keep the team leader happy.

My development manager is hardly ever available, and when concerns are raised they are just dismissed under BAU issues. No interest in changing the process. Most of the office is very youthful and laddy. I can see how you can do well here if you are good at politics, or are female. 

It's a shame, because the company clearly does embrace modern technologies in some areas, but only a handful of small development teams are exposed to these. I'd imagine these are the few developers that have written positive reviews amongst the hundreds of negatives.

I find it hard to believe anyone truly enjoys working here. My day to day experience is so overwhelmingly negative to a point where I now dread coming into work. The problem is because I have not been given the experience of the more modern technologies I can't learn the skills to move into another role. So therefore I am trapped, and any other role working on the same legacy technologies will see myself take a drop in salary.

So don't fall into the trap I did. Don't be fooled by all their fake success stories. It's definitely all just smoke and mirrors."

389,Bet365,Good atmosphere but a lot to improve,2019-07-19,3.0,International Content Advisor,"Most of the Support team members and Supervisors are easy to talk to and make an effort to understand issues from the translators' viewpoint

The various language teams are happy to help each other, and are very sociable.

Good salary.","Communication is not always good, there's been great improvement, but whatever comes from ""senior management/high up"" even when unreasonable is never (or very rarely) challenged.

Flexible working requests difficult to get approved. 

Benefits are not the same for all the people with the same job title, nor within the company."
