Had good challenges to solve.,Some people are there for politics only. They don't contribute in BlackRock Growth rather surviving because they have known persons sitting at higher positions in India office. Surprisingly they are also growing in BlackRock.  They create environment in a such a way that people who work hard leave the company eventually.
53,BlackRock,Poor HR team and very low payscale,2022-04-30,2.0,Associate Software Engineer,"- Product based 
- Finance domain","One of the worst team of HR you will see. 
Too low pay-scale as per market standard. When other (even service based companies) will offer 25 LPA, BlackRock offers hardly 20 LPA. All they keep on saying is that ""BlackRock is a brand"" and then their CTC is basically based on this single line. They will offer almost 30-40% less from the market standards and tell you that BlackRock is a big brand so you should choose wisely n all. 

Also to be noted, once they send you the CTC over mail, you have hardly 24 hours to decide whether you want to join the company or not and they will really force you and pressurise you to such extent that you wont have chance or time to think and decide whether you should be joining this company or look for other better options out there (there are plenty of better companies trust me)

Apart from this, when you receive the CTC over email, even if you try to do negotiation with/without holding any other counter offer, HR will start behaving rudely with you and your offer will most probably be revoked. Yes, that's true and it happened with me twice. In fact, as soon as you tell them about negotiating the offer, they will start deactivating your candidate account from their workday platform behind the scenes and you wont have any idea whats going on. They will just assume that you wont join the company. Ridiculous and worst HR and hiring team I must say.

Shame in the name of a big product based organization. Better look for much better options like Goldman, Morgan Stanley etc."

56,BlackRock,Best Company Ever!,2022-04-29,5.0,Administrative Assistant,"I’m sure it depends on your group, but I had an amazing experience working here. From the outside looking in it can be daunting to be surrounded by so many smart, driven and ambitious people. BlackRock expects high performers and will only recruit top talent. However, everyone that I’ve been fortunate enough to meet and interact with have been nothing short of kind, supportive and helpful. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work here and will the team that I worked with. I would easily come back to the organization for the right opportunity.

BLK really emphasizes the employee experience and I felt that the benefits and total rewards were great, it’s a really collaborative environment, most people you interact with are kind but bold and driven, they strive for excellence and push you to succeed",I left the organization to move into another function outside of administration. I think having a helpful metric for admins to meet and strive for would be helpful if the employee shows an aptitude for another area of the business. It’s disheartening to find that there isn’t a professional track outside of administration the same way there is for other areas of the business. This isn’t a unique problem to BlackRock either.
