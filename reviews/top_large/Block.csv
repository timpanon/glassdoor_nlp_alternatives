Also, the product is fantastic and I actually felt like I had something truly valuable to offer to customers","Pay is below standard for the same role at different companies (made up for with culture and benefits). Also, there have been some growing pains for the sales organization this past year as the org scales."
4,Block,"Decent, but not for me",2022-04-04,4.0,Senior Business Development Representative,"Decent compensation, insurance, and benefits 
Amazon gift card compensation as rewards on a weekly and monthly basis","Scaling quickly from a start up to a more corporate mindset, a little chaotic organizationally at times in the sales dept.
When you first get on they tell you, ""do well in this role, and you can move anywhere in the company you'd like..."" Truly, they want you to stay in sales, wish they would've said that."
5,Block,Avoid PIE and ML Platforms,2022-04-02,1.0,Machine Learning Engineer,"Some nice people trying to move the needle. Good company overall goal.

If you don't know anything about ML and want to be an ML engineer, they will hire just about anybody and give them a Sr ML Engineer title. Got a physics degree, you are a shoe in. Economics degree and one year at a ""AI startup"", you'll be leading ML projects and a Lead Software engineer.","Toxic middle management. No real experience in ML, but leading projects just because they've been at Square a long time (probably because no one else will hire them). Management is political, will promise new features or lie just to put up roadblocks against other more qualified teams that can deliver.

The tech stack is an all inhouse nightmare, let's built it all ourselves mess. It's a bunch of engineers whose first answer to every question is , ""let's build something new"" or maybe if you are lucky they are like, ""let's buy something new and then package a bunch of our own tech around it and call it a new project"". Many of the projects are on the 4/5th iteration of just the same old tired nonsense so somebody new can be a DRI.

Instead of, you know, just using open source tools and ML frameworks that ALREADY do what is needed. But there's no promotion or bonuses in making the right decisions in PIE.

Maybe other parts of the company are better, but the PIE (ML Platform group) is career suicide."

49,Block,"Culture of Nepotism, Alcoholics, and Cliques",2022-02-09,1.0,Software Engineer,I met some great coworkers here.,"Compared to their peers, Block pays below average. Their refreshers are roughly around 5-15% instead of the standard 25% of your initial offer. I know people who got $6k/yr grant as a refresher vs the expected $20k+/yr grant as a refresher (for their respective level).

Block's culture is rampant with alcoholism and cliques. When we were still in the office, they had a weekly meeting on the rooftop where all the ""old guard"" (actually what they called themselves) would grab a beer and drink. They were all white males and not very inclusive of others. Managers were also especially bad about this - they would regularly skip meetings with people to go out to the Market for a beer run and drink with one another during company hours. 

Register and Cash are fighting with one another internally - Cash keeps cannibalizing the rest of Block by literally poaching other Block employees (sometimes to the point of starting the poaching right after someone joins Block).

The company also has a history of rewarding Nepotism. People who have tenure or have special connections continue to be rewarded despite not delivering results. Managers are able to make up metrics and lie about their directs. They also don't undergo training and several managers contribute to an abusive culture. HR isn't there to help you - they will only cover for the manager."

53,Block,On a Downward Spiral,2022-02-03,2.0,Team Lead,"Very smart people from all different industries. Mostly everyone is willing to help or point you in the right direction.

Senior leadership is generally very understanding of mental health, taking time off, and offering resources to help support you. However, YMMV depending on your manager.

The ability to wear multiple hats and learn quickly in different areas, even if it is beyond your expertise.","Lower compensation than other tech companies. Lower base, no cash bonuses, stock that used to be high-growth, but has been on a downward spiral since the second half of 2021.

Obsession with BTC/crypto/blockchain. They are putting all their eggs in this basket and every decision is meant to push the company further in this direction. People might be thinking they are joining a global fintech leader, and instead are going to a company who's stock price follows the same volatility as bitcoin.

Burnout is real. When certain leaders of organizations don't care whether you stay or quit, how you are doing, whether you live or die, it sounds like lip service from the top pretending to care about mental health. You will be forced to put slack on your personal phone, and they will contact you during weekends, holidays, pto, etc. for fake fires 365 days a year.

Speaking of these ""leaders,"" some of them pretend to care but they clearly don't. Jack and core will talk about and offer support during Black Lives Matter protests, or Stop Asian Hate, or the Capitol Riots, but there are other sociopaths at the company who really don't care. Cash App was plastered all over the ring during Logan Paul vs. Floyd Mayweather. When people brought up domestic violence against women, they made it clear that is their customer base they are targeting and they really don't care what you think.

There's a mixture of new and pleasant technology, and old legacy stuff that has to continue to be supported. This would not be so bad, except there is a surprising amount of resistance if you decide not to build *new* things with the old legacy technology.

""Software architecture"" isn't a priority for Block's microservices - so while everything works and individual services have unit tests, creating usable APIs for cross-team boundaries is usually an afterthought that makes it a pain to ever make new connections."

I can only speak for CS (customer success), since I've been there for a while. There's really no room for upward mobility in CS. Leadership tries their hardest to come up with arbitrary ways to create some sort of ""ladder"" for employees to climb, when you're not really given any room for improvement, or any roles to move into."

VHI, Dental, pension, above average pay though not market leading. Loads of progression opportunities (though these have very little increase in pay) Can chose to WFH, hybrid or office full time forever. The calls are easier to handle than a lot of other call centers.","The atmosphere is changing in the team. Till recently it was a team of 6 soon it will be 20 with 2 team leads. The close atmosphere has been lost and rules are becoming more strict. No sick pay of any kind, 20 days PTO a year. They advertise as a benefit unlimited PTO but the contract says 20 which is below industry norm. You can ask for more days but you have to have a very good reason and get manager approval. So unlimited PTO benefit isn't really true. It's a call center job. They try to dress it up as more but that what it is. The calls are with businesses so they are normally professional to deal with but can have complex quires. Expectations are very high in terms of professionalism and passing QAs is hard. There's software telling you when you can take your lunch and breaks etc that must be followed. You can get in trouble for not taking breaks etc at the right time. The managers have also out sourced a lot of their work to tendered advocates so they don't provide any support for calls or take escalations. They also don't do QAs. For most part it works, but it feels like they are removed from us and working remotely you really only see your manager once in a 1:1 every 2 weeks. There's a dived in office.

I come from the hospitality industry. If anyone had warned me that I’d be taking non-stop calls for 7+ hours with hardly any downtime between calls, I wouldn’t have taken this job. They’ve since updated the job description to say “expect to spend 90% of your day taking calls.” I wish it had said that when I applied. Expect to have mostly angry (rightfully so) callers with very little manager support. I have empathy for days, but wow this gets exhausting. If you’re not taking calls then you’re out of “adherence.” So say good bye to having a minute to breathe after an irate customer screams in your ear before the next calls comes in. I had a month of training which honestly wasn’t enough before they had me taking live calls. Finding a straight answer is basically impossible. One person says one thing, the other says another thing. It’s very hard to help callers when I can’t even track down the most accurate information. You have to go one place for an answer, then to another, then to another. All while having to put someone on hold just to track it down. Every thing I do is tracked and monitored. I have to publicly say when I’m going to the restroom so that I don’t get a message asking where I’ve gone. You’re scheduled an hour lunch (usually cut to half hour) and two 15 minute breaks. You’ll probably get a call that will make you miss your breaks and you don’t get to take them. If a call goes into your lunch, your supposed to take your lunch as soon as you can. But again, then you’re out of adherence. They preach time management skills, but it’s so hard when the calls never stop. Don’t get too comfy with your lead/manager, because there’s a good chance that you’ll be reassigned several times. This makes it very hard to establish a relationship with my lead because it’s constantly changing. Yes, your calls are monitored and recorded for quality assurance. Expect to have to listen to those calls with your lead for “personal growth.” There was a few days where work force management started publicly outing people for being out of adherence. Imagine hundreds of people being put on blast for the whole company to see. It was disheartening and embarrassing to witness. Now people update everytime they have to change a diaper, puke, or any other human thing. Expect to have bigots and racist callers, but you have to help them as long as they aren’t verbally attacking you as a person. Right after training I had over 400 emails in my work inbox. It’s expected that you go through these emails for pertinent information. It’s impossible to do this with zero downtime. Expect to be in a constantly changing environment, rules/regulations change every day and nothing is stable. You will be learning something new everyday. That sounds reasonable until it’s too much to keep up with. I’ve never been burnt out from a job this quickly. I had such high expectations and I keep trying to convince myself that things are going to get better. But they haven’t and it’s doubtful that they will. Please whoever responds to this, don’t tell me to talk with my lead. I doubt they care and there’s a good chance I’ll have a new lead anyway."

-A large population of Senior AEs have been in the org a year+and haven’t touched quota once. There has been a lack of direction and overall efficiency for awhile in onboarding as well as making this role more manageable in terms of work/life balance.
-Several sales managers are focused on inputs/talk time/daily activities and micromanaging those aspects, but as of now seem to have little control in shaping reps success based on rising quota expectations.
-This is an outbound SMB sales team compared to most B2B sales orgs, even if you are a mid to upmarket AE. You will be handholding a lot of merchants to the finish line and playing a heavy tech support role as well. 
-Pay is average to below average for the work you put in to hit your number, a lot of people are here for the brand name and stock.

A lot of your experience there can depend on luck regarding who you get as your manager. Sadly there are a number of external hire management that don’t know the role and can’t help teach you, so you rely on overstressed teammates and mentors. The metrics are way too high and you’re expected to know a lot for the role in a short amount of time. Upper management seems lovely and savvy but are tone deaf to the struggles (or just don’t care) and continue to make the role harder. Training is very limited. Quantity, not quality, is what is important. It’s certainly more of a corporate environment than I ever expected. Oh, and you’re often too scared to take your “unlimited” time off."

191,Block,Horrific,2021-06-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working Remote forever
Quarterly Equity Payments - after 1st year","Dysfunctional Leadership
Disconnected Executives

Giving Executive Assistants leadership roles over other executive assistants, so execs don't have to deal with their admins, is a dysfunctional system. 
Not every EA is a leader and not every EA is capable of being an objective leader over their contemporaries. When its revealed that ""leadership"" EA's have meetings and complain, gossip and backstab their ""EA teams,"" the myth of teamwork and trust evaporates. 
And good luck being added to a team that will allow you to flourish. The metric these ""EA leads`' use to designate which team you will be added to is non existent. So your success is anyone's best guess. 
They indoctrinate you with the mantra that everyone is a team member and that you're all there to support each other. But don't be surprised when you find out the co-worker you asked for support, and who seemed more than willing to assist, also complained to your manager that you disturbed their workday. 
In an environment that teaches you to lean on your ""team,"" you really need to figure everything out yourself after your first week or so. 
If you're an executive assistant that prefers to build bonds with your executives, this might not be the work place for you. That relationship is usurped by the company's desire for you to report into the EA selected as your manager. And as I said, some EA's lack the skills necessary to be leaders. But they're great at collecting the bigger pay check. :)"

They provide us with endless benefits for physical, mental and financial health.",I cannot think of one.
194,Block,CashApp,2021-05-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"I work for CashApp Engineeering within Square so can only speak for CashApp (which has a separate office to Square's in Melbourne).
* Great remote-friendly culture though there are some things everyone is still figuring out (atleast I feel CashApp is better than few other companies I worked for in this aspect by doing more async comms etc)
* Competent Engineering leadership - we don't have non-engineering managers leading teams or being engineering directors/senior leads who are very empathetic to real engineering issues and don't come with arbitrary deadlines or unnecessary pressures
* Real autonomy to engineers. I've heard about it in almost all my previous places - but I didn't really know how it feels to be autonomous until I started here. Teams are only assigned a problem space / very high level and we solve it in the best way we want. No micromanagement or process overhead.
* Work-life balance friendly! I can't speak for SF or other CashApp offices here - but the Melbourne (or AU generally speaking) is very much nailing this (or atleast trying best to). Don't have people staying late and working late so there is no pressure on anyone else indirectly either.
* Good compensation / stocks
* Working on very interesting stuff all the time due to the trajectory growth.","* Fast paced environment (good and bad thing I guess - so change is the only constant - reorgs, people movements, industry opportunities etc etc) - perhaps a good problem to have?
* Whilst it's remote friendly, like I mentioned there are a lot of things still being figured out. The communities / guilds are not very active and kinda becoming just day to day work stuff. This would be a challenge for the org to re-energize such culture given Square has announced 100% remote even post-COVID and we already have hires from various parts of AU (combination of growing pains and 100% remote situation)
* Not very diverse when it comes to senior management positions. Although the most diverse team when it comes to junior to mid engineers. Good thing there is acknowledgement of this issue but still work to be done by supporting women/LGBTQ members/person with some disability but fully able to work etc"

For the most part, the benefits are Great! High pay at every position but you will pay a price for this. Cash App advertises unlimited paid time off which was changed to a ""flexible"" Paid Time Off policy requiring manager approval. This often results in no Paid Time Off.","I can't speak for Square Inc as a whole, though its Cash App business is hamstrung by exploitive practices, incompetent managers, and inconsistent policies. For example, you may be asked to do a task without training, then when you ask questions, they act as if they had trained you. This is frustrating and makes for a terrible experience. Upper management throws money at HR issues rather than working to understand the challenges to make meaningful change. 

Often senior management resorts to firing multiple staff who violate policies without adequate training. To make matters worse policies change weekly with little to no notice. Turn over is very high and their solution is mass hiring to replace those they cut. Management pats themselves on the back for hiring diversity. The truth is there is no one of color in upper management positions. To make matters worse they don't check references or perform due diligence in their hiring. All that's required is a minimum required background check."

349,Block,Great culture; great mission; interesting work,2020-08-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Can't speak for other offices, but pay in Atlanta is top-of-market.

Flexible culture. Work from home is going to be allowed permanently, even after the whole COVID situation is over. Flexible PTO. Extensive parental leave.

Good balance in engineering culture between shipping features and paying down tech debt. I think this is an overlooked variable at many companies. At Square my experience is that careful consideration is paid to the decision between moving quickly to deliver vs taking time to go back and clean up old messes.

Upward mobility. If you come in as a junior engineer, you don't have to look for another job after 2 years to find more responsibilities and commensurate compensation increase. Evaluation for promotion is built-in to the system, and pay increases for promo are considerable, not just token raises.

Worthwhile mission. Square is a company that actually takes its mission of ""economic empowerment"" seriously. It's not just a payments company or a POS company. It's a company that works hard to deliver the products that small businesses need.

Interesting work. Whatever you're interested in, Square is probably doing it. Nitty-gritty payments code, ML, cryptocurrency, front-end design and engineering, etc.

Room for growth as a company. There's still lots of uncaptured opportunity out there for Square, and the business is actively seeking it out.","Promotion process is kind of drawn-out and opaque. You work with your manager to put together a promo packet, but then don't hear anything back for at least several weeks.

Company culture is fairly homogenous politically. Some people are outspoken about their political beliefs, but it would probably be somewhat uncomfortable for someone who isn't at least moderately liberal to voice their beliefs.

Not many cons. I plan to be at Square for the long-haul."

Other things to point out:

- Complacent business strategy leads to boring work
- The SF office is very loud due to poor acoustics and tight desk layouts

The benefits, atmosphere, advancement through the company was all easy and wonderful. Each team lead I'd had seemed to care about personal, as well as, professional growth through my time there and really helped me open up and learn new things about myself and how to perform better.","I would say the only con, in my experience, would be HR. They are not very helpful and while may make it seem like they're on your side, there is almost 0 communication from them. The one person I was able to talk to was a 3rd party consultant and wasn't able to give me any information that was relevant to my situation. I was told, on a Thursday, that I should be contacted by the end of the week or possibly beginning of the following week by someone else with more information. Totally unprofessional to keep an employee in the dark for so long considering the main idea of HR is to help employees and to communicate with them."
389,Block,"Not to be dramatic, but Square has radically improved my life",2020-01-26,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- The people. Lovely people to work with who are incredibly helpful. You often hear rhetoric at other companies like ""we're /disrupting/  and changing the world"", but at Square, you'll find that people are more humble about the mission of economic empowerment and people have full lives outside of Square.
- Product ownership is huge here. I feel like I get to weigh in on decisions for product, and innovate on our products with new ideas.
- Engineering excellence. I worked at startups before this, where engineering was haphazard and unfocused. Here you learn how to build incredibly performant, secure products that integrate with a global payments stack
- Career ladder is well defined for software engineers. Clear paths for I.C.s vs management roles and my EM's have all been very receptive to my career goals.
- Perks are amazing. Free lunch and breakfast everyday (I wish we still had free dinner) and lots of other freebies that are icing on the cake when picking a job.
- It's in the best location in S.F., in mid-market. Incredibly close to Hayes Valley, the Mission, Alamo Square, etc.","- Tension between having an ecosystem of products that are all working towards their own goals, while needing to collaborate with other teams where roadmaps were not aligned between teams 
- Company feels less transparent as we get bigger 
- Honestly, I wish we still had the free dinner perk. It made it really easy to not have to cook on a weeknight if I was working late. Buuuut it was overall really great that they cancelled dinner service because I have a better work-life balance leaving work earlier instead of working later to get dinner."

If you do not suck up then you do not get any opportunities. They say they’re transparent but they truly are not. I’ve seen so many people fired, boxed up and thrown out for things they weren’t aware of and it’s a sad situation. 

If you work in higher tier jobs then it’s all politics but women are always paid less. What you bring to the table will not matter if they do not like you.  You could be bright, bubbly, good attitude but if management doesn’t like you then you’re a target. 

The best way to enter this job is at your own discretion. It always starts out good but they pile on the work as they see fit.

Cliques of entitled people is what you need to worry about most. If they have worked at Square longer than 3 years then you should be worried. Those people are apart of the 1% at Square."

As another advocate, I am unaware that what these advocates did wrong was wrong, as it has never in the past been made clear to us that this was wrong. Leadership, who turned a blind eye to alleged ""rule breaking"" is not being held accountable. 

None of us are even sure we have job security. At this point, the only thing that is clear is that though Square claims to be employee focused and to have our backs, it is like every other corporate company out there and views its employees as disposable."

As Square has grown we've needed to adapt and change our interview processes for specialized skill-sets and there's been more support for these kinds of changes than there has been blockers (across engineering and talent). 
High emphasis on work life balance and a culture within the talent org of trying new things like supporting remote recruiters/managers.","As we've grown so rapidly, there's definitely a lot of things that are being done reactively and so there's a bit of pain in dealing with broken things as they are getting fixed. ie how often our comp bands get updated (this is gotten better!)"

- Great paternity / maternity leave program. 4 paid months off! 

- Super transparent company culture. Every other Friday we have a company wide meeting (with different fine wine and appetizer pairings), where different groups discuss what they’re working on, where Jack Dorsey himself engages with his Squares, and listens to us voice our grievances, whether professional or personal opinions, (and he does so with great compassion and concern for all). 

- Awesome CEO that genuinely cares about every single person that works for him. He’s created a very welcoming and inclusive culture.

-Great company events aimed at creating a great, connected culture within the company ! Outrageous company picnic called square games with open bar and hilarious inflatable games and activities and not to mention all the good food! Great events for our merchants.. awesome holiday party.. and even just the random celebrations. Like Squares birthday.. and others.

- Difficult to support other products of Square when they don't have a customer facing team/direct transfer for incoming calls. I.e. Employee Management, Capital, Cash. Supporters are expected to have knowledge of multiple product areas so it does get difficult when there's new features/bugs in the platform/product requests/etc. since there's no clear escalation path in place
- The nature of support is 24/7. You are meant to serve the customers and with that in mind, expect to work holidays. When other employees get a week in between Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, you're more than likely working. Though you get to work from home, it's unfortunate having to be locked up in a room taking calls while the rest of your family enjoys the holiday.
- Growing pains = culture is difficult to maintain with rapid growth
- Little diversity in the certain product areas and it does get cliquey."

Many project managers have never managed anything and give engineers nothing useful to work with.
 With nearly all operation staff on contract half of your time on call is spent dealing with information they put into the system wrong.
The only people who stay long enough to have any understanding of how stuff works are on work visas or 22-year-olds read on the interned with Sqare. No one else lasts more than a year. This makes things like tax season absolute chaos as no one has seen it before and there is no documentation.
  Salary  stock and 401(k) matching are far below market.

-Your work will not feel valued. Management gives lip-service indicating they value it, but unwilling to actually show it in any meaningful way. Frequent reminders that you are replaceable. There is a constant cycle of people leaving after a year or two because they feel undervalued and stuck, then being replaced by a new batch of people who have to be trained up all over again.
-Over-emphasis on metrics and numbers by management leads to a team that is under-trained and pushed way too hard.
-Leads both manage people and do project work- good in theory, but in reality each is only good at one or the other. Some leads just do not have the temperament to manage actual human beings and this can be soul crushing.
-Various teams both within Support and outside Support are siloed off and rarely are on the same page. Lack of cross-team operational positions means inter-team communication and collaboration is very poor.
-Trying to move to a new position is so ""hands-off"" that it feels like a complete crapshoot- you're expected to find new roles on your own and just apply, but you have no insight into whether you'd be a good fit. You may end up having to apply to a half a dozen completely unrelated positions before landing something.
-Very slow to create new roles that are needed, instead key duties often distributed among a large group of people who are usually uninterested/uninvested in said work.
-Your role may change so dramatically overnight that it feels like a demotion. Likewise, you may be asked to interview for a role you've already been doing for a long period of time.
-Shared resources and tools have no ownership, so once whoever created the tool or resource leaves it gets no attention and eventually falls apart.
-Upper management is very tone-deaf and completely very disconnected from work that customer facing teams are doing.
-Management very bad at taking feedback- your feedback for leads is often turned around into a criticism of yourself. Frequent response you will here in response to feedback given to management is ""maybe this isn't the place for you"".
-Decisions are made by people who are not involved in work being done without consulting people who ARE doing the work."

612,Block,Great company to grow at!,2017-01-18,5.0,Business Operations Manager,"Square is an amazing place to learn and grow. The speed of change sparks affords new opportunities on a very regular basis. Even as the company has grown and gone public, the culture is still very horizontal and executives and higher level managers are still very approachable and open to new ideas. Perks are great - flexible vacation policy, good food in the office, plenty of snacks, coffee bar, and a beautiful office. 

The CEO has strong morale convictions and this clearly guides his leadership. It's very refreshing to have someone this authentic heading the company who speaks their actual opinion about social issues. Even when I don't agree with him, it's nice to know it's actually his opinion (opposed to something his legal team drafted up).","A lot of these issues have been fixed, but due to the rapid growth there are still some systems issues and managers that are in over their heads. Most of these Managers have been replaced (or moved to a more appropriate level), but some remain in higher level positions who lack the necessary experience in critical areas which is still causing some pain. The HR team is understaffed so they are not in a position to offer much support, but this is currently being addressed. 

The CEO's political beliefs create a somewhat insular environment, though I'm sure most tech companies are like this. It would be a challenging place for someone with conservative political views to work at."
613,Block,"Great engineers, like family, and growing.",2017-01-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"This review is focused primarily on the ATL office. 

I'm one of a handful of engineers that left Google together over four years ago to create a new office in ATL for Square. We've strived hard to maintain the same close-knit environment we started with, even as we've delivered many major contributions, grown 5x, and added several more teams.

- Our compensation is competitive. 
- We have many smart engineers, ranging from PhDs in CS to pedigrees at Amazon and Google.
- We have a friendly, collaborative atmosphere.
- Square continues to retain its startup feel, and it's much easier to have an outsized impact compared to larger companies like Google.

Don't be fooled by my four star ratings. I almost never rate anything perfect.","Square continues to grow, which is awesome, but it means there are growing pains. For example, some time ago, the company revamped its engineering ladder to be more consistent and prescriptive about career paths.

Required engineers to be on-call, at least on my team, but did not properly compensate. I have never worked anywhere that required engineers to be on-call unless it was shortly after a launch maybe they would be expected to fix their code if it failed catastrophically but not like this.

Has only 1/2 a CEO.

In an extremely low margin competitive business with no solid plan for turning a profit.  it’s the worst kept secret of both Square and Twitter, everyone seems to know it except him and the respective boards. Jack needs to try with one or he will fail with both in my opinion."

- Beautiful office and amazing food.","- Horrible management.  I saw managers throw their direct reports under the bus and then those same managers got promoted.  I saw managers refuse to give direct reports feedback.  My career development stagnated at Square because my manager was ill-equipped to provide any sort of guidance in this area.

- Inability to prioritize.  Focus would be given to shiny projects over projects that would actually add value to the company.  Some managers thought it was appropriate to have 10 P0 priority projects running for a single employee at one time.  

- The most political work environment I've been a part of.  If you don't cheerlead for yourself here, like other employees are doing for the most mundane of projects they complete, you won't get noticed.  Combine that with the fact that you would likely not have a manager who is skilled enough to be an advocate for you and it creates an environment that is frustrating for employees who aren't politically savvy.  

- The stress of all the above created a lot of tension in the work environment.  I experienced other employees being verbally abusive to me."

Very little room for advancement and recent available promotions were not posted anywhere (we found out spots were open when being told who the new leads are).  

Recent shake up of the schedule, and plans to do so every six months, means this is no longer a stable work environment.  If you don't mind having your schedule changed without regard of extracurricular needs (such as family, volunteer work, etc) this won't be a factor for you.

Also there really isn't a lot of transparency in regards to upward mobility. Tons of possibilities are discussed but the odds of moving up are pretty slim, especially in a supporting role. The work for a supporter as to be expected is highly repetitive and can wear you down pretty quickly.

631,Block,Seemed good as long as you're not in Support,2016-11-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Square is very perk-oriented. The company has a great energy about it, with leaders always sporting positive attitudes. It is a very casual environment where employees can relax (until they begin work).","The positive attitude didn't have much (if any) substance behind it, and that especially goes for Support. The brunt of the company's changes were placed on the Support team, with very little information or assistance in even the biggest company changes. It is very much a chained-to-your-desk environment, where even a longer trip to the restroom is heavily questioned. Unlimited PTO becomes less of a perk and more of an onus when leaders speak critically toward employees wanting a vacation.

Things move very quickly there, and not always in a good way. The Support team is expected to balance dozens of products with hundreds of features and is pulled in conflicting directions: keep someone on the phone while you investigate a messy issue, but don't let your call run long; we don't have a script, but we do have a very strict template of what you should be saying. Support employees have very little control over their situations, their days, and their growth within the company.

Arguably the worst part was that it was not like this at the beginning of my time at the company, but the leadership placed an emphasis only on quantifiable data rather than on our customers — a bad sign for a company claiming to be all about its users.

This is a company I had expected to stay with for a number of years, but I left as soon as I saw the direction it was heading."

725,Block,Great place to work,2016-05-31,5.0,Director,"Square is a company that strives to maintain transparency despite being public. Square has a mission that is noble and clear, but also tangible. Our leaders are stellar across the board. Square is doing things right. Anyone that has spent time at a larger company would marvel at how gracefully Square has made the transition to being as big as it is. We're moving fast, doing what feel like the right things, and have not compromised the core beliefs the company started on. The ability to work without a rule book or a guide is a must for a Square employee. The culture rewards risk-taking and thinking outside the proverbial box.","First of all, take with a grain of salt some of the reviews on here that use words like ""bureaucracy"". The people writing those words have clearly never seen a larger company operate. Square feels half the size it is.

730,Block,Awesome company,2016-05-01,5.0,Customer Support Representative,"There are many things to love about working at Square - the free food, drinks, unlimited PTO, etc but the best thing for me is the ability to move around the company to work in an area that interests you the most.  Everyone is very open to meeting and there isn't really a sense of hierarchy within the company.

731,Block,Toxic company politics,2016-04-22,2.0,Software Engineer,"Food is pretty good. There are definitely some very talented engineers. In several ways, engineering practices are top notch. Work/life balance is good.","Office politics are extremely pervasive in Square. I've known coworkers fired over personal disagreements. If you don't drink the kool-aid, you're gone.

Management refuses to admit mistakes. The communications team seems to focus on placating employees, not telling an inspiring narrative to the rest of the world.

Generally, projects move at a glacial pace unless management happens to fancy your project this quarter. The next quarter your headcount could be gone. I saw projects take two years that should have taken 3-6 months.

Compensation is unimpressive. I think there's more of an effort recently to improve it, but for many employees like myself it's too little too late.

For as many great engineers as there are, there are equally as many really poor engineers. Square grew far too quickly, and its talent suffered as a result. In general, engineering makes little investment in the future. Technical debt is extremely high with no plan on how to pay it down."
732,Block,Would Not Recommend,2016-04-13,1.0,Risk Analyst,"- The Perks and Benefits etc: free food, gym, beautiful workplace

This company hugely discriminates! Yes you will see a couple specs of minorities around the building but they either work as a janitor or a contingent worker never anything more. So as far as career opportunities there are none. 

- Square has treated me and my colleagues as if we are invisible. I have no idea who my supervisor is and that is sad.

In that time, I've seen an incredible amount of change, maturing, and growth – and all the while, it's been wonderful to see the company prioritize the things that make it a great place to work – focus on our sellers and economic empowerment, transparency, and collaboration.

The executive team is unparalleled in the valley. Beyond being leaders in their respective fields, they are incredibly accessible, passionate people. And beyond the executive level, I have the good fortune to work with some of the smartest people I've met.","Some room for improvement in work / life balance as the employee population continues to mature, but I see Square thinking about this (4-month maternity / paternity benefit, flexible vacation policy, adoption benefits, etc.)."
739,Block,A Chaotic Mess,2016-03-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Gorgeous office and great benefits including fully paid health, dental, and vision
- Breakfast, lunch, and dinner five days a week
- Incredibly generous vacation policy if you're on your lead's good side
- Most of the company genuinely believes in the mission to enable small and mid-sized businesses to succeed and grow
- Numerous showcases for Square merchants and high-profile speakers who regularly stop by to share their stories
- The security and kitchen staff are incredibly down to earth which is refreshing in this industry","- Absurdly unnecessary “perks” that bloat operating expenses. $40 designer plates, a made to order smoothie bar AND separate coffee bar, full Wise Sons deli, and robots you can remotely drive around the office with your face plastered up on a screen in google hangouts weirding everyone out. They also recently brought in a full mariachi band to parade around the office as well as a cotton candy station and magician. All completely necessary when you’re on track to lose north of $80 million in one quarter (this is public information).

- The amount of tech entitlement in San Francisco that you’ve heard about is alive and well here. There was a ridiculous debate concerning the cafeteria's pre-planned closures two days out of the month. Some argued that it was completely unacceptable because 30 minutes spent to go out and get lunch was 30 minutes lost with family or productivity. Ever heard of packing a lunch the night before? How about ordering from the food delivery service your company just acquired for 90 million dollars? 

- The company is extremely divided and headed in a million different directions but doesn’t seem to care that it's affecting its bottom line and employee morale. Payments? Register? Capital? Cash? Caviar? Invoices? Appointments? Payroll? Employee Management? Marketing? Remember Wallet and Order? Ask any of your friends or family what Square does and they’ll say, ""Um that credit card dongle thing right?"" Yet everyone has convinced themselves that we’re known for “more than just our reader."" The epitome of biting off more than you can chew.

- Massive attrition. Don’t be surprised to see scores of paperwork and candidates spilling out of the interview rooms. It’s almost a guarantee that the position you’ve applied for was recently vacated and needs to be filled immediately, resulting in a rushed interview process that devalues candidates. But of course they won’t tell you that. If you do interview in person, you can judge the sense of panic for yourself.

- Combine all of this with extremely poor compensation relative to industry standards, atrocious middle management, limited growth opportunities, and a “culture” that seems more like a freshman high school mixer, you can clearly see why they’re struggling to mitigate the massive amount of turnover in all departments.

And while you’re at it, google “Square IPO ratchet” and see who’s really benefiting from the ill-timed IPO.

Square says its mission is to empower its sellers, yet it has mightily failed to empower its own employees."

-Some very smart and talented people
-Big comfy office with lots of space
-The core products are still very strong and growing very fast
-Works hard on diversity and other ethical challenges","-People are added to the middle pretty consistently.  That is, it's becoming more and more likely to see your role effectively demoted because they decide to add a level of management between you and your boss, or boss's boss, etc.
-Decisions are now mostly by committee.  In Square's earlier history, decisions were generally made quickly by informed leaders.  Today, processes are much, much slower and the company is becoming less nimble.  
-Burned by the IPO.  Many employees at Square, especially members of our Finance Team, took substantial pay cuts to work for Square -- sometimes in excess of 50% -- under the promise that there would be a big IPO someday and we'd make up that loss in stock.  However, with the substantial cut in Square's valuation, many employees have stock option grants that are entirely in the red.  To make up for these losses, the company issued one time RSU grants to older employees who might have been burned.  My RSU grant was the equivalent of a 7.5% salary bonus, which takes a year to vest and will be taxed as income.   
-The transparency that Square used to treasure is disappearing.  It used to be that there was no product or financial plan that wasn't shared among employees.  Today, a combination of unplanned leaks to the press and the demands of being a public company have ended a lot of that transparency.  
-Out of touch leadership.  Jack is a very inspiring leader and has an excellent understanding of design and usability.   However, his conviction of being a visionary contradicts current market forces. 
-Lack of career mobility.  Square is very proud of its ""go/grow"" and ""go/careers"" programs which purportedly  allow employees to find new roles at the company if they feel they're not developing in their career.  However, very few employees are promoted at Square, particularly on the Finance and Business teams.  
-Apparently Square is perfect?  It's very rare for Square to admit something didn't go well or it made a mistake.  The policy seems to be to just let the problem disappear and hope nobody asks about it.  Products are often launched and then shifted permanently to the back burner.  Metrics post-launch are rarely checked and very few financial resources are oriented towards product launches.
-Dead weight remains.  People who are under-performing or are becoming caustic to the organization are very, very rarely fired and only occasionally mitigated.  On the few occasions someone is fired or mitigated, of the person who replaces them is just as bad, they let that person stay in role indefinitely rather than embarrass themselves twice and have to hire for the role a third time."

Very high quality work is produced by this company. Design is always paramount and on point. Awesome coffee.,"Business practices: Square leverages its name to their advantage and to the disadvantage of everyone else. This is manifested in poor compensation for all people outside of engineering and getting out of paying for recruiting and / or sponsorship privileges for their brand. Contractors are treated as second class citizens and must be willing to work for very little pay. Full time roles are advertised as available but I know for a fact there was never headcount to begin with. All this makes the company seem disingenuous as they are constantly trying to convince people that they're the ""good guys"" in merchant services.

Business health: Cost cutting is apparent throughout the organization (not that this is a bad management style, but it seems to be a signal something more). Sometimes it feels like some people are shoving the proverbial company ""kool-aid"" down people's throats; I think anyone with a discerning eye knows what's going on.

Working environment: The company is large now so there is a lot of red tape and channel conflict. Be prepared to manoeuvre a highly political environment. Your experience largely depends on your team and manager (like every other corporate) and culture is obviously much less cohesive than at smaller companies. Tricky thing is even if you get onto a great team, I guarantee that team will not stay that way long. 

Churn is very high at this company (for many reasons) so don't count on anyone sticking around for very long. 4 months in and you're considered a veteran! Most people come in and realize it's only a stepping stone.

There are lots of intelligent people here; most are not humble. There are also lots of ambitious people here but they're more likely to push you down than help you up.

Other than senior management saying that everyone works hard so deal with it. Square is a young company that grew quickly and still has the start-up mentality of long hours and low compensation due to stock options. The reality is that Square is no longer a start up but is now a mid-size corporation that is still relying on the 'you should be grateful to even work at a company like this' thought on retaining employees. The flat organizational structure in Finance has inhibited growth for senior employees. I have witnessed many new employees get the 'bait and switch' of jobs they have applied for compared to the actual work they are doing. The team is amazing and has some great personalities but it is draining to work with so many people that are so unhappy with their job.
790,Block,Misdirected Talent,2014-12-14,1.0,Software Engineer,"If you're someone who likes to read management or business case studies, Square serves as a terrific example of how not to operate in several key areas: how not to manage projects, how not to manage people and retain great employees, and how not to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive payments landscape. 

The sole area of excellence is the San Francisco office's cafeteria, which is on par with a fine restaurant.","Introduction

Square started with a fantastic product: the iconic Square Reader, which may still be the best designed, most reliable credit card reader device for mobile devices. Unfortunately, like many companies that start small and focused, they lack the managerial focus to become a standout performer.

As my title suggests, the story of Square boils down to this: it's a case study in misdirected talent.

And talent there is: Square boasts some great industry minds (as some of the more benevolent reviews suggest.) However, it is my view and my personal experience that winning product strategies, focused execution, and experienced management can succeed with merely ""good"" talent, while no amount of talent can rescue a company devoid of the other elements. Do they really fall down in those areas? Let's examine each notion in turn:

* Product Strategies: an Uphill Battle *

Virtually all of Square's low-or-no-margin payment businesses (mobile Reader,Square Register, Cash, etc.) face enormous competition from both entrenched competitors and more focused upstarts.  Although it is the opinion of the author that the Reader product is the best in the business, the ugly truth may be (much to the dismay of their meticulous designers) that margins matter more to customers than design, and in this area, they will be driven to the dirt by Amazon and others.

* Inefficient Execution *

It's hard to quantify execution capability. From the perspective of the author, however, I would say that I have seen much more accomplished, by fewer (less talented) people, in less time. The reason this is true is that the rank-and-file engineer at Square has little industry experience, and many managers have no prior experience managing people.  (This is discussed below.)

* Poor Management * 

Past Glassdoor reviews (some of which seem to have disappeared) mentioned chaotic, Twitter-like management, replete with disorienting reorganizations. This is still the case.  While there is significant talent at the senior level, the middle management is rife with inexperienced young people who have never managed others at all, many of whom were promoted due to their perceived engineering ability.

This has led to several situations that would be hilarious if they weren't so sad: Lack of clear ownership of major functionality, huge variability of code quality across teams, borderline-hostile code reviews, poor training, humiliating and unprofessional behavior in meetings, bad technology choices, and so on.

Conclusion

Despite the hype, talent, and early success of the Reader product, and despite the purported sky-high valuation (which makes no sense when compared to industry comps), Square is no longer a horse worth betting on. With a product portfolio consisting of low or no margin businesses, its apparent lack of focus and efficiency, and terrible management all add up to a company whose drawbacks far exceed potential benefits.

Recent college graduates should realize that the company is no longer a start-up; you're joining a medium sized firm that's still struggling to find its way in a sea of competitors.  If you're talented enough, you'd be better off trying for Google or another quality big firm to shore up your skills, and THEN move to a start-up.

The situation is even worse for experienced hires: compensation won't match what a skilled engineer can earn elsewhere, with far less hassle, and more prospects for growth. You're also likely to face a bait-and-switch when it comes to your position and duties, as well as the aforementioned issues with bad management.

At the end of the day, while probably not a sinking ship, Square is idling at port, bobbling listlessly while the smartest rats scurry down the mooring lines for the relative safety of the rotting boards of the dock."

One last thing i wish to highlight is the Food~ Compared with lots of free cafeteria among those bay area companies, Square's food is super good~!","Growth too fast is a pain, even the managers in Square are still learning and growing."
824,Block,"Square will challenge you everyday, and you will love it.",2014-10-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"- The work you do is challenging.  Many times, the work you take on is something no one else has ever tackled.  Whether you deploy a new service or close a new deal, the work that we do here is very rewarding, and many times there is enough visibility within the company where your work will be noticed by many.
- It doesn't matter if you're a new employee, employee number 40, or an intern. Everyone has a chance to make a huge impact, and Square enables employees to do so.
- The majority of co-workers are former Googlers, Facebookers, etc.  They have many experiences and are willing to share their knowledge to anyone at Square.  I can't imagine a better place to sharpen my engineering skills as a new grad in the industry.
- The hiring bar is structured such that most of the people at Square are not only smart, but they are also personable and social.  This makes a great working environment, and the company outings are something to look forward to.
- Benefits are amazing (e.g. unlimited vacation, free meals).","- Deadlines for key projects are sometimes aggressive.

It's an exciting, dynamic place to work with tons of interesting problems to solve. The people are top notch and it's impossible not to learn while working with such talented people across many disciplines. The culture is super open, transparent and collaborative. It's really easy to reach across what would at other companies be barriers to get things done. The food is also amazing, which doesn't hurt!",The fast growth and dynamism can sometimes feel like churn. There's so much going on it's sometimes hard to keep track of all the projects that are being worked on.
827,Block,Even the best rocket ship ever will experience some turbulence... better buckle up because it's worth the ride!,2014-10-14,4.0,Software Engineer,"Everyone has a sense of ownership and is empowered to do what they need to do. Lots of room to change roles, move around, wear as many hats as you want. The stock will almost certainly be worth something. The company has a real purpose and is generally useful/applicable/liked by real people (unlike a lot of other companies you could be working for). Getting time off is as easy as chatting with your manager - typically no questions asked. The food program is amazing with very high-quality comped breakfast/lunch/dinner. Rapid growth translates to continuous learning opportunities and a work environment that never gets boring. As an engineer - the learning opportunities never end!","Any ""cons"" need to be prefaced with this: remember that Square is an extremely rapidly growing company that feels like a whole new workplace every 6 months. I've tried to only list the more consistent or recurring cons here, but all of them are consistently trending positively (or I wouldn't be working here anymore, really!). Any of these cons could be gone in a month or two, or replaced with new ones. There's just no way to know!

That said:
- Immature leadership has been an ongoing theme for my entire tenure. It's been a problem at every level of leadership from executive on down at some point or another. On the other hand - I think this is to be expected of a company this age and size, and is usually course-corrected eventually.
- Immature HR (incl. compensation adjustment and talent review). First iterations of talent review were downright insulting: we were rated by shape (circle, square, or star) like kindergardeners. Luckily we acknowledged that was a horrible idea and have never done it again - but our cadence of performance feedback has remained random at best. Same goes for cadence of compensation adjustment. If you get a job here - NEGOTIATE UP FRONT - there's no telling how many months or years it might be until someone thinks to themselves ""oh maybe we should look at comp again!"". Note: this situation has already improved immensely with the introduction of a consistent engineering ranking/ladder system - if we manage to keep it more than a year, that is.
- Rampant politics and personal agendas. To be expected at any growing company. We have them too. Nothing special to see here, move along.
- Oncall policies. No overtime pay for brutalizing oncall shifts are the norm. No compensation for personal phone use either. Occasionally you'll get a ""thank you"" from someone.
- Not enough bathrooms. Not kidding. Try and find a free stall or urinal sometime after lunch. Good luck!"

Offices are a little sterile, but very nice.  Great benefits and perks (especially if you like coffee, smoothies or free food).  

Transparency is excellent.  It's refreshing to know what our finances look like, what's on the product roadmap and why decisions are made.  It helps promote accountability and gives me the information I need to do my job.

The product leadership is great -- we set ambitious hardware and software goals and generally get things out close to deadline.","Career advancement is a bit difficult.  The company structure is very flat, so if you want to lead a team someday, odds are that's not going to happen.  However, if you have an idea or something you think the company should be doing, you can add it to your role and put together a project team to help you.

The engineers work very hard and are protective of the quality of work and coworkers.

The discussions (on the record and off) are very insightful about everything from payments, engineering and life.

Company meetings and transparency are informative and motivating.",Size of the company can be daunting. There are a lot of people and Square is growing. There are and have been some growing pains caused from scaling a startup into a large company.

Our many many merchants depend on us to help them run and grow their businesses. When our merchants grow, we also grow with them. The incentives are perfectly aligned for us to help them do well. We don't need to sell ads based on their information, and we're not selling acorn points or whatever.

I work with incredibly talented people who have a wide range of experiences. We have a lot of fun at work, but we get our work done. Since Square has such a broad spectrum of engineering work, from hardware, to firmware, to back end services, to security, to infrastructure, to front-end (think Ember/JS/CS), to mobile (Android and iOS), there are so many opportunities to learn and to try new things.","It's taken us awhile to get our product vision/road map in place, but I think we're now in a good place.

All the company metrics a completely open, including how much every product is being used, where our money is going and coming from, etc. which really helps to feel connected to the company and see your impact.

I love being in a challenging environment, and everyone is smart and passionate about our work as a company.

The office is gorgeous, there are tons of perks (massage therapists & chiropractors onsite, coffee bar with baristas, cafeteria with a pizza oven for breakfast/lunch/dinner, etc), and the people are all super friendly & great to work with.

871,Block,Great company to work at!,2014-05-20,4.0,Customer Technical Support,Great place. Lots of young people and lots of energy. I loved working in the startup environment and not feeling restricted in what I could do. You get what you put in.,Before I left things started to feel a little more corporate. They started implementing some company changes that felt a little restricting but that's probably for the best as the company grows.
872,Block,Great company slowly going downhill,2014-05-19,2.0,Engineer,"- Collaborative environment and culture
- Intelligent and creative co-workers 
- On-site baristas, food, mac gear, massages and yoga
- Inspiring and involved CEO","- Highly inexperienced middle management
- Little to no process
- Highly political environment
- Changing culture from one that values design to solely making money"
873,Block,pretty good overall,2014-05-12,4.0,Software Engineer,"Great infrastructure, small teams, very obvious goals.","Kind of weird, directionless management. Not a whole lot of heirarchy but it seems to be more than necessary/effectual."
874,Block,"Fun, challenging and rewarding",2014-05-10,5.0,Software Engineer,"It's great getting to work with a very talented team.  I love learning something new and getting challenged each and every day. The company is incredibly transparent internally, which is really refreshing. I love building products that empower local merchants.  Compared to big tech companies that I've worked at, I feel like Square is a great place where we can win as a team.",Growing fast and having many offices around the world have come with challenges.  The amount of internal communication can be mind boggling if you don't quickly figure out a system for managing it. If you are the kind of person that needs to know exactly what you'll be working on in two month then Square isn't for you.
875,Block,"Smart, passionate, hardworking co-workers",2014-04-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Beautiful office with amazing perks and benefits.
Meaningful work and lots of ownership.
Very smart and passionate people that you get to work with.
Square succeeds when you succeed. This is a company that will listen to what you are passionate about and try to place you in a role where you will perform to at your full potential.","Salaries are not competitive, but the equity is great.
No work life balance, although I don't mind because I am very passionate about my work there."
876,Block,The best company I've worked for,2013-12-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Career development. My role is constantly changing (in a good way!) and I'm always learning and challenged in my work.

Hack Week. Four weeks per year that allow all employees to test and develop ideas, some of which become products (including one of mine :)

Passionate and interesting people. I'm inspired by my coworkers.

Biking to the office. I love working and living in San Francisco.","A year ago, there were gaps in leadership. Most of those have been filled now with amazing leaders like Sarah Friar, Gokul Rajaram and Francoise Brougher joining the team. We're still a young company and over the past three years, I've seen lots of ups and downs. I'm feeling optimistic for the year ahead."
877,Block,Best people I've ever worked with,2013-12-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Number 1: people people people. I've never worked with so many highly intelligent, friendly, curious, and intrinsically motivated people in my life. This, above all, makes going into Square every day exciting, fun, and rewarding.

- Clear mission. It's even carved into a wall in our new office. ""Make commerce easy"" Everyone in the company, from engineering to finance to support knows it, creating this really positive energy and spirit of teamwork like ""we're all in this together.""
- High impact, meaningful work. On the micro scale, it's always so cool when you visit a  business running on Square and see your product being used day-in, day-out. On the macro scale, metrics showing the huge number of businesses using Square every day always awes me.
- Incredible learning opportunities. Every engineer is happy and willing to teach something new. I've learned an insane amount!
- Transparency. Almost nothing is secret inside Square. All our metrics are available to all employees. Notes from every meeting are shared - including board meetings. New strategies and products are shown early and often. A huge amount of trust is placed in each of us to keep these secrets but it's incredibly empowering and can even spark new ideas across the company.
- Challenging the status quo. Square is growing and iterating extremely fast. Old processes are quickly questioned and replaced if they get in the way. Employees are encouraged to ask the senior staff anything they want during our weekly ""Town Hall"" on Fridays.
- Tons of autonomy. Individually, employees have the latitude to work when they want, how they want. Some people get in past 11am & stay later while some work typical 9-5 hours. We have an unlimited vacation policy as well. Engineering teams also have a great deal of autonomy. Each team has full-stack engineers, designers, and product people so they can design, build, and ship their own product.
- Work/Life balance. I usually work around 45 hours a week and am always home for dinner. One engineer even took a whole month vacation recently. There are some who still work insane hours, but managers are actively discouraging it.
- Amazing office & perks. I love having our office downtown instead of traveling far away to some cordoned off campus. It feels like we're really a part of the city. Our restaurant in the building provides us with amazing food, but lots of food trucks and local restaurants are within blocks.
- Hack Week. 4 times a year, the entire company takes the whole week to work on something different. This isn't just for engineers - everyone participates. It brings in a lot of creative energy and has even been the birthplace of some of our products.",Nothing major. Most of the cons people have written about have been addressed in the last year or so. I have no plans to leave anytime soon!  :)
878,Block,The most challenging and satisfying job I've ever had,2013-10-31,5.0,,"Management that truly listens. A culture of constant improvement, with smart and passionate coworkers. Working on a good product at a company that cares about it's customers and community. A dynamic and quickly changing environment. A reasonable work/life balance.

Unlike some reviewers, I find the work life balance totally acceptable, but it does require require some amount of personal responsibility. Decide how much you're willing to work, and then do that. I tend to work 40 hours a week, and take several weeks of vacation a year. I encourage my team to do the same.","Square is still a young company, so it's still figuring out how best to work. There isn't always the same structure you'd expect to find at a more mature company.

We have a high standard of quality for all of our work, which can be both a pro and a con."
879,Block,"Meaningful work and mission, collaborative culture",2013-10-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Our mission and work is meaningful and has a positive impact on the world.
Senior management's integrity and commitment are incontrovertible.
Colleagues are highly intelligent, collaborative, and motivated.
Engineering has a high commitment to quality work.","We've grown quickly, and there have been some growing pains.
The information overload takes some getting used to.
Location in SF makes it hard for South Bay commuters."
