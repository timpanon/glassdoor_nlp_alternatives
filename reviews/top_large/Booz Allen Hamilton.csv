8,Booz Allen Hamilton,Good company but not great,2022-04-04,3.0,Internal Consultant,"- Potential for work-life balance compared to other more prestigious (and more successful) consulting companies
- Decent pay (not great)
- Decent, smart people
- Potential to do interesting work","- Average to below average leadership
- Behind the times in many of its business and human capital management philosophies and practices 
- Very weak/non-existent talent management systems (such as performance assessments, talent development planning, and general career progression)
- Lots of untrained managers who were promoted due to technical expertise and lack the interest, empathy and/or talent to be a people leader
- NO bonus below the Sr Associate level (a level equivalent to Assistant Director)
- A lot of favoritism and bias — leadership is resistant to feedback (though they want to believe they’re open to it) and does not listen very well, unless you’re at a certain level or above"
9,Booz Allen Hamilton,"DoD Consulting, Leadership Varies",2022-04-04,3.0,Associate,"-Less intense than commercial consulting generally
-Inclusive work environment

14,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Good points, but they're trying to remove them",2022-04-03,3.0,Senior Executive Assistant,"Pay and benefits. They rotated during Covid efficiently and effectively. If you have a decent mgr(s) to support, it can be a great job.","Core values are preached, but not always followed. Disciplinary actions for so-called ""ethics violations"" are arbitrary. They're currently trying to remove the ""relationship"" building and the ""customer service"" of EA positions, which is what that position is actually about. Lack of transparency from Executive Team. Bold changes every 2 years that put people in a tail-spin only to have them dropped because they don't work and no one seems to have fully thought through these changes - appears capricious although I imagine its not."
15,Booz Allen Hamilton,Enjoyed working at Booz,2022-04-02,4.0,Intelligence Analyst,"Very professional
Leadership was responsive to my issues","Average benefits package
Did not receive a bonus."
16,Booz Allen Hamilton,a bit too woke,2022-04-02,4.0,Consultant,"Solid company, never have to worry about your paycheck. Strong technological support.",Going too far down the woke trail. Pushes a lot of beliefs on the employees without taking into account that they may not believe the same way.
17,Booz Allen Hamilton,Good company if you understand the reality,2022-04-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"High profile client relations, good market salary and benefits",Core values are paper thin. Bottom line is where the focus is although they tout a people first focus. Staff are no longer their greatest asset. Be aware of that and you'll do great.
18,Booz Allen Hamilton,Waste of time,2022-04-01,1.0,Software Engineer,"I didn't really ever have to work. This job boosted my resume, and helped me land a new job at an amazing company.","This is not a good place to work if you are passionate about software and want to grow your skills. The job is extremely slow paced. You are in a silo with your team and your contract. There is no sense of culture or community here. No company wide goals or objectives. It felt like I was working on a group project in college again.

The quality of code is poor. The technology stacks are ancient. There was zero structure to anything. JIRA boards were rarely used. There are no resources available for learning.

The way 401k matching is done is shady. You do not get your 401k match every paycheck, or even every month. It happens once per year on the last day of the calendar year. That means that if you get hired in January, and quit on December 30th, you will not receive any 401k match. Its basically an interest-free loan that you're giving to Booz Allen. You could've been making gains on those contributions all year if they were vested monthly.

A senior manager told me that Booz likes to hire more and more people each quarter to show growth to their shareholders. They are not afraid of hiring employees without having any actual work to give them."
19,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company,2022-04-01,5.0,Associate,Company culture and  interesting work opportunities,"Complex internal system, unorganized remote  onboarding"
20,Booz Allen Hamilton,Butts in seats,2022-04-01,2.0,Lead Technical Specialist,"Decent benefits, easiest firm to get hired by.","The firm is not what it used to be, now they only care about butts in seats to bill clients. No training, they hire whomever as long as you have a clearance and they can bill the client. No respect for work/life balance, management will call you any hour of the day."
21,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great job for self-starters.,2022-03-31,5.0,Engineer,"I can only speak for JCC but there's lots of freedom to work independently. There is plenty of opportunities to define your own work streams within company. If you are good at networking and play your cards right, your work can have high visibility and you can grow within the organization.",Company can be very slow moving at times. Their engineering efforts are brand new and they are still stuck in a bit of a consulting mindset. Too many cooks etc. You have to have the courage to make your own decisions and then justify them after the fact.
22,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great Company,2022-03-31,5.0,Data Scientist,"Great colleagues, work-life balance is great.","Pay for the industry is a little lower than average, but compensates in training, benefits, and flexibility."
23,Booz Allen Hamilton,Poor Leadership Culture,2022-03-31,2.0,Lead Associate,"Learn from 100-year-old consulting firm with rich tradition of serving important clients with interesting mission. 
For the most part a very humane place to work, but it varies team to team.","-There's a big difference between being competent as a consultant and contractor to clients, and succeeding internally at Booz. It can be very political and a person's success is often tied to the senior leader they align.
-The company's leadership says they care about women and diversity, but they don't know how to translate their values into the employee experience at the daily level. 
-Many senior leaders at the firm are biased against strong women leaders, and favor technical talent over competent leaders and managers who could lead the business and company in the future. 
-Lack of transparency, informality with performance management and back-stabbing by mid-level management can make it a toxic place to work once you get to a certain level. 
-Most talented and credentialed people are excited about the mission and promise of the company but leave because they're poorly managed."
24,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Great Company, No Complaints",2022-03-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Love the people, very collaborative and supportive for what your personal and professional goals are.

Fortunately, I had great Career Manager and Job Leaders to work with for an improved experience.","Work can become very slow and hard to find whenever a project ends. Many programs are not remote and thus limit the employee to their location. Also, your experience at BAH will be dependent on your Career Manager, who can change every few years."
30,Booz Allen Hamilton,Best Government Contractor,2022-03-29,5.0,Chief Technologist,"Largest small business - out of all the companies I have worked for BAH has had the most people asking me how am I doing, what do I need, how can Booz Allen help me.","Like all contracting firms, you need to be protective of your time - work/life balance.

Company that generally strives to do the right thing for employees and communities. BAH name looks good on resume","The culture in parts of BAH is toxic and in some groups bullying, gossiping, and finger pointing are the norm. ln HR in particular this type of behavior is common and accepted. Leadership is lacking. Those in charge don't seem to know how good leaders behave and their judgment is quite poor.   Incompetent, messy ""leaders"" are celebrated for ""fixing"" issues that they created. There's been a lot of turnover in HR the last couple of years and apart from some new folks who don't know better yet and those who've seen enough dysfunction and are actively looking to leave, what remains is mostly those individuals who thrive in the toxic environment that they have created"

Middle management, as well as my immediate team were mostly friendly and alleviated the strain of dealing with subpar government employees.","Horrendous and heavily biased political virtue signaling / pandering at the executive level. Outright threatening and hostile behavior towards employees seeking exemptions. Mediocre raises. No bonuses unless you are working a ""premium contract"" (protip: you aren't). No cell phone compensation. I had to grapple for remote work weekly with my government lead, and was eventually faced with a department wide ""back to the office"" mandate- bye bye."

Project leadership in the tech field expects everyone to do as told and take the heat (I.e., superhuman deliveries) for underbid projects.   The internal and billable folks are treated very differently.   Be sure to get the position expectations in writing in advance.   They hire Java programmers and expect them to be Python developers and hire Python developers for  Ruby on Rails positions.   You have a background in DevOps?  Expect to write PowerPoint presentations and excel spreadsheets.   You know Kubernetes on AWS?  Have fun working on Azure.    In other words you have to know everything about everything."

63,Booz Allen Hamilton,Big Contractor Doing Most Things Right,2022-03-22,3.0,Art Director,"Booz Allen as a whole corporation is very much your typical corporate defense contractor. But within the overall organization, there are a lot of things they do different than other large contractors. 

One of those things is how they handle layoffs. Make no mistake, like other contractors, if you lose a contract, you are very likely going to go on a layoff list. Where BAH differs is that they make every effort to place you somewhere within the company, if you are willing to move or take a new role. I saw multiple layoffs in my 3 years at the company for other people, and more than 2/3 of those people were found other positions in the company. I truly believe that they really do want to keep the people they hire at the firm and are willing to put their money where there mouth is.

Another thing I feel they did right compared to my other experiences at defense contractors is how they promote growth from within the company. Within the first year I was at the firm, I was given an opportunity to take a management role and was given the tools needed to learn on the job for that role.","In regards to one of the points above, as it pertains to layoffs, this could have just been my experience with my specific management chain (IMAG/San Antonio Immersive Team), but the layoffs weren't communicated to me as a manager until the day they told my team members, and only after they were told. This led to internal team issues. This was communicated to senior management and was met with very much a lackadaisical and dismissive tone.

Another specific issue is the way in which the management team treated the employees. It was really tough going from an individual contributor to a manager of a team. I was never really accepted into the management team or treated like I was a manager. More so that I was still just an individual contributor that they used as a mouthpiece to tell the ""bad news"" to the team. It was a great learning experience, but very limiting in that form. 

Other than that, the other normal complaint from the large contractors: salary. The overall comp package is pretty good. The health benefits, education stipend, and extra things in the benefits package is really nice, but they pay you so little than market rate. As an Art Director for a Fortune 500 company, and one that sees billions of dollars in revenue, I was paid less (around $80k a year) than 80% of other Art Directors throughout the country. When I left, I left for a job that was less responsibility for $40K more a year."

I'm constantly having to find new work as contracts begin and end. This means the quality of projects I'm on can be hugely varied. I absolutely LOVE what I do right now, but I've also been on projects that have destroyed my soul.

105,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great place to work,2022-03-09,5.0,Internal Auditor,"Great culture, pay, and career opportunities",Depends on team you’re assigned to
106,Booz Allen Hamilton,Do not recommend working here,2022-03-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Booz Allen “brand” name on your resume,"Throughout my 3 year tenure I left the company extremely disappointed with my experience. I had high hopes when joining the firm originally. I worked for a notoriously difficult Navy client in San Diego, CA in PMW (program office) 120 but left with a bad taste in my mouth from my treatment by my own internal team as well. You do not get a choice in determining which program office or team you are placed in. If you are not assigned to a team outright you will be placed on the “bench” for a maximum of one month while they look for opportunities for you and will be forced to resign if there are no open billets. This also applies when your contract ends with your client. If you have the unfortunate luck to have a client-facing role you will be in tricky territory from the beginning - most of the government clients are absolutely miserable people to work with. They are extremely demanding, condescending, stuck in their bureaucratic old ways, do not know how to communicate effectively and will demean you behind your back any chance they get. You should expect ZERO support from your Booz Allen management and leadership when you face these challenges with your client. The company only cares about keeping the client happy often at your expense. This is something a colleague had brought up during a team meeting to management in my first week on the job and I wish I had listened at the time. Of course leadership pays lip service during all internal meetings and pretends to care about their employees and advocating for the company values but it’s all crap. My team was a revolving door and I was the last person standing that was relatively new to the firm. Myself as well as some others in my team (whom are all gone) asked management for guidance and support and a path to promotion but were met with outright hostility during our annual reviews. Other program offices were the same according to stories I heard from the many people who have resigned. You will be assigned a so-called “career manager” which is nothing more than a glorified supervisor whom will do little to nothing to provide you training or real support with clients. Peer reviews are discouraged and there is very much a “sink or swim” mentality. Expect to be cutthroat in your dealings with others and play office politics to the extreme OR stay with the company for 5+ years to get promoted to the level that you want. Working for Booz allows no creativity in your approach to your daily work and you will be expected to fully conform to client and firm demands day in and day out. If you are client facing you will be expected to report to the government on site location whenever your client demands you to, with no exception. If you are located in San Diego you will be expected to report to NAVWAR in downtown San Diego which is a run down and rat-infested WW1 facility with claustrophobic cubicles for contractors. Contractors are not even allowed to park on site. Lastly, the pay at Booz Allen is shockingly low compared to the other big 3 and even top 10 firms in the country. Additionally, I did not see any others receive bonuses and the annual merit increase was below the national average for many. For a firm this large and profitable the health benefits were disappointing and I found myself spending a lot out of pocket for my health care. Most other employees I had confidential conversations with throughout my tenure were also unhappy with their experience at the firm and were actively looking for other jobs with better pay and a better working environment. Save yourself the trouble and work at the many other consulting firms out there where you will be paid what you deserve and will be supported."

An annual raise in the low single digits in a year when inflation hit 7% is NOT delivering exceptional results for employees. It's not even a cost of living adjustment.

The stock was $82 a share a year ago. It is $76 today. Its highpoint in the last year was $89. It's hard to think of this as delivering exceptional results for shareholders."

Their business model is billable hours, so its no surprise that they try to put you in front of client as soon as possible, even if that means you are undertrained, or alone. It also means that you oftentimes don't get to choose the clients or work you want, as your managers will have the role of keeping ""billets"" filled, and your interests don't make the business money. The facilities in which you work are often run-down government buildings with poor IT infrastructure, and clients who are themselves government bureaucrats often espouse an obstinate opinion on how things should be done.

343,Booz Allen Hamilton,Their Business is about their Clients first NOT their People,2021-12-29,2.0,Lead Associate,"Good firm brand recognition in the Washington, DC and San Diego, CA areas. Large company that you can take charge of your career and move around to different projects to diversify your portfolio of clients. Or you can have management place you on a project and stay there for years. Predominately Federal clients with a small but growing Commercial practice. The Booz Allen internal network is fairly supportive - just need to find the right people.","Leadership and project management is solely focused on supporting the clients first and not BAH employees. HR and Employee Relations are inconsistent in their feedback and handling of difficult employee / client HR issues. Expect zero assistance from the firm if the client is verbally abusive and harass BAH employees. If you are not billable to a project expect 1 month of ""bench"" time depending on your career level/salary could be more. If you need to change projects internally: the process is not streamlined or automated and very cumbersome/time-consuming on the employee. The majority of hiring managers are not responsive to internal requisition inquiries which makes the process even more frustrating. You really need a good network at BAH to internally realign.

You can put in your 40h and clock out or do as much more as you want on intriguing side initiatives, esp if you're in the SIG. If you like working on federal govt missions, this is the place for you.","They do federal work and mostly for defense clients, and there is not much expansion of that. There are pockets of other stuff, and their work in tech/ML/AI is growing, but it may be a challenge if you are looking to be at the cutting edge of your field."

PTO is very old school."
367,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Do not believe the hype, it's more Machiavellian",2021-12-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"•The CEO seems to genuinely care about company and his employees versus the previous CEO only caring about having a legacy. 
•COVID response went well. Most people were already semi-remote since they have hoteling 
•Being a government contractor makes it a fairly stable market for employment.
•A staffing agency pretending to be a consulting firm. By augmenting the government staff, the only asset is the employees so the benefits are good. 
•By not manufacturing or providing anything of significance to the DoD, the job is a lot easier than the traditional DoD contractor. 
•Does not perform traditional consulting services so, it is less cutthroat. They do like to refer to Booz Allen as the “firm” with such pretentious.
•To stay ahead of competitors, Booz Allen is continuously scanning for the next thing. Regardless of your own ambition, you can get exposure to a number of different areas and ideas. Whether you will be to apply is highly unlikely. You’ll know the buzzwords and will need use them since your managers will be using them. Don’t worry, they won’t really know what they mean or how it is to be applied either. 
•By working as part of the government staff, the work demands are very diminish compared to other DoD contractors. It really allows for a lot of flexibility such as going back to school, starting a side hustle, being an involved parent, realizing your tax dollars being wasted, pondering how did that person get promoted, etc.
•Very Niche market. Only certain areas of knowledge can be gained when supporting the government. Most of what you’ll learn will only be relevant when working for the government. 
•If you are looking to get a government position, Booz Allen is a lot easier path in getting into those positions than the US job boards.
•As long as you don’t have a dedicated seat on the client site, you have a lot of flexibility as long as you get your deliverables done. If you do have a seat, you can only hope to have a good client because you’ll be sitting next to rats. Figuratively, metaphorically, and literally
•Overall, it is an easy job. As long as you are willing to take the abuse of clients and know your only road to promotion is through attrition or kiss up to the right people.","•Two things to keep in mind: Technical skills are not required or very little is required. Optics means everything. Optics is referred to in Booz Allen speak as “shaping”, “booz allen fit”, “likeability”, and “managing up”. Your persona will need to mimic Smithers from “The Simpsons”, Dwight from “the Office”. This is especially true for any non-engineering type roles i.e. Program/Acq Mgmt, Cost Estimate, Data Science (yes this isn’t what is advertised), BFM, etc. 
•Client relationships are more important than your employment. Sr. Associates and above would rather see you leave Booz Allen than lose the client. Basically, the clients can treat you as they may as long as it is legal. Yes, there is a high turnover. Most of worse clients are former Booz Allen.
•Your all-round experience at Booz Allen will be determined by your client and Job manager. Your Career Manager may not be much better because they will pawn you off to the Job Manager. 
•If the client, Job Manager, Career, or Senior Associate do not care for your personality (yes, it is a big deal), you will be considered “not Client/Booz Allen fit”. Your future will be either a PIP, Lack of Work, or ignored all together. You can also wait 2-3 years. By then most people will have left and overnight you’ll now become invaluable.
•If you’ve spent any time with a DoD Contractor such as NG, Lockheed, Raytheon, etc. Two years at these employers is equal to 25 years at Booz Allen.
•The government and Booz Allen are really behind on the most fundamental levels to include the technology. Do you know DOS? 
•Management and client will use all of the buzz words. Do not trust or assume they understand what they are saying or talking about.
•Unlike the CEO, most of the management is focused on “Managing Up and Kicking Down”. There are very few leaders in the management chain between the Principal and Lead Associate levels. Most of the Lead Associates and Senior Associates are not very knowledge in their area of expertise.
•Any of your ideas is up for grabs by your clients and leadership. They will take the credit because it was through their great leadership skills of walking around, ignoring you, saying “I’m working a proposal”, and kissing up to those above led you to do great things. Enter Data Science.
•Here is what to expect: Engineering – BAH does not manufacture or build anything. If you want read and write reports. This is your gig. Cyber – Big Push by the clients. You might get lucky and do something useful. Contracts/Install Support – A cog in the wheel of paper work. PM/Acq Mgmt: A glorified Executive Admin that manages a client’s calendar and updates PowerPoint slides. No PM skills gained or needed. Cost/BFM/Data Science – Learn Pivot Tables, watch your team turn over every 1.5 years, and most importantly flatter your leadership. Poof.. you’re Principal or Senior Associate.
•Career Progression: Consultant to Sr Consultant takes 1 to 1.5 years – Time card approvers hate having to authorize your overtime; Sr. Consultant to Associate takes 3 to 4 years – still don’t know much but you’ve successful faked someone in believing you know something by now; Associate to Ld Associate takes 5 to 7 – wow you are still around so Sr. Associate needs you to manage their team while they work to get promoted; Ld Associate to Sr. Associate takes 10+ years – which client and Principal did you sell your soul to or make look good; Sr. Associate to Principal takes TBD – The Principal you sold your soul to either got promoted to VP, retired, or clients are growing your capability. You might get lucky like Cyber or Data Science."

Corporate values ring true for many in leadership.,"There is a severe disconnect between principals and associates/consultants. Claims of diversity and inclusion only apply to some populations, and prejudices and mishandling of the needs of other populations are downright in violation of the EOA/EEOC. The only path to advancement is through contributions toward business development, not due to providing effective leadership that supports and promotes the claimed values of the firm. Middle management is a mixed bag of people stuck there, and hacks/shills who provide negative value to staff and customers."
378,Booz Allen Hamilton,Established company with a few issues,2021-12-16,3.0,Senior Consultant,"Booz Allen is a very well known consulting firm doing really incredible work in the federal contracting space. If you're interested in supporting the federal govt in mission critical work, this is definitely the place for you. Booz responded to Covid very well and continues to offer impressive benefits to staff. There is a lot of opportunity for computer science, data analytics, engineering, cybersecurity, and other data/IT work.","The firm pays well but less than competitors for junior staff. Middle management is not overly-skilled in people management and decisions are made behind closed doors regarding a person's future (i.e. raises and promotions) that one cannot participate in. Upper management has great ideas for people management but it isn't translated down to middle management.

While Booz is not directly responsible, the federal govt can be incredible slow and tedious. You and your team may have wonderful ideas, but depending on the client, those ideas may not be viable or may take a while to implement."
379,Booz Allen Hamilton,Depends on the team you work for.,2021-12-16,3.0,Senior Consultant,"1. Great mentorship should you choose to be proactive
2. Looks good on any resume - a recognizable name
3. Interesting work","Just one major one - Defense Contractors bid against each other. Often the only differentiator between bidders to the government is price. This is where you hear that the stereotype that everything in the military was built by the lowest bidder - so yeah. When they bid the absolute lowest they can in order to win the contract, there is very little overhead available for raises. I saw multiple employees get promoted and not get the raises they earned immediately."

Their internal IT is less demanding and competitive than client facing teams. For people tired jumping from contract to contact, it's relatively stable in comparison.","Its Information Services team is highly inefficient and are behind in their frameworks and methodologies. Lots of the managers and directors have been there for decades. Hard to bring in meaningful changes. 

When it comes to employee appreciation, it's always just lip service from the management. It's sad to see some good team members leaving because of that.

Had the honor to work with a few inspiring leaders. Unfortunately they all left because of office politics. Information Services team now have a lot of incompetent middle managers at Sr. Associate and director level. Lots of micromanagement.

If you want to be part of Kafaesque endless cycle of pointless bureaucratic nightmares and develop a new shiny algorithm for managers to smash with a hammer with until they're bored of it then BAH fits the bill.,"You constantly are pressured and need to look for billable work, even though you're expected to not be paid for your time doing it (interview or writing RFPs). Right now it's a week before my Christmas vacation and I have 4 days left in this year before I go away and I'm constantly told to meet my billable target of 88 hours and hounded about it each day. When you are given billable hours, it's either for a project you hate or for something you wanted but hours are limited and clients keep scope-creeping when they detect any signal of life in you. Most project leads are sexist, ill-equipped to handle issues and enormously corrupt- favoring their ""army"" buddies and spending enormous amounts on bribing clients. I'm constantly working 12 hours for the past six months, while others get paid twice my salary to once in a while check their phone or harass you about how ""liberals are ruining America"". The few engineers that are competent there, have to compete in a constant death match to get billable hours and there's very little camaraderie. Clients projects often will set random immediate impossible deadlines, then once you have finished to their specifications, they won't even view it or they'll complain that you used an ugly color on your api model interface- when you spent hours not sleeping to create a complex AI model and the interface wasn't even in scope.

In my 7 year tenure (2.5 as an intern, nearly 5 as full-time), I have yet to fully understand why this process is so overly complicated for no reason.

My team is supportive and helps with career and professional growth. My government client is also fantastic. Great focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion and a lot of opportunities for growth which is what I was looking for as a junior staff.",The main con is that the compensation is not competitive at BAH compared to their competitors. So keep an eye out for that when assessing salaries of other top management consulting firms. For the work life balance I have I am not too disappointed with my salary but I know it is about 10% lower than friends in my same level/position at other top firms.

515,Booz Allen Hamilton,A company that accomplishes nothing but wasting DoD money,2021-10-27,1.0,Software Engineer,"Extremely easy, no expectations, company hires anybody","Don't expect to have a mentor, don't expect to learn or be challenged, don't expect organization. Expect to be put on failing projects with people who openly joke about how they don't care. Expect your coworkers to swear by their booz allen calendars, you better schedule meetings to the precise minute or else people will drop off calls. Expect that people will avoid doing additional work, even if it is the right thing to do. Expect that people will avoid conversations with you if you frequently point out problems that need to be fixed. 

This company does not produce anything but jobs - I have no idea how it got this large; but practically everyone I've met has a very limited or lacking skillset - But if you can speak well, or are very good at ""faking it"" you'll find yourself climbing the promotional ladder quickly only to find yourself leading projects that you have no business being near.

There are much better DoD companies out there where your skillset will grow, you will be challenged, have mentorship, and enjoy your job - Look elsewhere."

519,Booz Allen Hamilton,Typical government contracting,2021-10-26,3.0,Project Manager,Overall it is full of great people and leadership.

- Decent work/life balance, but pay reflects","TL;DR: 

- Very low pay
- Over promise and under deliver to clients
- Way behind in technology compared to other tech companies
- You are a number and no matter how much business you land them, you still won’t matter
- High turnover (people jump at chance to work here, then realize what it is and leave)
- Work life balance is decent, but it can be grueling for a few months at a time depending on how project is going
- If you depart the firm, they will make rolling retirement and general pay super difficult
- Career opportunities limited to formal qualifications, but some latitude depending on urgency (career opps != promotion)"

It is a really messed up practice for someone who is excited to work a project for a specific role. So beware when talking to recruiters.

- This company feels more like a staffing company.

- You are held responsible for being ""billable"" and you risk termination for a 
""lack of work"". Although there may be someone to help you find work, the work may not be relevant to your career goals.

Employee benefits are really good, and there's a culture among many managers I've worked under that focuses on your happiness and growth as an employee/individual (e.g., your manager is happy to help you find new work if you want a change).","There's an above-and-beyond hustle culture that can certainly lead to burn out. If your starting salary is low, you'll be hard-pressed to ""catch up"" to industry standards with just annual raises. The firm can feel very ""little fish, big pond."" No matter how great the firm is as a whole, your experience on your team is truly what your employee experience will be (e.g., if your team awards and expects working after hours, you will most likely experience working after hours; if your team awards balance and only working core hours, you will most likely experience balance)."

It's really difficult to put a process in place successfully when you have to govern senior management. I have heard ""I've always done it this way"" more times than I can count. Of course, this type of mentality trickles down and those that use their authority to skirt the rules typically have direct reports that do the same.

Booz Allen treats their employees well. 
Overtime work is available if you want it.","Booz Allen does not treat their mid-level management well. Those people put in 60+ hours/week and sometimes don't earn as much as the people who report to them.
Booz Allen is shifting direction from a consulting company to a solutions company, meaning they are focused on engineering/software/technical positions instead of business/financial/project management positions."

It's kind of hard to feel a part of the company at that point, and by the time I left, BAH kind of felt like just a collection of email distros.

735,Booz Allen Hamilton,"OK for entry level and coasting, but high achievers beware; turnover is high for a reason",2021-08-03,3.0,Modeling and Simulation Engineer,"TL;DR: Beavercreek Office is OK for a first job for anyone with a STEM degree and who still needs time to figure out what they want to do. Booz Allen at large is a great company, but your milage will vary from office to office.

At Beavercreek Office:
+ Impactful work thanks to long running contracts and important customers
+ Decent job security
+ Niche analysis tools qualifies almost anyone with a technology background -- great for jumping into something new and interesting

Booz Allen Hamilton:
+ Corporate leadership does a great job with communication
+ Unbeatable educational opportunities outside of normal duties
+ Massive company network that genuinely wants to help
+ Has systems in place to protect employees from ""lack of work"" situations that many contracting companies have to deal with from time to time
+ Employees are the company's most valuable assets (as opposed to large factories, for example), and the company does a great job at providing resources for them to succeed","TL;DR: Beavercreek Office has a lot of leadership and task-related issues that make it difficult to recommend as a place to work for people with established goals and ambitions. 

At Beavercreek Office:
- High turnover is largely influenced by aloof management and neglected culture
- Staff frequently complains about learned helplessness and lack of communication
- Clear advancement guidelines, but exceeding those guidelines is oddly frowned upon
- Decades behind the curve in terms of modern best practices for software development, analysis, and project management, which is especially problematic since a lot of our work is undiversified, niche, and does not transfer well to other jobs
- Work is very much like an analysis workshop; innovation and creative thinking are rarely ever needed
- Staff who stick around long enough are generally the ones who tolerate the other ""cons,"" and the cycle continues when they get promoted

Booz Allen Hamilton:
- The company's vast resources allow it to compete on fairly large contracts, which is fantastic in most situations. It also creates situations where those large contracts lead to siloed billets and narrow scope jobs. Could be a turn off for someone who likes to wear many hats. This could be a pro for others."
736,Booz Allen Hamilton,Federal Project consulting,2021-08-03,3.0,Associate/Lead Technologist,"Big name to have on your resume, and if you're willing to reside in the DMV area there are usually alot of project opportunities so getting staffed is not as big of a challenge as it can be at other consulting firms.","Managers on projects are really hit or miss, and the ones that miss, miss by miles. Definitely a lack of diversity in the leadership space. Ultimately spending 2.5 years on the project I was staffed to only showed me that govt agencies can be very incompetent and wasteful, where BAH fails is allowing these agencies to continue to waste tax payer money, but instead BAH just sneaks in and gets those contracts where they just need to justify seats in a chair as opposed to providing quality consulting. No bonus structure if you're an Associate or below. I was told that I was performing at the top of my peers and got a 2.5% raise each year and was forced to live in one of the more expensive cities in America. When i asked to work remote, a number of BAH subcontractors were given the ability to work remote, I was told that I should simply request to roll off the project because the project wouldnt support it. during my job search after I rolled off I saw the same role that I was working offered through another subcontractor with more pay and the ability to work remote. Project leadership really fails you at times."

801,Booz Allen Hamilton,Time for me to get off this merry-go-round,2021-07-13,3.0,Data Scientist,"- I got the job offer the day after I interviewed, for more money than the job I was leaving.
- It was a great opportunity to get a peek inside IARPA, which is where many new technologies that push the envelope are developed. 
- I got to learn about deep learning and neural networks, including Tensorflow and PyTorch, as well as pick up some skills in AWS cloud computing.
- I also really liked the manager and the team that I worked with on an internal R&D program. Unfortunately, that program lost funding after I was there only three months.","- I have just gone sideways in my career for the past year. I really wanted to work on a hands-on data science project and put a machine learning model into production, and I never got the opportunity because I got descoped from one program (where I was only allowed to talk about data science) and the other program lost funding after I was there for only three months.
- I guess this place works out for some people, but I just felt like I was lost in the shuffle. 
- You really are on your own if you get descoped from a program. You are told, you find your next job by networking. But how are you supposed to network when you get hired in during a pandemic when it's all remote work?
- When I applied for roles on other projects, I was too expensive for most projects or else lacked the right experience. There was much more interest in my resume outside of BAH than inside the company.
- It's crazy that BAH hires people but then makes them find a role once they are inside of the company. Like, you think you're going in for your first day of work, and it turns out that it's not your first day of work, but instead just a new phase of your job search."

Coworkers tend to be smart, capable, and dedicated. Depends on your project but contemporary tech, software, and tools are used.","Offered a Dream Job. Instead spent months on The Bench. I am disgusted that I could be offered employment after one 30-minute interview but never told there would be a second far more arduous search to find an actual project. 

My offer letter stated I’d be employed as a software developer supporting an intelligence agency. I was never offered that work. Instead I was told to take the first project I was offered regardless of its alignment with my skillset, career goals, or location and that if I didn’t like it I'd be allowed to look for something else after 9 months.   Oh and if I left the firm within 18 months I'd have to repay the training cost ($5K).  My experience wasn’t unique.   

I was hired through one of the Tech Excellence programs along with ~10 others. Our first month was a 4-week training course. A month after the course ended, 4 people had been assigned projects. The rest of us were instructed to apply to project openings on workday, i.e. find a job (wait what?). And our applications were for the most part completely ignored. BAH’s recruiters and hiring managers completely ignoring their coworker’s applications and messages is indefensible. 

If you don’t have an SCI clearance don’t bother trying to be a Data Scientist here.

Avoid the “Tech Excellence Programs”. They are a bait-and-switch. You’re a number they can use to bid on proposals."

- Chance to work with lots of technologies
- Chance to work on seemingly important federal projects for your country
- Good place for those with no experience

Not a pro/con: Your mileage will vary based on the project you work on. Booz Allen has hundreds (or thousands) of contracts spread across the federal government. It's more like thousands of companies in one than a single uniform unit.","- They appear to hire almost anyone, lots of warm bodies. This is good if you need experience, this is bad if you're a good engineer because you'll end up pulling dead weight on your project.
- Too much corporate cheerleading and propaganda. The two-day new hire intro is lots of drinking Kool-Aid and pretty thin on important details like benefits etc. It could be condensed into one day with how pointless the cheerleading is. Tons of Booz Allen spam to your inbox like ""how booz allen is embodying its values in the month of may"". Does someone get paid to write that spam?
- The structure of Booz Allen feels very nebulous, poor organization. For instance, they have tons of subdomains that you go to do various tasks like setting up a printer, contact helpdesk, etc.. yet they don't have a centralized area where you can see all the subdomains. You are just expected to learn/know. Very disorganized
- Too many meetings, as a developer expect to spend 5-10 hours a week in meetings.
- PTO policy is bad, 15 days per year, woof, get with the times. If the project I was on was managed better and Booz Allen had better PTO I might have stayed.
- My project was a trainwreck. Team Lead was in over his head. The organization was terrible. Lots of subject line only Jira tasks with no info. No planning. Also, the guy just didn't do anything. Very bad for morale when you see that coming from your lead.

It's highly unlikely I would work at Booz Allen again."

Expect to spend a year or more on a project and have nothing tangible to show for it by the end, or expect to deliver something that could have taken three weeks. 

- Salary adjustment will never exceed 3.5% unless promoted. 
- You will need to spend years here to get promoted, when you could have left to boost your earnings
 - Healthcare plans are garbage
- Staff-aug work means you're not working for Booz, and your also not a Fed. It's a terribly unfulfilling in-between state.
- It seems some people are constantly on fire, and others are at the spa--which speaks to staffing mismanagement 
- It's a cushy place to be, and will drive you crazy if you're ambitious about your career."

Also your career manager is suppose to help you with throughout your career at Booz Allen but sometimes that person is not be as helpful as they could be (I suppose it depends on who you get). Your career manager takes in feedback from your current project (manager and co workers), which influences your promotions, reviews. I sometimes found it frustrating getting feedback from a third party (my career manager) who doesn’t work with me, but I know this is a common structure in consulting. Like at most places, the people can make a huge difference on your experience and in consulting you often work with a range of people.

The Ability to get involved in different activities and programs
Great clubs and extra curricular activities","Horrendous working conditions: 15 of us were crammed into a room meant for 5 people for 8 hours a per day.
Awful Management: The main reason I quit, managers were not only toxic, but refused to train up junior employees and allow them to grow (when I brought this to their attention, they just said they were too busy to train me). Managers were consistently condescending, belittling, and petty.
When I brought these issues up the HR, they just made the problem worse.
Lack of opportunities: Good luck finding a data science project without a high level security clearance. 
IT COST ME OVER 10000 BUCKS JUST TO QUIT!!! Company gives you flex dollars. The money deceptively isn't yours. If you spend Flex Dollars and quit within 2 years, then you have to pay back everything. About $6000 flex dollars were spent voluntarily, these I'm not angry about. However, my manager forced me to use flex dollars for training and certifications. My managers forced me to spend 4000 dollars that weren't mine, to take courses and get certifications I was not too keen on getting. Essentially, they forced me to be indebted to the company, and work it off, very very scummy practices. 
Complete lack of recognition: I won an entire competition on behalf of BAH, and the VP didn't even congratulate me by name, or simply say thank you for going out of my way to bolster the image of the company. 
Disgustingly Low Pay: For a data scientist, I was easily able to get 20% more than I was making at BAH. They pay you like garbage, far below what you're worth with pitiful raises each year (mine wasn't even 1%).
In short: work somewhere else. The prestigious title isn't worth your time or dignity."

This can be great for networking and there are many company events that you can attend to meet new people. Pre-covid my team had flexibility to work from home at least once a week. 

There are a lot of opportunities to work on different types of projects, especially if your background is in STEM. I've seen many people take advantage of all the opportunities and the resources that the company offers which can be very helpful when/if switching to a different company.

There's definitely a diverse group of people with various backgrounds, and the company culture overall was pretty good.","If you don't actively network and seek for new projects, the projects you end up working on may not be something that you're interested in. There's always some amount of pressure to start looking for new work once your current project comes to an end which can get annoying.

This could be for most companies, but the more you become engaged in different areas within your team and your projects, the more work you'll have to manage. The work you pick up never really goes away, so context switching and time management can become difficult if you're not careful.

I've noticed that the pay in general is not as competitive compared to other companies, and the salary seem to depend more on your background and the range can vary pretty widely even within the same level."

- Good benefits
- Easy-to-Medium work requirements
- Great resources
- Great name","- Government consulting can be incredibly dry, boring, and have questionable value-added.
- Don't always feel challenged
- Bonuses are awful
- Pay is average, and low for consulting overall."
1290,Booz Allen Hamilton,Work-life balance!,2021-02-11,5.0,Associate,A ton of flexibility and telework options unless on client site,Billability targets can be stressful and result in loosing good people
1291,Booz Allen Hamilton,Good company to work for,2021-02-11,5.0,Associate User Experience Designer,many projects to work on,Many roles require clearances. Those roles with clearances are effected by coronavirus measures. ( Can't travel right now)
1292,Booz Allen Hamilton,Best Company Out There,2021-02-11,5.0,Senior Intelligence Analyst,"Benefits, training opportunities, experience, experts, ability to switch positions at another location within the company",There are not any cons that I have come across or heard about
1293,Booz Allen Hamilton,Excellent work/life balance that I've experienced so far. The work and people are good.  The R&D structure is silly.,2021-02-10,5.0,Lead Data Scientist,"- Where traditional IT consulting firms tend to BS a lot of the math, Booz has a lot of technical experts and government subject matter experts. In previous firms, I've seen statisticians leave because they were told to vet invalid models. There seems to be emphasis on doing it right here on most of the projects that I've worked on.
- Training. Training. Training. They do a fantastic job of finding opportunities for you to grow. After a few years, I think you get like... 7k per year to allocate towards certs, tuition, etc. - there are some caveats if you leave within 2 years, so keep that in mind.
- Like a lot of consulting jobs, placement on the right admin team will make or break the experience. I found a wonderful team that really cares about growing me, and the people are generally pretty friendly. If you want to do technical work, the SIG is where you want your offer to come from. If you really care about Aerospace/National Security/etc. or a specific domain, you'll want to be placed in a group in that sector.
- Great work/life balance because federal consulting is their bread and butter. If you're trying to focus on work-life balance and would rather avoid non-stop travel, this is a great place for you. You're also not forced to do any extracurricular activities a la Deloitte and can just blend in the background if that is your flavor. Promotions won't be as quick, but you can treat it like a job.","- Not really a con for most, but I've found that because I was pushed into dashboarding roles for so much of my career (prior), I got stuck on more dashboarding efforts here than data science/ML. Transitioning to more technical roles takes a lot of effort on your own time. AI/ML is really competitive right now, so I can't fault them too much.
- Compared to some other consulting gigs in the DC area, pay is ever-so-slightly below average. I was able to negotiate, but some of my more qualified coworkers that were hired out of comp sci were making under 80k after 2-4 years. 
- Lots of rework and waste from an R&D perspective - see advice to management."

1302,Booz Allen Hamilton,Good company,2021-02-09,4.0,Team Lead,Good benefits - leave and 401 are fair. Company encourages diversity hiring and support.,Company is actually geared toward developing younger talent (at lower salaries) and working them through the years to more senior roles. Understandable but for middle aged or older workers there is not really much of a path beyond whatever you hire on as. Interview process is chaotic at job fairs. Cannot know what the client will be like - some are truly horrible and cause 100% turnover of personnel in a year. Not Really BAH fault but it can be an unpleasant surprise. If first time as contractor be sure to ask about length of contract in the interview.

1368,Booz Allen Hamilton,Steady work in DoD landscape,2021-01-28,4.0,Organizational Change Consultant,"The company is really leaning into the current social inequities and seems to be planning to make any necessary adjustments. The DoD market is continually needing adjustments, and therefore the work is steady and each project is unique. The company additionally has taken it upon themselves to not let anyone go unless absolutely necessary. There is a lot of available training and potential to shift to new work if interested. The 401k match is 6%, however, you need to stay through the end of the year to receive that match.","The federal workspace makes for a very slow moving and change resistant client. Pay is somewhat linked to available contracts, and pay is lower than other firms due to overhead as a publicly owned company. Anyone under senior associate does not receive a bonus.

1404,Booz Allen Hamilton,Solid,2021-01-21,4.0,Senior Lead Technologist,"Booz Allen takes good care of its employees. I've seen them do what they can to accommodate people when issues around benefits come up.  There is generally strong camaraderie between colleagues. It's less cut throat than some consulting firms. Part of the reason may be the less-rigid tracking of sales credit. Make no mistake, they know the role you played and how many dollars were involved, but they don't dole out percentages and officially track it. The diversity is also wonderful! I have really enjoyed the effort put into diversity, and I notice the difference when I look around at the other contractor firms when on client site.","General Contractors thrive here (e.g., General Management Consultants), even in the highly technical fields. The most important thing is that you are a business administrator. You don't have to have skills and experience in what you're selling/administering. Booz Allen tried to create a technical track, but nobody in it get's promoted into the bonus pool even in their technical capabilities and client impact is remarkable. Of course, they also created a special unit, the Strategic Innovation Group (SIG), that is supposed to house the technical expertise of the firm. That is part of what prevented the technical track from working."
1405,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company to be working for,2021-01-21,4.0,Integration Engineer,Flexibility and the benefits that you get are great.,You will only be promoted if people know you. it's not based on the skills or work that you do.
1406,Booz Allen Hamilton,90% great place to work,2021-01-21,4.0,Lead Associate,"Pay and benefits are usually decent, especially if you're a more recent hire. The quality of your coworkers is much higher than at any other place I've worked- folks are smart, creative and tend to be go-getters who will generally tell it to you straight. Variety of work and opportunities for growth in terms of training and learning communities are unparalleled. In general the best place I've ever worked, and the fact that you can fairly easily rotate between projects keeps work seeming fresh. Also BAH is at the forefront of some of the industries of the future, especially AI.","Salaries for longer-tenured employees, at least at Associate/Lead Associate levels, are often somewhat below market, leading to newer employees being better compensated than those who have put time in and proven themselves. The criteria for advancement can sometimes seem kind of vague/arbitrary. If you're looking for a more structured environment or for requirements/tasks to be fully spelled out for you, you're going to struggle. Overwhelmingly one-sided political culture, which is openly embraced or even pushed by leadership, can make those who don't agree with the progressive cause de jour feel isolated and like they can't speak up out of fear(limiting diversity of thought). TBH I'm nervous even writing this."

1411,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great firm,2021-01-20,4.0,Lead Associate,Benefits are excellent. Salary OK.,401k match is not as much as before.
1412,Booz Allen Hamilton,Really Enjoy Working at BAH,2021-01-20,4.0,Software Engineer,"I like being able to move between contracts. It is like starting work at a new job but with the same points of contact throughout the BAH network.

The people there I've worked with have 95% of the time been awesome! Lots of talent and feels like a really fresh environment. I was led to believe Booz used to be pretty stiff. 

I got a promotion, and two raises in the 1.6 years I worked there. I also got 2 awards with bonuses attached. They were small like 800 apiece before taxes. But it was nice to feel like my work was being recognized. 

I've been working here throughout COVID-19. They handled it awesomely! They pretty quickly moved to remote work as much as possible (This is a big feat considering our main client is the Government). They promised when it all began to not start terminating anyone for like 6 months at the very least and they set a large sum of money to the side to ensure they could keep people employed.

The best part I think is that they won't let you go between contracts. They keep you on the bench paid while you are looking for new work. I can see the advantage to both parties here. Lower cost in recruiting and retain people you've already vetted to have experience!","Government work sometimes is outdated and there can be a lot of red tape that restricts delivering better products. This isn't BAH's fault just a downfall of working with the Government.

Tech stacks can be dated. I got worried when on the bench I would get stuck doing something that doesn't align with what I have in mind professionally.

I feel vacation could be a bit longer coming in? Could also be a bit more transparency on raises. I often tried to discern this information I feel I am being underpaid but I don't really feel like I have any avenues to address it. My career manager is probably the only one at the company I am not the happiest with. Feel like he isn't the ally he is supposed to be? My understanding is he is supposed to advocate for me and outline what I need to be doing to ensure career progression. This includes salary increases. I've got okay raises but I got stiffed on an agreement I made before I got hired to give me a 5k raise after 6 months. He didn't advocate for me."

Since BAH consultants work onsite and integrate with the culture of their clients, the client's atmosphere becomes your day-to-day norm.

1554,Booz Allen Hamilton,"If you're gonna be used, get paid",2020-12-09,4.0,Senior Consultant,Pros: Significant- BAH was able to absorb onsite contract losses due to COVID-19 and find other work for affected employees. That's nothing to sneeze at with all the nationwide layoffs. Education benefits - use them strategically and don't leave $ on the table. Take advantage of the Employee Assistance Program to get the free therapy and anti-anxiety meds you'll need. Some positions are still a refuge for 2010's style active alcoholics and 'looks good on paper' candidates. Park your butt here while you get sober and sort your life out if you can. HR screening is lackluster at best. If you have a TS/SCI full poly you can murder a hobo and still get a job.,"You will drop dead in your current contract before they ever move you to another project. There is about 10% mobility within the firm. (Unless you are incompetent - then managers will pass you around until dealing with you becomes unavoidable.) Once you are hired, it is preferred to fire you and hire a new replacement rather than promote you within the firm - strange though it may sound. Don't waste your time fighting that fight - ask existing employees for the skinny. If you take advantage of education benefits, you owe the firm one year of service after completing otherwise you have to pay that money back, so plan accordingly. Get in, get what you need, get out and move on. BAH will low ball you on all salary negotiations, so get the experience you need and move to a SDB to make $ and then jump back to BAH at a higher level. The initial HR intake interviewers are all worthless subcontractors. Don't worry about researching their questions - they're just as clueless as the average job seeker. Check the right boxes and you will advance. *But* confirm that you are applying for a fully, funded awarded contract. Protect yourself. If you apply for any job more than 72 hours after it's been opened...good luck. Managers have less than 30 seconds to screen your resume in a 80 page .pdf compiled resume file - so make yours pop. If you think you have a shot, network within the firm - that's *a* road to success. If not, network outside and open your options. (I have never seen internal networking pay off FWIW.) It's the 21st century: straight white people need not apply. (Sorry guys/gals not my rules. ) Plan accordingly - unless you have a TS/SCI full scope poly - then you can murder a hobo and still get a job. Don't get emotionally invested - view BAH as your rebound relationship."

I have an excellent healthcare policy, along with other good benefits, and I have had consistent (and generous) yearly raises. Work life balance is great, and there is so much opportunity to grow with this company. But this year they have truly won my loyalty with how they have handled the COVID 19 crisis and they have really proven that they look after their people. They did not hesitate to move all employees to remote work when it became obvious that we needed a shutdown, and they are in no hurry to push us back into the office, maintaining a people first approach that things are working fine remotely, so why put people at risk? The only people back are ones whose contracts require them to be at a client site, and Booz is working with them to be sure they are maintaining acceptable standards. I have never at any point felt that my job was at risk during this crisis, and we have been assured along the way that we not only are NOT going to have layoffs, but they are still actively hiring. While some of the government contract work we do is not ""sexy,"" it sure is reliable, and I have been so grateful for that this year. I have seen many fellow employees go to failing startups in recent years only to end up back at Booz. Also, Booz has a culture of standing behind its minority and LGBTQ employees providing additional support resources. They also provide assistance for employees facing life challenges and have also improved Maternity leave in recent years, which from my understanding was a previous deficiency. This is truly a company trying to grow and constantly improve. You will have opportunities here if you pursue them.",The only con I have is that they only match Retirement accounts once a year in January and you must have been employed until December 31st to get the match
1770,Booz Allen Hamilton,Looks after their people,2020-09-04,4.0,Principal,"Booz Allen is a company dedicated to their employees. Countless examples of losing a contract and team pulling together to place 95% or more staff onto other contracts or carry them on overhead until they can be placed. With COVID, the CEO announced no one would lose their job due to COVID and pledged $1M towards better health care, child care, people on overhead, etc while the economy recovered.","As with any large company, there are pockets of awesome and other pockets of mediocrity. Tough if not impossible to tell from the outside, but either ask lots of questions, know someone inside (not in the hiring chain) or join and reassess your position in 6months. Booz is excellent about inter-company mobility."

A lot of talented and professional people work for them. Big company with plenty of opportunities for lateral movement.,"CAVEAT: My experience with Booz was not a typica corporate Booz or regular consulting Booz experience. 

Management was very customer focus and not too employee focused. This lead to concessions made on behalf of the client's interests which weren't all that beneficial to the workers. There are also a lot of unprofessional and untalented people who didn't deserve the job where I was hired. However, these undeserving individuals made enough of a commotion to be an HR nightmare that management just put up with them for the sake of appeasement and appearance. It negatively affected the morale of the employees greatly."

I sat in orientation getting the usual pitch about corporate values. In my head, yeah, right...but in my experience, they actually practice what they preach.
No complaints about any one there.
On the corp level, they took early action to assure people that they still had jobs during the current pandemic crisis. Many other companies took a less than charitable view of the whole thing.
The benefits are there and available to you, but in all honesty they're mediocre at best.","This gets lengthy as there were several complicated situations. 
In spite of management denials, this is a contract house, you are a contract employee and will remain that way until you lose your funding or find another contract. Management repeatedly denied this, saying you're a full time salaried employee. Which you are as long as you have a charge number.
The company holidays match up with gov holidays and nothing more. You will NOT have Christmas Eve, New Years Eve or even the Friday after Thanksgiving off unless you use your vacation. I've never run into that one before.

The job that I was in as well as most others involves working with/at the local DoD installations, namely TARDEC or Selfridge. Not bad places to work if you can stomach working with government employees. Pretty much, anything and everything you've heard is true....

As I said, I had zero problems with local management. That's not the case with these from on high. Those folks came across as nothing more than used car salesmen, and I didn't trust anything they said."

The Job Manager serves as your typical PM and is tied to the contract you're on, while your Career Manager is meant to be your tie to the company and your main resource line.

I have since left, however, even in a COVID-19 environment, they are making me pay back almost $2000 for a course I completed more than 15 months ago by forcing arbitrary language in their company policies to avoid paying full cost for a course.

Many of the reviews from former colleagues talk about how much the company has declined since it went public a few years ago. But even employees who left the firm only a few years ago would not recognize it today. Booz Allen is very much on the move, overcoming its transitional pains, rebuilding a once-again great culture, and shifting its strategy from staff augmentation to more strategic work with an emphasis on emerging tech. This is a place to go for self starters who want to have more control over their career path, enjoy endless learning opportunities, and a strong work-life balance.  The people are amazing and mentoring. The work is of national significance to the country and you can truly make an impact.","The compensation and benefits—while good—are not what you will find at other large consulting firms. If money is more important than work-life balance, this may not be the place for you. Also, government work is not for everyone; it's a calling to help serve and protect citizens and warfighters but it's not always glitzy and exciting."

- Collaborated with some of the finest colleagues I've ever had
- Learned a lot - not just consulting, but bus. dev. and team leadership.
- Benefits are a cut above the competition.","- Since going public about 8 years ago, Booz Allen has been in an overall slow but precipitous decline, and it shows. 
- If the intention was to transition from ""consulting firm"" to ""butts-in-seats"" chop shop, it succeeded admirably. 
- The bottom line is now all about quarterly earnings, not people. 
- More and more contracts are ""administrative services"" in nature and less about innovation/solutions (ie. real, actual ""consulting""). This has opened the door to some really toxic and hostile work environments and the ""client is always right"" attitude allows so many good people to suffer under some very nasty clients. 
- Little to no opportunity to move to other projects outside of the Wash DC. area.    - Loyalty is not valued they way it used to be. 
- There's been a recent spike in turnover of senior leadership in some local offices, and that can't be a good sign."

The retention rate is atrocious.  Most folks leave well short of two years, with some folks having left within a month.  Almost all these departures are due to management's treatment of employees and complete technical ineptitude.  Folks simply hate working here.

Rarely does the work focus on solving a problem, it is mostly about occupying a seat for the government and shuffling whatever paper comes across your desk.
-Promotions and salaries are arbitrary, very political, and not merit-based. My only meaningful promotions and raises were given when I went out to another company and got a better offer and brought it back.
-Leadership is focused on sales, not developing people - they are very willing to let some sit in a role for years on the same contract, rather than try to maximize their value by aligning their skillset to the work
-Leadership maintains heavy control over the people they hire, even after the employee has moved on to another contract - people at Booz refer to this as leaders 'building their pyramid'.

Each day presents a challenge, we are not micromanaged and often given leadership responsibility. We are each responsible to drive hiring, present trends and, meet with Hiring Managers to educate them of the process and back up performance with metrics and coordinate large hiring events. You can expect to manage 60+ req's in the defense side, per Recruiter. You are generally recognized for your outstanding performance. If you can't handle working autonomously or are adverse to hard work and hiring goals, it is not the right place for you. Pay is excellent, we are paid WAY above what Glassdoor claims is the high end BUT you earn every penny. This is not the typical ""Recruiting job"". If you look at description for a Recruiting Lead, that is more what you should expect to be doing. Managing your clients within your ""Service Offering""  to make offers quickly and meet strict deadlines advising on best practice with a keen eye on compliance at ALL TIMES. Its truly a wonderful place to work. We work with purpose and know we are making a contribution to the betterment of society and the DoD.","Headcount drives promotions even if you exceed all hiring expectations. Promotion will come eventually, I believe, but it takes a lot of time and dedication to prove you are able to lead. You must be assigned a challenging task, like integration of a new system or a large contract and then perform well to be promoted past Senior level, into leadership track. You should expect to act as a Lead before you get that title. We don't all receive a recruiting bonus for hires in a quarter, etc. I think more can be done to recognize outstanding performance. We could have more contact with the decision makers, those that recognize top performance. Maybe a meeting once a year and invite those that consistently meet their goals and/or are on track for promotion. Lots of work."

2118,Booz Allen Hamilton,Booz Allen is a Criminal Organization that Steals from their Employees and Commits Federal Fraud,2019-09-28,1.0,Senior Lead Technologist,"No, do not work here.","Booz Allen steals from their employees and defrauds them. Booz Allen is a broker for the federal government and federal contractors. Their business model is to win contracts and then to advertise those jobs. The way Booz Allen steals from their employees is that they will assign a different level of service on each end of that transaction for a significant portion of their workforce.

So, for example, if an employee gets offered a job they will give you a different job than the one you accepted with more responsibilities and experience required, but at the original pay. Also, when you get another position in the company at a higher level they will tell you to wait for the promotion in their internal process to the end of the year. Meanwhile you are selling service at a higher level for a whole year. Then at the end of that year they will often decide not to give you a promotion to match the title and job you are already doing. This is company policy that your job rank and title on a contract does not need to match your rank in the internal system and corresponding pay.

In this way Booz Allen can pocket the difference in service levels, or provide the government with free labor and they can win more contracts by stealing and defrauding their employees.

It is no different than if the federal government said they want to buy gold and Booz Allen puts out a bid for gold. Somebody then sells Booz Allen gold, but Booz Allen only charges the government for silver and pay the vendor for silver. The government then gets gold at a low price. Likewise they can also charge the government for gold, but only pay the vendor for silver. But, if the vendor is a human being selling labor, instead of materials, there is little they can do to prosecute because of the lack of employee protections.

This is what they do with employees instead of materials. The only difference is that doing fraud like this cannot show up in any audit because nobody compares the job levels on the contract with those in the HR / pay system. Also, it may not be illegal under regulations, so it would be very difficult to prosecute independently, so they can get away with it. Also, since there is no law requiring an employment contract after 90 day or 6 month trial period, they can just say if you don't like getting scammed, then you can walk away.

They will try to pin this on individual managers, but it is company policy. They do not tie your rank to the rank on the contract. So, you can be a Tech Lead (level 4) on a contract, but could be a level 3, or even level 2, and technically nothing is stopping them from making you a level 1 in the HR system. This of course will determine your pay. Also, you won't show as being severely underpaid in any audit because they put the wrong rank in the HR system.

I think this is alarming for all individuals, but of course could be used to hide any discrimination based on race, or sex, in addition to just being used to scam employees and pad the wallets of the stockholders and management."

The work and environment was not the best but was decent.  However everything changed when I let my management know that I was switching job to a competitor. They were mad that I was leaving and probably thought they wanted to take a revenge. Even before my last day of work, they terminated my clearance which made my clearance go into Loss of Jurisdiction (no clearance). Crazy thing was I didn't notice this until the first day at the new work; I was working in a secure facility without clearance for few days.
Since then, I haven't been able to get my clearance back and it was very hard for me to find a project due to missing clearances. 

This is very very unprofessional and the company is going downhill BIG TIME. Totally messed up my clearance and the career.

2251,Booz Allen Hamilton,Lexington Park Office,2019-05-24,1.0,Senior Consultant,Great coworkers and that just about sums it up.,"Management does not listen to employees. Training is not uniform. You can ask one manager how to do something and go to the next manager and it’s wrong. Extremely high turn over. People in positions that they shouldn’t be in. Was more knowledgeable than people that had been there for years. They also play favorites. They let certain people telework, while barely giving any hours to other people. When I left upper management told me I was making a mistake and that I was getting paid what I was worth at Booz, and the new company was over paying me, told me it was my fault I didn’t get monthly snapshots because I didn’t press the issue enough to my manager(which I told them I reminded them twice a month) and he said that wasn’t doing enough, that their benefits couldn’t match Booz Allen(which wasn’t true). Basically made me try to think I was stupid for trying to leave Booz Allen altogether.  There is no room for advancement here, there was even a senior consultant being used as a team lead when I was there. Management also promises bump ups but usually never delivers. My best advise is to never work for this office. I’m sure Booz Allen is a good company and has good offices. This is just not one of them. You will notice after a month or two of working here, that many people are unsatisfied and looking for a new job. Spent a good amount of time venting about working here to other employees and there are plenty that do the same. Good luck if you decide to take a job at this office."

There's a lot of opportunity to be exposed to different projects if you are aggressive about that as well and you work with a lot of really talented folks.","Some of the brightest, most talented folks I've ever worked with jumped ship when we went public; or were let go because they were too expensive (and in my opinion, worth every penny).  There are some real corporate b-s'ers at the top and if you get stuck being managed by one of those who isn't great at their job, you'll get pigeonholed into your contract and it's tough to move up.  Also, if you get partnered with a career supervisor who isn't managing what you do day-to-day, it can be tough to move up since they don't know what you're working on, how you're performing, etc. directly. 

Also, there's a real culture there of going above and beyond and the work/life balance is really terrible.  Taking your laptop home and making it an appendage is a thing. It's tough to unplug and not have it be frowned upon.  There's a little too much of a competitive spirit around there."

2345,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Nice company, but mentors weren't able (or weren't willing) to help match me w/ the right projects",2019-02-19,3.0,Consultant,"I started with Booz Allen Hamilton directly out of college not knowing what to expect. Everyone on my home team (and on subsequent project teams) was welcoming and kind. Though the Consultant salary is lower than for firms like Deloitte or McKinsey, it is still very solid for a 23 year old. Benefits were decent too.","I came to the firm as a general management consultant hire with a background working in/studying political science and campaigns. Though there were some projects with roles for entry-level consultants in areas like communications or research - they were few and far between. More commonly, people like me got shunted onto the operations teams for one of the dozens of IT/Tech Modernization projects that are Booz's bread and butter on the civil side. (The military and defense jobs that make up the other side of Booz's bread and butter were only for vets or civilians with very specific technical skills). These operations roles meants I spent my time organizing meetings for people, processing and tracking on-boarding and off-boarding of other consultants for our project, and other mundane tasks. Within these projects, the only way to move up and take on new work would be in learning to do a semi-technical role. Working on requirements as a go-between with the developers on one side, and the clients on the other. Stuff like that. 

Though everyone at Booz was nice, no one on my home team was able to really help me get matched with a project that interested me or would make use of my actual skillset. There weren't a ton of projects out there that actually would have been a fit for someone in the mode of the classical liberal arts student (me), but there were some. Many less jobs than for my colleagues with true technical backgrounds (software dev, hardcore data analysis), but some! Enough jobs that it was apparently worth Booz's time to recruit many liberal arts students! But in my case, I spent two years at the firm working on two projects that bored the hell out of me, then left for greener pastures. Both times that I was looking for new projects (when I initially joined the company and after offboarding after a year in my first unsatisfying project) my bosses from my partner team were more focused on getting me quickly billing on a project (any project) than on finding something that would actually be a good fit. It's a shame, I liked many things about the company a lot. Overall though, my experience there was quite poor."

The company culture is great and they really try to reach out to employees on a regular basis. Telecom positions are hard to come by, but they do exist. If you have a good Career Manager you'll go far in this firm.","My biggest complaint is that there is no tracking on internal talent and the skillsets they have so the firm is constantly hiring for certain capabilities. This is most frustrating when you are looking for a new contract and you see open positions that you fit, but it's a capability hire which means you cannot apply for it.  Which leads me to the way you work at Booz Allen; when your contract ends it is your responsibility to find another ""job"" within the firm. If you don't find a new contract within a certain period of time (I believe it's 2 or 3 months) you get a warning letter that if you don't have a job within 2 weeks you will be let go."

This may have to do with the company slowly chipping away at employee benefits. The 401k match dropped from an automatic 10% to a 6% match. 401k fees are paid directly by employees from their accounts, and bereavement leave was decreased without any communication from management. At the same time the company still has an ""off the record"" expectation of employees working extra hours each week to make up for training opportunities that generally never happen. That won't be mentioned by any recruiter.","Booz Allen believes over-management is the key to success. The creation of a new job leader role just lumped additional daily/weekly responsibilities onto the most burdened employees, despite the previous construct working for most people. The amount of upper management is staggering  and stifles middle managers who have to present financials and project reviews that are tailored to each one of their 4-8 internal bosses. As for external customers/clients, the company markets itself as a cutting edge IT leader, but severely lacks institutional knowledge of cybersecurity, cloud hosting/computing, and basic network engineering.

-There is systemic discrmination against woman mostly older woman. Younger woman are expected to spread their legs for promotion and pay raise.
-Again, if you are an IT Engineer in any form, do not join this company. There are several great technology firm in this DMV and BAH is just a body shop company for the govt. They will hire you for 35$/hr and sell you to the govt for 150$/hr."

Nice people and co-workers. They don't micro manage and trust you with your work.","Depending on your field, work can be boring and not challenging. Technical people tend to work longer hours. When projects ends, the onus is on you to find another project even though you have a ""career manager"" who's job is to make sure you are billable. They don't pay market value for your career field. So unless you negotiate that before you are hired, don't expect to get it while you are employed by them.  In very rare cases they may do a MSA (Market Salary Adjustment), but they will give you much more responsibilities outside your field to get their returns.  Booz Allen pay schedule is once a month. It was something that annoyed me when almost every other company pays at least twice a month or biweekly."

Great place to start your career and get technical experience with various customers (mostly Federal/DoD).,"Sometimes the policies and procedures were overwhelming as well as the rigid management styles. Mostly due to change in portals, processes, and to mitigate risk due to recurring incidents within the organization.  Vendor relationships (specifically cloud providers) were not well thought out and did not meet the needs of all of the clients.  Most decisions were not customer driven and caused issues from an employee and management perspective.  Employee retention seems to be an issue at more than one location. Being billable is more important than being valuable and productive, not the best point of view for all customer engagements."

I was told I would be able to have multiple roles when I was going through the interview process, and when I chose the position and resigned from my then former employer, I was told how the contracts they wanted to put me on fell through.  I was then put on ""busy work"" and nothing that was substantial towards my educational credentials or skillset because I was a contractor and had to remain billable, so anything that was remotely close to my background, even something that I was not interested in, I had to take or risk not having work.  You are strongly encouraged to market yourself to others and network your skillset.  There aren't any real stable roles for you unless you are apart of a clique and get in good with the right people.  They're also so used to letting people down when it comes to contracts and work, there's no real communication about what happened, as though you should get used to it, as I heard plenty of times, ""Welcome to the world of consulting"".  You will hardly have communication with your career manager unless they're either on the same project as you, or reviews come up.

* Luxurious facilities
* Decent money","This is a company that operates on what feels like liberal Democrat policies, and is managed by a bunch of military veterans with no leadership or people skills. Why do I say that? They say one thing and then do another, and they say one thing and tell YOU to do another. They claim to value everyone's different work styles and methods of problemsolving, but the truth is it's full of bad leaders that don't know how to tolerate differing opinions or anything they disagree with (they'll shove the ""Booz Allen way"" down your throat all day long, and if you don't kiss the ring they'll harass you until you either quit or they can find some technicality to justify firing you).

This is what working for Booz is like:
* If you disagree with someone of the opposite gender, then it's entirely about their gender, not that merits of the two viewpoints. They do that deliberately to silence any dissention.
* ""Respecting others' opinions"" actually means ""do what you're told and don't have ideas of your own.""
* In their world, ""teamwork"" is code for having a bunch of people involved that don't need to be in every detail of what you're doing.
* High performers that are more competent at their jobs than their supervisors are viewed as threats, especially if they refuse to be micromanaged. If you're smarter than your boss at what you do, mark my words they'll find some way to fire you.
* The only thing leaders there care about is yes-men. It doesn't matter what those yes-people do, even if they're bullying or harassing you--the yes-people will be the ones who get preferential treatment.
* You can work yourself to exhaustion for this company and they'll never say ""thank you"" or ""good work."" It's not the Booz Allen way to recognize low-ranking employees for their contributions. Lead Associates and Senior Associates always act like they planned and strategized everything, even if they knew nothing about it.
*Their ""purpose and values"" are a joke. They care more about their ""feel good"" culture than they do having healthy debates.
*The majority of the Lead Associates and above that you'll meet don't care about the job or anything else that actually matters; all they care about is playing politics, so don't trust any of them.
* Leaders are insulated from the consequences of their actions, so they can freely mistreat ground-level employees without being stopped by HR or the leaders above them. A bad leader gets protection because the folks that hired them don't want egg on their faces, and it doesn't matter how badly you get treated."

From the first day, the firm provides you with a comprehensive overview of the firm, the values, expectations, and structure. The biggest thing communicated to employees is that the firm values the employees they bring in. 

However, based on the experience thus far, its more than just lip service. Immediately upon arrival to my job site, my first line leader and her boss made an effort to welcome me to the firm, address any questions I had, and ensure everything was continuing to run smoothly. Beyond that, unlike most contracting companies who will hire anyone with the minimum requirements and a pulse, my co-workers with Booz Allen are incredibly driven and passionate about their profession. The care and precision the firm places in bringing in quality people creates a great workplace that fosters energy and growth. 

When problems have inevitably arisen, my leadership was keen on quickly addressing the issue, while ensuring that the solution benefited both myself and the client. Being valued and having that sense of value communicated to you consistently by the firm is refreshing and sets the firm apart from the rest.","- Overemphasis on networking

Benefits have continuously gotten worse since I started back in 2008.  Team leaders pick one or two favorites and can ignore the rest of the team.  Company is highly segregated so there is no cohesive leadership across the board so hope you get on a good team and you even get noticed.

Does not pay as well as the other consulting firms in the area."
2704,Booz Allen Hamilton,Worked there for a decade.,2018-04-04,3.0,Lead Associate,"Pretty typical contracting firm. Colleagues were great and had I the opportunity to serve and learn on many interesting projects. If you are young, fresh out of college, aren’t married and have no children, this is a great place to gain experience and cut your teeth.","I was a manager with a stellar career at Bah. I left because I was offered a better opportunity with another firm. 

No clear path for promotion, it differed from team to team. You may be amazing on one team, you’re up for promotion, then switch teams to chase an opportunity, and all of a sudden none of your previous hard work matters and you’re starting from scratch. 

Perception is everything there. 

Constantly reorganizing internally. 

You are always walking on egg shells waiting for a “lack of work” notice.  

Work/life balance is awful. If you have a family, be prepared to make some pretty difficult choices in terms of work vs family. Either your family will suffer because you are working all of the time or you will have a difficult time being promoted because of the perception you aren’t working enough. 

No OT unless you are junior. Otherwise, be prepared to work long hours with little more than just your own self satisfaction that you did a job well done. 

Someone once told me, “After working in a chicken coop for a long time, you forget how bad it smells. It’s only after you leave, you realize how bad it was.”

I totally agree with that statement when it comes to my time spent there. I feel thankful for my time there, but never realized how stressful it was until I left and started working at another company. In hindsight, I wouldn’t change a thing. But moving forward, As a father/husband, I wouldn’t work there again and subject my family to the crazy long hours and stress. If you aren’t physically working there all of the time, you’re answering emails on your phone all night/weekend. Additionally, you may put in 60 hours of work in a week, but if you didn’t put 40 of those hours toward a contract and did internal work for Booz Allen, your career may be in jeopardy and you could end up with a lack of work notice. 

They don’t truly value experience. If you have been there for a long time, your “rate” may price you out of opportunities."

Big size company, average benefits - it used to offer better 401K and healthcare options but have been descending in the last couple of years.","Because the company seeks 95% government contracts, sometimes you get to stuck with the same client for years and must learn how to survive from all kinds of politics. For lower level consultants, you won't get paid as much as other consultants in the market but you would still need to work the similar LOE based on your role on the project. Sometimes you would get extremely high pressure from upper management and there's no way for you to resist. Small raises and slow promotions.

2711,Booz Allen Hamilton,The Bench? What?,2018-03-28,1.0,Associate,"The compensation level for an Associate is on par with market value. As a software developer, I was rewarded in terms of compensation, workplace accessories (Macbook Pro), etc. I enjoyed using enterprise GitHub, Slack, Atlassian products such as JIRA, Amazon Web Services, Azure, and others. There is also flexibility to WFH if you are on the ""bench"" or if your project allows for it.  Lastly, the location of your hub is typically pretty reasonable in relation to where you live, so commuting while on the bench or working remote is typically not a problem.","I was lured into this position because I was told there was an abundance of work in my hub and that commuting inside the beltway or into NoVA was not going to be a problem. I asked a ton of questions during the interview process about projects, work-life balance, client locations, etc. and the answer was always ""depends"". Once I got to the firm, I realized day one that you're more or less just a number they use to bid on proposals. The ""bench"" is where you are when you don't have work. I was hired with about 10-12 other employees who all rode the bench between two to eight months without work. As ""capability"" hires, you come into the firm without work. It's your responsibility to apply to two jobs per day, and interview as much as possible. You are encouraged to apply to positions even if you only hit 35% of the basic qualifications. As a developer, you are also required to perform technical interviews, mostly whiteboard or technical algorithm solving. Imagine this, you wear your suit and tie to the BAH interview, you get the job and then you find out you don't actually have a job... but you have to apply to two jobs per day, the location might be 30 miles and hours of traffic to get to, and you might not even want it... on top of that, you have to interview AGAIN and AGAIN until you find something. If you are offered the position, and it's a ""billable"" project, you will be strongly encouraged to take it, even if you don't want to. The recruiters don't describe this to you during the interview process, even if you ask the right questions."

Booz Allen offers hundreds (I'm not exaggerating) of training courses.  The majority are self paced web based courses, but there are lots of in-person training opportunities as well.  Perfect example: BAH leadership decided that they needed more people with data science skills so they partnered with a data science training company to teach any interested employee!  My management has also been very willing to allow me to get involved in things that interest me.  

2)  Booz Allen has work in all kinds of areas and all over the world.  If you get bored with what you're doing all you have to do is talk to your manager and you may be able to roll onto another project.  My last annual review my manager was very interested in whether or not I enjoyed what I was doing.  BAH periodically puts out a call for people to join a new project overseas (i.e. Germany, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, etc.).

3)  Benefits are definitely above average.

4)  The firm has some incredibly smart people.

If you don't live in DC Maryland or Virginia(DMV) you are pretty much screwed. Booz Allen likes to pretend it is some major international company but it really isn't. Yes they have opportunities abroad and other states. But most of the work is highly concentrated in the DMV. If you live elsewhere I think you are taking a huge risk by working for Booz Allen. If you don't have a project right away you may be out of work in a few months. Honestly other consulting firms have better options for people who do not live in the DMV.
Another problem is they have so many people on the bench who will eventually get lack of work letters aka you will be out of work if you don't find a project letters. But they will constantly hire people from the outside for ""capability building"". So they will fire people because they don't have work. But they will hire people who they don't have work for.

2763,Booz Allen Hamilton,Poorly Organized and Managed,2018-02-15,2.0,Associate,The pro is that you may be able to get a job offer because the federal market is huge.,"The con is that Booz Allen has been doing constant re-organizations for well over a decade. It does not know how to assign managers to employees out on assignments who are relatively alone and it assigns many employees this way. If you don't work with your manager you likely won't get promoted or good rewards because your work won't be recognized by anyone who can reward you.  It is essentially an adjunct faculty provider for the government, so the company itself has no core being or purpose and contractors have little investment in the long term goals of their clients due to the lack of reward possibility as an outsider doing insider type jobs. This would not be the case with a more traditional type of company, or even a contracting company with a narrower purpose fulfilling a role for another company rather than simply augmenting it."

I would recommend it to anyone looking to have a career in public service because you have the ability to 'get a taste' of various government agencies without committing to anyone for longer than ~6 months. Depending on your goals, you can take many different career paths--to executive leadership, subject matter expertise, project management, etc. Within the Federal consulting space, there are few better employers.","Booz Allen is a large and bureaucratic organization, not unlike the majority of clients it serves. To make change, especially at the junior level, you have to be extremely proactive to the point of being abrasive. Most people starting out are not comfortable taking this approach and end up 'falling through the cracks' and never taking full advantage of what the Firm can offer them. Relative to commercial consulting firms, Booz Allen struggles to provide competitive compensation. Top talent can typically make 20-30% more in the commercial space, so there is a bit of a talent gap at the junior levels."

Many ""data scientists"" do not know how to code, have 0 knowledge of machine learning and statistics, and are hired because they have any resemblance of engineering knowledge related to math. I can understand that they are hiring bodies to train them later but the quality of work suffers immensely because of it. 

The pay is not anywhere near the industry standard either... 

Don't let the rebranding facade fool you - turnover is very high and many are hired to the firm without any clear project in mind for them leading to a surplus of employees on the bench looking for work even after their employment begins. 

As a data scientist, the only tasks that I have been given to work on are purely software engineering, computer infrastructure (basically IT support), and administrative tasks. This is definitely not a one-off situation as many of those whom I have met with are suffering from the same situation."

The only pro is that if you are really lucky, you'll get to work with a decent team with integrity and good rapport.","As a newly hired employee, I've had a very rough experience at the firm and even worse, I'm not alone in this. So many issues, combined, make this experience unbearable  on a day-to-day basis. Although the experience can be subjective, it's really important that these be considered or else you're just testing your luck. Here's an overview: 
- your career manager (the one responsible to staff you on a project) makes or breaks your career. Most CMs I've heard about do not care about their subordinate's growth, development, conflicts, etc...they're only looking out for themselves
- Besides the CM role, no one else is formally expected to support, mentor, or advice you...
- this firm is just as politically driven as its clients are...relationships win over merit and morals. So just imagine, as a new hire, if you don't have a relationship with your CM, you're already on an island. You don't have any other formal source of support.  
- there's an expectation that you should know every single thing required because no one wants to be accountable in training or educating you about the most foundational things like process
- people are often pressured to sacrifice their integrity 
- some contracts are setup in a terrible way where the firm has overcommitted without the necessary resources...and the team has to take the lift for the firm 
- you are pressured into situations where you're working 110 - 150%

As the nature of contracting and resources working at customer sites, it's very difficult to feel that the organization cares at all about the off-site employee.  The ""hoteling"" and open office environment are contributing to the deterioration of moral.  As benefits increase BAH makes an effort to keep insurance costs down but they're in the trends as other organizations and just offer awful medical plans unless you'd like to spend $600 per month for the family.  The only way to advance within BAH is the person above you has to leave in some fashion...wooden box, new opportunity externally or relocation for another opportunity.  Transfers internal to the company are lateral at best therefore  no upward mobility unless you make your own contract and prove invaluable to the revenue of the organization.

The firm bet big on its disastrous ""Take Share"" hiring policy back in 2010 which led to a deep bench of available staff.  When anticipated work did not materialize to the levels projected, it resulted in a lack of work situation and literally thousands of employees at all levels up to partner were let go from 2011-2014.  The company went public in that same time frame (late 2011) and had to pull a lot of cost-cutting levers to project itself as a profitable company to investors.  Losing a lot of re-competed work to small businesses and the government's spending cutbacks due to Sequestration all contributed to BAH going from a company 26K+ employees to under 20K at its recent low.  Growth projections had the firm at topping 30K employees, so the company was way below the targets the C-suite Partners had set back then.  These days, new talent is hired in at starting salaries less than the firm offered at the same level a decade ago.  Job security is very uncertain even if you are on a billable task.  Management will move a higher salaried worker off of a task to be replaced by a lower paid new hire.  Workers in a lack of billable work situation are generally let go within 2 weeks to 2 months depending on tenure.

Promotions are very hard to come by and annual raises are anemic due to the firm's strong culture of holding down costs.

The firm is no longer at, or near, the top of the list for advanced degree professionals who are truly interested in being a consultant.  Deloitte is a much better option for someone who wants to do this type of work in the federal space and work for a large well-known company."

Also, the experience can be very inconsistent based on who you report to. There are some excellent managers who pay attention to their staff and help them grow, but there are others who either play favorites or have no understanding of what it means to be a leader.

- Company provides $5000 annually supporting training and professional certifications, which is great for those in their early career
- Energetic, vibrant team atmosphere with a 'can-do' attitude
- Colleagues are accountable and look out for one another
- Highly structured and regimented environment, a dot-the-I's-cross-the-T's environment, which can be a pro or con, depending on the context.  The upside is that people  communicate very directly with one another, so you always know where you stand with your manager.","I think these are very bright people who are well-meaning, but will do “whatever it takes” to please the client, hence the issue of ethics.  I can see why Booz Allen’s image was tainted after the Edward Snowden incident.  People aren’t taught ethics here – and I’m saying this after having worked at a large, internationally-recognized company where “doing the right thing” is a priority.  

Bottom line: when push comes to shove, they do not care about you, they just care about making the client happy, and if you're not a yes-(wo)man exhibiting obsequious, sycophantic behavior to your project and/or career manager, basically nodding and smiling to everything that they say (so they can do it ‘their way’) – even at the expense of your ethics and morals, you are doing yourself a disfavor in your career at Booz Allen.  As I can see there are multiple reviews on here highlighting ethical behavior (lack thereof, specifically) of senior management, I can support that with first-hand experience.  Senior associates have asked us to come in on the weekends but without clearly outlining policy for charging overtime for paid-time-off on weekends.  Once someone asked, “how do we charge weekend hours?,” and the senior associate replied with, “Make it work!”   This is senior management, by the way, and it’s not going to change. 

Highly structured and regimented environment can lead to following the rules too much to the point that it can lead to mistakes.

In all, I think Booz Allen is a place ideally suited for someone in his/her early career to obtain training and experience, but not ideal for someone in his/her mid-to-late stage career."

Also, if you got off a project there is strong pressure to find a new one as quickly as possible or you'll receive a Lack of Work and be laid off.

Raises depend on flexibility of the contract, but in my experience they are a bit stingy I this department. Otherwise, they tend to  pay higher base salaries than most companies."

2912,Booz Allen Hamilton,Overview of Booz Allen Hamilton,2017-10-09,2.0,Senior Consultant,"Decent Brand Name: Booz Allen Hamilton still has a relatively strong brand name due to the size and history of the company (about a $5B company with a management consulting history), which allows for stronger exit options (as in it will help you get an interview when you have Booz Allen on your resume).  

Above Avg. Culture: The work/life balance is strong (think 40 to 50 hours/week, but this depends on project/division). There are many company events and ways to get involved (only if you're based in D.C.). The work environment leans collaborative vs. competitive. The company focuses on driving towards an inclusive environment and a dress for your workday policy; this means all races and types of people are welcome and you can typically dress down a little from what you would expect from a consulting firm. 

Public Sector Work: If you enjoy working within the govt. space and learning about how the govt. operates, then Booz Allen is a good option for you. Almost all work is with the govt. and you'll get to interact with govt. employees, officials, and really every other aspect of the govt. Booz's website is a good place to see what type of work they do. Some examples: IT implementation, business process re-engineering, project management, program management, change management, strategic communications, Cybersecurity, other technical fields etc.

Nonpartisan Operation: Booz Allen's work will exist no matter what political party is in power. Booz Allen's work is not partisan and Booz will typically stay away from anything that may be too much of a risk or touchy subject (Booz is a very risk averse company). Partisan politics do not play into Booz's daily operations, so if you fear that you'll be working for ""x"" party, you're not; Booz Allen is a business, it will execute effectively on govt. contracts to implement govt. policies or improve govt. operations, etc., and it's very much less about the politics.","Management Consulting No More: Many people associate Booz Allen with Management Consulting, but this perception is become ever more obsolete. The projects for the govt. are typically very long (think a year or longer). Most projects now are staff augmentation, IT implementation, program management (administrative oversight), Cybersecurity, or other technical fields. It is very important to recognize that management consulting work is no longer a prevalent area for Booz Allen because if you're looking to gain the core management consulting skillsets, you should look at other firms. 

Poor Compensation: The pay is far below industry standards. Senior leaders will say our ""competitors"" are other major management consulting firms, but in reality there are major issues with that statement. 1) the other management consulting firms will pay anywhere from 10% to 50% more in salary with the average falling between 10%-50% more. 2) Booz Allen does not really do the same work as other major management consulting firms. You cannot say that public sector ""consulting"" is the same as private sector consulting because of one important reason: typically the skillsets gained from public sector consulting are not completely identical to that of private sector consulting. Consequently, Booz Allen employees will lack certain skills that are necessary for transitioning to private sector/industry firms. These skills that management consultants at Booz will lack typically fall into the quantitative analysis category (many who read this may disagree and say that Booz has lots of Data Scientists...well please read the next section). 

Qualitative and Quantitative Separation: The typical perception of ""management consulting"" work is powerpoint and excel everyday with powerpoint being the qualitative/strategy/communications/soft skills side and the excel being the quantitative analysis/hard skills side. There is an interesting phenomenon at Booz where if you're a ""management consultant"" you're left with the qualitative and strategic side of things and the quantitative is left to the ""data scientists"". In a world where a balanced skillset between analytical skills in excel and qualitative/soft skills is becoming ever more important, stripping Booz Allen management consultants of their opportunities to learn the quant. side of things truly hurts their careers. 

Non-HQ Workers are Treated Terribly: If you work in any geography location (meaning anywhere but the HQ locations in D.C.) you have a TREMENDOUS amount of downside to your job/career. You're treated like a second class citizen because you are not part of the ""club"" in D.C.; this means as a geography employee, your projects are worse, you are stuck on bad projects, you are  limited to a small number of clients, you are limited to certain types of work/projects, leadership doesn't pay attention to you, your pay is less, your activities aren't paid for by the company, you don't get as much training or staff development time, you are disconnected from the firm, you are not able to network, D.C. people think you're not good enough, you're seen as expendable (firings left and right can occur at ease in a downturn), you'll always be picked last for exciting opportunities (meaning you'll never be picked at all), your advancement opportunities hit a ceiling at a point, and much more. It is critical for those seeking opportunities at Booz to recognize the downsides they will face if they do not work in the D.C. offices. Please take heed. The experience in D.C. however, is much better. If I worked in D.C. I would give Booz 3 stars instead of 2. 

No Vision/Major Growth Opportunities for the FIrm: Booz does not seem to have a strategic path to the future. And this makes sense given the nature of the govt. work (and consulting firms in general as professional services firms have trouble innovating). Booz will only grow if the govt. grows its needs. As a result, Booz exists as long as the govt. exists (which is forever). But at the same time, the govt. will not likely undergo any sweeping/fundamental changes, and that means neither will Booz (so expect the work to stay status quo for the long haul). 

Large and Segmented Company: Booz is a large organization, it's like having multiple public sector consulting companies mashed into one. For example, the defense and civil side operate almost as completely different entities. As a result, these entities can have different cultures, work/life balances, skillsets needed, etc. Take note of which part of the company you're applying for to determine if it will be a good fit."

Most things are deeply vetted by professionals who understand change management.","It's a large firm, so raises can feel anemic, even when you're being told you've done an excellent job.

The advanced data science practice that I was sold on at interview time largely doesn't exist. (One Senior Associate told me: ""Most of our customers aren't even ready for simple analytics, much less advanced analytics."")

It varies greatly from team-to-team, and domain-to-domain and is a very highly subjective ""process"" based more on who you know and developing senior-level advocacy, rather than achievement and merit.  At the end of the day, front-line employees are simply FTEs - only as viable as your latest client delivery engagement.  Resource Management is ineffective.

Until recently, ""Booz-Up"" and ""Boozer"" mentality appears to merge company name with alcohol consumption at after-hours mixers and ""business"" lunches, which appears to be expensed by the senior manager present; I don't have visibility if those expenses were passed directly or indirectly to clients.

Great benefit package

Many awesome people who are very smart and very hard working 

You get what you put in: if you're a 60+ hour week kind a guy/gal, always available, and dedicated to your clients, you should be well rewarded

Gary Rhal is the man! He now leads the Engineering and Environment practice. I have never worked with a better mentor/leader and manager. Even if you're a bit nuts, if Gary believes in you, he'll stick by you.","Politics, politics, politics. One reason you'll need to work 60+ hours per week is you'll need 10 to 15 hours to deal with the politics inside the firm. Nuts! Maybe it's gotten better since I left.

Burn out: those 60+ hour weeks really add up. By year 3, I was nearly cross-eyed. In fact, I never had to take vacation time because I'd put in so many hours before I left and so many hour when I got back, the vacation hours were never needed.

Strange benefit of having a nervous breakdown: I know this will sound ""crazy,"" but I knew several people who had a nervous breakdown while working at Booz. In fact, I had a nervous breakdown. Almost to a one of us, we were promoted after we came back. Maybe this was just happenstance, but the seeming correlation was frightening.

Transformational culture: Well, Booz is a consulting firm, right? That said, it seemed a new corporate initiative was being rolled out every 6 months. We would be greener! We would be more nimble! We would consolidate management to better respond to customers' needs! We would incentivize  managers to work across practice areas! We would open lines of communication between partners and peons! In the end, most of the initiatives I witnessed ended in the dust bin of corporate history for lack of a real implementation plan and/or leadership support. Yawn. It became too easy to ignore the ""latest initiative."""

You don't have any say on which team you get stuck under. How some of these people became managers and continue to be so is baffling to me and several of my coworkers. ""As long as the client doesn't complain we must be doing something right"", and ""good enough for government work"" attitude is common. Client maturity/standard is so low that as long as it's better than their staffs work they seem to stay happy and the firm billable clock keeps running. Excessive meetings, time consuming status reports, formal culture and did I mention no sick time? Yeah, no sick days. Booz wont mention that in the recruiting pitch.

Firm is growing and is an exciting place to be relative to a few years ago.

I think your experience is going to be 100% dependent on the skills you bring to the firm, the team you're hired into, your first client/project, and your career manager. I was lucky enough to get hired into a great team with a great career manager, and many of the people on my team are doing really interesting stuff that I'd also like to do. I also came in with a strong (but somewhat general) consulting skillset, which made it easy for me to be plugged into a few different initiatives. My first client/project wasn't great, but I was able to use my pre-Booz Allen experience to get something much better.","It's all federal work, which may get old for many people. Promotions and access to great work can be highly political (knowing the right people/being on the right track). Salary and benefits are solid, but nothing to write home about.

Management is distant from employees, company values change too often, company looks only at the bottom line and forgets about the people that bring in that revenue, poor advancement opportunities, salary competitiveness is below average due to the high costs of overhead and expected company profit, and the list can go on and on. Leadership, at least at the Quantico area location, is immature and lacks a lot of the basic leadership skills needed to be an effective and powerful leader. Management changes in this area quite often giving the impression that no one wants to be on this team long. If you are planning on joining the Booz Allen team, be aware that you must negotiate your best possible deal up front as when you get in you are pretty much locked in to a bleak future. Another interesting fact, the turn over rate here at the Quantico team is very high. Not only myself, but I know of 6 to 7 other people within the same year leave the firm and never look back. This alone gives solid testament to the fact that something is not right. Just be warned is all I have to say!"

I experienced trouble with management in several locations working for Booz. There is little respect for the analysts, they are just worker bees. Management chain only trusts and listens to other managers in their chain, rather than actually respecting the knowledge, contributions, and experience of the analysts on the ground working with the clients. The managers, who are usually rarely on client site, think they know more and as much as you say to argue your case and support yourself, they have plugged ears. In several locations, managers pursue new contracts, then ignore the work just to focus on pursuing other contracts. There is little attention paid to actually managing the project and staff well. Contractors are taken on as ""experts"" but treated as children. There is little opportunity for advancement. Not to mention, bonuses aren't given even though they have reported growth in the last couple years where they expected to see loss. Benefits have gone down hill every year. 

Basically this is just another place to clock hours. The only two reasons I gave them two stars rather than one are:
1- they have maternity leave. That said, they made it feel like it was a burden to them. Manager wasn't particularly supportive.
2- there are lots of jobs available because it's a very big company, so it's fairly easy to move around if needed, and you can keep your paycheck, no matter how mediocre. Don't expect it to get you any advancement though."

- During a contract protest the firm went out of their way to provide billable work to employees to negate the loss of income.  
- I truly admire Booz Allen's ability to foster such a fierce and intense loyalty amongst their managers and employees. I'm not sure what they're putting in the Kool Aid, but it must be good stuff. 
- Booz Allen truly is the shadow wing of the nation's Intelligence Community. They provide fantastic opportunities with nearly every and any agency possible if you have the qualifications/network to make it happen.","- Booz Allen is notorious for their cult like culture and worship of the firm. 
- The business team I worked for in Central Maryland viewed any employee initiated movement requests as a problem. There was no assistance in moving to other teams, businesses, etc and applications elsewhere were viewed similar to defections. 
- Low pay compared to other companies in the intelligence contracting world. Booz Allen managers routinely acknowledged Booz's lower pay scales, but would counter argue that the firm's benefits were superior to their competitors. This is simply not true. However, considering many, if not most, employees are recently separated military service members/government employees with little outside contracting experience, these claims are largely accepted and defended throughout the firm. I received a $20k dollar pay increase upon switching to another company, and this increase wasn't for a different position either. It was for the exact same position that I had when I left Booz Allen. I still sat at my same desk, working alongside all of my same colleagues.

3250,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great People and Relaxed Environment.  Limited Growth.,2017-02-20,3.0,Lead Associate,"The majority of people I worked with were great, genuine people.

Booz Allen has to be the industry leader for work/life balance.  Because of this, it’s not uncommon for people to have other major sources of income on the side.   It really is amazing the amount of free time you have when working for a government contractor.  

For the most part, managers are always available to talk to about any issue and they really try to put you on projects that you want.  You can easily get by on 10am-4pm days.  I personally know a lot people who only showed up to work when they had meetings.    Also, to get a job at Booz Allen, you don't even have to do a case study.

Booz Allen is an excellent brand name.  It’s really overwhelming how highly external recruiters and firms think of Booz Allen.  Obviously, this is a huge positive, since if you don’t move up as quickly as you would like at Booz Allen, you can just leave, for probably a much better offer monetarily.  This is really important at any large corp, since oftentimes it is very crowded come promotion time.","Some in upper management and HR at Booz Allen have a bad habit of lying.  This is more so than I’ve seen at really any other company I’ve worked at, so it’s worth mentioning.  They will absolutely lie to you when trying to recruit you.  They’ll tell you about bonuses and fast promotion.  It’s important to know that it is company policy that no one below senior associate gets any bonuses, regardless of what they tell you.  They have this vague concept called the ‘People Model’, but in reality it’s just a bunch of false promises; no two managers give the same definition of it.

Booz Allen is currently in this weird stage of deciding if they should be more than a government contractor.  They spend a lot amount of money (which they get from huge gov't contracts) in anything that has the word ‘innovation’ and in creating products that don’t have a legit chance of selling.  That money could be better spent elsewhere; for instance, the firm wonders why their commercial arm isn’t getting any legs, but it’s really because they don’t bring in any legit rainmakers.  You can’t ask government workers with no industry connections to bring in commercial business - that’s not a good strategy.

Other than that:  health benefits are relatively subpar. no bonus unless you're senior associate above, regardless of what they tell you.

Overall: If you’re looking for an extremely relaxed environment at a big consulting shop, I really couldn’t recommend any better place to work.  If you’re fairly technical and want to challenge yourself professionally, I’d recommend looking elsewhere."

Managers are so overwhelmed, I found that for many teams I was on, they didn't even have time to assign tasks to me. When they did assign tasks to me, they didn't set expectations. Interacting with clients is a pain because the management will talk over you, interrupt you, undermine you, or just straight up tell you not to interact with clients.

You don't actually have a job when you work here, you need to apply internally for jobs. This is difficult because people hire who they know. I have not found people helpful at all in trying to bring me in to new projects.

Worst of all, the general incompetence in some of the markets is staggering. I've come into projects where the manager has been doing everything themselves and its going terribly. I've come into projects where nothing is happening at all. I've come into projects where I've had to rewrite entire artifacts because the previous ones were complete trash.

I feel so alone at this company and every few months, I have to worry whether or not I'll be able to keep my job because of projects ending.

But instead of orientation, there is now online training, and the culture does not reach the IMAG team.","Upper management has no software development experience. One bad manager has driven out a TON of senior people, and upper management buys his lies unquestioningly. Workplace went from wonderful offices to giant cube farm with no storage. I worked at the IRS call center and had more storage than what they have now. Loud and many many people in each room.In three years there I never saw a promotion from Associate to Lead Associate; instead they repeatedly drove out the higher paid associates and hired Lead Associates with no software or game development backgrounds. Booz people on other teams (and in other cities) seem much better than IMAG, all because of management. More than one former employee (in the ""loop"") has told me it's far worse than I saw. My review is of the IMAG team specifically, not the company as a whole. First time I've lost a job with more than one year in with no notice and no severance; they'll screw you on the way out. Booz as a whole allows employees time for self-development, but everyone on the IMAG team must be 100% billable, even making up time from marketing trips."
3295,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company with a lot of opportunities and potential,2017-01-24,4.0,Consultant,"Booz Allen has a very unique and professional work environment which allows you to realize your full potential. The opportunities are only limited by what you want and are willing to pursue. Leadership is very involved and has interests in getting to know every individual (of course depending on your individual team/cluster). Everyone I met at the firm was always willing to help others, eager to learn, and very involved. Senior leadership tries their best to keep all team members engaged through multiple events and activities during and after hours. The firm really gives you the capability to grow yourself as a professional by providing training, workshops, etc. that you can attend in order to expand your skill set. Managers are there to help you and will work with you according to the type of work life you desire. Climbing up the promotional ladder is systematic as all the levels come with prerequisites and requirements one must complete/meet in order to be promoted. This firm strives to remain apparent and above the trend in the current market. Overall, I would really recommend Booz Allen to a friend or colleague simply due to all of the opportunities for self/professional growth.","Finding the exact project that suites your needs can be quite challenging. At times, between projects, you can be sitting on the bench for long periods of time waiting/looking for a project to be available. Of course, the way to avoid this is always be proactive and look out for new opportunities as well as have an awareness regarding when your project/support ends. It always depends on what work is available and where your current standing is. Frequently, you can find yourself not finding a suitable project of your desire for weeks/months. New projects don't always follow the same line of work or have the same required skills which makes continuity of specific work an issue. Often times, you have to accept what you end up with. 
Salaries are somewhat in the below average - average range. Within the course of a year, I have seen multiple people leave the firm for better pay."

I feel lucky because I have a really great team that I work with and everyone supports each other.,"The tough part is that sometimes the personnel that represent the government clients aren't truly invested in the projects because they are funded by tax payer money. As a result, the motivation to continuously do great work fades away.

Because of this, capturing and winning projects is given more importance than the product that is developed. In the end, the product is not given the same value and so moving up in the company means becoming a good salesmen instead of improving one's functional skills.

Booz Allen has a great disabilities assistance program, and is wonderful about it's treatment of LGBT employees. The work hours are extremely flexible, and many people telework frequently. My colleges are incredible people, but YMMV. I took the job for three reasons: the Booz Allen name, the fact that they are sponsoring me for a TS/SCI clearance with polygraph, and the promise of a friend (who recruited me) at the firm that the group I would join would do important and interesting work. He is right, and I'm glad I decided to take the pay-cut to work here. That said, if I decide to start a family, it would be doing them a disservice to continue to work at a firm where my abilities and work are consistently and significantly undervalued.","BAH seems to underpay, even in comparison to other consulting firms.

3350,Booz Allen Hamilton,Unethical and Overbearing Body Shop,2016-12-14,1.0,Consultant,Average 401k matching.  Most of the non management level employees were good people.,"Their business model is to hire high ranking military officials and win contacts via connections.  They have no care in the world if they actually fulfill the job.  Where I was at they destroyed the morale of people who were there before by lowering their pay and housing allowance, claiming they get '$5000/year for training"".  This was also a fraud; it was just a justification for their ridiculous overhead expenses.  The bottom line is they will do absolutely nothing for their employees if your contact doesn't explicitly mention it as a necessity.  There were also people staffed overseas who were considered 'local hires' a year after they were stationed.  That means they must pay their own way back to the states even if they get another job at BAH.  Very, very unethical behavior with many lies to the clients.  Needless to say in many places they have destroyed their reputation with their arrogant hollow corporate culture and negligence of their own workers, especially when compared to other companies who work on the same site in most cases.  They also refuse to help more senior workers get high clearances when the opportunity is there.  Oh yeah, and their ""culture"" is that of a overbearing parent punishing you repeatedly saying it's for your own good with your very own 'career' manager who knows nothing about your skills.   You may think your a well oiled machine with a factory of people writing good responses to various RFP's in DC, but the reality is you are a mirage."
3351,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2016-12-14,3.0,Associate,My project was a rare exception in that I was able to do legislative affairs and public affairs. Working in a military environment was an amazing learning and networking experience.,"No evaluation process for managers. Bad managers continue to get promoted when they weren't that great at their job. My management failed to provide support, yet gave me amazing reviews because they wanted their project to be seen as highly successful."
3352,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company if you're with the right team/client,2016-12-14,4.0,Senior Consultant,"People are great. Colleagues are all smart, professional, nice people (with few exceptions). Management is very open and takes a genuine interest in their staff's career development, beyond just staffing their contracts. There's a great culture of collaboration and support, nothing competitive or cutthroat.

Work-life balance is excellent. Level 1 consultants are capped at 40 and in my experience that is strictly honored by management. Above level 1 I've averaged around 42 hours per week and rarely exceeded 45. If you're working from a company office and not client-site, you'll most likely have flexible hours and telework.

Career growth and advancement opportunities are there if you want them, but can be weak if you aren't actively pursuing them. Highly motivated people are able to advance quickly in salary and title from Consultant to Associate. Above that it's less clearly defined, you generally will have to be able to sell work to get the next promotion but it seems like most are able to get grandfathered in to their first management roles when their manager gets promoted. There's definitely a big culture of promotion from within -- the CEO started here at age 23, and I get the impression that the majority of senior leadership has worked here for 10-20+ years, often as their first job out of college or out of active duty military service.

Benefits are solid. The 401k in particular stands out-- immediate vesting, great fund choices and fee ratios, 6% match for your calendar year contributions as long as you're with the firm on December 31st. $5,500 available per year for external academic tuition and certifications, and there's great free internal training available on top of that. 15 days of PTO for junior staff, and you don't need to take time off when you're sick as long as you can log in to your laptop and telework.","The work at times feels meaningless and like a waste of taxpayer money. I suppose that's the norm with federal consulting. The federal government is notoriously slow-paced and bureaucratic-- simple, quick technical fixes can take an inordinately long time to get the required approvals and funding. Everyone seems very content with their work but nobody seems particularly excited. One DoD client I work with manages a multi-billion dollar budget with a series of disorganized Excel workbooks that have no traceability-- they can't get funding to invest in even basic database and analysis platforms.

Pay seems to be a little below average versus competitors (~5-10%), counterbalanced by advancement rate. Although benefits are good for the most part, the people who have been here since before we went public will tell you about how much better they were back in the day.

If you get stuck on client site, a lot of the pros listed above do not apply. No flexible hours, difficult to network with colleagues and thus difficult to advance your career."

3424,Booz Allen Hamilton,Just a number to management,2016-10-26,2.0,,BAH employs some of the best intelligence professionals in the business.  Many of those have years of experience to share with both clients and company employees.  An employee can network with various people in the company and no one bats an eye when a junior consultant contacts a Principal or VP.,"A candidate receives a lot of attention from management and recruiter during the recruitment process.  After an new employee onboards, management no longer pays attention to the employees.  

Mid-level management is not willing to support employees in advancement or transfer to other opportunities because that had a direct impact to the managers' numbers.  A request for position change or raise of salary is denied due to constraints until the employee submits a resignation letter, then magically the requested item is available.

Management strongly encourages employees to work additional hours even though the work is not compensated.  Employees are expected to complete non-client related company work on their own time.  If an employee was to complete company administrative duty for 8 hours, he/she is expected to still fulfill 40 hours of billable work per week."

Some are more competent than others, but overall the employees all do really great work and genuinely care about their clients. I have a number of friends of mine now who I met working at Booz.","There's a triple threat model that makes it pretty hard to make the jump to Senior Associate. You have to be perceived to be able to (1) execute your work, (2) lead teams, and (3) sell work. The hard part isn't necessarily doing these things, but in being perceived that you're doing these things. I know a number of smart people who could be argued to be meeting these metrics, but, for whatever reason, haven't gotten support from senior leadership for that next-level promotion. To really succeed you need to make lots of friends, socialize a lot, and be a pretty charismatic person. Also, it helps to be a bit lucky ;-)"

3438,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great Company...unless you're a Designer,2016-10-19,4.0,User Experience Designer,"Booz Allen is an excellent company for those looking for job security.  Our clientele mainly involves government agencies and the military, and so contracts with them are numerous and tend to see extensions as more work is added.  The pay is great and the benefits are awesome.  I've enjoyed working with a lot of of my coworkers.  While the office life is more ""Corporate America"" than most fresh-out-college people would prefer, the atmosphere is typically positive and light-hearted.  The firm itself, tries to provide a respectable culture, centered around their core values.  Work is contractual, meaning you're placed on contracts the firm has successfully bid on, and you charge your time to those contracts for your pay for the duration stipulated by the contract.  Because of the numerous contracts attained by Booz every year, work is plentiful, and you'll never get stuck on one thing for too long.","Booz Allen has a problem with providing work to its designers.  Because of the nature of our government and military contracts, most of the work we provide is ""maintenance"" on legacy systems.  This is a huge problem for a designer, because unless you're also a competent back-end programmer or database guru, you're going to be out luck finding a contract that needs your expertise.  Also, because of security concerns, you're typically unable to display work on your portfolio.  Designers live and die by their portfolios, so this is a serious issue for a designer looking to further their career.  During my tenure, I've watched every member of the design branch on our team, leave the firm, either cause the work wasn't furthering their careers, or they couldn't find new work.  When you can't find work, you're placed ""on the bench"" which is our way of saying ""You'll be let go unless you find a contract to charge your time to.""  When I was on the bench a year ago, I tried contacting a team focused purely on UX Design opportunities for the firm, and they were struggling to remain afloat themselves.  This is a significant problem that Booz needs to address, if they want to retain their designers."

3442,Booz Allen Hamilton,Not Great for Salary,2016-10-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Booz Allen offers a good work life balance and in most conditions a stable working environment. The firm has it's hands in a lot of different types of government and commercial consulting work although they are still trying to build out a robust commercial practice. Some work is really consulting but more staff augmentation, which can be good if you want job security and to work on longer projects (1+ years) where you can gain a deeper expertise than a three month engagement.","The firm doesn't pay very well and for candidates fresh out of school expect to get low balled. That goes for both undergraduate and grad school. I have seen some people come in from other consulting firms and get paid decently or work for Booz Allen, leave and come back but unless you come in through one of those methods don't expect to be offered very much. You can also get stuck doing work you don't like and not be able to move to another area if you're talented and the client really likes you. If your looking for a job doing pure consulting look elsewhere. Most of the work is staff augmentation instead of consulting. Watch out if you're given an offer and told they don't have a project for you yet. The firm often hires people with the hopes that they can find work for you and if they can't you get fired."

If you’re good expect regular promotions every 2 – 5 years from Consultant up through Lead Associate.","For high performing people the progression stops at Lead Associate. The company has a bottle neck of very talented people at that level. Promotion to the next level, Senior Associate, is shrouded in mystery.  Unlike most other companies, there is no process for identifying high potential candidates and providing them assignments to grow their talents.

Compensation and benefits are good, and depending on what contract you have, affords for good work-life balance.","During one contract I was bullied by my fellow coworkers, and senior management did nothing about it. I was on a very strict contract. I also found it frustrating that as someone in their early career, I was forced to ""pay my dues"" suffering through boring contracts that didn't teach me anything. This did not put me in a good position for promotion during the very arduous annual review process. During my various projects I only had one manager that I felt like effectively performed as a manager, the rest did not know what they were doing and it was clear they did not care about my career growth or goals."

As a Summer Hire, I was able to meet Horacio Rozanski (CEO of Booz Allen)... TWICE, which I never thought I would get the opportunity ever as an intern anywhere else. The biggest tip I have for someone entering an internship within the firm is to not pigeonhole yourself, rather, network and attend as many events and meet as many people as possible. Apply yourself and this internship opens a lot of doors for you. Oh yeah, and people here are incredibly smart - surround yourself with good people and you start performing at their level.

- Cheap, salary wise - they WILL try to low-ball you, very rarely negotiate on salary
- Not exactly a ""go-getter"" environment - people are comfortable with slow growth
- Not a top tier consulting firm like they try to make themselves out to be"
3573,Booz Allen Hamilton,"More political than the Government with rapidly declining leadership, vision and culture",2016-07-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Mid-level managers (Associated and Lead Associates) keep the business running on a daily basis, are dedicated to their jobs and provide great mentorship for junior staff.

- Most junior staff are extremely talented and dedicated to their jobs.  While senior managers (Principals and above) are generally disengaged at the junior levels, there is still a lot of camaraderie among junior staff, e.g., after work happy hours, team building events, etc.

- The firm has many self-selectable career paths which enable staff to focus and grow in different areas, e.g., specific technical capabilities, business development, leadership, etc.

- The firm has extensive educational resources for junior staff to expand technical skills.  Each staff member receives $5k and 40 hours - annually - for internal or external training.

- Because many client sites are already full, many contracts offer the ability to work from home (some contracts even allow for 5 days/week).  

- Moderately competitive 401k plan with a 6% match.  Decent relocation packages are also provided on an as-needed basis.","- Only the top 5% of senior-most staff (Senior Associates and above) are eligible for annual bonuses.  

- To ensuring ongoing profitability, Senior leadership (Principals and above) frequently rely on administering Lack of Work (LOW) notices to junior staff when contracts end.  LOWs are 2-page letters from HR saying “[you] will be terminated in 2-3 weeks if you do not find new, billable work.”  Unfortunately, even well-managed teams and top-talent are subject to these notices as just a few weeks of non-billability can unhinge a team’s financials.  This creates a culture whereby “nobody is safe” at any moment in time.  If you’re interviewing with Booz, ask your hiring manager or recruiter to provide the number LOWs that were administered in the prior year.

- While the firm has made strategic acquisitions in the past and claims a heavy focus on innovation, the firm has not yet branded any truly innovative products/services outside of its existing contracts.  This occurs primarily because senior leadership struggles maintain proper focus between billability and investments.  For example, whenever investment projects start to take off, billability becomes an issue; whenever billability gets fixed, there’s never enough resources to continue on the investments.  As a result, most “innovations” at the firm never get past a 5-slide “kick-off deck” or a basic user prototype.

- Because of the relative unpredictability associated with Government contracts, the firm undergoes frequent re-orgs whereby senior staff (e.g., Principals and above) switch between technical practices areas, resulting in wide distribution of unqualified leadership across the firm.  Rarely will you find a team where its Senior Associate and/or Principal understand - or even have general technical knowledge in - the inner-workings of their projects, resulting in poor judgement calls, damage to project timelines and lower-quality client deliverables.  If you’re interviewing with Booz, throw a technical question at your prospective Senior Associate/Principal and carefully assess their response.

- The overall culture is extremely political.  At the Associate to Senior Associate level, there seems to be unnecessary focus on how much you network and make it “appear” to your leadership as though you’re engaged (read: the loudest mouth wins).  In some cases, low-billability teams are exempt from layoffs simply because their managers have been long-running buddies with their Principal or VP.  In contrast, other, less-connected teams may suffer layoffs because their Senior Associate and/or Principal are not well-networked with their newly-assigned leaders. This encourages new management to terminate existing staff and re-hire what they think are more qualified staff.  But, by this point, another re org will have occurred…

- Talent is eroding at lower levels because of existing attrition, aforementioned leadership challenges and lack of interesting work.  According to public sources, the firm’s employee base swelled up to 27k in 2014; however, it has now retracted back down to about 21k employees.  Be mindful that this is Government contracting and, despite the firm claiming a heavy focus on innovation, there are rarely opportunities to innovate within the context of a pre-established Government project.  Many of the top talent is now fleeing to smaller, more innovative tech firms, Deloitte and other consulting firms that don’t rely heavily on LOWs.

- Rather than allowing all consultants the opportunity to focus on innovation, the firm recently created a new business unit (read: more unnecessary silos) around innovation, product development and modern technical capabilities (e.g., data science).  Unfortunately, this “business unit only contains 5% of staff, leaving the other 90% to focus strictly on the billability of their existing contracts.  This creates numerous conflicts across internal teams who have somewhat similar skill sets, i.e., the “innovation team” perpetually wants to hire the best and the brightest, leaving only the leftover 95% to focus on existing, more-mundane projects.  

- Benefits have diminished since the company went public and they continue to decline every year.  For the previous 401k program, the firm would add an annual lump sum to your 401k equivalent to 10% of your gross salary; now, the 401k program is a basic 6% match.  Health benefits now consist of high cost, high deductible plans (for all employees below Principal level).  Annual merit increases and promotions are minimal relative to those of other firms.  The only way to get a significant salary-bump is to hand in your resignation and hope for the best.  If you’re interviewing with Booz, ensure your hiring manager has you confirmed for billable work.  To be even more specific, ask them exactly which date you will receive your first “B-number.”

- Senior leadership regularly hires junior staff with no true billability plans and they over-promise on job roles during the interviews. Many senior leaders also rely on resignations and fighting territory wars to artificially grow their areas of the business.  If the interview makes the job sound “too good to be true,” please do your due diligence and get verbal agreement on exactly which projects/clients you will be starting on day-1.  

- The firm has an aging account management and staffing model which puts unnecessary strain on Lead Associates and Senior Associates, effectively requiring them to work 5+ simultaneous jobs to be successful (e.g., ensuring the team is billable, hiring, fueling innovation, leading projects, writing proposals, etc.).  Further, Principals and VPs typically sit in meetings all day, rarely make face time with their teams and expect mid-level management to carry all of the workload/responsibility.  Through my tenure with the firm, I’ve never seen a Principal (or above) write a single word within a proposal or client presentation - they either delegate down or hire/fire to compensate.

- The firm’s resource management function is very different from other consulting firms and arguably broken.  While most companies’ resource managers are dedicated to aligning non-billable staff with billable work, Booz’ resource managers merely review staff availability lists with Senior Associates and Principals - it’s not in their job role to actually understand your team’s skills or contract needs.  This puts significant stain on all levels of management as they must regularly attend these “list reviews” with no actual action from the resource managers. 

- The firm broke off their overhead/operations business into a sub-company.  Because these staff are not client-facing (read: less profitable people are less valuable), almost all benefits for this sub-company (e.g., health, 401k) have been eliminated over the past few years."

3582,Booz Allen Hamilton,Required Work/Life Ratio is Out of Balance!,2016-07-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I sought a position with Booz|Allen|Hamilton after retiring from 40 years of federal service, principally in strategic communications. I had been a senior manager with such responsibilities as ghost writing for senior Defense Department officials and writing speeches. I possessed a Top Secret/SCI clearance and, at age 60 when I retired from the government, was not ready to stop working. I sought a position with BAH because it enjoyed an exceptional reputation and because I had been favorably impressed with the BAH contractors I crossed paths with during my federal service. There were a number of positions I interviewed for and I was ultimately hired to serve as a strategic communications associate on a BAH contract supporting the Defense Health Agency with its TRICARE medical health program for servicemembers and retirees and their dependents. I looked forward to sharing my experience with the members of the BAH team and assisting in the production of exceptional communications products for the client. As a new employee, everyone on the team was very welcoming and helped me through the onboarding process. The members of my team were some of the most intelligent, passionate, diverse and professional colleagues you could ever hope to work with.","Upper management is laser focused on everyone being 100 percent billable to ensure the kinds of profits they forecasted and promised to shareholders. If you are not bringing in ""billable hours"" you will receive a Lack of Work (LOW) letter and will be given 30 days to find a new contract or be let go. That made me feel that I was simply a revenue generator and NOT particularly valued.

For all my experience, I found I was given rather mundane tasks to perform and that the work was not particularly challenging. Creativity in accomplishing tasks was not wanted or encouraged. Further, we were encouraged to NEVER give ideas to clients on how to better accomplish tasks or improve products and told simply to “do precisely what the client wants when he/she wants it.”

The firm also expected that employees attend varied events during our off-work hours in addition to on-site client support. We were also frequently given additional work relating to growing new business for BAH that we were required to do in our leisure time away from supporting our clients. These tasks were frequently provided on short notice with extremely short deadlines for submission and most were definitely the equivalent of another full-time job. Rarely was I compensated for any time I spent working such business development support work. Often, too, the individual placed in charge of pulling the proposal or presentation together to pitch the new business was a young associate seeking a ticket to a promotion. If this individual thought you were being uncooperative or that your level of enthusiasm for the completion of the work was not what it should be, they didn’t hesitate to throw you under the bus with senior managers. These individuals, as well as your team client-support team colleagues, had input to your job performance evaluations. So one was obliged to always “put on a happy face” and do whatever one was asked to avoid negative assessments from coworkers and colleagues.

Further, I found there was very little direction from management in how many tasks were to be performed. It's a lot of demanding to get things done without much direction, which is fine as far as avoiding micro-management. Perhaps because of my years of experience my colleagues and managers felt they didn’t have to give me much direction, but most of the time I felt like I was out on an island figuring most things out by myself. Colleagues were so busy getting their assigned work done, and ensuring that they got their 42 billable work hours each week, that I didn’t want to bother them for help or direction on how to complete some tasks. This, as you might imagine, led to dissatisfaction with work and afraid to ask for help. 

Management is required to constantly be bringing in new business and they couldn’t be working business development if they were always answering “stupid questions” from subordinates or explaining to superiors why a particular employee wasn’t functioning at 100 percent.

On my team, the team manager was located in another state. We held daily staff meetings by conference call and she would actually be on-site in the client support role only a couple of days each month. That wasn’t really a sufficient amount of time to get to know me very well or to know what my strengths were so that I could be given tasks appropriate to my experience. 

I was an 80 percent disabled veteran when I left military service. This required that I have numerous appointments for health care for various medical issues, most frequently during work hours. I tried to schedule as many of the appointments during pre-work or after work hours, but that was not always possible. Paid time off with BAH is rare and there are NO DESIGNATED SICK DAYS. So, I found myself always in a running battle with both my client site manager and my career manager over my needs to take time off. I was lectured more than once about how my absences from the workplace demonstrated a “lack of concern” for the client and for BAH and that I should stop such absences IMMEDIATELY. So, needless to say, my career manager was on my case about this CONSTANTLY. While hiring me may have helped BAH reach some goals for hiring disabled workers or disabled veterans, they were not happy or supportive of the time I had to take off for medical appointments. The career manager is the person who has nearly complete control over your career path and can force you down a road you don’t like if they don’t like you. I’m afraid that was one lesson I learned the hard way at BAH.

To stay 100 percent billable, I was never to be sitting at my desk waiting for someone to assign me work. If I was efficient with my time and completed tasks faster than was anticipated, I was expected to be eagerly seeking other work and the “right work.”

There is a lack of passion, culture, and real leadership. There is a ton of management. The "" Leadership"" team dusts off core values and ethics a couple times a year but doesn't live these or demonstrate them on a daily basis. The ""culture"" of the firms seems to be manufactured - a lot of people pretending there is a meaningful culture. It's not that there is a negative culture, it's just that it's very bland, neutral and not at all aligned to what the firm says it is.

Finally, I lost that TS/SCI clearance while working for BAH because I wasn’t engaged in work requiring such a clearance. BAH uses clearances to substitute for a National Agency Check and doesn’t assume custody of an employee’s clearance. Rather they allow unused clearances to “archive,” meaning an individual can lose their clearance because it is not being actively used."

- Networking
- Ability to move around company of you don't like your role. 

I have been with Booz Allen for more than a decade. I have risen through the ranks and have a solid understanding of its culture, it's motivations, its clients and how to work within its ecosystem. 

Pros.... hmm there truly are many. Especially if you are coming from college, do not have a young family and are very hungry, having the flexibility to work long hours. 
I am actually thankful for all of the opportunities provided from my time at Bah. I have met a lot of really smart people and gone to many fascinating places and have done thing a people would only wish for.","- They have removed several holidays and our ""floating"" holiday. 
- Benefits are no longer competitive. 
- Work Life balance is awful. 
- Claiming that you can take training or use your Education benefit is a joke. 
- Teams are constantly shuffled from leadership to leadership to help ""develop"" whatever capability is hot at the time. 
- Internal processes differ from team to team and are at the discretion of the Career Manager. 
- if you can't perform your job using the standard issued Booz Allen laptop, you're out of luck. Trying to get your team to purchase equipment that are industry standards externally, feels much like you would imagine presenting a case to congress. 
- I feel their decision to move to ""hoteling"" destroyed the sense of team that used to exist. 

The work life balance at Booz Allen is not very good. On average you are required to work 42 hour work weeks (the 2 extra hours supposedly make up for the training you'll never be able to take. But the pressure your leadership will put on you will far exceed that. I have had many pay periods in which I have put in 60, 70+ hours a week. I have had to spend the night on more nights than I would like to admit to meet deadlines with a short turn. 

The promotion process is truly up to the leadership of your team. Regardless of meeting and consistently working at all of the firm provided criteria for the competencies at the next level, how high-performing you are, the amount of staff you manage, the amount of money you bring to your team or how many awards you've won, if your leadership doesn't think you belong at the next level, then you'll never be promoted. 

They don't value employees who have been with the firm for a very long time and bring an extensive understanding of government clients and solutions. I have a close friend who has been with the firm for almost 20 years. He has only been promoted once (not uncommon - you can choose to stay at your level and not move up). He has been awarded many times by various teams for his participation to projects over the years and has never been a discipline or behavior risk. Bottom line, he is solid and I would use him on every project if I could. His only true raises have been ""cost of living"" raises over the years. Since he has been there so long, his ""rate"" has gotten too expensive for contracts. And because they can't let him go for any other reasons like performance, discipline etc... Management has been ""drying"" up his work and offering him opportunities which he can't consider (for example, in a whole other geography).  After his work has dried up his work, he will be given a lack of work notice. Unless he's placed on a ""long-term"" contract he will be let go. 

Booz Allen used to really be the greatest place to work for. Unfortunately, that is no lager the case. Expect to be worked like a dog, treated as if you are never working hard enough regardless of hours. Expect to get emails and phone calls late into the evening and over weekends that will require your attention. 

During the hiring process they will talk about all of the great benefits like insurance and the education credit. I know terms of insurance, I pay more out of pocket now than I ever have. For the education, you will only be ""reimbursed"" for it after your leadership has approved that it is a skill you'll be able to apply toward your client service offering. And if they do approve it, you will still be on h hook to paying for it and they will pay you back. 

As time has progressed it has also become more cut throat. Don't expect to lead a team unless your team leads move into a new role or you develop a ""new service offering""."

3659,Booz Allen Hamilton,Decent company to work for,2016-06-10,3.0,Intelligence Analyst,"It is a prestigious organization and has a very good reputation, but as a consulting organization, and as an employer. Compensation is good. For a large firm, management is easy enough to talk to.

In an unfortunate turn of events, when I got to the work site, I found that I was instead the bottom-rung hourly worker bee in an administrative office with no number-crunching computers, no scientific software, and no database, and that my work isn't actually funded and the contract expires in a few months. I was also not-so-politely informed that my business opinions are not, shall we say, prudent to express. I know it sounds like I must have run over the President's dog, but no, nothing like that happened; it was just one of those bait and switch business situations. I know that they did need my resume in order to try to obtain funding, so perhaps that explains the bait and switch."

Many individuals at my same level came in at anywhere from 5 K less to 10 K more with similar backgrounds. There are also no bonuses. This creates a culture of negative feelings towards the company. Further, paid time off days are few and there are no designated sick days. Raises are extremely low (0-3%), and consultants of many levels are known to be laid off for lack of finding work (despite having strong skillets and good educational/work backgrounds). Experiences vary widely based on project, but some colleagues in various accounts have been deferred promotions based on a lack of ""expertise developed.""

3697,Booz Allen Hamilton,Former Associate,2016-05-15,2.0,Associate,"Some staff are excellent (as you will find in other organizations as well). My direct senior staff fell into this excellent group, which was truly the only reason I stayed for as long as I did.","The hours are completely unreasonable for client-facing staff.  Expectation and requirement is to bill 40 hours/week to client work.  If you work on anything not directly billable (""B"" work) such as proposals (grueling work, ""P"" work though and not B work) or marketing work (""M"") you will be asked to make up the hours you spent on these other business-related tasks in additional B work.  This can easily lead to consistent 50-60 hour work weeks, sometimes more.  Expect a few 70 hour work weeks.  Everything you do that is NOT billable work you will have to make up on your own time, evenings, weekends, vacations, all-nighters.  I've been in th workforce for over 30 years post-degree, and Booz Allen is the only place since college where I've had to pull all-nighters.  

Another con ... The quality (low) of some project managers.  Not only in skills (people skills seem to be lacking among many) but in an overriding sense of entitlement and better-than-thou attitude.  Makes working on some projects unbearable.  

The performance assessment system is a joke.  It is a 360 assessment, but everyone knows who wrote what about them ... Thus, those poor quality people get rated far too leniently because who wants their PM (or any coworker for that matter) to have a personal vendetta against them?  

Finally, since the hotelling concept, everyone works at home and there is complete loss of comraderie and group cohesion and no friendships are formed beyond work related phone calls and emails.  Very sad. 

Many in here reported on the loss of benefits. Yes, very true. But for me I would take a pay cut to have the other coins I mentioned above ironed out.  Just couldn't take it anymore, left after 6 years."

Heaven for the principals.,Old Booz is gone and will never come back. It's a revolving door with a charge code. If the consultant has no charge code then he/she will get a lack of work notice and get kicked out in heart beat. Many consultants get hired and spend on the average a year and then out with no mercy or consideration for having families or kids at home. OLE Boys Clubs everywhere and if the consultant is unable to join any of those clubs he/she will never be able to join a project.

You work with great colleagues and are always challenged to go above and beyond in your work.  Working in a multi-contractor setting, I take pride being a part of Booz as I truly feel the firm gives you tools to outperform others.  

Very happy with my PTO and holidays accrual.  Most teams in the firm are VERY flexible with scheduling and work/life balance.","Booz loves to say that they hire your for a career and not a job.  Overall, I'd say this is true.  However, the increase of Lack of Work letters (layoffs) and previous cuts from a few years ago demonstrates that things have changes since BAH went public.  They are about the bottom-line albeit probably not as bad as other contractors. 

While the 401k is better than most it is not what it used to be.  The previous program made BAH a differentiator.  Now it's only slightly better. 

The health benefits have taken a huge hit since JAN2015. The employee's contribution has increased about 20% and out of pocket expenses have skyrocketed since DEC2014.  The switch to more of a Hoteling firm has led to cost efficiencies, but the ""Booz Allen Culture"" has been lost.  

Wages have stagnated along with the economy, so wage growth is slow depending on your level.  Lastly, very easy to get lost on client site and miss out on firm initiatives and growth.   You have to be proactive to be noticed and make your own opportunities."

3735,Booz Allen Hamilton,Disappointing,2016-04-27,2.0,Senior Consultant Level II,"Good pay, decent benefits, solid start company for anyone getting out of college or out of the military.","Much like college or the military, you either love it or leave it. I'll say I've worked for two Fortune 100 ""Top companies to work for"": Quiktrip, the gas station and Booz Allen Hamilton. I'll say that if you, as an employee, value leadership that cares about you, invests in your education and advancement, and actively listens to complaints and suggestions, you should pick the gas station. 

A lot of reviews on here pin point Booz's failures when they went public and senior leadership began catering to shareholders, which is very true. Decentralized leadership (who the employee has never actually personally worked with) absolutely does lead to loss of human capital that will eventually create professional generation gaps across the firm as people are given lack of work statements, are fired, or are let go. 

Every experience is different, but I would only suggest Booz as a transitory job and not as a career. I expected the contacting environment to be ruthless coming into it, but I expected that razor's edge to be surgical rather than all over the place. Much like all federal jobs, military or civilian, the best people leave and the underperformers stay around forever. Those are your leaders."
3736,Booz Allen Hamilton,Internal Admin Professional,2016-04-27,4.0,Administrative Professional,"I've found my managers at BAH are very responsive and supportive. They are very flexible with work arrangements. I can work from home a couple of days every week, and when I do go into the office, it's usually one that's very convenient from my home. PTO is typical from what you'd find at other consulting companies. They provide deposits into your HSA to offset the medical deductible.","The consumer driven, high deductible health plan is so bad that it makes you not want to go to the doctor for anything outside of preventative coverage. The least expensive doctors are in Virginia, which makes it inconvenient for me since I live in DC. They also offer an HMO plan, but it's an HMO plan. I couldn't continue to see the doctors that I'd found and respected. Although my position is labeled as an Admin Professional, the tasks I do on a day-to-day basis are not admin related. Unfortunately, that means I'm on a career track that will lead nowhere at BAH."

They also have what can be considered a best in business 401k program.,The de-centralized nature of having consultants at client site gives local mangers far too much autonomy to work outside of the corporate culture. I would also add that the pay is not always reflective of what is asked of the employees and is definitely impacted during contract changes in order to maintain a fat corporate profit margin.

They have an internal social media where you can connect with coworkers near and far and that can be a great networking tool if you utilize it.,"When I say the firm is great with all their perks and then you are on a specific team where the growing pains were to a point where the work environment was full of ignorant people who think they know the industry inside and out. Then you have a bunch of HR complaints that go nowhere because they only believe the ""higher ups"" and think you are overreacting. There was so many HR complaints on a couple individuals, the onsite HR team didn't do anything. Basically leaving you there to rot and eventually ruin your reputation on the team because those ignorant people get away with a lot of stuff and bullying was a big issue to say the least. If you get a job offer to join the ""IMAG TEAM"", I would highly consider looking elsewhere where your talents would be more appreciated and the environment is more comfortable."

At the end of the contract, the employee is responsible for finding another engagement within the company and if they cannot do so within two weeks, they can be fired. Management has no responsibility. There are a lot of opportunities for work, BUT 99% of them require relocation, which is not an option for everyone. Frankly, they don't pay enough to make a relocation like that worthwhile, especially given the short term nature of most of the work. The company really does not invest in its employees. They say they will pay for training courses, but then the money is never available. Even if you do take training, you have to make up the hours in additional billable work.  

The 401K match only occurs once a year, not quarterly. The upshot is that if an employee leaves in the middle of the year, they can kiss any portion of the match good bye. I don't know any other company that does that.

The company talks a good game about ethics and values, but I have seen senior management make decisions where they then require employees to lie to customers."

Good amount of resources available to you as a new employee to navigate the firm (Zone, People, Welcome Packet etc). You are given an experienced career manager who gives you insider knowledge and paves a way for you to begin career development not just thrown out there to fend for yourself. You meet talented hardworking individuals who for the most part are friendly and helpful.","I would like to say that this is solely my experience not to be generalized for all others who work at the firm as I would imagine some may have better experiences. The main problem I have with the firm is the lack of positions available for junior staff with no experience or security clearances. Most junior projects you apply to want a minimum of 1 year experience and/or a security clearance both of which are hard to attain as a recent university grad with no prior work experience. Majority of your time is spent sitting around doing nothing except struggling to find a project and doing mediocre tasks that no one wants to do (planning dinners for management, planning hiring events, getting the pizza at the door etc). Company in general is really sloppy and miscommunication occurs way too often (hiring managers don't respond to your emails, interviewers skip or forget to interview you, you are promised a position but then find out said position doesn't exist etc). In reality unless you are a seasoned professional with a minimum of 3 years experience and an active security clearance it will be incredibly difficult to succeed at this firm.  To put the icing on the cake the firm tries to push all of their employees to get ""billable"" meaning when time is running out you will be scrambling to find a project that barely fits your skill set just so you can become billable and not be let go. This isn't an environment for solid career development. If you are a recent university grad thinking about joining this firm reconsider and exhaust all other possible options first."

They started mucking with our Paid Time Off (PTO/vacation) and were also apparently playing lots of contract games with the government. They ended up losing lots of those contracts and the office I used to work in near BWI Airport is almost entirely shutdown now.

I worked for many years in the office, but now the firm allows me to telecommute which has been wonderful. The work is interesting and challenging, we have a strong culture of diversity, I love that we're in Working Mother magazine's ""100 Best Companies"" Hall of Fame and that the number of women hired and promoted to senior levels keeps growing significantly. There are clear paths for advancement and the benefits are amazing (the firm helps pay for adoptions! They match 6% of your contributions to your 401K! Onsite fitness centers! Childcare discounts! Great leave policies! So much more.) I love the people, the flex-work opportunities, the huge focus on the health of employees, and the culture where we work hard but have fun too... lots of fun employee events, contests, networking opportunities, family events, etc. I really like our new CEO too. He worked his way up through the company (started as an intern in Argentina 2 decades ago), he's very personable, and he's a strong proponent of diversity. I've worked at Booz Allen so long that I sometimes take the firm's benefits and culture for granted, but when I talk with friends at other companies I'm reminded just how great I have it.","I know the economy took a hit nationwide and Booz Allen did a great job keeping staff and benefits, but raises have been pretty low across the board for a few years."

This team also had no work-life balance and asking to take time off was frowned upon. I've seen this across the firm in pockets.

Culture is very collaborative- it's expected that you will support projects others initiate (which can be a con, unless you're initiating the work).","It's probably like this at any consulting firm: we are always developing new products, focusing on different problems, hiring new people. There is a lot of ""new"" which can at times make it hard to stay focused on the long-term projects and priorities that are important but not as splashy.

BAH truly does take work-life balance to heart and it’s not tongue in cheek when you're told your efforts are appreciated and noticed. Wages and benefits are competitive, but the true value of working at Booz Allen Hamilton is the environment, opportunities to advance, networking and finally the company culture/value system. BAH is the benchmark for consulting and is the catalyst for the success of several Fortune 500 companies and Government Departments. If one commits to doing their job well, being professional, adhering to the company's core values and continuing their education, there are no limits to where you can land.","The company is very government contract-centric and the headquarters is located in the D.C. area.

Overall highly recommend for a software developer looking to grow and work on cutting-edge technology. A definite pro is also the company's positive outlook on community/employee-driven change with internal competitions (and awards!) to improve things like work-life balance and ergonomics to name just a few at the firm: also lots of start up type things happening all the time. Another thing I loved was meeting my principal on my first day and all the opportunities to get to know senior leadership.","The one thing that comes to mind is the company ought to make it mandatory for an incoming employee to be provided - either at orientation or by his/her career manager upon starting - their respective org chart, and a larger one covering their working group.

- Overly preoccupied with a dress code
- Difficult to build up time off",2016-02-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company follows the Fed holiday calendar, that's about all I can think of for Pros of this company unfortunately.","- Work/Life balance here is BS.  Difficult to move around to get exposure to other skills, projects, etc
- BAH prefers to hire externally rather than allowing current employees the chance to move around
- Be prepared to use your PTO/VAC time to cover bad weather days when the Fed offices are closed
- Stuffy, uptight dress code.  Dress shirts/pants mandatory, ties were mandatory depending on the management, however it didn't seem like the rules applied to everyone equally.
- In the event of bad weather and the Fed offices were closed, BAH would penalize YOU for that by forcing you to use your VAC/PTO time to cover that day.  I've worked at different Fed contractors prior to BAH and have never encountered this ridiculous tactic.  Previous employers would code the day as a holiday, company overhead or a regular workday for the employee
- Bait and switch. When I was hired, I was hired for a position that I applied for and interviewed for, at least that's what I thought. 

I was at the 2-day orientation seminar at the VA headquarters when a guy in the group (someone attending the orientation as well) approached me and introduced himself and stated where he will be working and the office (same office as me). He was hired for a completely different job function and area than I was, but the same office.  The guy recognized my name  (name tags we all were wearing) which is what prompted the introduction. 

He then said I'll be working with him as well in the same group. I corrected him and said ""oh no, I was interviewed for and hired for (blank position). You must have me mixed up with someone else"". 

He said he didn't have me mixed up and I'll be doing 'job ABC' instead of 'job XYZ' (the position I was hired for). It turned out he was correct. 

I learned about the initial deceptive practices regarding my position of this company from a stranger coming up to me at the VA employee orientation and informing me I'm not going to be working in the position I was hired for. That's HOW I found out.

The manager I got was NOT the manager I interviewed with. I asked (different managers) why I was placed in 'job ABC' and not the job I was hired for. I do not think that's an unreasonable question. I never really got a clear answer, even after asking multiple times. I was told I would be phased into the position I was hired for down the road after an expected volume of work was cleared out (just 2-3 months max is what I was told).

The manager I was assigned to did not want me there from the beginning. His dislike for me was evident from the first moment I met him. Why did this person have a problem with me? No idea. The other people in the group (including the guy from orientation) were treated differently than I was. 

After a period of about 7 months (the volume of work was lowered in 'job ABC' where I was 'helping out') and not being phased into the role I was hired for I was told the position I applied for no longer existed and 'job ABC' (which I didn't like anyway) was being phased out. 

I ended being 'benched' for a while. During that time I found another job AWAY from BAH, gave a standard notice and got the hell out of there!

- They hire too many people it seems. Lots of lack of work notices are given after a while (less than a year in the offices I worked at). 

- Some of the people are nice to work with, but the vast majority have zero social/people skills.  

- They seem to hire a lot of younger, fresh out of school grads and work them to death. 

- Most of the employees at the office I worked at seemed uptight, highly stressed and agitated. I didn't get a chance to know many of them other than small talk in passing.

- The work/life balance mantra BAH likes to emphasize is complete BS. 

- I began to notice LOTS of BAH faces I would normally see in hallways, elevators and cubicles disappearing before I left (the last 6 months working there). I asked someone there whom I trust what's happening with these people disappearing and she told me either they're finding other jobs, or contracts aren't being renewed by the Feds or they're getting lack of work notices. 

- You will be set up for failure. Tasks will not be explained to you effectively and when you do something wrong (due to lack of guidance from management) they try to make you look incompetent. I would not be surprised if this is done to people intentionally.

The mentality is old school. Wear jeans for crying out loud. The majority of people at my location are sitting in cubicles most of the day (except to go to the bathroom, vending machine or lunch), what difference does the clothing make? Ridiculous. 

BAH lost a contract the week after I gave my notice which put a number of people on the bench with me. They were told the same thing as I was. We were told that 'WE' had to find ourselves other positions in the company to avoid a layoff. Management was zero help with this matter and they really could've cared less."

You need to stay employed by a project team to keep your job, and this becomes harder the more you get promoted and the higher your salary gets. You become more ""expensive"" as your rate goes up, so it's hard to get that internal hire.

Most hiring managers don't want to hire internally, especially if they're making a business case for Senior Associate. You have to show that you're building the business, not just shuffling around existing talent. Priority is actually given to external hires!

This is not the Booz Allen Hamilton of yester-year, and anyone in the industry knows that. They've axed benefits, paid time off.

Job-Stability: I can't stress this enough. Get ready to always be looking for a job, once you join Booz Allen. A friend of mine observed ""It seems ever since you went to Booz Allen, you've been looking for a job.""

One new co-worker at Booz came from Accenture, and told me, inquisitively, ""You know, it's not really clear who it is that's responsible for keeping you billable. (employed)"" I had to admit grudgingly ""Well, just you.""  He expressed to me that they have what is known as an ""Engagement Manager"" of some sort, who actually is held accountable for keeping you billable when your project ends.

There are two ""resources"", if you can call them that, at Booz Allen to supposedly help you stay employed when your current project ends. 

One is the ""Career Manager"", which everybody has, but their job is not really to keep you billable. Being a Career Manager just consists of additional responsibilities on top of that person's regular job. They pretty much just dole out general guidelines and tips. 

The second is an internal department called ""Resource Management"", staffed by what are called ""Resource Managers"", but again, they are also not held accountable for actually getting people placed in jobs. All they do is give you lip service about reaching out on your behalf, and they can provide an extra layer of visibility if you're up against a Lack of Work (impending layoff) situation. It's got to be the easiest job in the world. I would love to have a job where I'm not held to any standard or held accountable for actual results. You can think of them as your college's career counselors (you know, the [usually] state employees who haven't had to look for a job in 20 years?)

Career growth: No one will really level with you about what it takes to be promoted. You can try to discuss with your leadership what concrete steps need to be taken, and gaps that need to be filled, but nobody will have that discussion with you.  They'll simply tout abstract ""Core Values"" and blame you for not understanding it what it takes."

3954,Booz Allen Hamilton,Fascinating Work Where You Own Your Career,2016-01-11,5.0,,"The work at Booz Allen is fascinating - it is fast paced and impactful.  It has given me the chance to understand the inner workings of the government and be incredibly close to decision making.  Over the past decade, I have had the chance to work on multiple assignments, gain increasing levels of responsibility, and have never been bored.  I have had high-quality managers and the Firm has invested in my growth (a graduate degree and multiple certificates).","Occasionally decision-making at Booz Allen can feel bureaucratic - especially things that go back to headquarters.  You have to own your career - and build your network to identify new projects and growth opportunities.  Your manager can guide you, but you alone are responsible."
3955,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Fun company, not a place for young engineers",2016-01-10,3.0,Electrical/Systems Engineer I,"Great people, great benefits, great hours. Good mentors. Easy to move up.","Low Salary, all employees are hired the same regardless of degree. Engineers are paid equal salary as English majors when first hired. Not a great place to develop skills. Sometimes hired for numbers and not specific to the field or the candidate. Inconsistent work assignments."
3956,Booz Allen Hamilton,Neutral,2016-01-10,3.0,Associate,"Fairly stable work - between the government shutdowns, and switching contracts, our group has been lucky enough to be supported.","The assessment process is a nightmare. Given a few hours to complete a lengthy review, that boils down to a checklist for work we can't talk about, feedback from people we don't work with, for a promotion we won't get. As others have pointed out, it seams to come down to your career manager and who you know."
3957,Booz Allen Hamilton,Huge company; important to find the right team,2016-01-09,3.0,Associate,"I had an incredible team. My supervisor believed in me, encouraged me, gave me opportunities to grow. In a male-dominant company, I managed to find a number of inspiring and rising females.  The name of this company carries weight in the Washington, DC area. (Unfortunately, it doesn't carry much weight outside of this city though.)","It never felt like a cohesive company to me. I never knew what the strategy was, what was driving the company, or why changes were made. For a company with so many change management professionals, they didn't communicate or execute change very well. Though I had a positive experience on my team, colleagues on other teams had entirely different experiences."
3958,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company,2016-01-08,5.0,,The interaction between the business partners  and the plans provided from the workers is phenomenal.

3960,Booz Allen Hamilton,Depends on your manager and contract,2016-01-07,2.0,Lead Associate,"You will work with some very smart people.  It can be very flexible. You can learn a lot.  But see the cons below.  It just really really depends on your client and manager.  DO YOUR HOME WORK and make sure you understand how your boss and client does things, and see if you will fit the culture.

Another pro that I say without hesitation is that the Booz Allen name has a fair amount of cache.","As multiple people with in the company say, this is a company run by fear.  It's a very hierarchical company, ex-military company.  If someone above tells you to jump, don't ask how high, just do it, and do it fast.  Before meeting our new partner over our group, our boss had four meetings with the team on how not to ask stupid questions.  I've seen people told, ""Why are you in this meeting, get out!""  Another co-worker in another group was told in front of the client, ""Go sit in the lobby quietly and don't bother us.""  A poor 21 entry level guy was berated in the hallway by some random senior guy for not wearing a tie (we don't have to wear ties mind you).  The sad thing, is no one within the company blinks an eye at these stories.  Unless you have a high tolerance for work place bullying, I would be cautious."

The people are friendly. The benefits are decent, as is the pay. Stability is strong, unless you're on the consulting side where unless you keep developing and reinventing yourself, you'll find yourself on the bench and possible being told you are getting LOW'd.  May be adding business casual fridays...it's about time.","Company culture has become stale and needs re-energizing.  The suit culture is very old school, but they are trying to implement business casual Fridays. People are constantly moved around to the point people don't know why they are reporting to and treated like a widget more than an employee. The constant hiring and firing because of hiring before the work comes in has GOT to stop, or we will keep seeing sharp people quit 6 months after hire. Leadership is very disconnected with their staff and what they are working on."

Benefits and compensation over the last few years have decreased dramatically and BAH no longer offers a competitive rewards package compared to other consulting firms and other industries outside consulting. It is extremely hard to get a market salary increase so your best option is to leave the firm."

3970,Booz Allen Hamilton,No Corporate support makes it impossible to perform.....,2016-01-04,2.0,,Great Company. Almost no brand recognition in the Boston area. Very difficult to compete with other major consulting firms locally.,Almost no support from the home office in Washington DC. Very clique oriented environment. Almost no internal support systems.
3971,Booz Allen Hamilton,Tremendous Company,2016-01-04,5.0,Lead Associate,"Booz Allen is one of the best places to work in the government contracting sector. Despite recent cutbacks (attributed to government budget uncertainty and a corporate transition to a publicly held company), Booz offers a strong benefits package and competitive salaries.  What's more refreshing is the corporate culture.  As a consulting business, the company is committed to developing talented, providing avenues of self improvement, and a retaining skilled/marketable employees.  Contrasted with an industry that looks at employees only as project-specific resources, this employee-focused culture enables employees to define their own career paths and creates an entrepreneurial climate where good ideas are generally rewarded.  

The company is forward-thinking and self-correcting.  Leaders emphasize employing best practices to deliver a unique working experience.  The company embraces teleworking (where contractual constraints allow) and provides employees with a wealth of resources, intellectual capital, and training to build a world-class workforce.  

In summary, as far as government contractors are concerned, the company is a breath of fresh air and offers a unique experience that many enjoy.","Booz' entrepreneurial climate isn't for everyone.  Some interpret the focus on self-improvement and networking as a sink-or-swim culture.  Networking at Booz is built around the ability to offer an in-demand service or capability across project or market boundaries.  It's not necessarily about self-promotion as some interpret it.  It's just about understanding how your skills translate to other projects or markets.  This becomes more complicated if one's career management team is not actively engaged in helping the employee understand how their skills can be useful in other project/markets; the team doesn't actively search for follow-on work.  

So, if you are more inclined to focus on providing common solutions in a particular field, say computer systems administrator without having to contribute thought leadership, building technical/market expertise, and working across projects, Booz Allen may not be the right place to work."

3976,Booz Allen Hamilton,Government contracting system needs to be improved,2015-12-31,4.0,Systems Engineer,"This company was a good place to work. My fellow employees were a great group of people, which made going to work a pleasant experience. We did some really interesting work, was very successful solving problems and had a great time doing it.",All contract work positions have limited life spans. This is a real detriment to the company that you are contracted to solve their problems. When your contract expires all the knowledge and synergy that you have created is gone. The next group that gets the contract must start from scratch to come together and make the project work.
3977,Booz Allen Hamilton,Give voice to your potential,2015-12-31,4.0,,"Lots of flexibility, interesting projects.",Work experience and enjoyment depends heavily on what team you're assigned to and whether they consider you part of their team or an individual intermittently in need of a contract
3978,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2015-12-31,5.0,Associate,"Comparatively strong benefits package, Value placed on the individual but it depends on the assigned team, pay","Since going public some cost saving policies have gone into effect:  40 hours per year allocated training/certification time must now be made up, meaning if you take a 5-day professional development certification course (like PMP) -which both the employee and the firm benefit from, you are required to work additional hours on chargeable contracts to make up the lost 40 hours.  Proposal work also falls in the ""make up hours category"".  To be fair, given the pay, benefits and other perks, management had to make some hard choices to stay competitive and keep share holders happy.  -probably unavoidable."
3979,Booz Allen Hamilton,Former Military,2015-12-30,4.0,Associate,"Depending upon your office location, there are opportunities to work on a number of different projects that stretch you and make you stronger overall. The work is usually pretty interesting and the people are top-notch. It's not a bad company to work for.","If you get out of the military, recognize it's difficult to shake your last rank. What that means is if you leave as a master sergeant, it's hard to break into a leadership role in some offices because it's occupied by retired O5s and above. And while nobody overtly throws around their former ranks, it is often subtly referred to. 

Also remember that if you're working government/military contracts, you haven't joined ""The Corporate World"". You're still ""a military dude"" in the eyes of most corporate hiring managers. So, if you intend on transitioning to being a civilian completely, then this may not be the right choice for you."

Pay is pretty good especially considering I don't have a degree (I do have experience to make up for it). Benefits are decent. Premiums for my family and myself are relatively affordable.,"Booz Allen Hamilton tells you during new hire orientation that the company is family-friendly and flexible, if you need to take time off don't hesitate to do so, and you can work from home too if you need to. What they don't tell you is none of this applies if you are working on a client site where you will be expected every day, between the core established hours, and if you take time off make sure your work is covered or there will be hell to pay later. This completely contradicts the fact that if you're out sick or had a family emergency you really aren't thinking about work, you're thinking about your family or getting over your sickness, but they'll still expect you to not drop the ball.

Micromanaging and the ""We're Booz Allen, we're the best and everyone else sucks and is incompetent"" mentality gets old quick. Be prepared to have someone looking over your shoulder when you do your work to make sure you don't screw it up. I'm pretty good with details and am a bit of a perfectionist but this is a whole other level. And also be prepared to take over client tasks that aren't being led by Booz Allen, just because your task lead or supervisor thinks Booz Allen could do a better job. Yeah, that'll go over well with the people who were actually brought on to manage the task.

Vacation and sick leave are lumped into one pot of time, so if you get sick often like me be prepared to not have any vacation time available to ummm, go on vacation. I am of the opinion that employees shouldn't have to sacrifice vacation time for being sick."

The firm also demonstrates its interest and push for talent management and human capital development: Job managers and career managers in my account group are engaged with employees, provide functional expertise to clients and employees, and the firm's culture is one that encourages sharing of cross-functional intellectual capital.  There are limitless opportunities for professional development and pursuit of personal interests that relate to one's functional area.  Compensation involves a total package approach, and my experience has shown a willingness for job managers to allow employees to accept other internal positions rather than standing in the way.","Direct compensation is a bit lower than other firms providing similar services, and bonuses are few and far between.

Realities being what they are consulting, especially Federal consulting can be challenging depending on different situations that come up - but the firm has made real commitment to keeping it's people through government shutdowns, economic slowdowns, and the shifting market in general.  I am new to the client-side of consulting, I have worked in the Big 4 previously on the services side, and I am enjoying the challenge of the transition and the impact of working directly with clients in the field solving big problems that face our citizens and their government.","If you have an open mind and are interested in being a consultant - meaning you want to learn how to be effective with clients and with your own team within the organization, and you are not afraid of hard work, Booz Allen is a great place to be.

I interviewed very carefully for a certain project, but even then I was bait and switched. Trying to find another project is a big no-no here apparently (tried but had stern conversations with about 5 higher ups), so I guess I'm stuck.

If you're looking for a modern tech-oriented company, I highly, highly suggest looking elsewhere. Don't fall for the money or the spiel.

The medical coverage used to be great but declined significantly. All three of the available health and dental plans have high deductibles. Tuition benefits are decent ($5000 reimbursement per year).
Job Security: One of the downsides of the great job security was that it seemed very difficult for management to terminate people who underperformed. You and your colleagues are then forced to pick up the slack for people who should not be on your team.
Work/Life Balance: Our team would often work over 40 hours per week. You constantly feel like your work takes precedence over your life. There seems to be little attention to any type of work/life balance.

The firm used to have core values and people respected management.  However, I'd say in the San Diego office the turnover is probably some 40 people/month out of an 800-person workforce.

Advancement based on merit is not common but more of a business decision and unless one asks for advancement and then works with a plan to achieve agreed upon goals, promotions are rare.

Every client will be different, but mine allowed telework for my entire current 4 year period and Booz has no issues with that.","Proposal work!! If you want to move up at all in Booz you MUST do proposal work and help bring in business. Most proposal work is done at night and weekends AFTER you have completed your daily job for your client, and team calls typically take place 7 days a week between 6-8 PM for the duration of a proposal, and there are absolutely no incentives for participating in proposal work other than possible promotion some day. Typically people work their day job and proposals on nights and weekends for years hoping for a promotion. Only senior management receives bonuses based on proposal wins. Unless you want to be married to work, consider this a job without upward mobility.

Horrible employees get rewarded by being left alone. My management has tried to have 2 employees that telework and simply do not contribute fired on multiple occasions but HR always blocks it. In our unique situation these employees could have another full time job and no one would ever know. In the end the company doesn't care about individual performance as long as the team gets the job done.

4152,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2015-09-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall this company is great, at least it was when I first started in 2007. The DC office was great because I had never seen so many smart people.  I was always wondering how I tricked them to allow me in. In 2014 the health benefits were top notch but I have heard they may have changed. The profit sharing ECAP used to be great but that was also changing.  So when I was with this company my experience was great. Perks were always fun with great parties, happy hours, and baseball events. Tampa Leadership at the time I left were great people and would do anything they could for you (as long as YOU felt comfortable talking to them). When I first left the DC office, the leadership in McLean were instrumental in helping me move back to my hometown in Florida. Best experience with work life balance, if you work in the Kennedy office.  Otherwise if you are client site, is the client requires it, you can't usually work from home. Pay was very competitive for the Tampa area.  Performance Appraisal process is fair and thoughtful.  Very much aligned to great companies and how they rate their employees.  Very goal oriented appraisals.  Tuition reimbursement is a great bonus!","In Tampa specifically, management was very military-male donminated with little female leadership. Management didn't make it to client-site locations very often, which was not good for morale. Client work was starting to dwindle making many employees nervous about finding their next project. There is a lack of certain type of work in Tampa, which makes it difficult to move to different contracts if you are burnt out or thinking of leaving. The company was quick to give Lack of Work (LOW) notices with may people being let go. I saw a lot of this the last 3 years of my employment. The client site employees didn't always feel connected to the corporate Kennedy office, which also didn't help morale. They are slowly losing what made them special as a company and premier consulting firm. This started to happen after going public. Budgets for fun activities and such is disappearing, which was always one of the perks. In order to advance in this company, you have to be available 24/7 by your phone and email and be involved in responding to RFPs. And even if you are a hard worker and involved, you can be passed up for promotions because you would then become too expensive for your contract and price yourself out of work. So there is a balance of wanting to become leadership and having a contract that fits your work and pay grade."

Very hit or miss on management on whether or not they want to promote you.  Circumstances and timing are everything.  Some folks go from Consultant to Associate in 2 years while others stay Sr Consultants or lower for quite a while because of nature of contract/project.  Feeling of disconnection from Leadership.  So much emphasis on stock price and forecasting that wages only increased around the same as inflation for most employees, while we keep getting great outlooks for growth or good earnings reports."
4159,Booz Allen Hamilton,"What they say and what they do, The Dichotomy of BAH",2015-09-14,1.0,Associate,"People, always great people from various backgrounds who work hard serving clients on a daily basis.","Promotions:  Non-existent for most employees as there is no written formal path to promotion.  It is entirely upon your leadership to submit a request and verify that your market can absorb the increase of your new salary (2-5%), If this is not possible you will sit at the same level for several years.

Salary: Barter high when you come on board because salary increases are extremely sparse at the lower employee level, most receive between 0-2% a year.  Discussions to increase salary according to increased client work, obtaining an advanced degree or certification will not result in any increase, sadly.

Bonuses: These only occur at the Senior Associate level and higher, so if you spend nights and weekends working on proposals and doing business development, you only helped pad their compensation packet for the year.  You will receive nothing for your time other than a thank you E-mail.

Survey: Results are dismal in several areas primarily with salary, compensation, bonuses, and the like.  Senior leadership has touted transparency and fixes, but to date hasn't even briefed the results other than a snippet of the results that were massaged in order to shape the message.

Career assessment: Career assessment has no linkage to yearly salary adjustment, it is merely a paper drill to make someone feel like they are helping.  Most career managers within the company are the same level as the people they are managing, which makes it a little difficult to recommend ho to succeed from the same hole.  Most career managers are just time card monitors who check to see if you have done your time daily.  Sad excuse for career progression, definitely not a Google or Amazon type of work environment.

Transparency: Near zero, once in awhile the CEO  sends out an E-mail to state where he has been and what he has been up to, very little material on who he saw and what they were doing.  Very little leadership engagement with employees, most have never seen there leadership at all.  Like an episode of Undercover Boss in reverse, most couldn't tell you who their leadership were at the 3rd level above them, since they have never received an E-mail from them nor seen them.  Surveys come out once a year, but they are pre-populated with weighted answers that phrase questions such as, do you like X or love X, do you think you leadership has done a fantastic job or great job.  Very poor survey approach with no ability to capture what is wrong with the company.  No ability to either capture the issues nor to effect change on them if captured.  Left hand of the firm has no clue what the right hand is doing.  Nor regard for anyone at the associate and below level, if the CEO wanted to know what was going on within the firm he would grab individuals from remote sites, client sites and little no name sites with 10 people and ask them how he could help, but nope, its picture time, let me go to the big locations and get some golfing in.

4181,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2015-09-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Thought provoking, fast moving, capable and smart workforce with a good blend of youth and mature staffing.","Booz went public and literally walked away from itself.  It became more of a body shop than a consulting firm.  Leadership abandoned its staff, it is highly political.  Leadership does not listen to its staff and staff are in fear everyday of losing their jobs.  It isn't a way to live or work."
4182,Booz Allen Hamilton,A good place to start. Then get out.,2015-09-02,3.0,Associate,"Booz Allen still attracts some of the smartest and hard-working people around. To a great extent, it is possible to shape your career if you are a tireless networker who keeps an ear open at all times for new opportunities. There's also a good amount of growth at the Consultant to Associate level, with the opportunity to gain managerial experience relatively quickly. After five years at the firm, I was managing a team. This is experience that would be very difficult to come by in government and other firms.

The retirement match is one of the best in the contracting world with a 100% match up to 6% of salary. The BIG catch is that the company match is done only once per year, and if you are not an employee on December 31st, you don't receive any of the match. Tuition reimbursement is generous at $5000 per year.","The firm is so focused on its bottom line and return to shareholders that it is nickel and diming its employees to death. Attrition is VERY HIGH, something approaching 50%. We went from having excellent health insurance to a high-deductible plan that doubled my monthly health insurance costs. Management moved to a hoteling system whereby employees reserve space on a daily basis. This would be ok, except that management took way 30% of the available space to give to senior leadership as permanent offices. Where are we supposed to work? Annual salary increases are meager. A rating of exceeds gets a paltry 3%. A promotion gets 7% without an adjustment to the new responsibilities of the new title. Being promoted to Lead Associate is akin to a death sentence because there won't be any contracts that can afford you. Then there's the constant fear of being laid off. Two week of no billable hours and you're fired. That's precisely why employees look for jobs elsewhere as well as inside the firm when their contracts are up. There's nothing to foster any kind of company loyalty."

If you fit in with the team you are on, it can be a good environment, with your managers seeking out positions for you and helping you move ahead.","The company has become even more hierarchical and autocratic than it was when I joined 8 years ago. It has changed significantly from when it was a private firm. In addition, the government client is no longer the easy ""cash cow"" it was traditionally. It is trying to maintain the image of itself being a thought-leader, but generally we have become a ""seat in chair"" operation -- contractors rather than consultants. New grads and inexperienced employees make the company more profitable. Some teams feel like ""sororities"" rather than a professional team."
4191,Booz Allen Hamilton,Booz Allen survives on their name alone,2015-08-28,1.0,Senior Consultant,Having the name Booz Allen Hamilton on your resume impresses recruiters. There are probably good teams at Booz Allen but I've never encountered any.,"Booz Allen operates on a team structure where the Senior Associates dictate the culture of their domain. Of the four teams I was on, one Senior didn't care about the people under him, another only cared about how you contributed to proposals (not how well you supported the client), a third created a toxic work environment and flat out told me he would not help me find another contract after I said I was looking for another one, and the last one was dishonest and met with government officials to get insider information on upcoming contract information.

Working our way down the management structure to the Lead Associates, the story doesn't get any better. On one team, the Lead was friends with certain people outside of work. Those people were looked after and got the promotions and bonuses. For everyone else, it's not hard to fabricate some excuse as to why you didn't get the promotion or didn't qualify for a bonus. Being the one in charge of performance metrics, I knew who really deserved the promotions and bonuses. When the Lead's friends who are in the bottom 50% get promoted twice in 2 years and others get nothing, its clearly favoritism. Other Leads stake their career on the work of those under them because they don't have the skill to get the work done. They will act friendly to you but if you ever ask for anything in return like a raise, you wont get any help. And once you move on, they will turn against you.

Moving down to Associates, you encounter a group of people who throw around their position as a low level manager to cover for the fact that they probably don't know how to do any of the work they're asking you to do for them. And once you do that work, they generally have no moral qualms with taking all the credit.

And now we get to the backbone of Booz Allen, the Consultants and Senior Consultants. These are the people who do the real work at Booz Allen and generally don't get paid any near the market average to do so. In this group there are two types of people, those who are enamored by the Booz Allen name and will try to move up the ladder and those who realize that they're getting paid well below the market average and move on to something better. Unfortunately, the former group often coincides with less talented people who like to play it safe and just sit there and do their menial job and nothing more.

Beyond the employees, Booz Allen has corrupted the government to such an extent that they should be banned from competing on contracts at many agencies. After moving on from Booz Allen, I joined a small company that had recently unseated Booz Allen from a contract after the office consolidated two teams (Booz Allen's and ours) into one team. The company I joined was given high ratings while Booz was given average ratings. We were given a 6 month contract with the option of additional 6 month increments. We were also competing with Booz Allen for another contract in the same office. Booz Allen, still unhappy being unseated and having already corrupted the government official in charge of the contracts, had the government add an addendum to the contract we were both competing for that said the winner would get both that contract and the contract that Booz had just lost (the one they were rated as average). Booz won the contract and we were out despite having fairly won the contract 6 months prior and having had years of excellent performance in that position. After winning, Booz Allen tried to recruit everyone from the team I was on. Not a single person went to Booz."

4196,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate / Lead Technologist / Lead Engineer,2015-08-26,2.0,Associate/Lead Technologist/Lead Engineer,"The on boarding (although it has been streamlined over the years) is relatively thorough and helps new hires get adjusted to company culture and expectations.

Recently the company has taken steps to offer alternative career paths to those who are less interested in the business development/proposal work and want to focus on more technical/domain specific work where they can utilize their subject matter expertise.","Like most companies there are things you need to deal with to ""navigate"" a successful career. Without a decent mentor it will be difficult to know this.

Resource Management: The resource management process, on paper, is a great way for the firm to align the skills and interests of their employees to new opportunities once they are not billable. However in the interest of getting billable work quickly employees are urged to be ""flexible"" so while you may be qualified for a role you may not necessarily be interested in it (doesn't align with your short term or long term career goals, commute is not beneficial for you.....etc). Different management teams will handle this differently but for the most part there is a significant amount of pressure to accept an assignment sooner (rather than continue looking for a better fit) so as to mitigate overhead charging. Also, while employees are encouraged to be the CEO of their own careers the expectation is to work their current assignment through the period of performance. This is a bit conflicting because employees may find a role that is a better fit for them vs their current assignment. 

Advocacy: Simply put if you do not have a strong advocate in management your pay increase and potential for promotion will be disappointing. This may pose a problem to those who work on client site full time and are limited by how much face to face interaction they can have with management at the local Booz Allen office. High performing individuals with excellent annual reviews (including amazing feedback/reviews from the client) can end up with standard pay increases. If you want to be promoted it needs to be clear to your career manager so that both sides can knowledge the milestones you need to hit for the next level. Just doing good work will not cut it. Again, even if you do both of these things well your efforts can impaired if your brand is not strong with your management."

Overly weighted with salespeople who promise the world that can't be delivered, and with very tedious ""butts in seats"" positions at government agencies. The interesting work in between (except cyber and analytics) is few and far between because it's not what we're known for. The politics and fiefdoms affect everything. The attribute most valued is time at BAH, which can frustrate smart people with good experience coming from the outside. You'll see top performers with a dozen years of excellent experience and graduate degrees be hired from the outside at the same level (Senior Consultant) as a top performer a year out of undergrad who spent that year at BAH. It's changing, but right now there's a premium for joining out of undergrad and putting in time, a kind of grade inflation, that doesn't map to mid career hires.

This makes work/life balance challenging at times. Additionally, the higher you are promoted, the more ""expensive"" you become... which makes it harder to stay billable (you will no longer be considered for certain roles, given your cost as a resource). It seems a strategy to pressure senior leaders to grow their teams, if we are over-hiring then letting people go a few months later. Benefits have changed dramatically for the worse and pay increases are nowhere near what they used to be.

The firm is very supportive to employees who have to relocate due to military family moves or other reasons employees have to relocate. While they can't guarantee they will have a position for you in your new location, they have an entire team dedicated to helping you find a new position and make every effort to do so. Great access to upper and senior management, including Partners.","When I first started 10 years ago, the firm had separate vacation and sick leave banks, and the sick leave was UNLIMITED (yes, you read that correctly). They then switched to one bank of Paid Time Off (PTO) to use for sick time and vacation, so you are basically penalized by draining any potential vacation time you have if God forbid you get really sick and have to use up all your PTO due to illness. On top of that, the amount of PTO time is not very generous and is accrued based on your career level and years of service. So, if you are an entry level consultant and just starting out, forget about earning much vacation time until you have a few years under your belt and promote to higher levels. The firm also promotes a work-life balance, but in my experience this varies by individual team, and I've seen little work-life balance demonstrated."
4226,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company but heading downhill in terms of people management,2015-08-11,3.0,Law Department,Booz Allen has a great reputation and it is well deserved.  The employees and leadership are great at what they do and the services we offer clients are really the best in the business.  Saying you work for Booz allows you to do so with pride and most people recognize the company when you mention it.  They have OK benefits and their compensation it competitive,"Benefits have declined in the last few years.  They are still above the minimum but they are not very competitive anymore.  I used to think I was receiving amazing benefits but now when I talk to friends outside the company I realize we are a bit behind.  The medical plans went up in price significantly and high deductibles where added.  PTO is horribly low with only 3 weeks to start and that doesn't increase for five years.  There is no sick time so if you need to be out, you have to use the PTO.  On top of that, the company now follows the government holiday schedule which means the day after thanksgiving is a work day, so you have to take PTO for that too.  They used to have floating holidays, but they stripped those from us because we gained federal holidays...Columbus Day...Exciting!  Resource management is also not very good anymore.  The recruiters are ineffective and not very helpful when you want to apply internally.  They say they are all about hiring from within first, but in my department alone, more than half of all the new people in the last year came from outside even though there was interest among the team."
4227,Booz Allen Hamilton,OK,2015-08-11,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,Many projects to choose from.,Benefits aren't as good as they used to be.
4228,Booz Allen Hamilton,Consultant,2015-08-10,4.0,,BAH gives you amazing real world business experience. The project(s) you work on can give you unique experience in the federal government.,"In my experience, my admin team didn't do much for me. I was switched to a different team twice which meant I couldn't develop my relationship with my SA easily. My last LA did nothing for me."
4229,Booz Allen Hamilton,Continued ups and downs over six+ years,2015-08-10,1.0,Associate,"If you can find the right team with the right people, then you'll have a great experience.  I would only watch that you don't get too comfortable in those seats.  They way federal contracts are positioned, it's easy for senior management to get complacent and then lose the contract.","Senior managers will tell you, at any level, thank you need to sell work and that they have a rewards process in place to compensate you.  This is no process that's been defined to compensate you other than you annual review/raise.  Ask a senior manage and they won't be able ot provide any details on this place but they'll encourage you to sell for them.  

There is no office culture or harmony among staff.  Management is just looking to put a butt in a seat in order to bill the govt.  If you tell your manager that you're not interested in a position that they offer you, then prepare to be ignored.  Even if you've stated your goals and are on a billiable project; you will be ignored.  

I feel that I've attempted to gain traction across several different projects within my six+ years and there is either turn over from management (so you start over with a new person), or the contract is lost because the leadership screwed up the negotiations.  

The real heros at this company are the Associates and below.  They actually DO all the work and get none of the benefits. 

Oh and pretty much any fringe benefits are gone or now costs a lot more.  They're trying to ""remain competitive"" which translates to ""it's your problem now."""
4230,Booz Allen Hamilton,Lead Associate,2015-08-10,4.0,Lead Associate,"The collaboration across the Firm was incredible, nothing like I had seen before or since. The salary was slightly above average, and the benefits were above average. I enjoyed working there for almost 7 years.","Near the end of my employment, I felt boxed in.  I felt that I did not have a lot of opportunities to move up, so I left voluntarily.  When I left, the Firm was reducing some of the benefits to make the Firm more competitive."

I was promoted twice within 4 years in terms of level (Senior Consultant to Associate to Lead Associate) and twice in terms of position (team leader to deputy PM to PM) and was never able to achieve a salary commensurate with my work and responsibilities.  As a PM I was paid less than the people answering the phones for the client on the contract I managed.  I brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars over my target profit but was told there was no money for a raise.

No accountability for senior leaders who don't meet standards of decently so long as they bring in the money."

Orientation was a full week of ice breakers with free lunch and free hotel stays in the Tysons/DC area for people from out of town.  They really make you feel special when they interview and hire you.,"It seemed like a very cut throat business atmosphere to me.  They really push employees to grow the business and that seems like the only way to get promotions.  They assign you a career manager who is actually just a more senior employee than yourself, but those people have their own jobs/clients to take care of so it's really up to you do do all the work of advancing your career."

The diversity of employee backgrounds brings rich value to project work and to the client.  If you need to augment your team's skill set with something else, you will absolutely find it either through your network or resource management.  I also consistently feel that the work we do is making an impact.","The company has changed a great deal since going public a few years ago.  Pressures on utilization have increased greatly - the amount of people getting a ""lack of work"" notice  has increased. People are not given adequate credit for all of the extra proposal/BD work they do on top of billable work... the pressure to be billable is higher, yet the expectation to do BD work  ""in your free time"" remains the same.  This makes work/life balance challenging at times. Additionally, the higher you are promoted, the more ""expensive"" you become... which makes it harder to stay billable (you will no longer be considered for certain roles, given your cost as a resource). It seems a strategy to pressure senior leaders to grow their teams, if we are over-hiring then letting people go a few months later. Benefits have changed dramatically for the worse and pay increases are nowhere near what they used to be.  The retirement plan and healthcare benefits are MUCH worse than they used to be (albeit still better than many other firms.)  You will be lucky if you get a 2% increase, so it does not keep pace with inflation certainly.  There are no bonuses.

Turnover is most likely 40%/month and the firm has gone from one that's concerned with their employees and grooming them upward to one that is concerned about one thing, one thing only...the bottom line. I was let go during a recompete of a government contract and asked beforehand if I would be willing to accept a 20-30% pay cut and though I agreed, the Principal I worked for went ahead and hired someone behind me at even a lower salary.  I heard about my lay-off when he slid a ""lack of work"" notice across his desk to me...effective date my birthday.  Also, people say they are good about helping you find work within the company; my assistance consisted of HR sending me a spreadsheet and it was up to me to contact various program managers to see if they required my expertise.  
     My last day consisted of my PM meeting me in the parking lot to get my badge and laptop...think this made me feel like a valued member of the team? Oh, well three weeks later they had a luncheon and praised my good work.  The financial result was crippling to me; nearly 18 months to find a job during the worst recession in years.  The only way I'd recommend someone take a job with this group is if they were desperate and were actively seeking employment elsewhere.  Of the 20 or so people on my team, perhaps 3 still remain with the firm with the vast majority taking lower-paying, but more secure government jobs.

For example, some teams within the same market bring on new hires based on experience and education. Others do not. There is no reason somebody fresh out of school should be making the same as someone with a graduate degree and a year or two of relevant experience or several years of work experience. It is also hard to comprehend why teams in the same market/client space bring people on 20-25% higher than others. As a career manager, we've brought these issues up to leadership who ultimately don''t act on it. That leads to managers not taking the time to invest in the staff they manage because they know they will be gone in less than a year.

I wish management would realize we are not volunteers and they need to take of their greatest asset…..people. As many other folks have written there has been an erosion of what made Booz Allen so great before….culture! Management has taken note, but I’m not sure there is anything to do at this point to turn the ship around. Attrition rates have been VERY high and I heard that recently it was over 25%.

Booz Allen is what you make of it.

Nice people to work with.","Since going public the culture has been on a steady decline and is a shadow of its former self. Same goes for benefits. While not horrible, benefits are just average now. Health insurance benefits changed significantly this year and are pretty poor. Salary increases have also changed greatly and HR's market data for salaries is not accurate. In all fairness, much of this is driven market and not necessarily Booz Allen's fault. Although, if/when there is an upswing, I doubt things will go back to the way they were. 

Attrition has not been good. I have seen many very talented colleagues leave over the past few years. Hiring standards have also decreased.

Utilization/billability trumps everything. If you are out of work, resource management is not really that useful. It all comes down to your personal network.

40 hours of training time is not free. You are expected to make up the time that you use.

Work life balance is what you make of it. If you want to get promoted/noticed/good raise, you will need to work your standard 40-42 hours AND sacrifice your free time (often nights and weekends) working on proposals, marketing, and other administrative tasks.The frequency increases as you move up the ranks and declining work/opportunities is frowned upon. I do not feel like these personal sacrifices are appreciated. 

Promotions not so much dependent on merit as they are politics.

Annual reorganizations and internal rebranding efforts. Enough with the flashy media campaigns already.

- Innovation is squelched, despite the creation of a very large innovation group. The company uses almost none of the technologies and skills it purports to be expert in.
- The company's business operations team (called the GO team) is disconnected from market demands and mostly cannot be relied on to do anything except make life difficult.
- The company is positioned poorly in the marketplace.

Company tries to do good for employees.,"Company often over-engineers change.  Constant stream of change supposedly to improve, but often crafted in white granite halls devoid of working level impact or input. 
 
Federal government is company’s bread and butter.  There is no profit motive, and it shows.  Taxpayer dollars flow in.  Work is largely in support of giving the bureaucracy meaning.   You get insight to inner workings of tax dollars.  Very sad and depressing how wasteful the government is, lots of uncaring workforce collecting a check and great benefits, waiting to retire at taxpayer expense.  Majority of work ends up sitting on shelf collecting dust, just check in box busy work. 
 
Lots of change since going public.  Droves of knowledgeable people quit or laid off.  Continuing decline of benefits to feed shareholders.  Loss of 401k automatic contribution was watershed moment.  Minuscule pay raises limited by government trip wire (salary limits) and contract limits. 
 
Company no longer a firm.  Butts in seats is the model.  Stay billable.  Branding has suffered immensely and less time to invest in building new markets.  Company once considered itself the “Mercedes-Benz” of government consulting, but is now a run of the mill sedan. 
 
Senior Associates (start of management level) and above panic when March comes around (end of fiscal year).  That’s when annual layoffs happen.  Annual headache created by  going public. 
 
Senior leadership constantly repackages services to make it seem new and improved.  There’s only so much “improvement” you can do in a government services environment.   But they are slick at creating smoke and mirrors flashy marketing material and presentations.  Sad thing is the government clients are years behind (software, management concepts, value stream, streamlining), so they don’t know better.  What also fuels this is many retired military and DoD clients work at companies like Booz Allen.  They have contacts.  The old boy network thrives. 

It's not Deloitte & Touche, McKesson, or Price Waterhouse.  It's DoD consulting, which may be an oxymoron."

4448,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2015-04-24,2.0,Associate,"Overall, work / life balance is good up to Associate.  Depending on project, there are opportunities to work remotely (can be good and bad).  There are a lot of motivated and smart people.  Company's brand still carries weight.  Benefits, while not as goos as they once where, are industry compettivie.","Shocking erosion of corporate culture over the last five years and continuing to move down the value chain in terms of work conducted for clients.  The firms investments in people have seriously declined and they have become miserly regarding benefits, pay, team building activities.  Sadly, what was once one of the premiere consulting firms has become a staff augmentation shop.  Interesting project opportunities are few and far, often it is embarrassing to admit what work you actually do for clients.  More embarrassingly, are senior management's characterizing / spin the work as interesting and impactful. While there are still many smart people at the firm, the departure of dynamic staff (smart, balanced, with good interpersonal skills) continues to accelerate.  Additionally, career progression is opaque and does not follow logic.  This isn't anything new.  Pay scales are distorted and wide (e.g., staff at a lower level earning significantly more than those at a higher level sqashes motivation for advancement).  As mentioned, a lot of smart people remain and the firm still attracts some good people (not sure how long this can last as the brand will continue to erode given the current state), but these ""smart"" people are often overly ambitious people who do not work well with others and think they'll be promoted to partner next week (lol) and will do anything to make that happen (including back stabbing, shameless kiss up to SAs, Principals, Partners). Much of the aforementioned results from the Carlyle investment and becoming a publicly traded company.  When we joined BAH, a part of our intro. training focused on how BAH is not a public company and professional services organizations shouldn't be publicly traded companies...well that piece of the training is gone.  Now, quarterly earnings and bottom line is all that matters.  Becoming public enriched many of the partners, but is destroying the company and brand."

I think the quality of Booz Allen has gone down. 
- They promoted several people who had been fired by the client and the more of a jerk/backstabber you were the more quickly you climbed the ladder.  
- They started giving lack of work letters to people who had been with the company 10+ years and who had always been stellar performers versus looking at the people who were marginal performers (but who currently happened to be billable).  
- When I left for maternity leave I handed over PM responsibilities I had to a co-worker ""x"".    When I returned a new level had been introduced and person to whom I had handed over my PM responsibilities, ""x""  was promoted and I was not.  When I asked why I had been promoted to the ""lead"" role the manager said it was because I did not have the project management experience and said ""x"" got promoted because she's leading ""y"" project (my old project).

4480,Booz Allen Hamilton,Decent Place to Build Career,2015-03-28,4.0,Associate,"I started at Booz Allen Hamilton directly after undergrad. Was contacted by a recruiter who noticed my previous internships with defense contractors. Signed a contingent offer, got cleared during final semester in school, started right away.

Started off on a billable contract right away. Was offered little to no guidance but using common logic and networking skills I was able to grow my contacts, shadow IT and business development experts, and become familiar with the consulting model.

Depending on your contract the work can be extremely challenging. Staff come and go and only the strong survive in client-space. If you have a political/feudal government client - good luck. Know how to play the game. Work hard and look out for yourself, place your teammates in a position to succeed. Selfish individuals are immediately identified and not rewarded by management.

In my short tenure I made opportunities for myself by leading change and demonstrating exceptional delivery. I was rewarded with back-to-back promotions (Consultant -> Sr. Consultant -> Associate) in 2 years.

Firm training is decent but not advertised. You will determine how your career progresses. Non-existent hand-holding.","Benefits have noticeably decreased the past few years. 401k dropped from 10% employer contribution to 7.5% matching to 6% matching. Health insurance deductibles are in effect this year. Employees are unhappy and frustrated.

I have witnessed cases in which top talent were given LOW letters due to their contract funding being cut. Most employees sit around and twiddle their thumbs, banking their careers on their career managers. If the career manager is busy, on vacation, or simply not knowledgeable enough to find new billable work... it's bye bye for you. Keep in mind career managers have basic training and seminars they attend - but they aren't all-knowing.  Network network network to put yourself in the best position to succeed and survive in this tough market.

The different account leaders are not collaborating at an effective level. Staff turnover can be prevented if home teams communicate with one another on horizontal staff transitions.

The firm is in danger of becoming another seat-filler corporation. I am lucky enough to be highly visible to management because of the excellent work I'm doing. But some of my teammates feel very alienated from leadership and are unaware of our business operations. Everyone is busy and I noticed the folks that complain are the ones who do not do anything about it. They are unwilling to work a single minute over 40 hours a week, refuse to attend company socials, and badmouth teammates that succeed. Management is performed at the micro level and it seems to be hit-or-miss depending on client and work location."

The firm has a ton of networking/social events for you to connect with other interns and upper level employees. These events are paid for in full, so no out of the pocket cost. Also, at theses events you are able to get an idea of the other areas of business Booz Allen is involved. You can possibly leverage these relationships and work in an area of the firm that you are more interested in.

Booz Allen still lives on its reputation from the past.  It was once a thriving, top employee driven firm with the best and the brightest employees and top level benefits.  If you happen to land on the right team and project, it can still be that way.  However, as many others have mentioned, that is not the majority of cases anymore.  It does have many offices and that can be helpful since employees can work at any location which helps with commutes.  Some good managers still exist at the mid-level area in the firm and they do try to support their employees.","Booz Allen's entire executive management team needs to be replaced...including the recent promotion they had to CEO.  They do not understand business strategy (and actually any leadership concepts) and you can't even discuss topics with them without a set of PowerPoint slides that ""look pretty.""   When they say ""strategy"" at the firm, they really mean ""organizational realignment"" and not true business strategic planning.  So....every year or tow, they move boxes around on the organizational chart and they change the names of the groups. I guess no one has read any Harvard business strategy publications.  Shrader was an engineer and lived off the old general market strategy of using client relationships to win additional work.  However, the market changed and when clients said they needed to save monies, they cut higher paid employees and still went for ""generic work"" that others can do.  They also cut operating costs without understanding how their changes would impact the work environment for employees.  Their strategy to hire employees without having any contracts to place them on was disastrous the first, second, and third time they tried this (it took 3 times of this insanity????).  They will probably do it again too.  Partners are so far removed from their employees and day-to-day work they don't know what proposals have true chances of winning and what skill sets their team members truly possess.  How can you run a business that way?  The leadership does not seem to understand that the employees that are available to work and that they are hiring versus the work they are selling is a huge mismatch.  Then, they blame internal staff for the problems that they create.  They continue to promote employees to higher level management that have no management skills and they do not apply performance measures to management."

4517,Booz Allen Hamilton,Lost Its Reputation,2015-03-04,2.0,Lead Associate,"When BAH was privately held, the reputation was valid. We were an ethical company that provided a good return on the clients' investments in us. The firm supported the employees with great benefits (ECAP) and kept people on when a contract ended or a position was de-scoped while they (both the employee and the firm) looked for another contract. I felt valued and well compensated.","That all changed when the Carlyle Group bought out the private side. After a couple of years, the BAH leadership took the firm public. And everything went downhill from there. It was clear that the shareholders were the most important part of the equation. People were no longer kept on whilst looking for another contract, wages began to freeze, raises (if you were lucky enough to get one) went from 6% (my average) to 1% within a year (and I had the best performance review I'd ever had!). The quality of people hired was far below what it had been due to the lower salary they began offering. Many of the best leaders left the firm or were let go after years of employment. Benefits were cut drastically. The ECAP became a 401K with standard matching. With ECAP, the firm contributed an average of 10% of my salary while I never contributed a dime. With the 401K, I was required to contribute and with the matching, the total was far less than the ECAP.

Even though the compensation and benefits decreased, the expectations of the firm remained the same: MUST work on proposals (above your billable hours), the assessment process (""revised"" almost annually to ""improve"" the process) remained time consuming and ridiculous (even though one can only record 8 hours for the effort), and the ethics which had been so valued began to erode. I personally brought an ethics violation to my management, it was investigated, and even though all agreed it was a serious violation (on top of other well documented performance issues), the firm decided to retain the employee because ""we need the billable hours he/she brings in""."

4537,Booz Allen Hamilton,Senior Consultant (Contracts) Extremely Disappointing!! WORST Career Decision EVER.,2015-02-16,1.0,Senior Consultant (Contracts Client Site),"- Matched my previous pay 
- Paid for my relocation costs (you have to repay it if you leave within a year)","Let me preface this with your experience with BAH is 100% dependent on your IMMEDIATE TEAM. I cannot speak for the company as a whole or upper management since I was only there for a little over a year. I've had friends who love BAH and friends who despised it; my personal experience was a complete nightmare and the worst career decision of my life thus far. I was hired as a Senior Consultant for the contracts management team.

Before I came to BAH I worked for the government as a Contract Specialist. I had experience with supply and services contracts primarily in the R&D arena (CPFF, CPAF, and FFP contract types varying in complexity and size $150,000 - >$250M). I also had a good amount of knowledge in the pre-award process, solicitations, RFPs, RFQs, proposal evaluation, cost & price analysis, contract award, post-award management, FAR, DFAR, NMCARS, SPS/PD2.

None of that mattered because once I started at BAH I was put on a team with a Team Lead who literally micro-managed every single aspect of my time at work and didn't trust anyone. One of the first things she said to me was ""you need to CC me on EVERY SINGLE e-mail you send out,"" I thought she was joking and was about to laugh when I realized she was 100% serious. With all that experience I was only given tasks that I performed easily within the first 3 months of my previous government job. I felt like they didn't utilize my potential and knowledge base. To make matters worst my Team Lead was incompetent, she rarely did any work and would throw you under the bus in meetings if something went bad and personally take credit for things when they were good. She would CONSTANTLY ask ME how contracts were structured and how they worked and information about the FAR and DFARs clauses and how it applied to the contract and then VERBATIM repeat that to the client to appear intelligent. I always saw her on Facebook, shopping online, IMing her friends, or on her phone. She would always tell everyone how busy she was and how much work she had to do, but would do none of it herself and assigned the work to her team while she shopped online and looked at vacation places (and we were at the client site 100% of the time) which is extremely unprofessional. She would literally berate her team, including me, in public and yell at us whenever she was frustrated or stressed (about what I have no clue because she didn't do anything). If you didn't cater to her ego and do everything she asked without question she would write you a terrible performance review, have you put on probation, and eventually fired (which happened to my friend and teammate who, by the way, had a law degree from UC Berkeley so she was pretty bright). To make matters worst this woman was my Career Manager so I had no one to go to for help. I did have a talk with her about the whole situation and how I felt under utilized and how she treats her team and me, but that just made things worst. I looked into transferring to another team, but that wasn't viable if there wasn't a space available on another contract, department, or a need. Plus my current Team Lead was my Career Manager too so I could assume I wasn't going to get a fair recommendation. In addition, she was in cahoots with the Senior Associate and continually stroked his ego so I knew no one would have my back or fight for me.

The last 9 months of this job was literally the worst in my professional life. I dreaded going to work everyday because of this person and would count down the minutes until I could leave. She also pretty much implicitly said you couldn't go out to lunch and to just eat at your desk. When you would go to talk to another co-worker she would come back after you left and ask that person what you were talking about. I was afraid to say anything at work to her or anyone else in fear that she would have one of her outbreaks and berate you. I was also afraid about how she would impact my career and mobility. I was literally mentally exhausted everyday and professionally depressed, not because of the work at all (which was mind numbing-ly easy) but because of this single person. Even though I made the team and her look good in front of the client and her boss with the sheer amount of contract mods I was doing, I knew what was going to happen come performance review time since I didn't stroke her ego, and asked questions when she didn't make sense. To protect myself I put in my 2 weeks notice right when my 1 year was up so I didn't have to repay the relocation costs and so she wouldn't stain my professional career with a terrible performance review. 

Overall, if I was put on a team that actually was intelligent and did meaningful work I might have had a different outlook which is why your experience here is really dependent on the team you get put on and the people you work with. Unfortunately, I was stuck in a hard place with no one to back me up which only makes you feel more miserable and hopeless."
4538,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Good people, changed culture",2015-02-16,3.0,Associate,"The people at Booz Allen are some of the best you'll work with anywhere--bright, motivated, and highly professional. It remains a great place for entry-level professionals coming out of college or graduate degree programs, as their labor rates are lower so they will have an easier time finding projects and gaining exposure to career advancement opportunities.","As others have acknowledged, the corporate culture has distinctly changed. ""Billability"" has become the lowest common denominator for determining employee value; upon contract end, you have a slim margin of time--sometimes days--before lack-of-work (LOW) notice. Although employees are expected to seek out their own opportunities, there is very little guidance or support to help match employees to open opportunities, and the Resource Management system intended to perform this function is understaffed. Even when securely on a contract, this emphasis on billable targets impedes career development as it encourages staff to stay put in minimal-growth opportunities for the sake of job security. 

Individual experiences vary significantly, however, because there is wide disparity in how teams manage their budgets and staff. It seems that a team's leadership has free reign to determine its own LOW policy and make other significant decisions impacting staff without Firm-wide guidance. Such leadership decisions tended to feel reactive rather than proactive and were often poorly communicated to staff."

4546,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Once Great, Now Declining",2015-02-10,3.0,Associate,"Work-life flexibility, talented colleagues, big and resilient, variance of work, secure employment. Booz Allen is a large and established consulting firm, where it's easy to work there for your whole career if you chose to. Environment is energetic and smart, and the company is big enough that it's easy to find new work and/or new clients while retaining your current position.","For the past 5 years, Booz Allen has been focused more on shareholders and bottom line than on employees and clients. Our emails from upper management tout increasing profits despite declining revenue - like it's a good thing. It is a good thing, for the shareholders, but the slashing that's taken place to make it possible have all directly affected the employees. 

First came small and pretty inconsequential changes - no more biannual laptop upgrades, then our first big change: from everyone having their own office to ""hoteling,"" where each employee reserves an office each day and checks into and out of it like a hotel room. This allowed Booz Allen (BAH) to eliminate empty offices (employees who were on client sites always or almost always) and consolidate employees. A reasonable change, and understandable. 

Next came compensation changes we were told that our compensation actions (read: raises) were to no longer be tied solely to performance, but rather a host of new criteria, one of which was ""bid-ability on contracts,"" meaning ""will your salary make it easy or hard to bid you on contracts?"" Of course, proposals compete largely on cost, so it's always easier to bid a cheaper employee on a proposal, so this gave leadership a way to freeze salaries or give paltry or in some cases insulting raises with a black and white justification, and the deniability of ""it came from upstairs."" Lots of talented employees jumped ship at this stage, because raises are the #1 tangible retention tool, and many took these paltry raises as writing on the wall that they were no longer appreciated at BAH.

More recently, BAH is selling real estate - closing offices. That's a magic trick that can prop up the bottom line, but you can only use that trick once. 

The most recent change has been to our benefits - in short, more expensive healthcare with high deductibles. For example, my plan cost increases $150 a month, and my deductible went from $0 to $2600. Healthcare will cost me $4400 more this year than it did last year; or if I got a $4400 raise, that would put me at zero. 

Booz Allen used to be a high line product at a high line price. We used to be able to command a high price - from clients who wanted more than simply getting the job done, they wanted it done well - and thoroughly, by the brightest and best. Clients would choose Booz Allen for the same reason someone might choose a Mercedes-Benz over a Toyota. In our recent years, this race to the bottom of how cheap we can possibly make operations, how little can we pay our staff, has caused a loss of top talent, and hiring just-good talent as opposed to the sharpest and most impressive applicants. I'm imagining management wanted to cut operating costs, but retain the Firm's reputation - that's just not possible. They got their wish - they made the Firm cheaper. We're just another contracting firm now - a glorified staffing agency."

Changes have also put significantly more burden on the employee to manage their own careers, with no clear advocates or mentors, and very little way to find or connect to opportunities."

- Path for upward mobility is very transparent, and you can advance in the company if you play your cards right.","- It's difficult to change projects within the company unless you network your way there. You are very much treated as an asset and it's difficult to be able to work on something you're interested in versus something you want to work on.

The company culture is very collegial and collaborative.","As with any career in consulting, you have to be ready to be flexible and adaptable -- you may be placed on a project in any number of geographic locations. You also have to be ready to climb potentially steep learning curves.

However, by 2011, regardless of what their mission stated, they really operated to simply make money.  They used to be customer and employee focused and developed the best and brightest...not anymore.",Lost sight of their mission.  Too focused on making money driving butts in seats mentality.  Hire low end resources and fail to develop talent.  Backstabbing and infighting drives out the true talent.  Recognizes the poor performers who kiss butts and stab other in the back.

Everyone was always willing to help me.  I also noticed that the divisions 
seemed to help each other out; verses being in competition with each other.",I guess if I have to come up with a con; it would be that they had too many mandatory conference calls I was asked to be on that were not relevant to my position.
4564,Booz Allen Hamilton,Excellent Company,2015-01-28,5.0,Senior Consultant,"Being a consultancy, sometimes it's hard to keep connected with your employees; however BAH makes great efforts to keep staff integrated with their home base.  The employees at BAH are thorough, committed, honest, and trustworthy; the hiring filter is truly excellent (although some duds do slip through the cracks).  BAH also encourages advancement and does everything in their power to help you go wherever you want in your career.  I also have never worked anywhere that was so open and easy to work with.  It truly is a great place to work.","Working on client site can be challenging at times as far as VPN access, and when you work as a consultant (as many know) there's no forgiving time off, no leaving early, etc.  It's all accountable time."
4565,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Big Company, easy to get lost; Benefits slipping",2015-01-28,3.0,Associate,"Booz Allen is a prestigious firm that still has a great reputation for attracting quality talent.  They have contracts in prestigious places -- primarily federal government and DoD and work with exciting technologies.  

They hire for talent and culture fit, not for contracts.  You have a few months to get work where you can train and get certifications, and they'll keep you on for several weeks after you lose a contract to find new work.  Not your typical government contractor that lays you off when your contract ends.","It's a massive company, it's so easy to get lost in the chaff and not get recognized, if you are on the wrong team you will not succeed. Period. Some leadership takes care of their employees, other leadership just sucks the billable hours out of you and then gives you a 1% raise at the end of the year.  Good luck moving to a different team if you get tucked away on a bad one. I tried for 4 years to move teams with no traction.

The assessment process is tremendously complicated, burdensome, and opaque, people sometimes have to take a few day of unbillable time in order to work through them.

Everything is about billing and time recording. If you enter time 5 minutes late you might not get promoted.

Benefits have been slipping ever since I've worked here. They used to pride themselves on taking care of their employees, providing top tier benefits and compensation, but recently they've moved to the middle of the pack if not the rear."
4566,Booz Allen Hamilton,Just another defense contractor.,2015-01-27,4.0,Lead Engineer,"Above market pay and benefits.  The unpaid leave benefit allows employees to take up to a month off per year in addition to a handsome vacation benefit.  Everything else is about the same all the rest of the defense contractor community (medical, dental, vision, 401k, tuition assistance, etc.)",Leadership is constantly attempting to harvest the great ideas of its staff.  I say harvest because the donation or facilitation of ideas (business development) must happen outside of normal business hours (meaning no overhead charge number).  Participation isn't mandatory but it influences company culture (work life balance).
4567,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Ok pay, poor benefits, little room for growth if you're not a good ole boy",2015-01-26,2.0,Intel Analyst,"Great coworkers. I really enjoy everyone that I interact with and work with on a daily basis. 

Pay isn't terrible. It's not the best but it's far from the worst.","Terrible benefits. No sick days or personal days. If you're sick you go to work or take vacation time. 

The company forces you to go to training or meetings during regular work hours and it's not billable. In essence you work for 8 hours a day but dont get credit for the mandatory meeting/training. So you either have to  work extra or take paid time off. 

You're expected to participate in proposal writing, which can be a many, many extra hours yet you're not compensated for it and you don't  get comp time for what could be working 40 extra hours a week. 

Their health care just changed to a terrible high deductible plan that, coupled with the lack of raises for many this year, results in a net loss in pay from last year. 

They have a 6% 401(k). However they on deposit their contributions once a calendar year. So, if you are there for 11 months then leave you get no match. 

A lot of their new policies have been made to clearly pad the pockets of executives and appease shareholders. It's clear that management didn't consider their employees when they made decisions. There really are minimal reasons to be with this company."

- Benefits used to be superb/competitive before November 2014. Now we have the standard medical/retirement plan you'd find most places.

- Great performance client side doesn't account for much with leadership. 

- Company does not uphold values
like they claim. Illegal and immoral activity will be hidden/downplayed if it's possible to do so.

Many of the Booz Allen managers addressing the military are ex-military. The PRO is that this management has contacts in the military, understands how the military works, and can communicate with the military.  There is a CON and that is listed below.","The CON to having primarily ex-military addressing the needs of current military is that they come from the came operational culture and therefore, may tend to reinforce existing military operational processes with few new improvement ideas. 

Many higher paid senior non-management Subject Matter Experts have left the company, which may help the overall cost of employees but could impact Booz Allen's long standing diversity claims.

The management in place does not fully benefit from the diverse work history of it's employees because managers tend to define employers by the job they are currently doing.

4591,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great place to grow your career - if you land on the right team,2015-01-08,4.0,Lead Associate,"I was on the traditional ""management consulting"" side of the business.  Leadership quality is uneven, but when it's good this is a fantastic place to be.  This company wins just about every kind of work that exists in the federal government, so if you're proactive and part of a successful team you'll get opportunities to try a lot of different things.  I've done data analysis, strategic planning, communications, organization design, human capital management consulting, etc.  If you get stuck, with 25k+ employees and a strong culture of collaboration you can usually find an expert to help you out from within the company ranks within hours. Most of the clients are good to work with and the projects are interesting.  My typical project was 6-18 months, which felt like a good balance between stability and variety.  Unlike some companies, the end of a contract doesn't mean unemployment unless things are really bad in your market (or you are expensive with a niche skillset).  Tell your management you want to advance, raise your hand to help with proposals and marketing work outside your client work, and you can be promoted every 1-2 years - especially if you are a strong writer and have some leadership experience already.  Work hours are extremely reasonable; as a manager I typically logged 45 hours/week or under and was hitting all my marks for clients and internal management alike.  Proposal season in August-September is rough but you know it's coming and leadership does a good job ""sharing the wealth"" so the same people don't get relentlessly piled upon.  Internal training is almost non-existent these days, but the $5k annual tuition reimbursement easily makes up for that and the firm has deals to get people into external instructions programs that fall within that limit.","Balancing client work (often performed at a govt. office) with firm responsibilities gets frustrating when you have technical issues accessing IT resources due to security requirements on the part of the government or the company.  This is a daily fact of life.  Some government work locations are better than others.  Compensation is not great compared to what you can get in other industries, but within the industry it seems reasonable, and to be fair the requirement to be billable to government clients limits the firm's flexibility in this area.  I suppose the trade-off is less money in exchange for more support, interesting projects, and good name recognition among federal consulting firms.  Senior management comes off as being untrustworthy at times, such as during the aborted stealthy removal of parking/transit benefits this past summer, but this is mitigated if the intervening leaders are good. Benefits (health care, 401k supplements) continue to erode, which has not been great for morale."

The Firm has reduced benefits significantly while not admitting it to its employees (reduced vacation, eliminated sick time, reduced 401k matching, training hours have to be ""paid back."" ).

Post IPO the firm must work through the growing pains, and either mature, or fail. 
Salaries are falling. Many recent stories of pay cuts at both senior and mid-level employees.  Benefits have been dramatically cut. The ECAP/401(k) has been dramatically reduced. The health insurance is both laughable and expensive. Training is handed out sparingly and only to those in favor. Hoteling-based work environment for the lucky few who aren't pushed to client site 100%.
Leadership has no idea how to interact with on site employees, limiting career opportunity for those on site. The company doesn't invest in the formal systems needed for an org its size, so HR, IT, financial tools, staff networking, etc is frustrating at best.  Career planning is nothing but a hope and a prayer.
Finally, the firm has some tough decisions to make.  It has been moving down the consulting chain away from strategy to more butts-in-seats work to chase top line revenues. These contracts are tighter margin hence the salary and benefits cuts. It's hiring, staffing, marketing, pricing, and staff training and retention programs must adapt to these realities.  In the meantime, continue to expect mid level and highly talented employees to continue to leave as the mix of interesting work ends and cost pressures drive staffing to young and cheaper new hires."

Work can be hard to find for some people and the value of your job is dependent on the projects you work on. There are times where you may have to fight for your job finding work that is outside of your scope of interest or skill set. This has become increasingly common it seems, although not necessarily a bad thing for those starting a career. Gaining exposure to a lot of different types of work is a learning experience."

I was passed over as the lead on projects multiple times by people who were just as, or even less, qualified than I was but they were older. They claim to be a ""flat"" organization but the hierarchy is very clear. Because most of the staff is former military the culture subsequently became a very militaristic type work environment.

In 2014, I was given the option to take a 20% cut in salary or receive a ""Lack of Work"" letter.
I chose the letter.

One of the core values which Booz Allen Hamilton claims to embrace is integrity.
I always thought of integrity as being honest. Saying one thing and then going back on your word is not honest.

This is a company with a ""one size fits all” mentality. The senior associates (mostly ex-military) in my
office, who lacked college degrees, seemed to be always chasing certificates that they could
hang on their office walls and include in their email signature block to impress others.

So, as the holiday season approaches to those who remain at Booz Allen Hamilton, I say BAH!"

They had an attractive benefits package, so I took a reduced salary.  

For three years things were fine, until they did precisely what they promised they'd never do:  They went public again.  

Now the only people of ANY importance are the shareholders.  Not the employees, even slightly.  Despite getting ""exceeds"" on my yearly reviews for the past 3 years, I haven't gotten a raise because BAH ""couldn't afford it.""

During this time, BAH brags to their stakeholders about how much more profitable they were than the year before.  They send out E-Mails talking about how these changes will ""save Booz Allen $200 million in the next year"" all the while, they strip more, and more away from the employees that are actually earning that money.  

The morale is at an all time low.  On my contract, we started with 16 people.  Over the past 2 years, I'm one of two of us that are left.  They can't even get anyone in to backfill, and are down to just the 2 slots.  

Avoid this company like the plague.  It has failed to learn from its own past, and for the second time now it has killed the goose that laid the golden egg, with the guys at the top making millions of dollars while the guys actually doing the work aren't even given scraps.

2. Your supervisor has a large, perhaps outsized, say in your rating and promotion decisions - making a mockery of the supposed 360 degree annual performance review.

They have a large footprint across the federal government, so there are a good number of opportunities. The firm seems to do a better job of weathering events like the government shutdown than their peers (SAIC, BAE, etc...).  There is a decent level of stability given the industry.

There are high ethical standards, a focus on quality work, and opportunities to advance.","Since the Carlyle buyout and the IPO, there has been a series of cost cutting efforts that seem to focus on improving the P&L in time for each quarterly earnings announcement.  Over the last few years, we've had:

* a (poorly executed) move to hoteling that killed any sense of team cohesion.
* reduction in the 401(k) (Actually, the previous program was a 10% profit share, now it is a 6% match that only pays out if you are still employed at the firm at the end of the year)
* Reduction in health insurance (a switch to high-deductible plans)
* Watering down the 360 degree assessment process to one that amounts to little more than a checklist.
*(They even got rid of all plants in the offices as a way to save money)

Every couple of years, management tries to dramatically shift the organization with the promise that This Time Is Different.  There have been switches back and forth between functional and market aligned structures.  There was the One Firm push to integrate the commercial and government businesses (""we are one firm, we can work together""), followed by the split of the two halves (""we were really two separate businesses, with different models and cultures""), and the attempt to recreate a commercial business (""This time will be different"").

When I started, the firm's culture, reputation as a premium brand, and benefits were the big draws.  I don't think any of them are particularly notable anymore.

Over the last year there have been a bunch of efforts that are hard to look at with an unjaded eye -- the ""Ed talks"" are the firm's take on Ted talks (having a senior vice president give a speech while walking around on a stage really doesn't capture the whole Ted experience); knock-offs of Shark Tank, and superficial talk of innovation fill our email boxes along with videos of our new president's ""Connect Tour.""  Some employees are paid to try and build excitement on Yammer. A lot of effort goes into what one might call ""influence operations"" to convince employees that management is on their side."

My so-called Career Manager didn't do squat to help me find another position within the company and a lot of positions require an existing secret or higher security clearance.  All the promos I saw were political, not based on skill.  And woe unto you if you have a goofball client - they can make your life hell if your manager doesn't have the stones to protect their people.  This is a good place to get some experience in a federal contract house (butts in the seats); BAH is NOT a consulting firm in any sense of the definition.

4671,Booz Allen Hamilton,Once-Prestigious Firm Now Slashing Benefits,2014-10-15,2.0,Lead Technologist/Associate,"The firm has built a good reputation over its many years of existence.  For my market, people at the Principal level and below are good, upstanding.  Meeting with your manager is usually license for a free lunch (at least in my management chain).  Quarterly management meetings are a restaurant have been fun and good for network.  The firm really came through and covered client-side people during the government shutdown in Fall 2013.  The firm finally offers a career map for technologists and engineers, although it remains to be seen whether that will increase upward mobility.  Internal social network is active and informative.","Benefits are being slashed on annual basis:
- The retirement contribution, which was above average (10% of pay, but vested) when I joined, is at or below average now (6% of pay with 100% vesting at SIX YEARS).
- The 2015 health insurance choices have been unveiled and they are OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD.  The lowest plan is far worse (higher premium, higher OOP max, higher deductible) than the cheapest (and only) high-deductible plan last year.  The only Aetna plans left are high-deductible, and the deductibles are way too high when compared to the premiums.)  Pharmacy benefits also are subject to the same deductible now.  I'm curious how many people the firm will lose over this.

There is an expectation that you make up non-billable hours (e.g. firm-mandatory training).  You are expected to do an annual self-review, even though it's not required and you can't charge it.  (None of this is particularly new.)

Lead associates and senior associates get overworked.  They (especially lead associates) are expected to do management basically for free after putting in a full week being billable to the client.

You used to be able to count on job security at a big firm, but that is no longer the case.  The lack-of-work notice comes as soon as you end your work on a contract and you have precious little time to find a new position before being shown the door.  What is the point of working for such a large firm?

Sick time included in paid time off (which is four weeks for new Associates).

Attrition seems to be high."

A bad boss means no promotion, no feedback, left in limbo at the client site, not protected against bullying/harassment by customer. In my case I was assigned what turned out to be a very dysfunctional organization that within the year had replaced its own senior management and treated its contractors like trash or worse (self included). My immediate supervisor, a nice competent man but worried about his own promotions/rise etc, did nothing to protect us at the site. His boss --my hiring boss-- was a complete a-- who was so full of himself that he had zero interest in his minions except for his few pets. But what particularly struck me as red flag, was how during a week's orientation, as we were being indoctrinated on the privileges of working for such an esteemed company, I noted (and raised a fair question) that it appeared the BAH's immense success was tied to its one sole customer, the US Govt. I asked is this was perhaps a risky model i.e. all eggs in one basket and what if this funding source dried up (this was asked circa 2009)? Wouldn't it be prudent to branch out a bit?  Needless to say, my question/comment wasn't appreciated. This should have been another red flag."

It’s well known company in the DC area and there is the perception that everyone who works there is super smart and that it is a well run organization.  The missions of the clients supported are interesting and many coworkers are nice.,"No work life balance.  Working at Booz is a series of fire drills and poorly run projects. Its not uncommon to spend long hours working on something that is 'high priority' and later learn that what was asked for was never even looked at.

Lots of arrogance, pretention, and ego at the senior associate and higher level.  There is an unspoken dynamic that people at this level know everything and that pretty much no one below that level knows anything….so you end up indulging the senior staff  by nodding and smiling – which makes their egos even bigger.  And you do this even when it is obvious that they don’t know what they are talking about - and yes, there are people in Booz who have no clue as to what they are doing.

Career paths are limited. Raises, promotions, and bonuses are generously sprinkled across ‘leadership’ while the majority of employees – the ones actually doing the work – get very little for their contributions.  Lower level employees are just supposed to be happy to get the honor of being deemed good enough to work at Booz.  It’s definitely a culture of haves and have nots.  The average employee could get the same job somewhere else, earn the same salary if not higher, be appreciated more, and not have to deal with the weird organizational dynamics at Booz."

Many different opportunities and the firm does help the transition from one project to the next.,Essentially employees are highly paid interns.  The opportunities for promotion and merit raises are minimal and the company experience depends tremendously on the individual team and the client.

When my position was migrated to another company, Booz Allen did little to nothing to retain me even though I was more qualified than people working in other positions. They are more interested in keeping people billable than they are in providing the best value and qualified people for the client. Definitely has the perception of favoritism.

Booz Allen is also top heavy which drives up cost and weakens ability too compete."
4716,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great place to start. Better hope your offered a real opportunity,2014-09-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Booz Allen attempts to maintain a more personal relationship with its employees, and this is driven by the CEO.","They have been swept away by the globalization forces that have attempted to commoditize highly skilled resources, and drive down salaries to very competent and qualified people. This is the mantra of all consulting firms, to reduce costs and ignore qualifications."
4717,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great employer for the most part,2014-09-08,4.0,Associate,"It is very apparent that BAH genuinely cares for its employees. It goes out of its way to find work for its people when contracts dry up, maximizing the talents of its personnel to ensure they have valuable, meaningful work. The leadership at the top at the regional office I work are very impressive, with the middle managers just below them a mixed bag as far as leadership ability. Still, there is no doubt that they care deeply for the employees.

There are opportunities to move around the company, and the opportunities are worldwide. If you don't like it where you're at and you have some mobility, this is an excellent company to work for! 

The large majority of folks I've worked with are very intelligent, which is refreshing when working in an environment surrounded by entitled government employees.","The move to being publicly traded has come with some trade-offs when it comes to benefits. Read: ""Take care of the investors before the employees"" (loss of employee perks and benefits in some cases). Salaries and programs such as education reimbursement have severely been cut.

I have witnessed a lack of diversity when it comes to overall management and the allocation of promotions, though I think this is more perception than reality. As one lower-level employee put it, ""It's hard to get promoted unless you're part of the 'old white men's club'."" To its credit, I think the management at the regional office I work at has noticed this, though any action to remedy the perception and/or the numbers hasn't occured. 

If you are at a regional office or ""hoteling"", good luck feeling like you're part of the big show in the DC area. If the DC set doesn't suit you, though, you'll enjoy being away from that flagpole. BAH has a lot of great locations to work at, so happy hunting."

I was placed on a client site 100% immediately after orientation (which failed to teach me anything important about the company's operations), and am now in my 11th month on the same project.  My manager was fired a few months into my time here, before ever having a one-on-one discussion with me for even 5 minutes.  Her replacement, who works out of a Booz office maybe 10 minutes away, has not bothered to visit our client site or invite me to his office, and the middle manager between myself and those folks has never shown an interest in learning what skills I might or might not have.  The company is heavily focused on federal contracting, and has no strong incentive to stay more than just a notch above its inefficient clients in terms of delivery.  Compensation is also poor vis-a-vis the consulting industry at large, and there seems to be no consideration of value for a non-MBA higher education degree, even if directly relevant to work being performed."

- Interesting work. There is the possibility of working across multiple teams and disciplines.
- High-quality co-workers. There are many intelligent people working for Booz Allen and there is the opportunity to interact across the firm where employees can learn from the best.","- I worked for a company that was acquired by Booz Allen almost two years ago. The integration has been difficult leading to a lot of uncertainty and loss of talent. We moved to the larger firm’s offices and we are kept at arm’s length leading to diminished local opportunities. It seems like we are two separate companies sharing an office and can be uncomfortable because of differing cultures. It is not like this for all offices. I have visited other Booz Allen offices and worked with them without experiencing the same discomfort that is in my own office. However, some of my same-division-colleagues have relayed similar issues.
- Advancement depends on work, this isn’t really a con it is reality of the business. I work in a smaller market and try to advance through virtualization (a great alternative if the client is willing) and working with other offices in larger markets. The little I interact with my in-office colleagues they seem frustrated by an ability to be promoted. It is problematic but difficult for those working on a client site and don’t have the opportunity to build new business because of the nature of their work and size of the market.
- Booz Allen is a premium consulting firm and values efficiency and intelligence, that’s a good thing. However, the firm is costly and their main client is the federal government and that means that cost can be the most important factor in winning work. The firm does take extraordinary steps to remain competitive but also resorts to proposals for less than exciting opportunities (that’s where the money, however much, is sometimes) and bidding lower than in previous efforts leading to diminished benefits and compensation. An unfortunate business reality."

Management expects you to put hours of extra work into proposals, then you don't see ANY impact for that when it's to get your annual raise, due to a BS excuse.  I've had enough.
Career opportunities outside of DC are few and far between.
Management seems to lose sight of the fact that people who work on the outer edges of the ""DC Area"" can't always easily travel to DC on a moment's notice, and certainly can't commute to DC for a different contract - especially since BAH refuses to provide additional pay to compensate for the extra travel expense."

If you see a mixed bag of reviews(or below average), you're likely joining an average(or below average) company.  Before you discover all of this once you join, think about staying away from Booz Allen. For reasons, refer below.

When a company begins to make cuts on how it treats its people rather than invest in them, it's a sign that bad times are looming.  When this happens, a good number of the most talented people usually leave(and they have been in the last 1-2yrs) and the average to below average stay.  In an industry where people represent a key asset, it's a downward spiral for the firm from there.  And it's been showing as the firm has been losing many many bids for work as of recently.

Last year, the firm drastically cut salaries for a key position and it prompted many to leave.  
The firm cut its bonus plan to a 401k plan, it then cut that 401k plan this year.
Career managers(people who are supposed to help you with your career) are a mixed bag.  They're not really put in a position to value your career all that much, most are looking after themselves and aren't really incentivized to help you.
People are fairly territorial with their work.  Divisions compete with one another for work.

The health care benefits are great compared to many other companies in the DC area.","While nice, most people, especially management won't go out of their way for you.  You are entirely responsible for remaining billable and seeking billable work, which can make the environment very cut throat.  Overtime is expected all the time, not occasionally.  The ""work hard, play hard"" mentality of rewarding hard working employees is long gone.  Raises are contingent upon if your client agrees to the increase.  The ability to occasionally work from home - for me - has never become the reality.  My last contract did not allow for a good work-life balance, the client was awful, and I was pressured to not find a position more in line with my qualifications because they didn't want to have to find a replacement.  I wasn't allowed to truly consult and provide recommendations or improve the processes I was hired to do so.

4788,Booz Allen Hamilton,Different experiences in different offices,2014-07-25,3.0,Senior Associate,"My experience at Booz Allen Hamilton exposed me to a wide range of interesting challenges-- personnel management, client relationships, business development, and technical tasks.  When I joined in 2004 the company stressed that they were hiring people for their career not just for a single task and there was an emphasis on empowering employees and personal development (40 hours available for training per year for example.)  As a Senior Associate, I lead a great team of a dozen direct reports working on a variety of complex problems for our clients.","The experience in different offices can vary greatly.  Booz Allen prides itself on being one of Fortune's ""100 Best Places to Work For"" but many of the things that Fortune credits (such as onsite daycare and fitness facilities) are only available in the McLean, VA campus and not available in the other offices throughout the country.
The down side of all the interesting challenges is that employees are expected to do all of personnel management, business development, and client relationship development while maintaining billability to client tasks over 95% (the exact percentage varies by office and business area).  So if as a manager, I spent more than 2 hours per week doing the extensive personnel assessment system for example, then I was no longer meeting my billability target.    It lead to moral issues where I had to choose between lying on my time card or correctly accounting for my hours.
Additionally, by 2010 when I left the corporate culture was shifting dramatically-- employees were hired for single tasks and if they were unable to find another task within the company on their own (without management's help) they were let go.  The 40 hours for training was still available, but employees were expected to make up for those hours by working additional time in the following months."

It is impossible to advance within Booz without being a part of winning proposals and focusing on business roles.  Expect to work late in the evenings and on weekends to do this.  Also, these opportunities to be a part of proposal teams can be difficult to come by as those aspiring at levels above you take them.

They have solid support from all of the commodity shops such as IT, HR, Accounting, etc., which allows employees to focus on their work and not getting paid on time, finding someone to fix their laptop, or getting quickly on-boarded to company policies.  It's also a great place for military folks leaving the service and transitioning to a civilian career.  Booz Allen primarily supports the Department of Defense and US Government, so military jargon and an understanding of military and government culture is desired.  Also, since there are numerous veterans working at Booz Allen, it's a great place to find an immediate support group.","If you want to make the highest salary in the industry, don't work at Booz Allen.  If you are looking for great mentors who will take  you under their wing to show you the ropes, don't work at Booz Allen.  Booz Allen requires its employees to be 100% proactive in managing their own careers.  Booz Allen provides the resources and networking opportunities to be successful, but its on the employee to create their own success.  Aside from the lack of mentorship, Booz Allen's culture since it has become publicly traded is to maximize shareholder value.  Booz seems to have removed its concern for employees and put all emphasis on boosting the bottom line.  This is frustrating as an employee because, as good as that is for the company as a whole, it sucks as an individual.  All correspondence coming down from the higher ups details their actions as ""good for the company"" but anyone with any business sense can smell the accounting and finance tricks that are going on to keep the company financially healthy.  Granted, it's a necessary evil, but it still makes me upset as an employee."

The benefits are decent, pay decent, although the days of lavish parties and generous compensations are gone.  Company touts work-life balance, but depending on your manager, it can be like pulling teeth to be able to work from home if needed.","Booz has a stellar reputation, however, the company has been trying to rest on those laurels and not necessarily adjusting to new realities of a cash-strapped government.

Resource Management could use a serious makeover.  There appears to be jobs all over the place, and even when someone fills 80% of the requirements, often times there isn't even a response to the inquiry?

4825,Booz Allen Hamilton,Not you father's Booz Allen,2014-06-20,3.0,Associate,"Great name recognition. The Booz Allen name still caries some weight. It helped me get an interview for my current position at a Fortune 100. 

Collaborative. Booz Allen is still decent at collaboration, though with the move to ""hoteling"" this was somewhat degraded. Senior leaders have open door policies and many will accommodate even if you are not on their team. 

Core values espoused are still in the firm, but not consistent. The dynamic changes from team to team, even within the same home office. 

Flexible work schedule. Over  the two years I spent with Booz Allen, I received the ability to complete my billable hours to accommodate travel and take business days off needed for my graduate degree program. 

Great ways to give back through Booz Allen Cares.","At the point of Principal and above, there is a huge disconnect with the lower ranking consultants up through Senior Associate. 

Notifying employees of permanent changes to vacation/holiday schedules between Christmas and New Years via email was appalling. Cutting ECAP, was the final blow to benefits that differentiated Booz. 

Moreover, billable workers like myself were viewed as a commodity. Client delivery wasn't really valued, just filling a seat and ability to retain a security clearance. 

All of these cons have changed the culture for the worse."

4837,Booz Allen Hamilton,Over the course of 10 years I worked there things changed...,2014-06-11,3.0,Associate,I worked for really great Vice Presidents within Booz Allen.  They cared deeply about their people.  Took good care of them. For the most part that culture permeated down to directors and managers. For that portion of my career I got promoted and felt like I had good growth potential until the later part of my time there.,There were teams who's management did not care very much.  As with any company the experience was dependent upon the managers. It's primarily a government contracting/consulting firm. The market was changing when I was there from a model where consulting thought leadership was appreciated by government clients to a staff augmentation model. Two very different markets.  I've slowly seen really good people leave and move on to other great endeavors.

4843,Booz Allen Hamilton,A once-proud firm on its way to becoming an also-ran contracting house.,2014-06-07,3.0,Associate,"Booz Allen has contacts everywhere. If you're looking for qualifications for a certain project or introduction to a government organization, you'll find a contact easily.
There are lots of ways to keep in contact with colleagues. For example, one can search employee profiles on the intranet and have conversations on just about any topic on Yammer.
Corporate parties are well-funded and well-planned.
The company seems to be amenable to flexible work arrangements.
The firm carried all its employees during the government shutdown. A welcome gesture when other contractors were being released for lack of funds.","Everything shuts down for a month at the end of the fiscal year. It becomes frustrating when one has an active, funded contract but can't purchase, travel, or charge time because the company has to spend four weeks reconfiguring its accounting system.
Speaking of accounting systems, nothing propagates automatically between systems. This means there is a relatively high probability of someone somewhere along the line fat-fingering your numbers. It also takes a long time to go from establishing a project to actually being able to work on it.
I work in the Booz Allen Hamilton Engineering Services ... entity. Long story short, we were a division of another company, which Booz Allen acquired. They decided to keep us a separate entity, because Booz Allen isn't set up to do engineering work. However, this means we neither operate as a separate company nor operate as part of the Firm. So, for example, we have to run through two separate approval chains for everything - not conducive to fast-paced engineering work. It is also ambiguous who has control over what funds, who is managing what project, etc., which leads to infighting instead of cooperation.
The firm is so proud of carrying its employees through the shutdown. However, with employees expected to work 10+ hours of unpaid overtime every week, that seems like the very least it could do.
Finally, the firm is much too risk-averse. It encourages innovation, as long as the innovation doesn't threaten established processes or require purchasing anything. They're so afraid of their name appearing on the news that any novel project will be rejected at the highest levels of management."
4844,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Smart people, but traditional and bureaucratic depending on your team alignment.",2014-06-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Booz Allen is a consulting firm that often inherits the culture and values of the clients they work for. So, depending on which clients and teams you are aligned to, you can expect vastly different experiences.

It's definitely a great place for stability, but don't expect to be challenged, or receive the growth potential and appreciation that you might get with other firms.","The biggest problem currently is the bad market. It's doing fairly well at not losing values in the face of stiffer competition and less work, but the impact can be seen everywhere, from training reduction, to cuts on perks, to less flexibility and risk taking. There's also the problem of strategic hiring of individuals who don't fit the company culture or level of intelligence, but exist as managers because of their revolving door connections with the government."

Despite preaching core values, including diversity, they rarely let those who are differently enabled shine -- how many women are there at the top? -- how many multi-color heads of hair, with quasi-ironic t-shirts and ripped jeans do you see on campus?

But it also boils down to the client; if the client likes you it will be a good review, if the client doesn’t, it will be negative.  I also, came into a bad situation where the site lead and my supervisor left in less than three months after being employed with the company for years.  This changed the culture of the site and with a difficult client the new site lead and supervisor didn’t know how to manage the consultants in a professional manner leading me to leave sooner than I wanted too."

The produce results that endure and stand behind their work.  Their ability to ""reach back"" within company assets to formulate proposals and generate sound business solutions is the best I have experienced.  They are constantly updating their company policies to better administer to their clients and ensure their client information is secure...and that all employees are aware of the changes.","Over the past 5 years, since they sold out to the Carliel Group they have transitioned through numerous administrative and internal corporate policy directives.  One such example is the annual assessment of employees; I believe the older way of evaluating an employees performance was better, but the current policy is less time intensive for those performing the assessments."

They are always advertising positions on their internal job board but, when you apply there is either no real job (just getting resumes) or you get one only for it to be taken away. You will be told it is a financial decision and you need to stay on the current contract. In other words, you are just a paycheck to them. Meeting with your CM or Sr. Associate about needing a change are met with ""We'll see what we can do."" Once again, there is no real intent to move you to somewhere where you and the firm can both benefit from your expertise. Instead, they attempt to temporarily appease you with award money and promises that they are ""looking to move you over soon."" 

Also, for a ""consulting"" company, this is one of the most technology behind companies I have ever worked for. They cannot figure out how to digitally sign documents. Everything is print, sign, scan, and then email (or snail mail). I worked in a company that was 1/2 the size and they could digitally sign documents.

Finally, they will want you to pursue certifications that they want you to have even though you do not want them or interested in getting them. The idea is for them to market the certifications on proposals. Once again, they do not care about the individual; only what makes the firm look good on proposals and contracts."
4881,Booz Allen Hamilton,A great place to work for more than a decade,2014-05-06,3.0,Senior Associate,"Teams were well managed with lots of upward mobility.

There was great potential for growth. Also the 10% into your 401k is awesome!","Unfortunately, after going public, the bottom line per quarter became more important than long term strategy. Huge dividends were paid out, while employees suffered raises that did not keep up with inflation and promotions were held back from deserving employees. I was told that if I was up for promotion a year or two before, there wouldn't be any doubt of getting it, and I deserved it, but now financial times are too tight. This was a few months after giving a $6.50 dividend (no that's not a typo.) Sour taste to say the least."

Not any more.","I was a relatively old hand when Booz went public in 2010. What transpired after that was a series of miscues that have damaged the company brand, perhaps fatally. The company's focus moved from client service to marketing and cost containment. Booz hired a bunch of new staff--and promptly had to let them go because they didn't have work for them. Brilliant move.

Existing employees deemed ""too expensive"" were targeted for adverse performance assessments on grounds that ranged from absurd to surreal. Meanwhile, those that did bring in work were allowed to practically get away with murder--until they lost their golden touch, whereupon Booz revived all of the negative comments from their performance review and used that as justification for terminating them."

Quickly showed a desk and expected to guess at project expectations. Don't expect feedback/pulse check, management is too busy rubbing elbows to grow and mentor junior staff. Expect to brown nose to promote, actual hard work is optional. Transitioning to other teams is always a possibility, if your nose is brown enough. If not well established on the East coast, don't bother jumping in on the hot job market, instead expect to be hosed by the high cost of living and taxes... Dual income is a must to at least survive and better be making a combined 300k or be living in the slums."

The leadership is very dynamic, collaborative, and does the best they can to balance the needs of the employees with the shareholders.  Very good compensation & benefits package, educational and other opportunities to build skill sets and grow professionally.  A particularly good fit for any ex-military.","The company is pragmatic/utilitarian about the bottom line almost to a fault, which is to say if you're not on a funded contract it's your responsibility to be actively seeking out another position as soon as possible even if means relocating.  This is not an enterprise where if you take care of them, they'll take care of you in bad times.  You either produce or find another job.

I really enjoy the very flexible time policies, which allow me to take 2 or 3 days off a month without taking vacation time. The company also was very generous during the government shutdown most, if not all employees still got paid. My experience has been its easy to move to different contracts and markets, which served me well as person young in their career. The company also have  pretty good benefits.","Lots of relatively large changes over the past two years have impacted benefits and work-life balance. The benefits are still good but much less. Working 100% on client site can make you feel disconnected from the firm at large. Promotion and upward mobility is very much dependent on your management chain, having a good management chain is awesome. A not so good management chain is a horrible experience.

4892,Booz Allen Hamilton,Most Positive,2014-04-30,4.0,Consultant Test Engineer,The benefits and salary are very generous. The culture is extremely professional for the most part but at times can come off as being snobbish.,"The way employees are rated is called an ""Assessment"" which is normally done annually. The problem with this process is that they use a ""360"" degree method of gathering information about the employee. The employee has to provide a self-assessment along with the names of customers and company mates as potential interviewees. Sometimes employees that don't get along will use your assessment to get back at you by providing less than flattering feedback. However, if the rater that is writing the assessment is good he or she should be able to gauge the type of person that they are reviewing based on all the feedback gathered."

Strongly dependent upon a narrow market (Government professional services) and vulnerable to changes in political winds.

They provide a great culture, competitive pay, and are invested in the growth of their employees. One thing that always amazed me is how they were so nimble for such a large organization. There are umpteen opportunities to advance your career through internal and external learning.","The two biggest problems I saw were a) There is really no career path for non-BizDev folks b) Promotions aren't completely merit based. This gets frustrating in the long run. Also, as the company has grown, it's become less personal. There were several strategic changes that alienated the employees."
4901,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Changed, for the worse",2014-04-25,2.0,Senior Associate,The best thing about working here has been the flexibility of work arrangements which make it great to balance parenting (and all the driving and work from home that can sometimes require) with work (working from home not an issue). That has been of HUGE value to me as a single mom,"The place has changed radically in the past couple years. There is a younger set of top leadership taking over, and while modernizing and refreshing is good, it is coming with a lot of politics, turf wars, horribly puffed up egos, and bad decisions. Morale is at an all time low, benefits have been eroded back to general going rates across commercial industry, so they no longer make up for the toxic environment. Pay increases are pitiful due to the tough federal contracting environment. You can get the same benefits, better compensation, and better career path at other companies, I'm finding out."

- Raises are only .8-2% a year- Again the compensation here is horrible
- So much restructuring and re-orgs every other year that you just became another empty face among the huge crowd- Just another drop of oil in the machine
-This is like office space, you will have 2-5 bosses to report to and have to comply with useless company surveys and activities that are a complete waste of time
- The worst part is that every other week I see an email from someone in the company who has been with them anywhere from 5-17 years but because they are now on the beach or not billing are getting a ""lack of work letter' - Pretty much if you stop billing you are dead here.

Leadership has been very vocal with staff about things ""not changing,"" but we all know that change is inevitable.  Unfortunately, for Booz Allen, this has manifested in high turnover, layoffs, and reduced perks.  The retirement plan has gone to crap since going public.  There is a wide sense of fear that once your project ends, you will receive a ""Lack of Work"" letter; yet the company is still hiring aggressively because leaders are rewarded for ""growing their teams.""  Morale is the lowest I have ever seen it, and the pressure to contribute extra hours beyond your client work to be seen as too valuable to receive LoW is high.   Additionally, incentives to pursue promotion are decreased, since doing so will only make you more expensive and harder to staff.

IT support is excellent.,"1) Not much consistency for determining if new hires should be Lead Associates or Associates; and little consistency across the firm for promotion to one or the other. Many Lead Associates seem to have been promoted due to technical proficiency, but they have poor people and project management skills.
2) There is a feeling that to be promoted you must 'do your time.' Highly skilled new employees often are placed into less impactful roles; those who have experience managing large teams or thriving in entrepreneurial environments are placed in more junior 'doer' roles where their strengths are left untouched. 
3) The firm claims to value diversity but this does not seem to be true for diversity of perspectives (e.g., general management consultants who have worked outside of government, in smaller organizations or even internationally).
4) The culture, opportunities for growth and promotion are hard to figure out. There is a strong ""you take control of your career"" ethos. However, there's also a very fine line between encouraging employees to do all the work and poor management.
5) Internal communication at market and team level isn't great. I don't feel my team has a vision to rally behind and I can't see how our work fits with wider firm strategy.
6) I feel like 75% of my time is spent developing decks and thinking for folks 'up the chain.' -- half of which never see the light of day. Many Associates are stuck in 'content-generator' commodity roles and it's really demotivating."

The company touts itself as highly ethical but it's ethics are only client facing.  I have never, in my over 35 years in the workforce, been treated as badly as an employee or manager/leader.  I've had 9 ""team leads"" and 6 ""career managers"" in just over two years.  None of them had or  the same level of management or leadership experience I have and none of them have been able to provide or expressed any real guidance or interest in helping  me move up or gain additional responsibility for promotion.   

After my first year I was not debriefed on my evaluation by my program manager as I was told I would be.  He was simply ""too busy.""  The next year the same thing happened.      

I have several other reasons for being unhappy with this company relating to promotions/opportunities, having to use personnel time to participate in company sponsored functions, and lack of assistance and poor quality mid-level leadership.

I believe I have given BAH more than an ample opportunity to prove me wrong but I stand by my opinion that it is a horrible company to work for.  

I am transferring with active duty spouse this year and I would not consider staying with BAH even if it meant giving up my career."

If you went to school for something where you plan to make immediate change/improvements or even changes within a few years- don't work here.

There's more focus on ""flexibility"" with the concept of work-where-you-live in order to reduce commute times for employees. There is an abundance of networking opportunities, just take the initiative and sign yourself up. There are also lots of functional communities that you can join to learn more about a particular area within the firm, as well as personal interest communities (intramural sports, adventure clubs, etc.).","It's not the same as it was even 5 years ago. In speaking with other veteran employees (who have been/was with the firm for 5+ years), everyone has shared the same feelings. Since going public, Booz Allen has become less of a consulting company and more of another contracting company (just hiring people to fill a seat on a contract). 

Times are tough and they've cut back on a lot of prior benefits like team outings, new laptops, raises, profit sharing (previous ~10% annually into your retirement fund, now switching to 6% matching), personal time off (we actually lost 2 days of time off when they switched our holiday schedule), general spending on administrative overhead.

Personal career growth is limited by leadership above you. Promotions are essentially dependent on if your project/market is growing and if you were part of that growth. If you're on a bad project in a contracting market, there's no business case to get you promoted to upper management (e.g., Lead Associate and above). Leadership also needs to give you the opportunity to demonstrate that you can operate at that next level - if you don't demonstrate it, you don't get the check mark on your annual assessment. 

Speaking of assessment, the process is pretty subjective. Again, it all depends on who your senior managers are and whether they're willing to fight for your promotion in front of the assessment board. There are supposed to be competencies that you are assessed against, but with the new creative writing format, you can really stretch how you word your demonstrated competencies to fit the bucket. And again, that final assessment (written by your manager) is all dependent on your manager."

If government contracts are interesting to a prospective candidate, then this is the ideal place.  If you are affordable, the firm may pay for your security clearance.

Most people who work at client sites are intelligent, productive, and genuinely good people.

Be prepared for a rigid management hierarchy, which may be attractive to inexperienced college graduates, or other newcomers to the consulting industry.","Employees are always hunting for stability and job security; at least an extra ten to fifteen uncompensated hours each week is expected, otherwise one is not considered a ""team player.""

Most employees work at client sites, deal with client concerns, and generate income for the firm.  Many employees work in McLean offices and write proposals without truly understanding client service.  To attain a position as a proposal writer, you should be young, female, and attractive.  Proposal writers are always employed, despite not generating revenue for the firm.  Proposal writers are usually promoted faster because they have more exposure to the corporate mothership.

Benefit package deteriorated shortly after the firm went public.  Employees lost two vacation days/year, and the once-generous automatic 10% 401K contribution (a key reason many took a position despite shrinking salaries) dropped to a maximum of 6% matching contribution.

There is an ongoing purge within the firm, and very talented personnel are being cut or encouraged to resign because they are considered too expensive.  Many talented personnel are leaving the firm in droves, and the place is hemorrhaging talent.  This is a short-term gain for the shareholders, but does irreparable damage to the long-term sustainability of the firm's once excellent reputation.  Expect to be released from the firm once your bill rate increases beyond what the Carlyle Group determines is too expensive."

Excellent legacy. Really - we're 100 years old. And it really was good in the ""good old days"".
Earnest attempts at cautiously reinventing how (part of) the company does business, in order to face new market challenges. They call it ""strategic innovation"", but it's really tactical reaction to market trends. Still, it's pushing small portions of the company ahead enough to keep up with new market demands, if not to actually anticipate them.
Devotion to admirable ""core values"" in dealing with customers.","Whether the tasking is interesting and rewarding - or even aligns with one's actual skills and experience - is increasingly a crapshoot. For employees, keeping ""billable"" is #1 priority in this firm. It's not enough to be working 50 hours a week on proposals, investment tasking, internal projects, etc. If you're not billable, you're gone: the Damocles' sword of ""Lack of Work"" letters hangs over everyone who can't find their own billable tasks. One gets very limited assistance in finding new tasking - even junior staff are expected to ""be professional"" and find their own work. Very tough if one isn't broadly and tightly networked into the organization - extremely difficult with operations almost 100% distributed and the vast majority of corporate meetings done ""virtually"".  Employees also have to create their own opportunities  to meet face to face with other Booz Allen folks (and find the time to do so, because in Booz Allen's ideal world, every single staff member would be full time on a client site; one has to be at least a Sr. Associate to get a permanent office in a Booz Allen facility - the rest who aren't on client site either telework or ""hotel""; the latter are only able to book offices from week to week, and have to keep their stuff in lockers at other times. In some situations, you may NEVER see another Booz employee face to face for weeks or months. It's particularly sad for new hires who never get a sense of belonging to the company, and may get little guidance from their career manager, who are often not engaged on the same projects. We're all generally left to fend for ourselves. And there is a very inconsistent level of managerial support - again it's a crapshoot. If you get a good manager, you get good support - but otherwise...plus the managers are all under pressures not so much to manage their staff as to make sure they make their billability targets. This is a generalization - but in my experience, Booz Allen goes through these cyclical crises of ""utlization"" or ""billability"" tracking, and we're all forced to flail around accepting whatever work comes along, regardless of whether it fits into our career strategy (ha ha ha!). Now I admit, a lot of this is the result of the weaking market since 2007 - but it is reflective of what some others here have observed: the company (a management consulting firm, mind you, so there's no excuse) is not very adept at adapting to market changes any more. Back when we were a privately held company, there seemed to be a lot more ability to weather such vagaries in the market and to protect the employees from too much of the fallout. But now we're all in constant crisis mode to some extent. And the much-heralded ""core values"" that the company still touts as one of its ""key differentiators"" in the market - well, we may live up to those values when it comes to serving our customers - but when it comes to management dealing with their staff, I don't see a lot of evidence of any ""core value"" except keep the profits high enough for our shareholders. It's very sad - and despite the negativity of this review, I'm holding on, living in hope that upper management will wake up and recognize that its current approaches are increasing angst and decreasing the quality of Booz Allen as a place to work. (The fact that we fell off the Top 100 places to work list last year after many, many years of being on it, doesn't seem to have fazed anyone...which says a lot.)"

Ten years ago when the firm started reducing benefits (anyone still around that remembers unlimited sick leave?) the mantra was ""we will never go public.""  Ralph had every intention of going public and began slowly chipping away at benefits introducing the phrase ""industry standard,"" which been ananthema to Booz culture.  Then that became the driver for everything, from letting HR dictate who gets promoted vice the managers and leadership, to the stupid idea of doing away with the ""beach"" to allow us to get the best and brightest their clearances.

High performers are getting 2% raises even in growing markets (e.g., health), and average performers are getting 0%. Opportunities to do business development (proposal work and white papers) are rare now because of the increased emphasis on direct labor - some of us who used to be 85% billable now are set at 95%, so any additional work you want to do or are required to do is all on what would have been your own time. This is starting to hurt the company's business prospects, because fewer strong performers are raising their hands for things that will help in the long term (white papers, proposal work, etc) and are focusing only on billable work - that is the most important thing.  

The acquisition by Carlyle a few years back has chipped away at our available overhead. Overhead is what pays for marketing work, thought leadership, team building, covering strong producers who are on the beach for a short period of time, even things like new hire lunches. When Carlyle sold a division of Arinc to Booz (yes, Carlyle sold a division to itself, essentially), that meant a chunk of our overhead now goes to pay Carlyle for buying something that it still owns. When we took out a loan to pay dividends to our shareholders (mostly Carlyle), that meant a chunk of our overhead goes to paying back our loan. Carlyle uses Booz as a magic money machine. Our leadership at Booz will say again and again that Carlyle lets them manage us without interfering - but that is only true so far as managing what is left after Carlyle squeezes out more cash.

-People are smart, friendly and realistic. I work in the Strategy Communication division so I can't speak for the other service lines.
-Pay is decent -- I'm an associate making close to 100K. 
-I'm able to work from home a lot and drop into the various offices in the DC area as I see fit. Some people are on projects that require them to be onsite and I've heard it's a drag. The project you end up on is somewhat random and by luck, unless you're hired on for a specific role on a specific project. 
-Booz Allen has a pretty decent reputation.
-Advancement is not too difficult within the company as long as you have a good career manager and project opportunities. 
-Benefits are good.","-Booz Allen works mainly with government so there's not much diversity in the type of clients you will work with. There was a non-compete after BAH and Booz & Company split, but that's since been lifted and BAH is trying to make inroads into the commercial sector. I've heard of a couple of wins but I'm not sure how successful it's been overall.
-For the most part, you're required to find your own project after your career manager helps you get on your first engagement. Honestly, I'm on the fence as to whether this is a pro or con. I'm very outgoing and like meeting new people so it's right in my wheelhouse, but some aren't. People who are more introverted would probably find the culture at Booz Allen a little difficult to navigate. 
-Working with government can be tedious and, for the most part, the work you're doing is a few years behind the private sector, especially in digital strategy and marcom. 
-If you're right out of school, god help you :) I could not imagine starting my career here or any other big consulting firm for that matter. I came with about 6-7 years of experience with a clear career direction and marketable skills. Yes, you can make a decent pay for being a recent graduate but your career trajectory is somewhat random. You'll acquire skills working on projects, but those too are random and, as mentioned, a few years behind the industry. 
-Annual pay increases are downright offensive. In the past year, my career manager, who is also my task lead on my project, has pushed a lot of work onto me and kept the potential of being promoted as a reason for me to take on a lot more responsibility -- a lot of which was his work. I agreed and I got promoted within one year, but only received a 5% pay increase. The company will cite the downturn in government contracting but it's complete BS. So with a promotion, I received a 5% increase. That's barely above a cost-of-living adjustment you typically receive at other companies without a promotion. Now, my manage continues to push more work my way that is not billable because I'm now an Associate. LOL, just ridiculous."

A 60-70+ hour work week is the norm.  In addition to direct client work, the responsibiilties to the Firm are significant.

""Work where you live"" for GO Team is nice, should it be approved.","Salary for GO Team (internal staff) is far below other competitors.
""Work/life"" balance that they promise is almost nonexistent.

Hoteling.

5053,Booz Allen Hamilton,The Tide has Changed...,2014-01-08,4.0,Senior Consultant,"Competitive salaries, professional development funding, short commute","Doing more with less staff has hurt morale. Since the firm went public, the bottom line has been to appeal to the investors than investing in retaining quality personnel."
5054,Booz Allen Hamilton,One Year At Booz Allen,2014-01-07,5.0,Associate,"* Culture of investment in employees.  Unlike many firms in the government contracting industry, Booz' brand as a management consulting company encourages a culture of investment in the long term growth and development of its employees.  The firm offers above average tuition assistance benefits, and uses a matrix approach to career management.  Under a decent career manager and with relevant skills, employees may find Booz Allen as a company they can settle down in and progress up the corporate ladder.  Whereas many company's only see employee's value in the project that they are working on, Booz seeks opportunities to develop thought leaders with the intellectual capital to deliver value to clients and the firm.  

* Creativity Rewarded.  Booz encourages and rewards those able to creatively deliver value to the firm and it's customers.  The firm stood up a strategic innovation group, has an annual firm-wide ""Idea compitition"" to encourage fresh thinking, and I've seen them allocate funds to associates to pursue their own ideas that have potential value to the firm.","*  Still No Good Senior Technical Track.  One of the challenges the firm has, particularly in technology-heavy markets, is developing and advancing technologists within the firm up the corporate ladder.  The firm's entrepreneurial focus, leads to an increased focus on market development skills as an essential promotional criteria.  This could include development of new capabilities/innovations, but senior leaders (particular those with a market focus) have a tendency to over-emphasize relationships and opportunity development.  While those skills are important, the firm needs to find a better approach to developing a technical promotional track above the lead associate level.  

* ""Home Team"" is Everything.  Booz' matrix-style organization has plenty of benefits, but one downside is that one's experience in the company is heavily shaped by the career management team.  For most, that's not a bad thing, but for some a poor career manager can mean the difference of staying billable or finding rewarding work.  What makes it more challenging is that many times one's career manager may have very little insight into the employees day-to-day work experience, especially as the employee moves from project to project.  The key for employees in that situation is to take an active role in their careers.  Always network, and don't be afraid to change career managers if it's beneficial to your long term success in the firm."

5081,Booz Allen Hamilton,Reputation Doesn't Mesh with Current Company Dynamic. This company is a Used to Be....,2013-12-16,2.0,Associate,Lots of opportunity for training. Learned great new skills in the first 2 years - then placed training on-hold. Very educated work-force. Peers are great to work with for the most part. Challenging projects with interesting work. Lots of variety (had 12+ projects in 5 years). Full shift from “consulting” to “staff augmentation” is underway. Met a handful of truly remarkable people in tenure at firm.,"Corporate culture: Gone downhill rapidly & created a toxic environment. High-overhead to keep hundreds of Sr. managers has impacted ability to compete for viable contracts & higher talented mid-level people. 

Leadership: Firm maintains managers, not leaders. Few career managers are actually interested in supporting YOUR career path/interests. Complete disconnect between leadership & workers. Prides itself on ethics, yet ethics violations are consistent. Back-stabbing, ""passive-aggressive"" managers are commonplace. Poor corporate communications from leadership to HR to the Help-less Desk. Firm still tries to promote itself, based on benefits and corporate culture from pre-IPO days.

Internal programs: Poorly conceived internal programs have eroded Booz culture.
For example --  “Work Where You Live” – became “The Way We Work” after enough new hires complained that they weren’t working anywhere near where they lived, and some where commuting more than a hour each way. 

“Take Share”, a program to hire up the best talent, basically was done to pull talent from other firms and into employment for a ‘trial’ period. This was evident when the memo defending ""Take Share"" came out to say that it wasn't done for this purpose. Many left good jobs to come to Booz only to find out that after their project ended they were given lack of work notices. 

Retirement: New “retirement plan” pay-in has firm only paying into your retirement AFTER you’ve served the full year (Dec 31st). As expected, a lot of Lack Of Work notices went out in Nov / Dec. Saves the firm millions. Also, it’s decreased from the 10% when I started to around 6% for incoming employees.

New program to hire up to 500 “junior” level employees on a temp basis (3 mo.) is being initiated (2014). If project continues they may stay on, if not they’ll be shown the door. Part-time labor w/o the benefits – a bonafide consulting sweatshop. 

Leadership: Expect leadership via absentia or via e-mail. “Career managers” have little experience or incentive to assist in finding projects for those on their ‘team’. Career managers come and go in rapid succession – I had 10 in 5 years. The higher you move up in the firm – you aren’t paid more (1.5% promotion raise) or valued more; you’re just given more work, the firm can bill more for you and it’s more difficult for YOU find a new project b/c of your higher billing rate. This leads to very high turn-over at the Associate and below level, but those in Lead Associate and above tend to stay for a long period because they’ve found their niche and are now in-charge of making the Booz “Kool-Aid”. Maintaining a CYA file for each project / person has become the norm.

Work/Life Balance: Though they tout it, they depend on your to believe it exists, but it depends on your client(s), project team and career team. Tele-work is client dependent. If you want to get promoted expect to work at least 2-weekends per month, a lot of nights and on various ‘internal projects’ – and even then you might not get promoted. I heard of one person who met 24 of 25 promotion criteria and wasn’t promoted! You're EXPECTED to attend a fair-share of extra-curricular events (brown-bags, happy hours, etc...) which are all 'volunteer' time. This is in addition to any proposal / business development work - which is in additional to your daily client work. This isn't fully explained during the hiring process. 

Once on a contract you cling to it for dear life – even if you can’t stand the client / the work / the team. You’re stuck. Because the minute you ask your career manager to see if you can get on / find something different – you’re labeled as a “problem”.

Benefits: Are being eroded daily. Retirement 401(k), training, ability for advancement, time-off, etc. For example: in 2013 - the firm did a policy revision for time-off -- which finally gave us 4 Federal holidays that we hadn't receive before (Presidents, MLK, Columbus, Veterans). Sounds good right?! But in exchange they took - the ""free"" day after Thanksgiving, two ""floating holidays"" and one day of Paid Time Off. Sounds like an even swap - 4 for 4, BUT -- they made it retroactive and wouldn't be implemented until the Booz fiscal year in April. Therefore they took the 4, but we only got 2 of the 4 holidays in return. When I asked a career manager about the 'bait & switch' they stated that it was 'bad communications.' Huh? This is just one of many examples of what's going on behind the curtain.

Promotions: Promotions are based on ‘good-ole’ boy network. Assessments are a joke & written by someone that you’ve probably never worked with or even met. No recourse to challenge anything in an assessment. Assessments USED to have a section called, “Motivations/Frustrations” but this was taken out recently. Probably because front-line managers scripted “Frustrations” to shield senior management from what was really going on / being said by employees."

The firm purports to having a ""networking system"" through which you are able to find billable work. Its not true if you are under a poor manager. Managers shut employees down when they try to network with senior staff.
Very caustic work environment. Its very stuffy in here. Lack of teamwork.Its a man eat man environment. Everyone tries to cover their tracks. Do not be surprised if you get rolled off a project almost immediately after you got started.
Most good people have left. The few who are left are constantly looking to get out.
Project work is not challenging and is very admin focused which anyone can do.
Unable to grow in career path. Not much reimbursement to take courses or classes.
Finding billable work is getting harder everyday.You will be let go in a heart beat if you cannot find a billable project.
If you are looking for a new position; please take on a position elsewhere before you consider this company. All the reviews on indeed, glass door and career bliss are not objective. You will be better served applying elsewhere."

Nice perk.,Worst performance appraisal process ever. Anyone that you have contact with during your work day can be questioned regarding your work ability and performance.

Also, the lean organization meant that I always had opportunities to build business skills that would otherwise not be possible at a major system developer.","The lean organization and high leverage meant there was always a lot on the plate.

BAH is becoming just another beltway contractor.","Work environment is heavily dependent upon which team you are on. Teams are managed by senior associates who work directly for a Vice President of a region or contract group. Senior Associates will lay-off, fire, hire temporarily and do what ever it takes to make the most money from a contract or to gain a contract on behalf of their Vice Presidents regardless of employee welfare. Expect to live and die by the contract. Your longevity may be determined by how much your salary takes away from the bottom line regardless of your value.

5135,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Over promised, under delivered, and incredibly disorganized",2013-10-31,2.0,Intelligence Analyst,"- Meaningful work in the DoD/IC world
- Pay is a little better than straight federal service
- Opportunity to move around and try out different projects or practice areas
- Has a pretty decent reputation and gets lumped in as a top-tier consulting firm in some people's minds","- Company is focused on short term bottom line over everything else
- Little to no bench time, if you're not billable, you get cut
- Management loves to sing praises of the firm, its values, how great it is, but the follow through is non-existent and they really don't care about the employees
- HR and Recruiting are terrible, under staffed probably (not their fault) but overall just disorganized - took 3+ months to get an offer letter when it was supossed to be done in 1-2 weeks
- Sketchy recruiting practices, recruiters deceive you to get you to sign an offer, then shy away from promises a few months later
- If you're on client site, its hard to really get to know others in the firm
- Hoteling is awkward and done just to save costs
- It is definitely not a top-tier consulting firm - it used to be, but now its just one of the many federal defense sector contractors that provide contract services
- Generous benefit plans have been cut significantly
- Pay is pretty close to par with what the fed gov pays, and probably is right on the line once you factor in the better benefits on the fed side
- Carlyle (the owners of the majority of the firm) could sell it at any minute, with unclear effects or they could continue loading it up with debt and taking dividends out


Bottom Line: Look elsewhere! Find a place that actually values its employees and doesn't jerk them around. Go the federal gov route or a contractor with a better reputation and working environment. If you join BAH you'll likely be worried about your job every time you cycle off a project, and you'll see the slow decline in the firm overall right around you."

- you are not promoted on your potential, but on the work you have done meeting the requirements of the next level while you work to maintain your current requirements/standards.

- not attending ""non-mandatory meetings"", or ""brown bags"", etc does not look well. However, if you do attend you have to make up the time.

5167,Booz Allen Hamilton,Overly Hyped Consulting Company With a Tarnishing Image,2013-10-07,3.0,Associate,"Booz Allen manages to employ some of the most intelligent and outgoing folks in the industry, and they support some of the most important and overarching government programs contracted out.  They push their employees hard to be the best they can be, which helps develop them into very competent professionals.  They push their culture to be the best consultant pretty hard, and also really drive home good ethics.","It's a very aggressive, self absorbed culture.  The 360 degree review process is excessive and very broad, essentially forcing anyone with an inclination to move up in their career to get their hands into many pots.  This is great for developing experience, making a name for yourself, and extending your wings, but most employees do just what it takes to check the box on their assessment.

It's extremely difficult to change contracts or industries, and some programs (mine was like this) actually try to sabotage this by playing mind games with you and internal political games.  I was part of the interview team and heard several stories by former employees that expressed distaste for not being able to move within their career.

Management can be self absorbed, political, and they are more concerned about profits and developing their career due to how agressive the culture is.


Thankless environment.  No matter how hard you worked and innovated, there was always a reason you could have done better and why you didn't make the cut for a promotion.  Even worse is when you worked to develop a product or solution, only to be told good game andhave it moved on for someone else to manage because they need you billable.

Benefits started out pretty good, but since then the ECAP program has been cut and employees no longer get the 10% gift into their retirement account.  Copensation was 20% or so less than competitors.

Unless you drink the punch and fit in to the ""good ole boys"" club, its going to be very difficult to advance."

They hired the brightest talent and provided staff with the tools, training, and empowerment to climb the professional ladder. Since going public, there has been re-orgs and a decrease in benefits that has given the company more of a body shop feel.",There is definitely a major micromanagement problem.  It often felt like the over management was keeping me from doing anything productive.
5170,Booz Allen Hamilton,Talent and attitudes of employees are poor,2013-10-05,2.0,Associate,"When I first started in 2011, my team and the company seemed decent. The projects were relatively interesting.","Pay is decent for a government contractor but not if you compare yourself to real consultants. That being said, you don't work the 60+ hrs/week consultants do so you can't really expect a consultant salary. People at BAH aren't very bright, which I think is fine so long as you don't try to convey yourself as experts in any particular topic. Unfortunately, to get ahead you do have to fib and convince your clients that you are talented and can solve their problems. The ones that are ambitious seem to have chips on their shoulder and/or napoleon complexes. They are all arrogant and think they're the cream of the crop. Yet most of them don't have the necessary technical skills you find at other companies. For example, the average BAH developer would never be able to get a job at Google and the average BAH business consultant would never get a job at McKinsey. Yet, the average BAH employee think they're better than everyone. This type of thinking makes for a tough work environment.

The work BAH is capturing these days is all over the place. Sometimes you get very challenging work like creating new metrics to evaluate gov programs. But sometimes you get remedial work like maintaining spreadsheets and dashboards.

Overall, I think the salary and work is decent. The people and their arrogant attitudes are what bring down the company. Management only cares about themselves and want for themselves to get promoted over helping their team out. The talent isn't all too great if you stack them up against other companies, yet they think they're the world's expert, for some odd reason."

5217,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Used to be great, now declining",2013-09-04,2.0,Software Engineer,"BAH does a decent job of finding new work for existing employees, although this is becoming more difficult since losing several large contracts recently.
- Their large size means that they can prime contracts, which has some perks.
- Flexible work hours are great for avoiding traffic.","In 2007 managing director Marc Gerencser said that, ""being privately held allowed the firm to consider long-range investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make"".  He was right and since going public in 2010, BAH has been on a steady decline from an employee perspective.

Traditionally BAH has valued their people as their biggest asset and salaries and benefits proved it, but that has changed.  Salaries are flat--no raises for management this year and small or no raises for others, but CEO Ralph Shrader managed to get a 47% increase.  Vacation and 401K contributions are being cut this year and next year.  Sure government contracting is hurting all over, but BAH compensation and benefits are now no better (and in some cases, worse) than their competitors.

Under Ralph Schrader's leadership, BAH has become extremely liberal.  Here are some of the forums that are sponsored and encouraged at the firm:

Administrative Professionals Forum
African American Forum
Armed Services Forum
Asia & Pacific American Forum
DiverseABILITY Forum
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, & Transgender Employees (GLOBE)
Latin American Forum
Middle East and North Africa Forum (MENA)
Multinational Forum
Native American Forum
Parents’ Forum
Rising Leaders Forum
Women’s Forum

With all this focus on diversity, the firm seems to have lost its identity of being a cohesive team with the most technically competent workforce.

One last item: annual assessments.  The firm knows this is a problem because they keep changing the process every 2 years, but it's still an arduous task with questionable benefits.  Every year my feedback it to learn more about the business side of things, and every year I feel like quitting when I hear that."
5218,Booz Allen Hamilton,Not a bad company but has changed since it went public,2013-09-04,3.0,Associate,"Good salary, good benefits.  Lots of resources to help you do your job. Over all Booz Allen isn't  a bad company. I've been with them off and on since the late 90's and have seen their ups and down.  They never shy away from changing things to make the firm better, but they sometimes take a long time to effect those changes (years and years in some cases).","Things have been slowly changing since going public.  Vacation cut a little as they came inline with federate holidays and 401k bonus (probably best benefit they had) has started to drop dramatically and getting them to free up the 5k education money you are promised each year is a difficult task.

Booz Allen used to say when they hired you, they hired you for a career not for a job.  That has changed in the last 5 years.  It's more of a butt in the seat company.

Though for a very long time I felt the firm was above and beyond all the other consulting firms out here, but not so much any more.  They are bringing their benefits inline with other companies, letting folks go as soon as their contract is over. 

Not much really stands out between them and the other consulting firms any more.

Still, with that said, I would probably consider a position with them in the future if the opportunity was right."
5219,Booz Allen Hamilton,"A ship with no direction at the moment, but actively working to find some",2013-09-04,2.0,Senior Consultant,"You work with great people.
If your on the right team initially it can real speed up your career position.
You will gain first hand insight into why employee morale is so important to a business, why in a service industry where people are your asset it is better to be private, and the danger of when barbarians at the gate take over your company.
If you want to eventually be a government employee, this is a great place to start.
Work Life balance at certain levels is a real thing.
Lots of good decks to read on the internal sharepoint site.
At the DC office very very good looking group of people
Average salary

All in all this was a slightly above average first job experience, and I was fortunate enough to be on a great team, with great managers, that initially allowed me to take some risks in my career (ie. in my three years there I worked for 4 different clients). Also I genuinely enjoyed the BAH people I was around and in fact, I would consider some of them friends for life. As stated earlier if you are really into government work, there is not a better place to start a career or make a switch. A couple people on my team and projects were able to go from mid level people at Booz to GS-14 within the government (granted they all had an advanced degree of some kind). Initially, my managers were very flexible with what kind of training I took, but after the firm went public a lot of things changed for the worse.","Expense and time reporting is a pain (although this is the same everywhere)
***Extremely siloed and specialized****
99% government work
Constantly going through changes
Often don't follow the same advice and methodology that they sell to clients
More and more staff augmentation (aka butt in seats)
Losing company culture as a result of people being located on client site and lots of new faces
Managers under extreme cost focus and pressure which results in them being very risk averse and short sighted
Lots of dishonesty from upper management in messaging and communication
Low employee morale
The barbarians are at the gate

the most important advice I can give here is be very careful what projects you select, because you become your resume (meaning your resume drives your career path less than you) while this is understandable and to be expected in consulting it is not what most people are told when they enter the firm. They are told about the wide range of opportunities, but as a result of how strict most clients are about the resumes they select this isnt very accurate. Additionally, many incoming college consultants don't realize how hard it is to switch from government over to the commercial side after you have only done government work. Your only shot will be in healthcare or in a compliance role, and it will be very difficult to switch from government to high level strategy roles. Another big issue is that you become very jaded, working for the government is depressing, there is so much waste and in some ways you are a part of it. This was especially troubling while I was on a project at the VA, the money they were paying for consultants was wasted due to poor management on the clients end. Which leads to another point, calling BAH a consulting company is not accurate any more, because over 65% of the work there is staff augmentation meaning you are a contractor that works for a government employee and happens to be paid by BAH. The employee morale here is very low, as a result of sort of a cultural limbo. It's actually quite fascinating and would make a great HBS case study, basically there were a large (but shrinking) number of people who were here in the good old days (pre split with Booz and Company), after this split and Carlyle came in not much changed, but as a result of various hiring initiatives, lack of winning work predicted, the political landscape, and going public the company culture was decimated and you had people angry that the place they knew was basically gone, and you had people angry that what they were sold prior to joining wasnt the case (this was because the people who were selling it generally believed what they were being sold from their managers). In general this has led to a large % of people who are dispassionate about work because of a lack of career options and upward mobility, and as a result client delivery has suffered (it's not bad work, it's just not above and beyond anymore). The biggest issue at this place is that the executive team treat its employees like morons and feed them the prepackaged messaging that everyone learns at B school. Most intelligent employees can see through this and that makes people even less efficient and interested in going above and beyond. Lastly there are no real incentives any more to do anything extra outside of your job (unless you buy that you should go above and beyond because you have a job). This means that more than likely any extra work you do, you will not see the benefit, in career progression, or salary increases (bonuses etc). There is a log jam of people at the higher levels, because they do not have an up or out mentality. That being said you may see some benefit in terms of the responsibility you are given, but quite frankly this can only help you if you are looking for another job, but even then you will be underpaid, because your next jobs salary will be based on your current jobs salary. All in all it is not a bad experience, you just need to make sure your expectations are managed correctly, and I think if you come in with the right understanding and expectations it can be quite an enjoyable place (at any level under lead associate).

Take what I say with a grain of salt though, because the stock price is at an all time high, so clearly management is doing a lot of things correctly for their investors. This is a classic case of what is good for investors, may not be good for employees and clients."

-At the headquarters, it takes at least 4 years to have a grasp on the corporate culture and unspoken rules.
-Hierarchical: They call themselves a flat organization only so you can find out later that people are upset if you have a window office if it's outside of your rank. The client has the highest rank; the client is feared as if he were king and executioner."

Everyone is forced in to a ""consultant"" track rather than providing an option for a technical track. While changes are attempting to be made, it seems to be too little too late. Core Values and the culture are of very high regard, but when there is a blatant disregard for some of the core values, sometimes they fly under the radar with no consequence. Work/Life balance is preached to the moon and back but I have never seen real work/life balance with the majority of the people I have worked with.

They had a very deep bench of talent but that is all starting to change as they become more and more like every other large body shop in the area.,Ever since they were bought by Carlyle the culture changed for the worse along with the benefits and compensation.  Management at the VP and up level is completely clueless with regards to what motivates their employees and how to communicate with them. Any interaction with them is straight out of a Dilbert cartoon.  Some Principals get it but you can tell the ones that are about to be promoted because it looks like act like they have been given a lobotomy.  The mid-level management core (the Sr. Associates) is completely demoralized and most are leaving as fast as they can. Very few talented people at the Associate level want to be promoted since the don't perceive any value in doing so. Booz no longer rewards talent.   This is going to leave a hollowed out shell of a company that will most likely have a catastrophic collapse in the near future.

The assessment process is time-consuming, stressful, and ultimately pointless, as promotions in reality depend on whether or not you are ""liked"" by your administrative chain. To be liked by management, you are expected to contribute to practice growth and development, as well as personal development and trainings, but are not given any time to do this -- it's all ""volunteer,"" -- which means work-life balance is a joke.

Next year the 10% 401K will be going away and there will be a 6% match. This is still good, but they are losing one of their main draws as a company. With the difficult financial times, they are being pressured to bid on contracts at a much more price-concious rate, whereas they have historically been able to win contracts on the quality and expertise of their service offering.

It was great to say I worked for Booz Allen because the well earned reputation was supported by years of excellent work and very successful client engagements.  BUT NOW, they have gone the way of the SAIC.  A consulting firm that now has over 25,000 employee can't maintain their earned stature.  We hired people with pulses and put them on contract simply because they fit the bill rate.  Quality went through the floor and every attempt to correct it was lost in the price to win.

Very little opportunity to attend technical seminars and conferences to learn about new trends, tools and offerings in the market."
5295,Booz Allen Hamilton,Since going public Booz Allen has become a not so desirable place to work,2013-06-18,2.0,Lead Associate,I have worked for a couple of defense contractors and Booz Allan has some of the best insurance coverage in the business.  This includes short term disability and life insurance.,When I first arrived at Booz there was a sense of community and taking care of their own. Bench time could be any where from 3-6 months before potentially receiving a lack of work letter.  Now employees are getting 40-80 hours and then receiving a lack of work letter.  The other huge downfall of Booz is that the ECAP program is going away in the next 2 years.  The typical deposit to your 401k used to be about 10% of your salary and in 2 years it completely goes away.  All in all there is no more sense of family in Booz and it is just becoming another place to work.

Booz Allen is no different than any other corporation, and probably a lot worse because it's ""entrepreneurial"" environment is pretty cutthroat.",Pay is probably less than what you rate if you have military or government experience. Benefits have been significantly curtailed since the IPO and the Carlyle Group is bleeing the corporation dry. (Reference the recent article in Forbes.)

The ability to change which contract you're working on is nice.  If you like to work from home this company is great.","There are no local teams anymore (unless you work client-site), so expect to never meet any of the people you're working with.  The Hoteling system is awful unless you already know a bunch of people who work in the same building.  Everyone who actually goes to the office only communicates with the few people they already know there, and since you'll be with a different person every day (sometimes multiple per day) you'll never get the chance to get to know anyone outside your team - who you'll never meet face-to-face anyway because they'll be spread all over the East coast.  For junior staff who don't know anyone this creates an extremely difficult environment where you are left with two options: go to the office and be alone in a crowd, or just work from home all the time.  The latter sounds great (and certainly has its perks) but after a couple years of being locked in your apartment with limited social interaction, it starts to get old real quick (not to mention the massive loss of productivity when working from home)."

5356,Booz Allen Hamilton,Should have been better,2013-03-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Booz Allen has a decent enough reputation in the federal consulting space and is thought of more for strategy consulting. The capability areas are delineated well meaning a person can work on projects that are aligned with their capability (strategy, technology, analytics). 

You'll work with a very diverse group of people, some coming through the standard college route, some as former federal employees, and others coming after military service. Many of them will be great.","Unfortunately, Booz Allen Hamilton has determined that it would rather begin to operate as a federal job shop. That is, you're only valuable to the contract for which you can fulfill a specific role. This isn't consulting and unfortunately, Booz Allen is following Federal money like Accenture and Deloitte Consulting in their Washington DC/Arlington, VA offices (the majority of their Federal consulting employees do not perform the type of work common to consulting staff in the rest of the firm) and performing staff augmentation work (not why most prospective consultants come to the industry). Additionally, the well delineated areas also means employees can be prevented from getting on new projects when there is less work within one capability vs. others even when previous work experience makes an employee the ideal candidate.

The diversity of the workforce comes with a caveat. You'll meet many people because so many leave regularly or are given ""Lack of Work"" letters. Several people in my own reporting chain left within my first month at the firm. As with those after me, the firm had been on a hiring tear bringing in more personnel than it could do anything with. As a result, your first project with the firm could very well be your last. Unfortunately, the firm lost several of its largest contracts late in 2012 leaving much of its staff to scramble for work as the majority of the firm's work requires high level Federal security clearances (perfect for people with previous federal work experience or military service) or high travel (if you aren't paid exceedingly well and have responsibilities, perhaps a family, you'll have a difficult time traveling). 

Another problem with the firm lies in the importance of the  personal network that is needed in the firm to find projects. The only formal process for getting new projects is reliant on the efforts of Senior Associates who are ultimately dictated to by Principles. As a result, new employees will have little influence in the process and can find themselves on the way out very soon.

Pay is not great. Unfortunately, this is the result of two things. First, the firm's hiring pool is inflated by two groups who are not typical of consulting (I listed three above) - simple understanding of economics there. Second, staff augmentation work in the current Federal environment now almost always requires a ""low bid"" to win. As a result, the firm low-balls offers with a take it or leave it approach until they find someone dumb or desperate enough to take them with the anticipation that the cost of each person put on a contract will satisfy the profitability margins required by the board and partners. As a result, many people hope to leave for greener pastures making many people indifferent about the firm."
5357,Booz Allen Hamilton,Used to be a great place to work,2013-03-21,3.0,Associate,Decent pay and easy enough job.

5362,Booz Allen Hamilton,Overall my experience at Booz Allen has been good.,2013-03-18,4.0,Associate III,Overall my experience at Booz Allen has been good. I work on a distributed Team and therefore I don't have to deal with the office politics and office work environment that others may have. Your work experience at Booz Allen depends on who you work for and your specific client assignment.  Mine have been mostly good; so I have been generally happy with my work experience at Booz Allen and have learned from it.,"My pay has been good, but as Federal contract work has become difficult to win, there has been a tightening up of salary increases, benefits (401k program being reduced) and other nickel and dime issues such as getting office supplies approved or travel reimbursements have more nit-picky questions from audit.  Part of this may also be from the firm going public in 2010 and ongoing pressures on management for profitability.  Probably 80% of Booz Allen's work is Federal contracts.  So a reduction in this market area going forward will be issue for the firm for the foreseeable future until it can transition to other growing markets in the private sector or internationally.

Federal clients can at times be great to work with, and at other times, not so much.  There is a lot of uncertainty within the Federal government now, which makes getting direction from Federal clients difficult, especially for long-term planning or commitments.   

Several reviewers have described Booz Allen as having essentially moved to a staff augmentation firm or ""butts-in-seat"" vendor, rather than a true consulting firm. I would agree that a large bulk of the work that BAH now does is that type of work, but they also still do some high quality consulting work.  A portion of my work could be described as staff augmentation and that has been ok for this period in my life as I have found it a little less stressful and easier work at times than full-time consulting work.   It's just important for potential applicants to understand the type of assignment they would be working and give some thought whether you want to do that work and would grow from it career wise before jumping in."

- client team members' attitudes emphasizing compliance to the contract (rather than collaboration and change towards the art of the possible)

In those four years, most of the pros I had listed have steadily been withdrawn.  But for now, if you were a new hire you can still feel some of the vestiges of what made the firm the firm: a desire to support its employees to make sure that the best and brightest came here instead of our competitors.  It's on its way out, though.","The incident I feel most sums up where things have gone downhill:  I'm not the only staff who noticed that they solicitied firm-wide input to spend time taking the employee survey--a large portion of which discussed our time off benefits--only to release a new policy on that issue within days of the survey closing changing our benefits.  In other words, to early for them to have possibly had any time to review and actually care about the results.  For a firm that markets strategic communications expertise to clients this was an epic fail.

In addition, most of us have seen the ECAP phase-out writing-on-the-wall coming for a while.  Mark my words, this is just the start of what eventually will turn into a vanilla 401(k)/matching system.  Just like our competitors."

Career growth and overall experience varies greatly depending on what team you are on"
5404,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Some Important Positives, But Questionable Direction And Dysfunctional Management",2013-02-14,2.0,Senior Consultant,"-There are some really great and talented people who work there and I suspect they're attracted by the Booz Allen brand.
- The benefits were very solid, particularly the ECAP, although I've heard this has changed since I left about two months ago and the ECAP is no longer around.
- The online resources for training are outstanding and very accessible.  The best I've seen at any employer so far.  If anyone says that they weren't able to get training at Booz Allen, they simply weren't trying.","- While people are attracted to Booz Allen because of the brand (as I was), that brand is in sharp decline.  As has been mentioned repeatedly, the company went public a few years ago and they're owned by a private equity group that demands quarterly returns that Booz Allen just isn't able to meet considering that sequestration and cuts are now hitting their biggest client.  As a result, benefits are being curtailed, the company is not hiring people who want market level wages (I had three highly qualified people I recommended dropped from consideration because they wanted equivalent salaries to what they made elsewhere) and pay increases and promotions have dried up.  The company is also putting a premium on finding new business over delivering quality results to the client.  This will eventually ruin this company and its brand. 
- The assessment process and career development are a joke because your entire career development is bottlenecked through one person...your career manager.  If he likes you, you're golden (unless he doesn't know how to write an assessment).  If he doesn't like you, it doesn't matter if your peers, other supervisors, the clients and everyone else love you and write stellar feedback for you...your career is toast unless you can change career managers.  This is particularly noticeable on client sites, where your team lead and career manager could end up being the same person.  In many locations there's not enough outside involvement to gain perspective, so you are whatever your career manager says you are.  You can get around this by finding a mentor (who is actually more of a patron) but don't expect help from anyone but HR in finding one if you're on client site(the Senior and Lead Associates in my chain were of no help).  Most people on client site appear so cut off that they have no more idea how to find a mentor than you do, unless they've been around a lot longer than you do (which most probably haven't been, as Booz Allen has had a lot of turnover recently).  Basically, if you're considering a client site job with Booz Allen and, during the interview process, find yourself with any reservations at all about the people who will be either your career manager or team lead, you should walk away unless you can't find anything better...it probably won't work out well for you.
- In line with the last cons, Booz Allen has put a premium on expansion over quality over the last few years.  This has led to them putting people of questionable ability and temperament into positions of authority largely on the basis of them being in positions of leadership in the military (often hired by someone they worked with in the military).  The project I was on suffered greatly from this as many of these leaders were completely inept at dealing with personnel who didn't have the ability to quit their jobs and go elsewhere if they were mistreated.  This was the most common gripe I heard across my project from different client sites...incompetent, self-serving leaders who had no idea how to develop or even retain personnel or how to manage client relationships.  This led to a high attrition rate."

They force employees to spend ridiculous amounts of time evaluating their performance over that previous year.

Good people (but many of the good ones are gone)","Once great culture is failing
Still clinging to 'diversity' as a differientiator - yet the company is still driven by the middle-aged white guy
Benefits are being slashed - holidays, ECAP
Hoteling has destroyed the cutlure
Constant threat of layoffs
Required to pick up the work left by people who are being laid off or who resign; the workload is overwhelming with no relief in sight"
5415,Booz Allen Hamilton,Satisfied with Booz,2013-02-06,4.0,Lead Associate,"competitive salaries, very good benefits, excellent work/life balance","difficult market is dictating a shift in how business is done which in turn is affecting the culture at the firm (some for better, some for worse)"
5416,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Very challenging, yet rewarding",2013-02-05,3.0,Associate Consultant,The salary was top notch,The work was overly strenuous
5417,Booz Allen Hamilton,Not What It Once Was...,2013-02-04,3.0,Associate Developer,"Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is pretty stable if you work in the technology sector despite changing government sector. If you work in Cyber, Systems Development, or something related your job security is pretty stable. Even when contracts funding becomes problematic I have never found issues finding new projects. 

One thing I love about BAH is that they seem to offer pretty flexible schedules which helps work-life balance. It all depends on the contract though. If your offsite at a government office things are pretty limited depending on the contract, but if your working onsite management wil let you work from home at times and with the new hoteling model you can eliminate long commutes altogether. 

I think BAH offers plenty of opportunities to network with individuals even though hoteling model has taken away from this somewhat. There are plenty of forums, focus groups, and events to give you an opportunity to meet people across the company.","BAH is extremely political. You may find yourself in hot water at times for saying the ""wrong"" thing. The ""wrong"" thing depends on the person and can range from just being honest and at times not responding at all to something. The culture at BAH can be troubling at times. From my experience individuals tend to go to someone's direct report about an issue rather than resolve the issue with the individual. Management from my experience has accountability issues when it comes to their own decisions when things go awry.

Moving up in BAH will require you have the right people in your corner. Again this is about politics more than anything else. Who your friends are and who is backing you is very important. Nevermind what your peers think it's more about WHO thinks WHAT that matters. 

Recently, there has been an exodus of people leaving the firm. As others may have echoed in their reviews the firm was purchased by Carlye Group and Investment firm. Things began to rapidly change afterwards. What also hurt the company was the decision to go public. As a result of the new market and declining earnings, the ECAP (401k) program will be revamped giving employees less employer contribution. Many benefits have been reduced or eliminated. Employee rewards are less, networking events (that cost money) have been eliminated, and PTO accrual rates have been reduced.

BAH was a dream company to work for 5-6 years ago, but they are slowly becoming an average company that does not pay competitive wages according to the market. What attracted people to BAH was the culture and benefits. Both are a shell of their former selves."
5418,Booz Allen Hamilton,Soon to be former employee,2013-02-04,2.0,Associate,"- Tuition Reimbursement (5K per calender year)
- Decent PTO","- ECAP no longer at 10% after 2/15/13.  
- Lower than average salaries compared to competitors
- Lack of job security
- Low morale due to lack of job security
- Too DoD heavy; you need to get into more commercial work

A couple rounds of lay offs targets administrative professionals and mid to senior managment - more are likely on the way.  Perks have tapered off after the company went public.  Promotion above lead associate is difficult in the current business enviroment.  Territorial management makes it difficult to explore business opportunities outside your team/geography.   Recently announced the cancellation of the current Employee Capital Accumulation Program - a great benefit which put 10% of the employees salary into a 401K with no employee contribution required.  Transitioning ECAP to a 401K matching in line with the rest of the industry."

I would expect that trend to continue. We also just lost our floating holidays and the claim was it gave us ""more flexibility"". Raises greatly reduced over the past few years.

We just lost several managers, and the process lacked any formal communication from leadership until days later. In many cases, clients and direct reports were unaware of the change outside of the rumor mill. 

Most of the good people at the firm have left now, and the few that remaining are all looking after the past week. What will remain, as is much of the new employees is suits with nothing inside. (Can we say lipstick on pigs?!)"

Good first employer for recent graduates.","Smaller teams can largely exist independent of their home offices, yet on paper exist as a single entity. The problem with this is all communication can be routed through a single team leader, collaboration can cease to exist, HR problems develop (especially if with that team leader) and client relationship health is largely reported by a single individual, regardless of how accurate it is. This can (and often does) lead to a ""high school cafeteria"" type of environment. 

Mid to upper level management is increasingly made up of unqualified individuals, individuals fulfilling a larger goal of demographic diversity and individuals with poor managerial skills (if not good consulting skills). Assessment process riddled with inconsistencies, interpretations and ""exceptions"". 

A ton of lip service in policy establishment, management practices, consulting skills and day to day client relationship training. Training time increasingly unclear as to how it effects work schedule (recent policy change).

5475,Booz Allen Hamilton,This once great consulting firm has become an outsourcing company,2012-12-20,2.0,Associate,"There are pockets of the firm that still retain the former greatness of the Booz Allen culture.  The collaborative spirit, adherence to core values, thought leadership, excellence in everything that they do, career development for all staff, professionalism (acting that way and treating others that way), client service, hiring the best and brightest.  To date, I have not run upon anything quite like those aspects in my 10 year career.  I learned things at Booz Allen that I would never have learned elsewhere, and really the ""secret sauce"" of what made Booz Allen great could really work anywhere.","Things were great when I first hired onto Booz Allen in 2008.  Then things went quickly south.  First the Carlyle buyout in mid-2008 which changed things a little but not appreciably.  Then going public in late 2010 when the Partners said ""nothing would change"" when in fact everything changed (weekly utilization drills, increased scrutiny of expenses).  Then the mass hiring in 2011 of unqualified staff for non-existent positions in the ill-timed, ill-advised ""Take Share"" initiative.  Then the mass downsizing in 2011-2012.  Bit by bit, the firm has become beholden to the shareholders versus what it was always beholden to: its clients.  This has led the company to value a ""butts in seats"" outsourcing approach to government contracting versus the classical management consulting approach of the gilded age of Booz Allen.  No longer are people valued at Booz Allen, they are just a commodity to be sold cheaply.  When your task runs out, you're out the door.  In some fairness to Booz Allen leadership, the clients (or really, client, the Federal Gov't) don't value thought leadership in the classical sense (The gov't provides the thought leadership, right?).  Joking aside, I don't think that Booz Allen knows what hit them since the change was so gradual they really think that nothing has changed in the culture of the company.  

One last thought and that is that the management at Booz Allen made a fatal mistake in relying on the double-digit annual revenue growth model where the firm's revenue grows fast, faster than the infrastructure can keep up leading to a growth-binge-growth-binge model where profits come from the infrastructure not keeping up.  This model may have been great for the fat years, but is dismally insufficient for the current fiscally constrained environment."

At the outset, it was a great company to work for with a myriad of opportunity to learn and grow from smart and talented people and from a company with a 95+ year tradition in consulting. I worked primarily in the public sector and day-to-day the client-work coudl be so-so (it is government, so I wasn't always working with the most talented people operating in a high-performing environment), but I took pride in working for Booz and found it to live up to its ideals as a ""great place to work"" and learned a lot. UNTIL.....","Just about everything changed with the Carlyle private equity firm investment and subsequent public offering. Booz's reputation in the marketplace is pretty at odds with the internal reality.  Booz Allen Hamilton is no longer a consulting company, but a large Federal contractor. In the past 2-3 years the company culture has slowly gone adrift as we focused on short-term financial results, cost-cutting, and rewarding senior management and Carlyle for their ""performance"" (e.g. see $1B ""special"" dividend paid for with junk debt and cash we should be conserving in this uncertain gov't market). At the same time, training, benefits, awards, salary increases, team all-hands, and holiday parties are all being cut or trimmed. But, don't worry, you'll be expected to be available for early AM, evening, and weekend work anyway. 

By the end it was a very disillusioning environment with little upward mobility thanks to extreme politics and a misguided desire to hire ""talent"" externally, as is reflected in the 30-40% turnover in some teams (those are actual metrics, no exaggeration). The best and brightest who have other opportunities are sadly fleeing for the exits while a lot who are left describe their career as ""at least it's a paycheck"".

SO....if you're looking for a stable job as a Federal contractor, Booz isn't a bad place to land. If you're looking for what Booz is trying to sell a lot of people on...an opportunity for challenging and strategic consulting work where you'll be rewarded, I'd recommend Accenture, Deloitte, or a lot of other mid-size actual consulting firms."

They will make their lower level mgrs give their recommendations, and if it goes well will take the credit for it, but if it goes bad they will punish the mgrs that advised them.
- The IT support side is staffed really thinly, like everywhere else, so you may be the only one to support a system or program.

Principals care less about being team leaders and dump on Senior Associates who never have time to fulfull their role as Career Managers. And being a Lead Associate is a thankless job. 
They are firing experienced employees and replacing them with cheaper labor categories

Booz used to be a special place to work with lots of opportunties to get on interesting projects. Not so anymore. In fact, if you're a HUMAN CAPITAL professional, STAY AWAY from this place as they are laying people off.  And since June of 2012, the new trend is experienced staff are quitting at a fast pace.

Since going public and closing offices under the guise of ""hoteling,"" the firm has lost its way and it's really not a collaborative environment anymore. I've been around the firm a long time and it's simply dreadful that people no longer talk to one another and that the Senior Associates and above do VERY little to help you find a project.

It's not a safe place to work anymore. Watch the reviews here.....see the pattern. Shrader just sent out a bulletin to let people know they are about to lay off a lot of folks due to ""limited opportunities,"" so the writing is on the wall.

Advice to Senior Management – Go back to the model where teamwork and collabboration was key, hire people to do business development versus trying to get everyone to be a salesman, learn to appreciate employees more, revive the connection with folks at client sites and start speaking the truth in VP meetings. Don't tell us we need to have fun and then guilt people into charging their time for an all hands meeting..."

I also believe that management (both upper and middle) is sincere in wanting to build a company that supports its employees and their professional growth.","Culture: BAH has a very conservative corporate culture, and this can mean that management and others are not straightforward - there is a lot of euphemism. When things go well, there is effusive praise and management engages in the best practice of calling it out. When things don't go well, no one will speak directly about it - and the words used are things like ""opportunity"" to make it sound positive.

Bureaucratic Organization: Since BAH sells into the federal government, they are organized to reflect federal government mindset on talent and personnel, which is preoccupied with over-specialization, and an emphasis on experience over talent or potential. This means that success is not really measured by results, but by what certifications one can say they have and what training courses you can put on your transcript. The focus on specialization further means that it is nearly impossible to move laterally - even as a low level employee. Entry level consultants are immediately branded and pigeon-holed with a particular specialty and market. 

Bid Strategy: BAH has grown immensely fast over the last 20 years (until recently). To capture all this business, they have hired aggressively and moved into ever more areas of federal government business where at scale, they can generate profits. This means, though, that Booz is now engaged in mostly contracts that are long-range and don't involve very high-level, strategic, or challenging work. In this sense, they are putting butts in seats, rather than hiring the best and brightest and moving them around to challenging assignments.

Honestly, none of the people I knew at BAH who were impressive, smart, or effective stayed for much more than a year and a half. Its not a world class consulting company, its a well-reputed government contracting behemoth."

The inflexible corporate structure does not lend itself towards putting together the best qualified teams of professionals to succeed at customer solutions.

I have seen leadership turn a blind eye to providing the best solution for a client if it went against quarterly profit goals.

It also still carries a strong brand name. If you are interested in US government contracting jobs, the firm seems to have a slightly more professional environment than its peers.","In short, Booz Allen mischaracterizes itself as a strategy consulting firm. The firm has an identify crisis and is struggling to define its direction and client base.  In the meantime, it is a US government contractor largely dependent on work for the US Department of Defense.  If you are interested in  consultancies such as Booz & Co., McKinsey, or Boston Consulting Group, Booz Allen Hamilton is not the place to look.  

Many of the firms's differentiators departed when Booz Allen spun off its commercial and international consultancy, Booz & Co.- a collegial environment which fosters creative thinking, work which requires critical thinking and concrete analysis, and exposure to a variety of business models, clients, and projects.  Expect your exposure to be limited to one US government department.  Your transferable skills may lead you to working for the US government or the public sector practices of other Washington DC based contractors, integrators, and large commercial consulting firms that absorbed public sector work.  

The pay is notoriously low and the the layers of bureaucracy have increased sharply in the past 5 years.  As an example, expect to report to 3 or 4 managers, some of whom you may never meet and who live and work in a different state.  In addition, the firm's culture has shifted significantly, encouraging order takers rather than self-governing, proactive professionals.  

The shift  left many employees in awkward positions.  Employees who began work that commercial consultancies- strategy projects for commercial companies or foreign governments- were reassigned to contract administration in a cubical in a US government office building.  Employees MBAs or doctorates found themselves doing work that a sharp intern can accomplish.  The result has been the consistent departure of people with those skills and credentials, or a ""punch the clock mentality"" for employees who want to finish up their MBAs and look for employment elsewhere.  

In fact, degrees in business are less valued than certifications in US defense systems acquisition, project management, and project planning. Other skills are (1) operational knowledge of a single weapons system, such as a 20 year non-commissioned officer who can pinpoint the exact number spare parts needed for one model of a ship, plane, or missile launcher (2) back office skills such as contract administration, billing, and event planning (3) hyper-specialized skills, such as computer programming, advanced knowledge of Microsoft Project, and (4) high-level clearances complimented by hyper-specialized skills."

The main issue I have with this practice is that it isn’t up to the junior staff to win work, it’s up to the Partners and Principles to win work. There is also a related attrition problem.

Most of the focus seems to be on burning down the funding without evaluating the value being provided to the client. Sad part is the client doesn't really know/understand what they are getting (a lot of fluff). The management lacks people and professional development skills."

The firm offers so many benefits and opportunities for personal and professional improvement that the only thing standing in the way of the ascending the corporate ladder is the personal desire of the employee.,It seems as though the overall focus of the firm has shifted away from client service and employee satisfaction to more of a up or out mentality where you are either on contract and generating revenue or you're history...
5548,Booz Allen Hamilton,Not a place to work since going public,2012-09-17,1.0,Associate,"Some very good/decent/smart colleges here. 
A few very good managers/SR. Associates.
Top leadership received the ax which helped the company's bottom line.","I started here before they went public. That was the best time to be a ""boozer."" You had a lot of client work, and the company was growing rapidly. Most employees were able to move up fairly quickly from level 1 to level 3 in about 4-5 years. Today now that its public, that has all changed. Good people are passed over for promotion because of the bottom line. Perks like lunch on BAH have been curtailed so much that it just doesn't happen (unless you are a partner). Christmas parties are lackluster and boring. A lot of chest pumping to the remaining folks who were not laid off. Before they were public the push was to grow, mold, and mentor people into great consultants. Today the push is to get someone into a seat so they can bill hours 5% over contract, uncompensated. That is the BAH dream now. 

There is a good saying that you can buy something and sell it at a higher price to the next sucker. If you end up not being able to sell that at a higher price, you are the sucker. This can be applied to people as well. If you still fill a seat, you are not learning anything and you just know that once that contract expires you will get your lack of work letter... and you are not actively looking for a new job, you are the sucker.  Sadly, BAH has become just another body shop so the real value of the firm is down the tubes. Its a lousy performing stock, and the insiders dictate every action the company does. 

Before they went public, the partners and higher ups lamented, repeatedly that nothing will change, we will not mess wit the secret sauce. I heard this so many times. Now I look back at the company and I realize the lack of truth from senior people was just sad. They are all liars in the face of their employees, but the tough military like structure makes it impossible to actually call them out for being liars. 

Diminished benefits.
Fantastic 401K is WILL go away because shareholders demand this.
Now just another body shop. 
Successive layoffs mean employees work/live in fear."

I have worked for Booz Allen for five years (almost) and the first four years I thought I would work for BAH for the rest of my life. The management were respectful and remained committed to their people. Those people are gone now... The tuition assistance is great provided you don't find or have to find another job. As you have to stay for a considerable amount of time before you don't have to pay back the full amount of the tuition assistance.,The company culture is in serious decline. Like many of the other reviews the company has gone from an employee first work/life balance which made people want to work for Booz Allen and remain hard working and loyal to rats trying to jump off a sinking ship in some aspects. As soon as the company went public it seemed to change overnight. If you have a life outside of Booz Allen you might want to find something more secure. The firm needs to concentrate on its retention of people who built the firm up to where it is and not shareholders. Referral bonus is among the lowest in the industry.

The firm isn't positioned to do work on small strategy teams, preferring to launch massive, expensive engagements (which is very pragmatic and stable, but boring).

Yes, Booz does a lot of proposal work outside of the normal work day; however, you normally don't have to get involved unless the proposal is a recompete for the contract you are on and the window for working the proposals are relatively small. Booz promotes from within and they bring in people so it's up to you to get involved with business development if you want to get promoted. There are no guarantees on this and that is one of the cons. The people at Booz were great to work with and to work for.  My pay was good for the industry I was in.  My entire time was on client site.","If you want to get promoted beyond Associate, you must do a great job in your normal job and do business development. Even then there is no guarantee. I saw people who worked extremely well and hard, did business development, and still didn't get beyond Associate.  I was on the outside looking in and there may have been other areas the people were weak in but there were a couple of people that I knew were very good, had great client relationships, did a lot toward business development and still didn't get promoted. As you can see from my rating, I was still very satisfied with my time at Booz and left the door open to return if I every want to. The other con for a ""vet"" of Booz was the company changed a lot over my nine years and usually to the displeasure of the workers, but the business climate has also changed so the changes were needed, such as no longer being a private firm and going public. That caused accountability to shareholders and less loyalty to the individual employee, in my opinion."

They were not big on their Career switching program, though they do push it as a pro, they don't advise folks to get into the program.

The staffing process is a joke, there is no process you are expected to apply to each job as you would externally and have go to through the same process (i.e. multiple interviews, non responsive hiring managers, recruiters and even negotiate salaries due to salary caps). There is no help from the internal resource managers.

In terms of work, most of the work is staff augmentation. There are very limited consulting opportunities, for the most part BAH is operating as a staffing firm where it fills seats with its resources.

BAH hired several hundred people for its new ""commercial practice"" yet laid them off within a matter of 3-6 months so job stability is non-existent. 

You are expected to take any project whether it is a skillset match or not or even aligned with your career goals just to keep your job.

There is no severance process, you are just given a 2 week notice and shown the door unlike most of the top tier consulting firms.

The assessment process is very cumbersome and biased. They say it is a 360 feedback yet only specific feedback is filtered into the final assessment to ensure that you get the planned ""assessment"""

The matrixed structure, which has negatives, also has positives in that you can easily gain a network of people who can help you down the line.","Most people seem to wear a corporate mask.  Every once in a while you meet someone who behaves like a normal human being, and it shocks you.   

You are on your own to find work.  If you don't have work for a while, you are gone.

Teams are all over the place geographically, which increases even more because of hoteling, making it incredibly hard to collaborate effectively with teammates, and the work quality suffers because of it.   

These three things above make the overall work experience not enjoyable, and cause a detachment with other employees, even with teammates and bosses - and not the camaraderie you'd get at better companies.

Management is inconsistent.  As a technical person, I would have thought that a company of this size and distinction would be more organized and use proven methods for managing technical projects.  In my experience, most of the people managing us had no idea how to do it, and were just winging it.   Very disappointing.

The company generally has an attitude that its employees are the best of the best, but it has shocked me how many people I have worked with who don't have much in terms of ability or passion.  There are a fair amount of smart and driven people, yes, but they seem to be  outnumbered by the ones who aren't.

I've met 1-2 life time friends here and I would not trade that for anything. Although the company is drastically changing since it went public, I was fortunate enough to participate in a number of excellent learning opportunities. The training was amazing and has really helped my career. Further, I've been very happy with the project experiences that I was given and it allowed me to apply my knowledge in new and different ways, branching out into new fields and building an excellent resume.","Although I've made a couple of amazing friends, I have to say that the large majority of people I worked with or engaged with at Booz Allen were very difficult and challenging. There is a egotistical hierarchy within the firm and expect to work with overly aggressive and hostile people. Further, the firm does not work as a meritocracy, it is all about who you know and building those relationships. If you expect to put your head down and work hard to achieve great results for your clients, don't expect to be rewarded for that - unless it is rewarded with additional work. 

Further, you should expect to work a great deal. You will be expected to deliver to clients full-time, work a ridiculous 360 degree assessment process, and build business. This is when the firm is not asking you to volunteer time to administrative tasks and meetings, help develop marketing materials, or build employee resource groups, etc. 

Don't be expected to be provided the resources you need to do good work either. You volunteer your own cell phones, home office equipment, etc. Booz Allen definitely creates barriers to success and is looking to decrease costs in order to maximize profit margins on billing rates. Your compensation will likely be low - negotiate up front. I've seen some truly remarkable resumes accept lower than market salaries and job titles. 

Security is also at risk. If you are unable to find a project in 60 days, expect to receive notice that you will be leaving the firm. I observed a time when we went on a hiring spree and were unable to staff those individuals, just to see them let go in droves. Further, I watched loyal employees with 10+ years with the firm be fired in the most gruesome way. Individuals were told on Friday that if they received a phone call Monday morning by 10 AM, they would no longer have a position with the firm. For many that must have been a terrible weekend with their families and a long anxious wait in the morning. 

Overall, your experiences will be highly variable. You will see some high highs by working with some fun intelligent people, but you will also work with some nightmare scenarios and ridiculously difficult individuals."

Depending on the team you're on, flex time is good and some of the management team understands team dynamics and strives to get the best from everyone.

I've watched many of my peers and team members look upon Sunday as another workday to get everything accomplished.

Also, the late winter of 2012 purge was handled poorly.  Since the senior leadership/partners enacted the PR campaign of touting ""Ralph's Bold Plan"" was going to be good for the company - the company has seen their stock tumble almost 18%, and many of the Principals and Sr Associates who survived the purge are simply buying time to collect their annual bonus - then they will leave.  Supposedly the firm ""predicted"" this and as such are poised to pay out larger than normal bonus to the managers in an attempt to retain...however, they will find they are pouring money into people who are leaving.

The recent federal ruling and loss of the large IDIQ contracts (SURVIAC/IATAC) means BAH (and other large, previously entrenched in the DoD firms) will need to compete all their contracts against lean, agile small firms who don't have sky high multiples - a serious issue which must be quickly addressed.

There are plenty of positions available for different clients and due to the company's ""matrixed"" structure, you can work anywhere, for any client while remaining on the same team.  If you don't like your team, you can switch teams.  To excel, you are expected to work within the competencies of the next level.  For me, I started as a Consultant (L-1) even though I had 5 years previous experience in the field.  By my first year, I was able to be promoted with a substantial pay increase (part of this was due to getting two additional professional certs) and increase in PTO days.  BAH lays quite a bit of importance in its ethics.  ""Ethics First"" is their program, and its the cornerstone of how the company conducts business.  Honestly, coming from a much larger company to BAH was a breath of fresh air because of this and that the company does seem to really care about it's employees.  
Company has great benefits and their ECAP program (basically your 401k) ensures that after your first year, the company contributes 10% of your salary to your retirement fund automatically each year.  You can contribute as much as you want, so this can help you build up a retirement fund fairly quickly.  Of course, it takes you 6 years to become fully vested, and if you leave before then, you lose all the contributions the company has made to your ECAP.  Not too bad of a deal when you get down to it.
Overall, I enjoy working for Booz Allen Hamilton, and recommend it for anyone who is looking to break away from larger company that doesn't put much emphasis on employee satisfaction.","PTO days are your vacation days as well as your sick days.  16 days to start off with in your first year.  Not the worst deal, but I was used to having separate sick leave and vacation leave in the past.  

Depending on what team you are with, you can have a totally different Booz Allen experience.  Some teams are better than others because of management and funding; so there have been cases where someone gets hired on and within 3 months they are gone because they had a ""horrible"" experience.  But one can say this about any company really.  Personally, I switched teams because I wanted to expand my experience a bit with a wider variety of clients."

Junior employees are sharp and helpful
Occasionally interesting work","Biggest problem: the enormous amount of sitting around ""on the bench"" that often occurs because of lack of client work or fed bureaucrats not moving contracts quickly.  Result:  I've only had actual work for for about 1/3 of my time at this company, which is bad for my career development and a waste of tax dollars because that's what pays Booz.  As an MBA, I expect to be challenged.  That hasn't happened.  I've seen a LOT of people at my level leave because they are very smart, very  motivated,  and this place wastes their time and talents. 

Government consulting is a misnomer.  It is NOT consulting.  It is contracting out what the feds don't want to do or aren't staffed for.  Booz has become a ""butts in seats"" place,  where they just try to get you client site basically  doing the same thing as a bureaucrat.  And trying to help entrenched, unmotivated career bureaucrats make progress on important national issues is frustrating.

Management:  Senior Associates usually SUCK, and they are the middle management you'll likely work for.  Principals are usually good, but there's limited interaction because they're senior to  the Senior Associates."

If you network with others and they are aware of your skills and work ethic, you do not have a problem finding the next assignment.

Another great reason to work at Booz Allen is the annual contribution to the 401K. I is not guaranteed that the firm will contribute to your 401K near the end of the fiscal but the firm has contributed every year so there is a good track record. It is also one of the reasons most people stay for long periods of time so it is important to the future of the firm.

The leadership makes sound decisions and is very competent. This is the reason I joined Booz Allen in the first place. I was very impressed when I interviewed and realized that the managers actually understood the work which was done by their direct reports. The managers of my previous employer did not seem to have a clue or care about how direct reports did their job.","Booz Allen is a great place to work but like all things in life, you need to be in the right place at the right time to have the opportunity to get to the top. This is the only frustration I have had with my time in the firm. I have been a developer and love doing development work however you will not get far in the firm if you are a technical person. When I say technical person I mean someone who actually writes code or configures network equipment. (If you are technical but only write policies and processes or manage technical projects then you can go far.)

Sadly I do very little coding now but I am doing work which is more in line with what the rest of the firm does and should help me get in the right place to move upward in the firm. The bottom line is if you are hardcore technical then don't expect to move past the Associate level unless you are willing to take on softer skills."

Focus on staffing and bill ability has always been there though (at least in the last 5 years).  Success requires being very politically astute, not questioning mgmt decisions, being billable and being available to work at all hours. Senior management is not really interested, and will not take action, on the feedback of its people. if you're not good at either schmoozing your way to the top, and/or working non-stop, don't plan to make a career with 'The Firm'. Known for lowballing salaries. Work-life balance is an issue at all levels."
5681,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company once you hit the ground running,2012-03-15,5.0,,I have found the work life balance to be very fair if that is a priority.  Managers have been very accommodating for my desire to pursue philanthropic and volunteer efforts even if during company hours.,Not a place to work for if you are not flexible when first joining.

Now that the firm sold out to Carlyle Group, we are just another government contracting company.  Also, you are only 'safe' from being laid off if you are full billable at the client site or support enough clients to get next to 100% billable hours.  

I had to relocate to a different part of the country in order to remain billable and not get laid off.  Several of my coworkers got laid off or voluntarily left because they were not near 100% billable utilization and getting stressed out about being laid off.  Depending on the client, the work can be pretty boring.  We have truly become a ""butts in seats"" contractor company.

Employees tend to be very smart people and the working level employees have strong work ethics.,"The annual blood letting (2+ years) of approximately 10% of the bonus pool employees and how that is accomplished is 100% inconsistent with the firm's espoused ""core values.""  Employees go from one annual review that is good with a 30% annual bonus to fired (announced in their annual review debrief) without any warning.

Most weeks, I can usually get a free lunch from the leftovers from meetings.","Management in all of the Information Security/Assurance areas with whom I've interacted and worked seemingly have no IT backgrounds. They have learned how to talk the talk, but can't walk the walk.

They recently fired on average just over 20% of their senior leadership. They also made a campaign on the radio and in recruiting to hire 1500 new Cyber people for Summer 2011. Most of them have now probably been ""let go."" An article came out at the end of 2011 or early 2012 that stated that Booz is not financially solvent. Management then held conference calls where they ""told"" us that they're ""righting the ship."" It was ironic as the Italian ship had just crashed at the time. It seemed to fit perfectly, as this is what's happening.

Half of one Cyber team has quit and left for greener pastures.

After accepting this job and resigning from my previous job, I couldn't find anyone who had anything good to say about Booz. One friend put it best: ""Booz is where dreams go to die.""

There are so many other contractors out there, and they all seem better at this point. When you consider that SAIC has been around about 1/3 as long, and has twice the number of employees and revenue, it seems that Booz is doing something wrong, and companies like SAIC are doing it correctly."

More than ever, it is all about the numbers, billability and new business.  GO Team objectives trump all.  Functional expertise, strategic thinking, and client service -- the art of consulting -- risk being devalued as a result.  This will hurt the long-term, institutional stature and brand strength of the firm.  Now that LOW letters get issued on a strict time frame, without asking if an employee about to be sacked might be able to contribute to the firm in ways that more than pay for the cost of an extra few weeks of billability, the real strength of the firm -- it's people --  the  Innovation, creativity, and taking the time fully to think through and look ""around the corner""  at a client problem are less important than immediate revenue gratification, quarter-by-quarter.  Management communication to staff is full of spin about work-life balance and core values, but really, it's all about the numbers.  Booz Allen used to have a higher risk tolerance.  It made strategic and longer-term investments to develop new service offerings based on the application of cutting-edge technology and management science to the operational challenges facing government.  Not so much anymore.  Brand strength will suffer in the long term because of all these things.  But, of course, by then key insider shareholders will have already cashed, so who really cares?"
5695,Booz Allen Hamilton,History of Excellence; Future Less Clear,2012-03-01,3.0,Senior Consultant,"The company supported me through several expensive certifications, has truly refined my consulting skills, and has exposed me to various government agencies.  While I have frustrations about the company in general and my particular experience, I still believe that I've become a stronger professional as a result of my time with the firm.","The other reviews about how the company has gone through A LOT of changes in the last 3-5 years are right on target.  As someone who joined the firm right before the split with Booz & Co. (commercial size of the business) and Carlyle buyout, I can tell you that these changes have left employees holding the bag in many respects, which is evidenced by their increasing turn-over rate.  People are heading for the door!  A few specifics:  

Opportunities for training/certification and advancement are getting harder to come buy is this more fiscally constrained environment, which is being driven by Quarterly Earning Reports and shareholder pressure than by long-term business objectives.  Booz Allen used to understand that as part of the consulting services industry, it could not afford to treat employees as an expense.  But that's just what they are doing.  As a company that offers advice (not tangible goods), the quality of which depends on attracting, maintaining, and investing in the continuing education of the best people they can find. 

Management is less and less interested in matching/able to match talent with projects they want to work on.  Their bonuses aren't tied to employee satisfaction but are tied to how many people are on their teams, keeping them billable (""rear ends in seats"" mentality), and how much new business/revenue they bring in.  So there is a lot of pressure to stay where you are (not change teams or even projects) and put in a lot of ""volunteer"" (read not billable) time toward business development activities.  Sadly, this volunteer work doesn't seem to get much recognition come assessment time.  I have personally served on many internal volunteer initiatives, and I'm lucky of these are even mentioned in one line on my assessment.

The assessment process is beyond burdensome (taking an entire 4 months from start to finish, each year) and is not nearly as objective as leadership seems to think.  Based on my own experience and having watched many peers go through their own assessments, it's a pretty biased process.  I've seen underperformers get promoted because they were in good with the right managers.  Likewise, I've seen deserving bosses and peers alike be passed up for promotion for reasons having nothing to do with their skills and performance.  In addition, development actions for the next year are often determined by manager priorities and not by the career path the employee wants to take (I once had a manager require me to participate in a social media round table volunteer group even though I'm not interested in it because he oversaw it).  The politics in the assessment process permeate the rest of the firm.  

The matrixed model the firms prides itself on means employees are subject to a growing beurocracy and a ""rule by committee"" environment where decisions aren't really ever made and are stood by even less.  I have actually seen people get in trouble for moving forward based on a leadership decision because another leader didn't like the decision (e.g. the ""committee"" wasn't in total agreement or the decision wasn't properly ""socialized"").  Employees are evaluated on their ability to navigate politcal environments, not on their ability to deter political approaches to problem solving and interpersonal relationships.  That means being up front and honest is not only undervalued, it's a liability for those of us who consider ourselves tactful, but obove all else straight-shooters.  

As I said above, I'm glad to have worked here overall.  But there's been a lot of bad that came with the good."

Annual profit sharing bonus of 10% your salary","Company is publicly traded and therefore much more rigid than other privately held firms in the industry (especially given the reduction in gov't spending)

Company does not have a large commercial sector business, therefore it is hard to move into it

Career mobility is limited. The firm advertises career mobility but it is a sham. Once you get past a year in a given discipline it is difficult to move around and career management does not do much to assist

Company takes on any contract therefore you could get ""stuck"" on a staff augmentation type contract where the experience is low quality"

Excellet training programs both internally and externally with tuition assistance. Most senior leaders (Sr. Associate and above) are very approachable.","While there is emphasis on having a strong functional expertise, marketing & business development trumps all else as a way to get promoted in this organization.  For example, even if you are an EXCELLENT Cost Estimator who is consistently expanding the capability for the organization, you will not be promoted to Lead Associate or above unless you work (lead, write, etc) proposals and ultimately position yourself as a ""Market Lead"" to make Sr. Associate.  Essentially there are few, if any (I don't know everyone in the firm) ""functional promotions"" where you can become a Functional Manager, such as the Lead Cost Estimator for the cost estimators in a market (for example).  Rather, in order to promote to the level if Lead Associate or above, you will need to lead diverse teams - functionally speaking. Continuing the CE example, you may find yourself leading a team of Finance, Change Management, Project Management, etc. staff.  If what you are looking for is a broad, market-based, leadership role, this is the place for you.  If you want to grow BOTH functionally AND as a leader within that capability, this is not the place for you past the Associate level."

While the firm continues to build its credentials as a technology consulting house, it holds true to its 90+ years of management consulting heritage.  This is reflected in how the firm evaluates employees using the same set of competencies for each respective level and across service offerings/capabilities. There is great emphasis on staff owning their careers and an equally great emphasis on collaboration across, up and down within the organization.  Given the firm's growth in the past several years, there are opportunities abound.  That said, nothing is a given and you must work for what you want.","Booz Allen has experienced significant growth and is now learning how to be a big company.  That is moving the culture around a bit.  Some people may not be comfortable with that amount of change. The up or out dimension to the career model is long gone at the staff levels, which can create some dead weight at times.  Staff working away from the office can have a hard time staying connected."

5702,Booz Allen Hamilton,Struggling with Change,2012-02-23,4.0,Associate,Booz Allen has great people working for it.  They really go out of their way to take care of each other both personally and professionally.  It is refreshing to see that most of them put the client first in their work and normally let the quality of their work stand as the reason a client should hire them for future work.  Great opportunities for professional development if you can be disciplined and set aside the time to do it.  Extensive internal training resources and $5k available for external training and tuition assistance,"Booz Allen seems to be struggling with change...changing from a private to public firm and also the changes that are occurring in government spending.  Prior these two events, employees, with few exceptions, were able to completely focus on giving 100 percent and more to the client. However, today with financial pressures of being public and fewer government dollars to go around, new work is becoming more and more difficult to capture, leaving many employees on the bench waiting for new work to come.  In the past, this wasn't a big deal, but today employee time on the bench is finite and lack of work (LOW) letters are getting issued much more quickly and frequently...no billable work means you may have to find new employment with another company.  This is also having a partial effect on projects the start getting close to completion.  Instead of being completely focused on the work, employees are starting to worry more and more about whether or not they will be able to get assigned billable work after their current project wraps up.  This, in my opinion, can distract employees from the work that they should be focused on.  This isn't anything new to the consulting world, but it is new to this company and may lead to problems down the road if not handled properly.  It would really be unfortunate if this great company loses the ability to differentiate itself from its competitors...which is its people and their ability to alway put the client's interest first"

Government sector work is 9 to 5 and pretty chill.,Upward mobility past associate/ lead associate level is limited.  Pretty much have to wait for someone to leave the firm to make the jump.

- Because it's a large company, they have the ability to hold you on overhead for a longer period of time than a smaller company - so there is that small safety net","My experience has been the following:

- Felt deceived by the recruiter as we specifically agreed that I was not being hired for a certain job, and that I would only support in a given ""corridor,"" yet when I came on board I was offered a position well outside of the agreed upon radius as well as the only jobs targeted were the position specifically identified as outside of my career path and not what I was hired to do.
- Culture definitely feels as a butts in seats type environment
- Company seems to only care about the bottom line, less about employee development and needs
- Constant fear of Lack of Work letter/furlough

You are part of a Company Team - You will have a task to work and they will expect you to work it but when you need help there are others in your team or other teams to reach out for help or technical advice.  It is a Team philosophy, if there is anything you can do to help the team move forward then you should just as others will help you move forward - The client wins, you win, other individuals win, and The Team wins.  

They have a BAH help desk (single phone #)for individual company issues that may be causing you concern or just need a little help with a benefit.  The help desk will take your issue and direct it to the correct office who will coordinate with you to resolve your issue - very nice not to have to try to track down the right person in a very large organization to help you.","Just as they expect you to work your task that you've been hired to accomplish, they expect you to take the extra time to work Market Development.

Third, we are now told they want to make the company more competitive by firing Partners, Principals, and Senior Associates. My fear is that next quater they will go after  Associates and Senior Consultants (the worker Bees).  My prediction is that they will get rid of the beach and ... people will not be able to charge to General Admin (G).

It is an amazing resume builder and you will learn a LOT about proposals, business development, professionalism, productivity, etc. especially if you're right out of college.","Ever since their purchase by Carlyle there have been little changes adding up to a big problem.  There is a serious vacuum formed by the decisions of management to enslave themselves to quarterly profit reports.  The company culture used to be very people-centric; they knew they didn't sell widgets, only people's time and invested in it.  People didn't come to BAH to learn, they brought skills and experience that could deliver (for the most part).  

For the last 3 years, they have been trying to emulate CSC/SAIC/ManTech and just put butts in the seat.  They are so focused on reducing costs to the government to be more competitive against more 'value' contractors that they are turning into them.  It's a slow march to mediocrity.  The truly dedicated and talented who are still around are stressed to hell trying to carry the water for 5 underlings right out of college with no experience in the field (or anywhere).  Every veteran lost increases the size of the vacuum, but there are no acquisitions or senior strategic hires to fill the void; instead they just stretch whatever is left which is just accelerating the drain."

5749,Booz Allen Hamilton,A great place to work with great people...if you're lucky,2012-01-16,5.0,Associate,"Booz Allen offers some of the best people with the best work I've had the privilege of being involved with. It's reputation has been historically rock solid in the government sector and the benefits are very competitive. The projects/programs that are typically taken on are more selective than other consulting firms, which means that staff are generally offered challenging and interesting work, not ""hired butts in seats"" (or ""TS cleared butts in seats""). The firm is very forward-leaning regarding internal collaboration platforms (hello.bah.com and Yammer), which helps tie far-flung areas of the company together.","The cons have specifically come about in the past couple years. Specifically, since the move to take the company public and the subsequent fallout. Budgets are noticeable tighter for ""niceties"" like team socials, training, and other former perqs. ""Lack of work"" also seem to be more prevalent, meaning more folks are given the axe more quickly than ever. Quality staff without a project used to be given a lot more leeway, but now they're given two weeks to find something or else they're given the boot (like many other consulting firms in the area). On the other hand, perhaps it's just that I'm more cognizant of these individuals since the popularity of our internal social networking has grown. The ladder-climbing is much less of an issue to me. In fact, it's really no different than any other traditional company: sell your soul, move up the rungs of corporate success. If you're looking for ""work-life balance,"" then you just need to find that balance and live with the consequences. If that means sacrificing a high-level and high-paying management position to build a quality marriage and raise healthy kids, then DO SO!"

Hire staff for a career, not just a single project
Collaboration is rewarded
Smart, fun, dedicated co-workers
Ability to shift around in the company as your interests change and markets mature","Since the company went public, weird and erratic behavior from senior management has become the norm.  Focus on quarterly results has resulted in bizarre hiring quotas, lack of work letters when staff are unbillable, and significant time required by senior associates and principals to report on status of pipeline and utilization."
5756,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Terrible experience, would never recommend to anyone unless they are guaranteed a long-term project.",2012-01-11,1.0,Consultant,"- Good work / life balance (Depending on contract)
- Abundance of facilities in Metro DC area
- Good benefits","I just moved to the DC area after being hired as a Cyber Consultant, only to find out that I would have to fight for my career as soon as  I got here. I was hired for non-existent commercial work, and as a new graduate (entry/junior level) I have found ZERO opportunities within the firm. Upper management is very unhelpful, and only instructs you to make sure that your Hello profile is up to date and that you are checking the jobs.bah.com website for open positions. OH REALLY! I HAD NO IDEA I HAD TO DO THAT! I spend at least 1-2 hours everyday on jobs.bah.com, or reading the internal job reports, and sending out applications / following up with hiring managers. The few jobs that there are, all require clearances. I am FULLY clearable, and have absolutely no reason to be declined a clearance, however finding someone to actually sponsor the clearance is impossible within the firm.

The process goes like this: Apply to job that you meet 75-100% of requirements, notify them that you have a Secret clearance, and ability/willingness for a TS, or SCI or FSP if required. Receive notification that client is not willing to sponsor clearance, and hiring manager hires an outside resource. Original internal Booz Allen candidate receives lack of work notice and is given two weeks to find something, AS IF THEY HAVENT BEEN LOOKING ALL ALONG. At the end of this two weeks, the Booz Allen employee is laid off with no severance. 

Terrible experience, unprofessional/disconnected upper management, and a focus on the bottom line at the expense of employee satisfaction."
5757,Booz Allen Hamilton,Best company I've worked for.  Deep dive in functional areas. However need to be in right place and time to move up,2012-01-11,5.0,Lead Associate,"Generally, benefits are pretty good.  Plenty of vacation days, profit sharing integrated with 401k. 
Booz Allen is a great place for young people to start because of the strong corporate culture (what to do and what not to do), 360-review process, and highly defined performance criteria.  Also has reachback capabilities far beyond any other company I've worked for, with technical focus groups, communities of practice, and a new (internal) social networking web site.  Generally, your management usually looks out for you and helps you work on your career progression.","Responsibilities are organized different than other companies, which means you may not have as much purview as you did with your last company (even though you may be qualified).  E.g. you may have led teams of 40 people before, but if Booz brings you in as an Associate or Lead Associate, you likely will not have purview over that many personnel... and you will likely not have as much purview over personnel management activities until you are a Sr. Associate or Principal.

Career progression is highly dependent on being in the right place and right time.  It's not the typical model of do well and you'll move up.  You have to do well, be highly networked, and ""own"" a market.... which can be very difficult.  People can end up being at the Associate level for 20 years.

There are a lot of demands on your time.  After working your 8 hour shift, you may be required to work on markeitng, proposals, white papers, focus group or community presentations, etc.  You are required to do A LOT to get by within this company.  They talk about work/life balance, but admit that the ""balance"" is different for everyone... and naturally has to be balanced towards ""work"" to get ahead in the company.

The company was purchased by Carlyle Group and there are pressures on profitability that are causing mental anguish on the employees.  The culture is changing."

- Staff are hired as ""least technically qualified / lowest cost.""
- The assessment system focuses on the wrong metrics - not everyone is a busniess developer.  You need hard working technical staff and functional experts.
- There are way too many senior leaders who are out of touch with the client base and only serve as gate keepers and manage through powerpoint.  Quarterly Management Reviews are largely group think and self-agrandizement sessions.

-Teammates often share dedication and work ethic","-Dishonesty in hiring practices. You're told that you're hired to do a job long term, and then discover that you'll be doing something totally different and it's short term
-Unappreciation for technical/engineering employees. Only those at a level IV or above get the glory. 
-There is NOT a flat org chart. Employees are designated at levels and there is a certain pecking order. If you get on the wrong side of a higher level as a level I or II (Consultant or Sr. Consultant), look out
-Technical decisions are made poorly, political motives take precedence 
-Oppressive culture, you have to work the overtime and bow to those above you or you will be forced out
-Focus seems to be on making bodies billable instead of properly fitting qualified personnel where they would be better utilized
-Many workers dread a lack of work letter (or LAW), as the company does not assist you in finding billable work, creating a culture of fear. No communication or clarity from management on status of your contract
-Exodus of knowledgebase from office, many leaving for greener pastures and limited passing of knowledge
-Although the company culture forces a strange dress code upon its employees that is often mocked by government customers (expect to wear suits and ties), people are talked to and treated unprofessionally (vindictive behavior by managers, threats, grudges, etc)
-Leadership ignores suggestions, requests, advice of best practices, etc., and marches on their own agenda which can create ethical dilemmas for those executing tasks
-Little to no support from leadership on site, as they are often more concerned with employee reviews or business proposals. 
-Leadership is completely blind to the low morale of the workforce
-Reviews grade you on business development instead of quality of work/support of the customer/etc. Thus, unless you're bringing in new contracts promotion is impossible (as well as raises). This applies to EVERY employee, even if you're tasked with engineering/technical work"

- Senior Associates used to be helpful and approachable, but more and more I'm finding them to be too absorbed in whatever it is that gets dumped on them.  To be honest, I don't know a single one that seems happy.

An internal organizational chart did not exist until recently. The company has strayed away from its core values, which has impacted the employee environment and quality of work delivered to clients. Booz Allen lacks ethnic diversity in senior management positions at the Senior Associate level and above despite its emphasis on diversity. The 360 performance assessment process is an exercise and it is often predetermined who will be promoted. One of the most concerning issues is the amount of nepotism at Booz Allen with family members working on the same government contract projects despite the company policy explicitly stating it is not allowed. Booz Allen often operates like a family business when decisions are made as the rules are selectively applied to individuals."
