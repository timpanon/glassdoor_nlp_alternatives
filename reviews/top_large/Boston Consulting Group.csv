5,Boston Consulting Group,Everything is great except compensation,2022-04-02,4.0,Knowledge Analyst,"I'm in a NAMR Knowledge Team so take that with a grain.
Fantastic team manager, really dedicated to building up offerings and has a clear pathway forward. Fun to work with.
Work is very flexible, most teams are supporting of hybrid and making room for life stuff in the workday. Work Life balance is great.
Content is interesting to develop, case work can be tough some times, but KT has the ability to set clear boundaries, compared to consultants.","Others have said it before, but the opportunities for career advancement in Knowledge Teams feel out of one's control. You need to collect ""feedback"" from case teams, who don't really understand your role and see you as an underperformer, because you aren't working insane hours like them. You don't really get to ""choose"" what cases you work on, so its a toss up if you get noticed by someone worthwhile. People who are higher up often come in at their level, or have miraculously gotten noticed by some MDP, who gave them a good review.
I'm sure its possible, but I don't know many people who have gotten more than one promo here. Also, there's no shot of becoming a consultant. You could be ""Client Focused"" in KT and work 2x the hours for half a consultant's pay if you want."

536,Boston Consulting Group,You need to believe the nonsense to succeed long-term,2021-10-21,2.0,Project Leader,"Career prospects: people take you seriously with BCG on your CV
Colleagues: very driven. Lots of people ‘well-bred’…
Quick-fire view: get to see into lots of companies in all different sectors and how they work. You cover the basics quickly without even realising. 
Eyeopener: real insight into how those with privilege and access think and feel. It’s very separate from ‘normal’ British society and is a rare insight","I wish I'd realised sooner (I've given up ~6 years of my life) that the whole thing is nonsense. It is a classic case of the 'Emperors new clothes'. BCG works by convincing: 
Employees: to succeed at BCG is to be ‘smart and successful’ (and therefore to fail is to not be)
Clients: your capabilities are substandard. You can’t possibly achieve what you want to with your own people and we (BCG) know things you don’t

When you start asking yourself ‘why?’ - why am I working 90+ hours a week changing font on ppt slides and listening to rich white dudes battle it out over the right ‘turn of phrase’ at 8pm every night of the week you realise there is no point to this - unless you believe that to succeed at BCG is to succeed in life. Even if you’re good at it once you ask ‘why am I doing this’ - it’s pretty difficult to go back from…

If you have a modicum of self-worth not tied to having a status badge at BCG (or what you do for a living), or if you’ve lived a 'normal' life where people have genuine problems and do work that genuinely has an impact on society (or your business) i.e. they actually DO something then it’s pretty hard to justify WHY you are doing the job at BCG. 

Objectively: 

Very long hours filled with tedious work:
 a) majority of work covers similar topics (strategy, cost-cutting, due diligence, COGs …) there aren’t that many problems in business
 b) The model works on replication: taking the latest ‘BCG thinking’ and ‘packaging this up’ for the client in question (formatting it into their slides and changing a few words) 
 c) Pointless work (Everything is possible, not everything is practical). Great giving a client a ‘master-plan’ but 9/10 they can’t execute it because it doesn’t fit their business and we have no idea how to actually execute everything. Also, nobody cares about that cool slide you did…
d)Pay vs. overall renumeration: hour for hour you won’t get paid that much and you will say goodbye to evenings and weekends. Having time off is the exception not the rule. Be prepared for very disappointed friends and family

Poor leadership: 
a) Very little investment in people training (as a PL I got like one afternoon) and the issue perpetuates because you have nobody to learn from (so you can't learn on the job as they say)
b) No requirement to prioritise team's wellbeing / what work adds value: you're not evaluated on it really.  You can (and will) treat people like expendable resources because they will do anything not to get a bad review
c) Partners are cults of personality. You can get away with a lot of things you should not be able to in 2021

Unease in the work you are doing:
a) Poor quality for clients who are often paying 5-6 figure sums to get the same answer as their competitors
b) Experienced hires are used to boost the image of the firm, but we don't really leverage their knowledge - so clients are paying for a limited viewpoint from people who have never done the work
c) Some work is just unethical: Helping sovereign funds buy out public infrastructure? Cost cutting to increase share-holder profits at the expense of low-wage workers? Being paid as the ‘Levelled’ to help the government ‘Level-Up’"

597,Boston Consulting Group,"Might not recommend the assistant role, except to those who need great healthcare",2021-09-27,3.0,Senior Administrative Assistant,"- amazing healthcare benefits (NO insurance premiums, also extremely low copays, unlimited sick days).
- you can bill a lot of OT, and managers haven't been pushing back on hours of OT billed since covid.
- extreme feedback environment. You will learn a lot but you need to have a thick skin and a flexible ego.
- admin team recently introduced a year-end process where managers collect downward feedback from their reports.
- overall positive culture.
- BCG does fascinating work for its clients (although as an assistant it can be hard to ""dive into"" the work and understand content, take on ""stretch opportunities"" and such due to their own lack of capacity plus lack of trust from executives).
- current remote model means assistants can join more case team events (previously held for consultants only at offsites).
- good name/experience to have on your resume.","- Boston office specifically uses a ""new"" (past several years) evaluation model for assistants, that is separate from how other business support teams are eval'ed. Most assistants in this office dislike the model due to extreme ambiguity and lack of transparency around pay/promotion structure and feedback-collection burden, but admin management seems either ignorant (very unlikely), uninterested, or vehemently opposed to this. This model is also spreading to other offices...
- despite great benefits and OT, assistant comp isn't competitive with other industries and firms due to base salary. You can make way more money (think +$30K) being an assistant at a biotech or finance/VC firm in the Boston area.
- very high volume of work for assistants, before and especially since covid. Managers encourage assistants to ""push back"" on unnecessary requests, set boundaries with the people they support, and step away after normal business hours, but fundamental problem of assistants being overloaded with scheduling persists with no solution in sight. Stemming from this, assistants may experience high levels of stress and long working hours.
- less senior assistants tend to be ""team players"" more than senior assistants, being more willing to cover other assistants and contribute to team events and culture.
- assistants are responsible for alerting their coverage when they're sick (vs. managers coordinating), and for securing their coverage for vacations.
- very limited internal mobility for business support staff (ex. admins, finance, HR) partly due to perpetual competition with internal consulting-track staff.
- sharp cultural divide between business support and consulting staff. Consultant evals are much more meritocratic and they get more clarity around progress tracking and promotions, consultants are paid way more money, they have dramatically higher budgets for team events, are the unsaid focus when BCG talks about retention and improving D&I, etc. Won't lie, after a while this really stings."

- Some colleagues are really nice & collegiate feel because you all start together
- Work is straightforward, there is just lots of it
- Good career prospects
-Great for early careers if you can put the graft in","-I cannot emphasise more that BCG needs to be 100% the first and mostly only priority in your life

- You need to be a really physically and mentally fit individual with a lot of resilience at BCG (so good for military joiners). If you aren't you will already be on the back foot performance-wise

- You will be forced to trade off on your own wellbeing on a regular basis. You will get ill. Everybody does, it's just more severe in some than others. Many people to have cycles of 'burnout' (mental illness by another name) and time off work. If you cannot accept this, it's not for you. 

- Performance is massively judged by presenteeism. If you have a family, tenancy for burnout, long-term health condition, disability etc. that would not be a barrier to another, even high-pressured career, it will be here - you will be considered 'disengaged' unless you can be available 24/7 . It doesn't matter how good you are at delivering in the hours you are there - you need to be good and available 24/7.

- The target work week in London is 65 hours (8-10pm x 4, 8-5 x1). But this is the target. The norm is more like 90. 80% of the time I've spent at BCG has been +15 hour days, no weekends, limited breaks during day, expectation to be always available. I've often gone without showering to prioritise sleep. 

- If you have a family you will need a spouse, partner, or care-giver who can do everything at home. 99% of the time it is impossible to spend more than an hour a day, and more than 10 hours a week overall on commitments outside BCG. Not unless you sleep less than 5 hours a night. Holiday periods can be generous, but you spend most of this time recovering

- Really poor leadership skills for project leads. Many have never managed people / projects and just don't have the basic foundations. There is very little investment in this and the 'context' is not set up to reward / encourage efficient leadership 

- You will spend hours a day pouring over low value tasks at A-C level. As per previous point, expect to work for people with very directive leadership / transactional leadership styles. This isn't a place where, at least at the lower levels, you are coached to learn, develop and / or take ownership of your work as there is not the leadership capability within the organisation

- Not for those with a conscience: when you get there you realise it's a highly selective group of people , with little empathy or understanding of the majority of people's experiences and needs in society as a whole, advising people / organisations with enormous influence on society. There is little 'real' diversity of experience; regardless of ethnicity etc. Most employees have lived a life of privilege or access and there are very few people from 'normal' backgrounds"

Has a lot of parties and free food
Has a fully paid company outing( depends on the office)
Has a education reimbursement policy with approval from manager

Overseas travel is another plus
Work life balance is optimal","Very little career mobility within the company
No 401k match
Has periodic layoffs. I have seen lot of people who get rolled off the company if they can't make partner.
The green card policy sucks big time. There is no clear policy that is communicated to the employee. It is very much left at the manager's behest. Managers usually bait and switch the employees using the green card as a tool to keep them. HR is not helpful in resolving such matters. 
Overall, this is a very top down company. It talks a lot about diversity and equality, but if you peel away the layers , none of it is being practiced, in reality. In my case, my manager kept promising a green card filing for 2.5 years without actually filing it, but always making sure to 'bait and switch'. HR will deny any meetings or calls. Immigration team will work in collusion.
To summarize:


No diversity at leadership that can understand issues related to immigration
BCG managers do not fully comprehend issues faced by immigrants
BCG leadership (at Director+ levels) have very little training about the immigration process in this company 
HR does not fully comprehend issues faced by immigrants and are not very helpful
The Green Card process does not provide transparency to the employees, leaving them with zero control of their own situation
 Needless to say, the different players in the BCG immigration team have any accountability to employees as the process itself doesn't call for it"

Horrible place, and the culture is set by the top, so think twice if you expect any change here. There are 0 exit options in Russia, and they know this, so they will do whatever they want. They clearly don't care. Hilarious to hear ""BCG values"" mentioned in the Moscow office, as if to make the whole experience even more insulting.

1613,Boston Consulting Group,Not a good place to work,2021-01-06,1.0,Developer,"Office facilities, lavish parties, occasional gifts, amazon vouchers, food, snacks, etc are some of the things which can be considered as pros. But most of these have taken a hit in lockdown.","This is a very confused organization with two types of mindsets prevalent -Consulting and backend capabilities. Now the spotlight is on consulting and rest everything takes the back stage. Consulting is a very fiercely competitive field and similar expectations are mounted on backend teams. The whole setup is to facilitate the consulting unit like robots. This leads to multiple cons like:
> Work life balance is impossible.
> Quality of work is below average since most of the times the work is around POCs for some pitching rather than actual project work.
> Impractical short turnaround times expected from backend teams as consulting teams either have no clue of how technology works or they simply don't care.
> Extremely poor project execution with no standards observed, no proper project plan, no vision, random sub standard firefighting work and then one day pin drop silence and project vanishes and backend teams get no idea what happened.

Now apart from work, as an organization, there are many cons as below.
> They dont have a portal to track exit formalities and everything is just on mails.
> Their finance department is very opaque. They launch seemingly employee benefit schemes and include clauses and create barriers to utilize them. And if one day you realize to exit the firm, all of these benefits would be recovered quietly.
> Complete management is very egoistic and unprofessional. Employees are formally asked to not take leaves. Every hour of employee is micromanaged. Higher managers never interact with employees, not even when the employees have resigned. Humor is when resigned employee have to themselves contact HR for further steps. Management is very keen on replacing employees so forget about any effort to get retained once you put resignation. Unprofessional comments on employees are passed as jokes on team calls or parties by management.
>Very opaque employee rating system. No digitized employee rating portal and they still follow ancient method of emails and no clear timelines. So bonus and promotions are completely controlled by managers irrespective of the type of work done. There is no proper hierarchy in the organization so people looking for promotions and career growth can forget about it as there are just managers above senior developers/analysts. So employee would be working the same mundane stuff for years with no value added.

I sometimes wonder how does the company featured in ""best places to work in world"" in some internet websites. The whole image is being falsely presented to attract and exploit talented people.

This review is only applicable for employees in backend teams and may or may not apply to consulting teams."

The healthcare+dental programme is also top notch.,It’s a highly political environment where your reputation matters more than your performance. You will be evaluated better if your OPPL (case leadership) likes you. Associates/Consultants would claim credit for each other’s work and its atypical for the OPPL to care so much as to give credit to those who deserve it. The CDC system also perpetuates bias and isn’t a fair promotion/retention forum. The CDC will also push back on strong evals should they wish to fire you. It’s all about the kumbayah narrative.

1671,Boston Consulting Group,Great Stepping Stone,2020-12-11,3.0,Research Associate,"Great benefits outside of salary - health insurance in particular.
Getting BCG on the resume opened a lot of doors.
BCG Navigator offered a breadth of information at fingertips.
Work-life balance as the job is not overly complicated and the work hours are meant to be 8am to 5pm exactly.","- Business model for DRS is at odds with business model for the org as a whole, meaning there is a conflict of interest between succeeding in the role and progressing your personal development and career.
- Work is transactional by nature, meaning that unless you are resourceful and step outside of what management wants you to do, you will not get any exposure to meaningful BCG casework.
- The job becomes managing cheaper outsourced research firms to increase the profitability of the DRS department. Basically, you get good at creating and managing 6 research requests that you don't do yourself, but merely send off to case teams after you ""QA"" them. 
- Moving over to the consulting side is not possible from DRS, or from the Knowledge Team for that matter.
- DRS was managed and run like a call center. Butt in seat at 8am, punch out at 5pm. Not recommended for those who value autonomy and don't like to be managed via hours."

1845,Boston Consulting Group,"Software Engineer BCG Platinion: an incredible variety of clients and work, supported by a world class consulting firm",2020-10-09,5.0,Senior Engineer,"Being part of the engineering team at Platinion (a tech-focused unit of BCG) has been a great experience, and I have gotten to work with the best group of colleagues I've ever had. Each case / project has been a totally unique tech stack and problem to solve. Because we are a consulting firm, there is a good mix of heads-down coding and work along with client facing work. Platinion is often brought in by clients to build prototypes and MVPs for projects which makes the work faster paced and I think more fun. 
Platinion has a bit less intense style compared to the regular consultants at BCG, where there is pressure to be promoted or leave every 2 years.
We operate somewhat independently from BCG but still have all the perks and benefits of working at a top consulting firm. Perks that include the best health insurance ($5 copay for EVERYTHING), first class flights for flying, and incredible office spaces (the NYC office serves* breakfast and lunch every day with ample snacks and free Joe coffee throughout the day)

*going into the office and all office services are of course on pause for 2020 due to COVID
I trust our Platinion leadership and especially the BCG leadership; the BCG North America team I feel has done a great job handling the tumultuous year 2020

Consulting can feel rather isolating with traveling to clients and being on different teams all the time. BCG does a great job of recognizing this and making efforts for team and office events and culture. (They do a much better job at this than my former employer, a large IT consulting firm)

I'm not sure if this is available for Platinion but on the BCG side, when you are ready to leave or are told to leave, you are given a 3 full or 6 half months salary to seek your next position, as well as assistance from career services in your search.","The pace and workload can sometimes be high, but because cases have set end dates (usually at most a few months) there should always be a light at the end of the tunnel. 

From an engineer's standpoint, traveling every week to a client like a consultant felt like too much. But with COVID we're obviously not traveling at all and I am guessing that client travel will lessen or change dramatically after this.

The actual salary is a bit lower than what a software engineer in NYC could find, but other perks and benefits, particularly the health care, help to make up for it.

Platinion had to grow rather quickly and made for some hectic and maybe-not-as-thorough recruiting .

This year has especially brought to light shortcomings in Diversity and Inclusion among the nation and BCG is no different. Platinion and especially engineering lacks Black representation and has made strides with but still behind in gender diversity. This year has felt like all the right acknowledgements of the issue have been made; BCG has launched many efforts including 'inclusion accelerators,' millions of dollars in in-kind pro-bono work and actual monetary contributions to causes. But it will take time to tell if a significant positive difference is made."

- Much delayed promotion (saw people at same level with 7 years as Lead)
- Entire universe they have only benchmarking projects nothing other than this,after some time you will not be able to sell yourself with domain skills a big hit to your CV
- Starting from last year less than 10% hike
- Politics (dangerous politics I would like to highlight)
- Rude top management
- Racism,red  tapism, rating based on gossips

If you can find your work-life balance it’s a great brand for GMAT/ other college applications.,"- The Management leverages BCG brand for mass hiring but does not know how to live by it
-Every employee is FTE behind doors for management, a pawn for their filthy politics
-Management does not value individuals unless you have strong personal ties client side 
-Promotions- one from each sub-team, location and every cycle.  Be ready to become a sycophant as achievements, metrics don't count. 
-Quality of Work- ""We drive complexity"" as they say.  Not true. 
Some of those who try to do that are made sure to be suppressed, as they should not look smarter than the management. The work is basic as it could get google/business research with numerous databases to support.
- An empty mind is a devil's home. The management is a perfect example for this quote
Career Path- On papers, it is an easy transition to KT/ CT. In reality- “we wont let you move”. And by luck, if anybody even scores a foot in the door, management will ruin the process by unfavorable feedback
Personal Growth- There is no real skill development. How would that happen when management itself is incompetent? Also management  would never give up their Pool and Foozeball playing time."

2168,Boston Consulting Group,BCG - Data and Research Services (DRS) - The best place to ruin your career,2020-04-04,1.0,Research Associate,"1. Meager office perks such as free food. 
2. Can't remember anything else","This is the only section that defines how working at ""DRS"" is like. The team has the worst kind of ethics-related procedure. Nothing is followed according to the ethics provided in the charter but is dependent on the whims and fancies of the director and the senior manager. This entity lures people from the market on the behest of its respectable company's brand name - BCG, but it's nothing close to it.
I will break it down to discuss the different paradigms. 
1. Culture - The entity is run by a cartel of directors, senior managers, and managers who do things according to their will without any check. People at the senior level are mostly not qualified enough to answer queries on the industries they are handling. If they found out that you know more than them, get ready for an egoistic clash and a round of denigration on most of the matters. Getting a promotion is pretty easy, you just need to keep on agreeing on the crap made by the management. If you do the above, you are sure to go places and earn promotion otherwise you might end up in a spot where they continuously find ways to mentally harass you. I was amazed to see that senior people most of the time don't have any work and are just passing time in the company - getting complacent with their inability. The senior management lack industry knowledge and cannot groom you accordingly - chances are you would know more than them. Concerns to the HR are never heard since every news goes out to the senior management who then dictate accordingly. The management completely lives in their world and deem most of the laterals as culturally unfit - coming from the people who have stayed their entire life here and saying it to people who have done meaningful work globally - that's how irony looks.
The choice is yours, if you want to make your career or break your career."

Overall the company is a great company to work for and the people I have encountered from the top down have been pleasant during my career here.","Depending on the cohort you work in flexibility is not as flexible in roles like Administrative Assistant. Management puts forth an effort for flexible schedules but in reality, compared to other positions and roles in the company the Administrative Assistants have the least flexibility. Promotions on a large team like the one I work on are slow to come by and seem to be biased at times. You have to take on a load that is beyond stressful to prove yourself for a salary increase in this role.

2269,Boston Consulting Group,Toxic work environment - stay away,2020-01-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been working in multiple BCG offices across continents and really liked the company for the exciting projects, interesting colleagues, etc..

Until I've decided to give the DC office a go. Horrible mistake.","The culture I experienced in the DC office was so toxic that I did not recognize the BCG I knew.
 
Some examples:
1) On my second project, a  junior team member made fun of a colleague with mental health issues. When I spoke up against her remarks, emphasizing that a surprising number of colleagues - including  ""successful consultants"" - suffer from mental health issues, the rest of the team (all from the DC office and including more senior members) reacted negatively. They in fact tacitly supported the junior team member and her remarks - which became evident when the same junior member received a MBA Sponsorship a couple weeks after this incident.

2) The career development advisors I've met (which are of utmost importance to your BCG career) showed truly toxic behavior. During performance reviews, I've heard things like ""Your opinion does not matter"" or ""we trust our local associates more than people like you"". This behavior from CDAs (a relationship that builds on exchanging opinions and impressions openly) would have been absolutely unacceptable in any other BCG office I've seen.

3) Programs to enhance people's work-life-balance get advertised over and over, but management does its utmost to prevent people from actually using these. A close friend of mine tried to use ""Time 4 you"" (a program where employees are supposed to get unpaid vacation very easily) as her mother was terminally ill. Even though there were no clear business reasons (say, an ongoing project she was on and couldn't be replaced), the firm built up considerable pressure (e.g.her CDA calling, asking to ""consider her career"") to prevent her taking this time off. Given the context at hand, this behavior was a text-book case of bullying. 

4) Compared to other offices, I did not find a single senior role model in the DC office - quite the contrary. One example is how our team got ""burned"" on a low-prospect proposal, with the partner letting us work until after midnight. On Valentine's Day, we - against previous agreements to the contrary -  had to crank out slides without real urgency until 9pm, before the partner let us leave, saying ""I understand that some people have a private life and this day is important to them"". It became clear to me that Mid-level colleagues (Project Leaders and Principals) get groomed to fit into this culture - turning ""nice people"" to cynical ""slave drivers"" in a matter of a few years."

- BCG is undoubtedly one of the best places to work at - The platform gives you end number of opportunities to explore and develop yourself
- The organization provides many perks to it's employees (which includes mid day meals and snacks, year end bonus, home broadband reimbursement, health and life insurance, international business travel and yearly off site)
- I have heard people saying that growth in BCG is slow and time taking, but i personally feel if you perform exceptionally well and deserve a next level then the company will not ignore you and they will take proper care of your needs
- Life at BCG is challenging but at the same time, always gives you a positive vibe and proud feeling that you work with such a great organization
- They give you flexibility to work from anywhere, there are no fix working hours given one has to take ownership of what they are supposed to deliver (on time).","- I am sure most of the people are waiting to read this information - The salary that they offer to new hire is better than their competitors considering the market standards (that's what they claim) but i am not really convinced with this.
- The organization is growing globally so are the headcounts, which in a way impacts the physical space in the office and  the year end appraisals and perks.
- They invest a lot on their people and the technology  but still people sitting in the senior management position are mostly old and not ready to adapt the new ways to operate and still believe in doing manual work over AI"

2293,Boston Consulting Group,Interesting experience,2019-12-10,3.0,Project Leader,"Pros: 
1) Paycheck and Benefits: Most attractive part, maybe the only motivating factor on some days. 

2) Quality of work: Work undertaken by BCG is mostly interesting and potentially impactful. You feel that you are part of a project that can change the way an industry works or client's TSR

3) Clients served: You get to work with leading players,  and it is a privilege to share board rooms with CEOs and be able to learn from them 

4) BCG MDPs: The Managing Director & Partner team is terrific and one of the major reasons why BCG is a top-tier strategy consulting firm. The amount of information and industry expertise some of the Partners have is jaw-dropping and even C-level execs pay close attention to what a BCG partner has to say. 

5) Fellow consultants and non-consulting staff: Most of the consultants and associates in the office are fun. Consultants are supported well with L&D teams, staffing teams","Cons: 
1) Long hours: Consistently clocked >70 hrs/ week. Though weekends are protected, Sat is spent recovering/ grocery/ laundry and then by Sun eve--you are packing for an early AM flight on Monday. This makes you question the money you are making. If you making 1.7x the market rate, you are sorta working 1.5-1.8x hours as well. 

2) Middle management (Senior Project Leaders/ Principals): Not everyone in middle management is a great people developer. I once worked for a senior Principal who would constantly fret about his promotion and how if he doesn't become a Partner soon, he'll have to leave. That made for a terrible case experience as he was so insecure and made everyone work long hours (unnecessarily) to deliver ""value""

3) Up-or-out policy: BCG is aggressively pursuing the up-or-out policy. Every year size of incoming class gets bigger, but people start leaving after 12-14 months. All you need is 1-2 bad case experiences for the firm to make up its mind and force you to leave. This policy makes sense superficially, but it assumes that everyone develops at the same pace. At the same time, you do not need to be exceptionally smart to have a long career at BCG. BCG has a very peculiar work culture/ process, some people are able to adapt and some don't. If you have some industry/ real-life work experience, it may hinder your success at BCG as you may feel we are not answering the right questions or our work lacks technical detail. Most ""successful"" consultants at BCG joined the firm right out of undergrad and only have consulting expertise."

While the hours can be grueling, it's not uncommon to be told the night before that you're travelling somewhere for a project starting the next morning. This can make planning your personal life a bit difficult.

Also, the partners at Budapest office are all amazing and supportive people. Budapest office not being that big gives you a sense of a small family, which I'm pretty sure you can't say for many of the  other BCG offices.

One other advantage of Budapest office is that it's super international as it's acting as a hub that operates the SEE region, thus includes many people from there.","I mean the work life balance of course.

\\Social Impact - Many local and global partnerships with NGOs, opportunity to work low- or pro-bono for social impact organizations
\\Mobility and Travel - Frequent work travel leads to lots of perks redeemable for personal travel; quantity of BCG offices across the country and around the world means the possibility of transferring to different cities (not the easiest process but definitely doable!)

Often times BST are expected to live up to the expectations and work the same number of hours as the consultants with a fraction of the pay and growth opportunities. There is also a stigma when working on this side of the business that is often near impossible to overcome, meaning many partners just don’t take BST or their input seriously. The salary for BST is also typically far below industry average and the claim is that due to the benefits, the starting salaries are lower, which is all fine and good, but simply cannot compare to other more competitive companies at this point in time. Lastly, the technology is far behind where it should be for a company that is pushing digital transformation so heavily on every company they consult, there is high turnover on BST teams (due mostly to the challenges mentioned above) which leads to toxic work environments and even less work/life balance, and there is a high imbalance of effective managers. Some are the best I’ve ever had and some have no desire to grow their teams. Overall, I’d recommend BCG as a company that can set you up to do well anywhere because it can be an incredibly challenging place to work."

Working day in, day out with some of the highest level minds on the planet. 
Benefits include: fully paid health coverage for the fam, generous time off for the junior level staff, an industry leading luxury travel policy.

2434,Boston Consulting Group,Experience depends on team and luck,2019-07-12,3.0,Consultant,People are very sharp and you will learn a lot. High responsibility given and pressure is to perform and carry your workload. Teammates are generally supportive but help can be limited depending on how heavy the workload is. Opportunity to travel but generally to the same place. Some people you work with can be very amazing and willing to teach but others can have other priorities.,Hours can be very long. It is not unusual for 1 to 2am nights and you hear from peers of stories for projects going to 3am and 4am nights. Too much emphasis on PS work and a lack of diversified opportunities to work on different industries and types of projects. Training is not that relevant for people new to industry and can be improved. Not specific to BCG but there is a lack of fluid exit opportunities in Dubai with similar $ and this makes for a work life balance that can be tough at times.

2441,Boston Consulting Group,Toxic work culture - absence of mentorship - luck based growth rather than outcome based growth,2019-07-07,1.0,Project Leader,"- Brand name: Sadly even today the outside world values a ""BCG Consultant"" as though they have magical powers. This will change very shortly! Because within BCG, people grow into senior roles without having true leadership skills. Most of the partners do not have good leadership skills.","- Mentorship & leadership: Although this is the aspect that BCG publicizes, this is the one component that is missing completely.
90% of BCGers would be scared to express their true thought process or push back to a P/ PL or Partner in a case. 

- Work culture: If you are lucky enough to be staffed with a P/ PL who is open to learning alongside you and mentoring you, you will be in constant threat of being counselled out. If you somehow end up being well liked by your P, you will get good scores irrespective of your true performance. The only factor to success at BCG - Luck! 

- Diversity & Inclusion: Again an aspect they publicize on, but is completely absent! Just count the number of women partners vs white male partners. Someone with pedigree is valued way higher than someone who doesn't have a fancy Ivy league MBA - even if the latter adds more value, is hard working, motivated and dedicated and is open to feedback.

- WLB: I don't think I've ever heard people at BCG use this term - if you ever bring this up with your P/ PL, you can expect to be counselled out post next CDC. 

- Happiness: You are neither happy at your job given the bad work culture nor happy at home given the bad work culture! It consumes you. People end up going to therapy to deal with the stress and low self confidence. Job security is severely low. One could probably even seek the up-or-out mindset and say that they like the fast paced growth. But the ""up"" is not dependent on how dedicated you are. The ""up"" is dependent on your luck in terms of the P/ Partner you end up working with. 

- Pay: Again another aspect heavily publicized in the positive light. There are many places outside of BCG that pay much better for significantly better WLB. For example: tech, start-ups

Advice to folks looking to join BCG: Heavily recommend spending some time on Fishbowl (or similar apps). Fishbowl is an app where current and former consultants share anonymous posts about their experiences pre, post and during their consulting days. This opened my eyes! I wish I had read this before joining the firm."

Researchers (Rs) who put sincere efforts are conned into believing their work would speak for itself, only to be lost in a maze of processes, relation building and shifting goal posts. Anything but research. 
Rs and ARs (associate researchers) detrimental to any work environment were nurtured during my tenure. Their toxicity is now for other researchers to clean, but for no reward because 'this is never a part of their goals' (a sham).

JD of an AR: If you wish to drink, party and laugh your way to an ivy league college without having to worry about work culture/office decorum or attaining knowledge. This is the place for you.

JD of an R: If you are ready to be the chariot for your SRs to ride; don't mind shifting goals every month from daily process metrics, mentoring ARs, QAs, creating content, driving initiatives, hand-shaking with stakeholders, attending meetings for missing these goals (convened by people who kept shifting the goal posts themselves) and maybe do some research which no one would talk about by the year end (afterall you were never focussed on anything throughout the year), then SRs would love you.
PS: You are not an under-age AR, so plz act responsibly at office events

JD of an SR: Welcome, to a vertical created specifically to cater to your needs of chill work-life, benefits, travel and having Rs at your disposal for every task that could potentially interupt gossip/plotting sessions (along with the choice of picking favorites at your hearts fancy).

DRS is a profit center for BCG and is specialist capability hub that provides specific research and competitive intelligence services to BCG's clients together with the consulting staff

Great work life balance

Opportunity to innovate within the boundaries of business needs

Opportunity to work with smart new hires from best undergrad schools such as DTU, NSIT, Hindu

Great team culture - focus on enjoyment with work - management does try to host team bonding events in every quarter and two annual offsite events

Learning is central to everything - a lot can be learned - depends on the willingness of the associate researchers and researchers - one needs to ask the PA Lead, this is not college where PA lead will come and teach, ARs and Rs need to take the initiative

- Researchers are treated like nothing in the world. Nobody cares about them. SR's take credit for the good work done by researchers and management doesn't bother to cross check.
- No complexity of work. Busy pleasing the likes of KT and CT 
- SR's are super busy all the time. Not working but Gossiping. Management meetings are all they do. Overpaid and underworked. 
- Management needs to learn to stand behind their people and encourage kids. People coming from C- grade universities (every person in senior management) are busy telling prospective IIM candidates how awful the B-schools they aim to go to are. It's hilarious. And why do they do this? Because they just want you to get discouraged and stay in their team for the rest of eternity

People worked hard and the senior leadership did care about certain aspects of everyday life in a way that was productive and helpful. As a non-consultant, the work was hard and demanding just like consultants. BCG is like a family and they take care of you. BCG does care about affinity groups and does a great job of trying to be inclusive of people with different background.","Cons for BCG in general: 
-BCG management and leadership made it clear that consultants come first and everyone else is second. While this makes sense in some regard (consulting is the business), it was often disheartening to not feel as valued (ex: women@BCG affinity group is only reserved for women consultants). Living as a non-consultant at BCG was often like a second-class citizen. 

Cons for recruiting: 
-Unlike the consultant world, Business Services and recruiting, in particular, does not have an up or out model. Employees who are lazy and not meeting standards are not held accountable. It seemed like BCG rather keep an inefficient, lazy employee who has been working at BCG for 3-4 years at a substandard quality, rather than hire someone new. 
- The promotion structure is absolutely archaic. You are not promoted based on accomplishments or good work, you are promoted based on your time at the company. All of this reinforces the above issue. There is no incentive for tenured employees to work hard.
- There is absolutely no autonomy. It is almost impossible to make changes or create solutions because the approval process takes forever. Senior management has too many issues to solve but has to meet and discuss all of them multiple times. Very inefficient use of everyone's time."

Very little interest in solving client problems, dubious analysis, dissappointd by aptitude of colleagues. Seems like art majors would do best here.

First case I was told I was being ""hazed"" because they didn't like me and wanted me to quit. I reported this to management, and was told that I had to stick with the same team for 3 months. I would come client side at 8 AM and leave at 10 PM, whether there was work or not, I was just required to be on-site for 14 hours a day.

I took a substantial pay-cut to come to BCG and they were not interested in negotiating.

Didn't get the recognition that I deserve. BCG does not judge people by his/her performance in promotion decision, but by his/her loyalty to one boss/ practice area. Also, your reputation plays a huge role in your promotion. But the way to decide your reputation is simply gossip on ADC/CDCs, a group of principals/partners to discuss an associate/consultant that he has never met with. It is not first time that I received unfair decision/ feedback from CD meeting.  They came up with things/reviews that never happened. 
Metal harassment. Bosses blaim people in a very bad manner. I saw many people who are blaimed to tears in the office. 
Intensive work( common to work till 1~2 am everyday), but sometimes I feel meaningless of what I am doing. Don't know where the value lies. 
Unwise decisions from PPL/ partners. Seen many bosses who know nothing about client, but keep talking to show his/her presence, and some bosses who make team to redo slides again and again for similiar storylines. I simply don't understand what's the meaning to package storylines for 20 times. Why don't we solve problems for clients, insead of piping up slides? 
Demotivated after 2 yrs of work.  You worked very hard, and your PLs approved your capability, but still, you cannot get promoted because you didn't have someone at CD meeting to back you up. No matter how many achievements you have made, these CD people take it for granted, but if you do 1% thing wrong, they will enlarge the 1% mistake and make it a disaster in your career. What's the meaning for me to work until 2am everyday for you? What's the meaning for me to try my best to give you a 100% perfect deck?"

I’ve been working at BCG since November 2016 and it’s been the best place I worked at so far. I’m married and I have two kids. They are my life and BCG gives me the flexibility to spend as much time as I can with them by allowing me to work anywhere. At BCG “work is not a place you go it’s a thing you do”.

Long list of Cons actually -

1. Favouritism - If you spend most of your time talking to managers who like to get their empty egos massaged you'll get good projects and on-site opportunities- and promotions. 

2. No work life balance- You can be asked to work from home on your vacations as things are almost always on fire and all things are due yesterday. 

3. Work from home - They claim to be very employee friendly but frown and harras every time you want to WFH-unless you are on pre-informed pre-approved leave.

4. Over time: No matter how late you stayed in office for a case - you have to leave yourself for home be it 2 am at night- no concern for women's safety.

5. Lying Upper Management- I have seen upper management openly lying to freshers about kind of exposure, benefits and expected hike you'll get. 

6. Mental Harassment & Toxic work environment - Hostile work environment for someone who wants to only succeed by good work and client feedback - 

7. Verbal Abuse - Many times the senior most manager has been known to abuse 
 people even in Hindi Language although that never happened to me."

- Great training: you'll learn how to structure and quantify very abstract problems and you'll learn a lot very fast
- Good salary and perks as with any top 3 firm (probably the best with work life balance)
- Most collaborative, down-to-earth culture of MBB
- Alumni network is really active, opens several opportunities","- Staffing is a huge hit or miss: very political and you can end up becoming an expert on a super boring topic you have no interest in
- Very political and a lot of schmoozing: sometimes its fun but other times you end up going to a team dinner for optics when you'd rather go to your hotel room and relax or catch up with family
- Strongest performers come from i-banking, highly quantitative backgrounds. Non traditional candidates will need to work 2x or 3x as hard to keep up
- Long hours are a must and definitely a sink or swim environment- not for the faint hearted. Expect 60-80 hour work weeks to be the norm
- Some offices are particularly brutal with long hours and politics - Dallas and DC in particular do NOT have a good reputation. Chicago and NJY are fantastic for Associates/ Consultants
- Work/ life balance is not possible at any level unless your definition of balance is significantly skewed towards work - if you come in single, expect to stay single unless you date a BCG-er; if you come in with an SO, they should expect to see you only on weekends of which many will be spent working from home (this is not so much a BCG only issue but a strategy consulting issue)

- not very diverse in terms of background with everyone coming from the same set of schools and privileged backgrounds
- racial diversity is low particularly for among African-American and Hispanic/Latino cohorts
Experience seems highly correlated with staffing opportunities and luck
- if staffing doesn't put you in optimal situations off-the-bat it's an uphill battle from the start
- surprisingly there are a significant number of managers (project leaders and principals who are not nice people) and usually the people who leave at that level are actually the individuals you'd want to work with
- if business needs do not align with you interests, very likely you will get staffed on cases not in the industry or functional area in which you want to gain experience

But BCG is not a monolithic entity. The culture and quality vary greatly by office.","The Dallas office is one to avoid...at least go into it eyes wide open. Plenty of political infighting, weak partners and a focus on office profitability make for a toxic environment that's counter to what BCG is really about (and very different from the rest of the firm.) Although it describes itself as familial, it's cliquish. If you fit in and make friends with the ""right"" people, you might do well, regardless of your merit. Don't make the effort to play the game and you won't do well, regardless of your effort. You're either in or you're out. Sadly this is allowed to persist by the system and regional management.

-backbone of company culture is a hard work ethic 
-more good people than bad","the pros couldn't outweigh the cons:
you don't have autonomy in the role at BCG, you have to report to your manager who microanalyses you (they have eyes into your email in all regards) and micromanages you on outlook. An EA for BCG is not for the faint of heart because the nature of the company requires that you preform with the highest marks-No problem. However, there is a problem when the manger watches your screen and has tiny issues with how you have your inbox sorted, how you didn't use a short cut she told you to create even though this short cut may be for something as small as changing your font size. 
ALSO  very important to know about working on the BST (business services team) side of BCG is that the BST side and the consulting side practically feel like two different companies. You rarely see your executive (maybe a couple times a month) and you are not expected to interact with the consultants. One quickly learns at BCG that the two sides do not mingle much and it is not fondly looked upon if you do. 
Altogether, survival at BCG felt like high school drama appealing to the other girls needs on the admin team, as opposed to the executives needs. Because the two parts of the company are so separate, the executives typically don't have much say in choosing their assistants. You end up signed up in a role much different than the common EA role."

Great place for a younger person to learn (provided you get staffed on the right sort of assignment, which is becoming lower and lower odds)","Of all the top consulting firms, BCG is by far the most focused on short-term profit per partner at the expense of all else.   During the decade I was at BCG, I saw WAY too many decisions that were very bad for clients and non-partner consulting staff that got made to enrich current partners.  Very smart people can come up with rationalizations for their actions, but at the end of the day what I saw take place very regularly at BCG was dishonest.  As someone who served in leadership roles, was active in the CDC, etc, I still feel very guilty for some of things I was involved in.  Every large company has some ""bad apples"", but at BCG, the ""bad apples"" gain more and more power because they the ones who are least apt to demonstrate any restraint or remorse for focusing purely on short term profit.  The individuals who I saw lie, cheat and steal the most are now in enormous positions of power.  I regularly hire consultants now that I'm an industry exec, but I would never hire BCG unless/until the current regime turns over."

Good work life balance

Office build out and location
Good abroad outings especially only if you are in HR function","I have spent enough time in so called HR department of BCG IKA but never found myself proud of it. The organization has great reputation across the world minus IKA. Its simply because of the person who is running the function. If you join this function, you will realize very soon that you are working for this person and not for BCG. She has her own agenda which is unrealistic. And if you don't follow her then be ready to be thrashed. 

I found malpractices being executed. The recruitment vendor/partner seems to be very good friend with my boss. And you can imagine very well undue favor that is been done both sides. I tried giving right feedback to vendor but I was asked my boss to not create problems for them. Can you believe that your internal org is asking to support vendors even when they are not meeting expectations. Also, there was clear mandate that out of multiple vendors, I need to work maximum profiles only with one vendor who is friend of my boss. I was even asked to reject internal referrals. For most people who are reading this review, it will be easy to understand. 

I have seen people making personal spend and reimbursing those on company expenses. I found everything unethical practice but cant say this to anyone. 

I have worked in such prestigious organizations who were not as reputed as BCG but still they had great respect for employees. I was never scolded in public before. I was always respected and my opinions were considered. I was coached earlier but not in this organization. 

In the end, I would say that the organization is good but the people who are running this is not doing justice."

If you want to be part of an organization that values arrogance over knowledge, gossip and constant subjective evaluation over team group, and true organic added value, if you are a Trump fan and wish to be part of a group that admires and provides support to the Trump administration (CEO, Rich Lesser is a enthusiast) , if you want to be part of a white boys’ club that does not promote diversity (besides what they advertise there is almost no minority that reach the partnership level) then yes, this is the right “club” to join."

2. Great perks and benefits - free food and drinks, great office, frequent outings etc.
3. Exposure to BCG's way of working - the famous BCG case approach","The following applies strictly to the PDT team within BCG and not to BCG as a whole:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. If you are an MBA, do not join the PDT team. Unlike BCG's consulting wing, the PDT team does not value MBA degree at all. You will see BTechs from random engineering colleges, with no business understanding (and with similar or lesser no of years of exp than yours) being promoted before you. Reason - they do not require MBA skill sets in PDT.
 
2. Moreover, there is no hiring parity. You may find people with lesser years of exp being hired at higher positions. 

3. Internal growth/promotions are adhoc and defy logic at times. For example - a 5.5 yrs BTech can be promoted to a Lead level, even though while hiring, PDT says that at least 6.5-7 yrs of exp is required to be considered for a Lead position."

3528,Boston Consulting Group,Great place to launch your career but need to be strategic about not getting stuck,2016-03-02,4.0,Recruiter,"+ Company as a whole treats employees well. Everything is done at top quality for the employees 
+ Great learning opportunities at all levels. Working closely with consultants, recruiters indirectly pick up some of the consulting tool kit 
+ Learn top of class recruiting best practices - if you take your recruiting career seriously, you will have an amazing foundation wherever you go
+ Very transparent / flat structure where everyone is expected to contribute regardless of tenure
+ Working for a smaller office can be rewarding if you've built strong relationships with leadership
+ Diverse","+ Comp package is a challenge even when you factor in PSRF (retirement) and performance bonus. Normally it would be OK, but for the hours the recruiting team is expected to work and travel, it's not equitable. It is not uncommon for a recruiter to dedicate 14 hours a day during peak season with travel, debriefs, evening events, etc...
+ An assistant who gets overtime can make more than an associate or comparable to a manager who is salaried.
+ Could be difficult to drive change/insert opinions when everything in standardized - it's a recruiting machine here
+ If you want to move out of campus recruiting, options in experience hires/lateral are slim and generally not desirable due to the dynamics on those teams.
+ Some processes are super archaic which adds unnecessary work on recruiters (in this day and age, why can't we design a process to NOT snail mail offer letters again?)"

3620,Boston Consulting Group,Knowledge Team=Death of Careers,2015-11-13,1.0,,Free food and good salary (if you can negotiate for it),"Stinking politics, Relentless hiring of low quality workforce are some basics, others are as follows:

1. Tendency to hire people at a lower level than they are eligible
2. Very Extremely substandard workforce, i.e. people don't have qualifications for the positions they hold. They use their networking skills to get hired in the company
3. Leadership doesn't have basic project management skills due to which people have to work for days and nights
4. For the first time in my life, I have seen people here lying to the face of their juniors, seniors and clients and then fight over it to prove their lies
5. People who are less qualified, less experienced, and of a lesser quality of brain cells could be your manager and it would take you days to make them understand a simple thing because they are complete idiots.
6. Salaries doesn't depend on your experience or qualifications, it depends on how well you can butter the leadership and how well you can network with your manager over smoke breaks
7. Very hierarchical approach, even when they say its a flat organization. The hierarchy is followed top to bottom, line by line
8. Growth is ZERO because the clauses of promotions cannot be met by any human, because the working hours, quality of projects, difficulty of project and client feedback are not the deciding parameters. Instead going out with managers for smoke/tea etc. are the correct parameters.
9. No matter what anyone does, if a project fails, the burden comes on the analyst because the leadership clearly states that the analyst was the one working on the project (hands on) even when its a project management failure.
10. Sometimes people are granted an express track and hired into the system telling them that they will be promoted before others. But that is a bigger sham, because these people don't have the power to promote. It depends on the people sitting at the mother company, so don't fall for this.


I have wasted my precious years of life here. Please don't fall for this, BCG as a brand will not help you out when you feel pity for yourself about the work that you would do here. And all the reviews of people here about knowledge team that have <3 stars are actually true to the CORE. Instead the reviews that are 4/5 stars are written by management puppets who are trying to hide the truth about this horrible place.

Be warned and proceed at your own risk because today you have an option tomorrow you will be a part of this."

Many great people who are smart and genuinely nice.

This is not a Pro nor Con, but there are some real differences between the regions and offices on staffing model, type of cases, and partnership. For example, South System is very profitable but had a reputation for being a high-burn place, staffing is more directive (lower ability to say no to cases). Chicago has a reputation for having a gentler work-life balance, and if you are good you have more say over the type of cases you are staffed on. West Coast is supposed to have less travel to a certain extent, etc.","The spectrum of experiences at BCG is extremely wide. You can have an amazing time or be completely miserable. Your experience depend on your managers, the client, the type of cases, the system / office you sit in, your relationship with the staffer, etc.

Workload: I'd say the intensity and the quantity of workload is a big con. It's hard to maintain a personal life when you are staffed, esp when you are traveling. BCG tries to make it better by implementing a program called predictable time off, but when a team has to explicitly establish that it's NOT okay to work until midnight on Fridays, something's wrong.

Type of cases: BCG does just as much strategy work as McK and Bain, but the trend in cases is going towards big implementation or transformation cases, which many times include org redesign or ""delayering"" (ie mass layoffs), and that kind of work can be unfulfilling, repetitive, but incredibly high-burn - you work 80-90 hours a week making sure that the people who are on the fire list is actually fired and so you can count them as ""synergies"". These are also the cases that don't get publicized during recruiting.

Danger of being pigeon-holed. What this means is that you do a 6-month case on XYZ, you hate it but it goes OK. Then another XYZ-like case comes along, your chances of being pulled on it is higher especially as you are now an ""expert"".

Travel: ultimately consulting is a travel-intense profession, and that does wear on you after a while."

There's a high bar on performance but those who excel can write their own ticket--the firm will go to great lengths to keep them happy, and they typically get a lot of choice on projects. Great exposure to senior folks--as a consultant I typically interact with people 3-4 rungs above where my b-school classmates would come into the client organization, and senior leadership / c-suite at smaller clients. As a project leader, you're interacting with senior leadership regularly; PL's on my cases present to country leadership, global leadership, boards of directors. Exit options are similarly accelerated. The people are great--very nice, interesting group of people. I find the culture very socially inclusive and not clique-y.","Hours and travel can be rough, but great travel / benefits perks go a long way to evening that out (ie no per diem or meal limits, company doesn't get fussed about expenses--they know you're working hard you get appropriate leeway on the soft stuff). Know what you're getting into and this won't be a problem. NY office typically travels less.  The bigger challenge is that some projects will just suck. No way around it, and every now and then you'll get stuck on one.

[Data and Research Services is a subsector of the knowledge team that was launched in 2012. Its members are billed as knowledge support experts in research rather than experts in any specific practice or topic area. I have worked on the founding branch of this team since its inception in Oct 2014.])

Company overall looks great on a resume, benefits are excellent, good work-life balance in DRS (e.g.: no taking work home, hours predictable and regular, etc.), work covers a wide range of diverse topics.","Day-to-day work is repetitive, boring, and essentially the same at Associate Researcher or Research level. (These two roles have a combined average tenure of ~5 years, meaning that someone who signs on with minimal experience is looking at 5 years of the same repetitive, boring work.)

Environment is high pressure and extremely deadline driven, but returns on individual efforts are too low to motivate sustained exertion. Attrition is extremely high. 

While lip service is paid to career opportunities within the firm, these don't seem to actually be available. On-the-job skills learned in DRS are very specific to DRS and largely nontransferable. 

Base compensation is low compared to industry. 

Management team (with a handful of exceptions) is insufficiently trained and lacks management experience. A number of members of the management team perform consistently below the expected level of quality across dimensions."

Only possible to get a raise on Knowledge Team when up for promotion.  Can be 4+ years at higher levels.  Too long.
Benefits are not competitive on support staff with other top firms.  McKinsey, Bain are better.  Most other small firms offer more vacation and 401k match as well.

The primary difference relevant for the job-seeker is cultural: McK has a bit of a reputation for their consultants coming out of a cookie cutter, and BCG has bit of a reputation for being a bit more colorful in terms of the people there. Both of these reputations are, of course, stereotypes, but they aren't undeserved. (And Bain has a reputation for being a frat house...)

Benefits are amazing, too--where else do kids fresh out of school fly in the better part of the plane?","It's up-or-out and the qualities measured in the very competitive hiring process aren't necessarily the same qualities needed to thrive there in the long run. The hiring process is essentially an applied IQ test--be brighter than everyone else and somewhat presentable to client who'll pay very heavily for your time, and you'll get the job. The IQ needed to get in comes in very handy during the first years as an Associate or Consultant. But eventually the role will turn first into a project management and then into a sales role, combined with being a good shrink for CEOs whom they trust and like. The qualities needed in these roles arguably are quite different from the brain power needed to get in. Also, the intense up-or-out environment sometimes can bring out the worst in people--it's rare, but can be unpleasant."

3983,Boston Consulting Group,Not a sustainable life for most; be careful about exit timing,2013-10-21,3.0,Principal,"Very rapid learning curve, opportunity to work with top management at well-known clients, very friendly office culture (at junior levels), very smart and motivated people, and a powerful addition to your CV.","As noted elsewhere, there is a powerfully-entrenched long-hours culture and absolutely constant and overwhelming pressure on teams. The PTO process is supposed to address this, but in London at least, has resulted in no real changes to partner behaviour, and so PTO sessions really just turn into grumbling sessions that don't change expectations. The fact that the name was changed from its original ""predictable time off"" to ""predictability, teaming and open communication"" is a pretty good clue.

There is a very wide range of partner personality types. For example, judging by what consulting staff say, 3/4 of the London energy Partners have a ruthless, critical, and driving approach to teams, as do the private equity guys, while media Partners are at the other end of the scale in terms of personality and approach. Banking partners are in the middle. 

Career progression can be tough, with any negative feedback or issues with individual partners magnified out of proportion. At the Principal level, one bad project can be enough to derail your career. 

A lot of project approaches are very theoretical, and although what ultimately goes to clients is almost invariably of high quality, what the client sees is often a fraction of the work consultants are driven to do to satisfy partner desires for a perfect solution, rather than a practical one. With the wrong partner, case team meetings can be a nightmare.

Finally, it is important to manage your exit timing, keeping in mind that even Partners rarely stay longer than seven years.  Consultant or P/L is likely to have the best mix of exit options that don't require a big fall in salary and give good industry exposure.  At P or Partner level, industry options become far fewer, and often require a big drop in compensation.  Do keep in mind that in contrast to McK, the BCG alumni and career services network is rudimentary, so you will be on your own when you start looking!"
3984,Boston Consulting Group,Great company!,2013-10-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The benefits package is crazy, the atmosphere is overall very friendly, and everyone is working together for the benefit of the company.","The only major con I can come up with is that, although the atmosphere is very friendly, it is also fairly political on the business services side.

I have only encountered a few people who have this personality, however, but overall it is a great atmosphere!"

Over the course of my tenure, I saw how the grueling hours and stress led to physical and psychological degradation of great people. One of my colleagues would suffer seizures because the medication he normally took for a chronic condition made him drowsy, and he couldn't afford that additional drowsiness when already sleep-deprived on our projects. 
Another colleague developed a stress-related condition so severe it was mis-diagnosed as breast cancer during the few medical visits she was able to make without repercussions from management. 
When a manager of mine who was pregnant in her first trimester would leave the boardroom due to morning sickness, (ie. go throw up) our higher-up manager claimed it was ""unacceptable for her to just leave the room"": he also claimed she should be grateful BCG made arrangements for her to work there while pregnant, since ""women getting pregnant was their own choice"" (and not, say, a fairly important biological imperative of your species).
That BCG institutes a metric system to track work/life balance is indicative of how much of your life will be under its control when you work there: all of it!

- Massive reorgs going on -- job changes, eliminations, etc
- New more consultant-like job requirements (time, expertise, pressure to bill), same pay
- Limited optionality for career growth in KT unless you want to leave and go somewhere else or go into consulting at BCG

BCG is no longer a platform for the vital few who offer breakthrough thinking and back it up with hard work - if you're in this bucket you'll find yourself in better company at one of the BCG alumni firms who have chosen not to accept the compromises of scale.

- Exposure to many different industries and business functions
- Excellent comp and benefits, especially at the lower levels in comparison with similar opportunities","- Typically extensive travel
- Long hours (always 60 hours+ per week)
- Many short projects (<5 weeks), which are exhausting ""sprints"" and often prevent the development of strong client relationships or team bonding
- Forced rotation among managers can mean exposure to great managers and poor managers with little to no choice
- Rotation among projects & managers requires consistent getting up to speed on managers' styles; may not click and can lead to poor reviews
- Some offices have fewer long-term or large clients, forcing a very exhausting, consistent sales culture
- Interview process only moderately successful at forecasting employee performance
- Verbal focus on work-life balance, but in practice, depends greatly on the client, the type of project, and most importantly your manager. Again, unusual to have <60 hour work weeks, and will generally involve travel

4029,Boston Consulting Group,It's an honor to work here,2013-06-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a consulting firm, BCG is little other than its people, and its people are amazing. It is my privilege to lead them in helping our clients to solve their most difficult issues. Every BCGer can give me a perspective I didn't have before and this forces me to push myself as hard as I can to give something back to them. They can be tough to manage since they size you up pretty quickly and don't give you their respect just because of the title - you've got to earn it. That challenge keeps me sharp.

Beyond the consulting staff, I have to hand it to our business services staff (BST). Admins, IT, travel, staffing - all of them are responsive and service oriented. I can get done through them in an hour what would have taken me a day in the average company. IT is especially good. Left your laptop on an airplane? No problem - IT will overnight a new one to you with all your data restored so you never skip a beat. In what is a stressful job, these folks do what they can to make our operations not one of your concerns. They're good at what they do.

Comp is known to be good. Benefits are stellar. Promotion speeds are unheard of if you've ever worked a regular company. A lot of that could be said about BCGs top competitors though.

What sets us apart is how involved all levels of the firm are in solving our clients problems, treating each one as unique. Do we leverage what we've learned from experience - of course, but we're always looking for the differences rather than force fitting a generic solution. I've been impressed with how much even the Senior Partners engage on content at sometimes the lowest levels when the ""devil is in the details."" It doesn't always make for the cleanest process, but at the end of the day it gets us to the best answer.","Intellectual leadership isn't there like it used to be. Again, I think this criticism could be launched at the top 3 consulting firms, but BCG in particular, hung its hat of path breaking concepts in the 70s and that's just not there anymore. Consulting really drove the intellectual agenda of management then, pulling academia in its wake. Not sure any business school or economics professors will be calling up partners to get  new insights nowadays. Along the same lines, I worry about the generalist model. Only so much can be taught in two years at business school and, unlike the medical profession, there is no obligation to continue to learn the latest evidence based research, or even theories for that matter. So few do. As business disciplines continue to bend to the scientific research process (finance went first, now parts of marketing are starting), MBAs will be left saying only the most general of platitudes. Do we still add value, you bet. But perhaps not on the pure ""intellectual"" part - more so on solving political log jams, organization hurdles, synthesis of all the pieces parts.

As great as the people are, they (and I'm of course generalizing here) can get a bit detached from the average Joe and that sometimes manifests itself in off putting ways e.g. whining about issues people would die to have elsewhere. Really gets under my skin to hear my colleagues play into the prima donna stereotype. That's us at our worst moments.

Yes, work/life balance is tough in consulting but I don't think it's out of whack with other professional jobs - law, investment banking, etc. I'm convinced the labor market has its own efficient frontier of sorts in the tradeoff between money/achievement and work/life balance. You can't have the good of consulting without the bad. We wouldn't be what we are if we worked half the time. The mix it brings is not right for everyone or for all times in your life/career. 

Ok - enough for now. I really need to get back to work. These decks aren't going to write themselves! :-)"

Consultants are billed out at ~10x their salary so there is a huge arbitrage opportunity and thus most of the most talented consultants move on, leaving some variability in the quality of the partner group."
4081,Boston Consulting Group,Deceived,2012-12-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I think the people at BCG are unparalleled. I made friends quickly. I learned Excel and Powerpoint, I stayed at nice hotels, and ate well. That's about all that I can say that's positive.","I was at BCG for a year and I was never on an official case. That's the part they do not tell you in recruiting sessions. I never met a client. I spent a total of three days at an actual client site, where I was hidden in a windowless office so that the client didn't know it was getting an extra associate ""for free"". 

I came to realize as well that the job isn't about getting the right answer but about basically making your manager happy. Ultimately, because consulting is client services, your boss is happy when the client is happy, and the client, who has his or her own career to manage, cares more about an answer that makes his or her department look good than about the overall health of the company. While I was never ""on the front lines"" so to speak, I still had slides to make and research to do. I got very frustrated when my slides were continually edited in ways that I felt were more political than data-driven. 

Finally, the review process is so opaque. That is ultimately what sours me about the company. They claim to be quite forthright in their reviews. I would disagree. I sought feedback every week from my manager, who gave me nothing but effervescently positive remarks, including telling me that he was going to give me the highest grade available to BCG Associates on my official review. When the final review actually came back, I ended up getting a middling grade along with negative feedback that directly contradicted praise I had received when I was seeking feedback weekly. Further, even though it was my first review of any kind, and even though I had received a middling (read: not low) score, I was fired from the company within a week of receiving that review. I think the whole process was decidedly unfair. I didn't even get a chance to prove myself until I was six months into the job. I did everything in my control to seek feedback and respond to that feedback. I was told not only that I was doing fine but in fact that I was exceeding expectations and that I could expect to receive a very positive review. After being built up to believe I was doing so well, I received an ""average"" review that apparently wasn't actually average because I was ""transitioned out"" as a result of that score. I don't know if they hired too many people my year or what else was going on, but I was completely blind sighted by their decision, and, frankly, I think the way it was handled was both shady and unprofessional."

Most cases are not very interesting -- currently most are cost-cutting/delayering type cases that focus on benchmarking.
A lot of typical overachieving, aggressively Type A types -- less creative/quirky than the company sells itself to be.
Ability to work on social impact cases is very limited, though it is heavily mentioned during recruiting.
Most of the consulting staff seem unhappy/dissatisfied with their work experiences.
BCG's emphasis on feedback (mostly negative) creates a toxic atmosphere of insecurity.
Not always a great working environment for women -- some of the practice areas tend to be dominated by a very Finance-driven/fraternity like atmosphere that can be hostile towards women."

4155,Boston Consulting Group,You get out of it what you put in - but you can become a dramatically better version of yourself here.,2012-03-21,5.0,Associate,"1. Career opportunities
Starting at BCG, so many doors open to you, it's crazy. Head-hunting emails every other week. Relationships with clients, from the C-suite to analysts. People leaving to do everything from joining PE firms to corporate clients to non-profits at senior levels.

2. Affiliation
Less than two years in, I already feel about as close to some of the Associates in my starting class as a lot of my friends from college that I've known for years. And you'll get to know the principals and partners really well as well - from joking around at team meetings, trash talking over college sports, or sitting around with beers at happy hours. Additionally, holiday parties, retreats, and other occasional events are a lot of fun to attend and just mix with the people at the office. BCG is growing very fast and the partners are committed to keeping it feeling as close-knit as possible.

3. Work that makes a difference - most of the time
Yes, there will be instances where you have to do somewhat dry work. But with the rare exception, managers make sure you're putting in work that's serving a purpose, not just being fed into a black hole. Clients may not always take our advice, but you can bet that both you and the people you work with will constantly demonstrate a culture that is committed to bettering the client. And people will always sound smarter than you, no matter how smart you may be. That's a great environment that always ups your game instead of letting you rust.

4. Pay
From anecdotal evidence, BCG is constantly at or near the top for each tier in pay. The PSRF adds a solid chunk to your retirement fund, and the bonus process is very transparent.

5. The health benefits
BCG pays for every penny of your premium and the benefits are phenomenal. My recent surgery cost $5. While this may seem small in and of itself, it's indicative of the general culture.

6. *People care*
This is manifested in some of the earlier points I've made, but at every step along the way, it's obvious that managers, partners, staff, even office heads go out of their way to make life better for its employees. The atmosphere is fair and transparent, especially considering that it's a private company. Honestly, I think this is the most important facet that sets BCG apart. You won't feel it unless you've gotten to know the people. And that's why, as cliched as it may sound at recruiting presentations, 'the people' is the most important aspect of where you work.","Yes, you'll have to average more than 50 hours a week. It varies from office to office, across managers and projects. But most managers will try to be as accommodating as possible for personal commitments, vacation days, making sure you have a life outside of work and that you don't burn out."
4156,Boston Consulting Group,Exciting but high pressured journey,2012-03-19,3.0,,Strong culture where employees are motivated and want to take the extra effort to contribute to the firm and the success of colleagues,Project selection process is stressful and competitive.

- Projects typically are C-suite focused; it's always interesting to step back and realize that you, as someone in your late 20s, is interacting with VPs of Fortune 500 companies
- Incredible support for taking time off when needed; benefits are unparalleled","- Even though BCG is lauded for work-life balance, don't expect to have much stability.  There will always be a need for last-minute fire drills, so unless you have the excuse of a family + two kids, setting some boundaries is a challenge.
- Feedback can be overwhelming; it comes quickly and frequently, and it's not always projected that you're doing great work when so much effort is focused on your areas for development.
- Be careful about office selection.  While the recruiting messages suggest that you'll be able to work on any sort of casework, most often you'll be defaulted to the work that is being sourced from that specific office.  This is especially prevalent for smaller offices with a more rigid staffing structure.
- The firm is growing, and during onboarding periods, many senior consultants are bypassed for project work in favor of a lower-cost consultant.  The ability to get staffed declines substantially during these periods."
