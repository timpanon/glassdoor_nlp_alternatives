19,Box,Box is not a great place to work anymore,2022-03-05,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Good culture (but how its getting diluted)
Good work life balance
Some managers do care about employees","No equivalent refreshers (stocks) even if you are performing good (based on yearly review) at your current level (I am not talking about next level). So basically after 4 years your TC is going to be less.
Managers are valued more in my team. In my team only manager's birthdays and joining anniversaries get celebrated with kudo boards etc. 
Promotions: I see that some teams have lenient promotions vs some have very strict. If you want to join, try to join new, less established team where you will have better chance to get promoted. If you are on IC track, it's really hard to get promoted. While if you are in manager track it will be better. Also I have seen the trend that people who are bold, good at presentation and keep themself's in limelight have better chance for promotion.
Overall Box is not a great place to work anymore."

They also have a lot of opportunities to volunteer and give back to the community .","Unfortunately, they don't 401k match.
Some stages of the onboarding process were made difficult as a returning employee, much more so than just coming in as a new employee.
Not so much a con, but I have noticed that most new hires are not fresh graduates so it is a bit daunting for interns to be one of the few employees coming into the company with less than 3 years of industry experience."

222,Box,"Culture is Great, Almost to a Fault",2020-10-16,4.0,GTM Team,"First of all, I LOVE Box. This company is truly one-of-a-kind and such an amazing company to work for. The people who work here are so incredibly smart and caring that sometimes it's difficult to picture working anywhere else that has the same kind of kindness that Boxers have. Benefits are really great (except 401ks, no matching) and the parental leave is great too.","While I really love this company, I think they take one of their values ""Assume good intent"" almost to an extreme. There's almost no accountability at Box which is extremely discouraging for hard workers. When sales people aren't hitting their numbers for well over a year, it's time to cut your losses and fire them. At Box, getting fired is almost unheard of and if you do get fired, then you REALLY messed up. While I wouldn't want to work for a cutthroat environment, I think there's a balance that Box needs to find if it wants to continue promoting hard work and cut some of the fat in the company that bogs us down.

Box also needs to do 401k matching and make their salaries more competitive if they want to hold onto their talent. Culture is great but it doesn't pay the bills."

-Incredible people. Even on the worst days, my teammates are the ones I laugh with at the end.
-Valued for my whole self. When I needed to make adjustments to my workload and schedule for some life changes, I felt fully supported by my manager and Box as a whole.
-Leadership that isn't shy to state where they stand on social issues, and also accept where they need to do better. In today's climate, we want to know that our leaders believe in belonging and acceptance, equality and justice. I've been immensely proud to know that our leadership is vocal about the issues that impact their employees.","-This has recently gotten better, but for most of my time at Box there was never a clear career path for my org. It was difficult to determine my standing, which made promotion conversations and cross-org-career changes hard to navigate. However, recently more structure/mapping has been put in place to make this conversation easier.
-My org/teammates have been consistently underpaid/undervalued compared to the market
- As with any tech company, sometimes coworkers can lose sight of what matters and behave a bit spoiled over things that they should be grateful for. They can also sometimes be disrespectful of shared spaces/office environments."

Today those employees are gone, there is no clear outlook for how they can stay competitive, many promised products that our stock value was based on have been nixed, and great management has been replaced with incompetent and desperate fills that are bringing down sales and CS and creating desperate sales people with shady tactics.

235,Box,"Great CEO, Great Product, Poor Leadership",2020-09-25,3.0,Sales,"Box used to have an amazing culture, but is still generally a good place to work. Perks are pretty standard for tech companies (still no 401K match which is surprising), but the people you work with are awesome, several talented people across sales, marketing, product, engineering, etc. The product is the best in the space, which makes it easier to believe in the long-term success of the company. Aaron is an incredible person and product visionary and makes the company feel like a family.","Our executive level changes have brought some important operational changes for the better, but have started to drastically erode the culture that made Box such a great place to be. Even though Box is a flat organization, the executive team seems totally in the dark on what things feel like at the ground level. Targets continue to get higher without a proportional increase in enablement or headcount and it's stretching all aspects of the company. While many tech companies hire smart people and get out of their way, Box hires smart people and then subjects them to micromanagement from the higher ups. Good ideas or logical anecdotes are often dismissed while the company continues to pursue strong numbers for the market. In general, the CRO is an extremely aggressive, egotistical addition to the e-staff team and has a lot of people worried about Box's culture and what it means to work here."

We have meetings, to have meetings when something could be covered in email or a slack message. I understand the desire to stay connected in our WFH world, but most Sales professionals have been working WFH for years now and is not a new concept in the world of Software sales.
Market with our solutions first. We keep seeing a push on our products which we understand internally, but it would be helpful if marketing started with what problems we are solving for our customers and would make it much easier to explain our value prop during discovery calls and pitches.

The product itself is such a game changer for remote work and companies wanting to thrive in the digital age. Flexible vacation policy, 5 months maternity leave, WFH stipend during COVID-19. Everyone has been especially supportive of each other during COVID-19 - giving employees additional paid days off, mental health resources and a flexible work from anywhere policy.

The internal communication is fantastic, I know exactly what's going on within the company, the product roadmap, strategies, etc. Previously, I've worked at companies that did NOT share this level of information and it's refreshing to have that at Box. The values are very clear and the company does a great job trying to promote those values throughout the organization and live up to the values. I must say that Box does a great job showing the value it places on employees, it was one of the things that I picked up during the hiring process and was reflected in my offer (not just the offer itself, but the communication behind the offer). That made my decision to come here super easy as that can be really hard to find in a company with 2K plus employees and growing!","Sometimes, the ""fun"" that is injected in the corporate meetings is a bit over the top, IMHO, but I understand that this is a young company and the culture reflects that.

While the nature of sales is competitive, Box does a fantastic job of keeping hiring standards high and ensuring that culture continues to be the most important aspect of bringing people on-board. Secondly, having a leader like Aaron Levie is unheard of. I have so much respect for him and the passion and commitment that he has for the success and mission of the business carries over in everything we do and is incredible to be a part of. Its a hunter mentality that values and rewards hard work, the grind, and good people.

The culture is really phenomenal especially on the sales side of the house. There is a strong sense of community among coworkers and people really do want to see you succeed vs. hyper-competitive sales cultures. Additionally there are tons of resources around ERGS and room to grow with your career with upward mobility. 

The management in particular has really show their true colors during Covid-19. Aaron's leadership and generosity through out this pandemic has made me feel 100% secure in my job. Which in turn has allowed me to focus on what is really important and that is my customers and doing my job well. Management has also been extremely transparent and hosting weekly 1:1 fireside chats with various executives and the sales team members to share their own experiences in their roles and how we can translate that to benefit our customers. 

I also would say after a number of years our product offering is finally rounding out its suite offering to better compete with the larger traditional ECM players and better differentiate ourselves from basic files sharing.","No 401K Matching, Stock performance mediocre over the years, competitive market"

We have Friday lunches led by leadership, which offers great transparency and opportunities to ask questions

Benefits wise you can't really get any better from unlimited PTO, catered meals every day, huge snack selection, very generous paternity/maternity leave, gym/phone/transportation subsidy, and constant team/company outings and events.",No matching 401k. Justification has been the ESPP/equity package serving a similar function though the stock has underperformed for awhile so that hasn't really worked out. You can't have it all though!

Buying into the mission is super important to me, and I am a huge supporter of Box's mission of changing how the world works together.

A few other good things:
- Work/life balance is a priority for most managers and flexible working isn't uncommon
- Unlimited PTO affords employees the ability to take the right amount of time off
- In-office experience includes lunches, snacks, drinks, etc.
- Box is huge on culture and the importance of belonging
- Hard work is rewarded appropriately","There are two cons that I'd call out for prospective employees:

1. Box doesn't do 401(k) matching as of today. That being said, in my opinion the ESPP program more than makes up for it - but there's no traditional 401(k) match.

2. As part of growing pains, the top priorities aren't always clear to employees in some areas since it sometimes feels like there's a ""flavor of the quarter"" mentality coming from senior management."

I've never left the office feeling relieved to be out of the door, everyday I've had at Box has been a good day even when I've had challenging days. The Box at culture has evolved over the years from when I joined the Box's family in 2014 but I've always held on to our core values ""Make Mum Proud!"", Take Risk, Fail Fast and GSD whilst adapting to the changing culture as new Boxers join. Apart from my love of the cultural and the wonderful colleagues I've been privileged to have worked with over the years. I have also been exceptionally blessed to have had great managers and regionally leaders supporting, mentoring and championing my efforts and trusting me to take on new challenges with like experience which eventually led to me transitioning to a new and unorthodox career path and for that I will always be truly grateful.",No one is perfect and there areas for improvement but what is great about Box is we don't shy away from facing up to mistakes and holding ourselves accountable.

The work I do feels meaningful and interesting, and I routinely collaborate with brilliant and fun co-workers.  I love that the company as a whole has an inclusive, kind, agile, and fun culture.  Senior leadership exhibits kindness, creativity, drive, humility, caring, and support of others, and that culture trickles down throughout the organization.

- I get to be myself at work

- Content... is that cool? Kinda. Is powering how the world works together around content cool? YES! That's what you'll be doing at Box no matter which org you're in.

- Magnetic and empowering leadership from our executive team 

- Executive leadership actively seeks opportunities to educate employees with a high amount of transparency 

- Box is a company that genuinely cares about the betterment of the world, not just in the areas that content touches 

- Promotion comes to those who work hard, live out our values, perform and bring out the best in others and not based on politics 

- Micromanaging is generally not practiced - Box really trusts their people who commonly go above and beyond to do what's best for each other and our customers

- I've never worked with better customers - very fun to work with

- No one is a jerk, it's actually astounding to not be able to name one at the company

- Work/Life blend support is near utopian 

- The benefits are incredible

- Every manager I've had has accelerated my professional growth 

- I'm able to continue to do my best work at Box","- There are a lot of meetings at Box, some meetings feel unnecessary and could be solved with an email/messages in Slack

- No 401k matching, but the company has a generous ESPP and the equity package is very attractive 

- There aren't as many structured professional development opportunities compared to other companies (e.g. no leadership development program)

- The company is able to respond with startup agility, which is actually a pro, however things can move extremely fast - so change management isn't as smooth as it could be sometimes"

We are provided all of the tools and resources we need to succeed. The team is highly skilled and experienced, and work gets done more quickly and efficiently than any other company I've worked at before. 

The culture fosters inclusivity, humility and drive. I work with some of the smartest people who genuinely want to be the best versions of themselves both at work and outside of work. I am inspired by fellow Boxers who do countless acts of good in their communities.

Aaron Levie is an incredibly driven and visionary CEO. Things have been extremely busy this month and last with the COVID-19 pandemic, and Aaron was already ahead of the curve on building a strategy for our company before the pandemic fully took off in the U.S. I was inspired to see the way he mobilized over 2,000 people to come together and support each other, our customers and our communities. 

Box has a great mindset pertaining to remote work as well. I live in Colorado and they were willing to be flexible with a fully remote position for me, which I appreciate every day. The team has adapted to the new fully remote life better than I could've ever thought possible.

When I am at HQ, I am blown away by the amenities, food and events.

Box offers unlimited PTO and I never feel strange about using it. Box really values mental health of employees and encourages employees to take time off with friends and family, or just R&R when needed.

Again, I really cannot speak highly enough about this company.","Sometimes the amount of work travel can be draining for my role, which only happens during busy seasons (like events)."

The culture is unlike anything I've experienced before.  The people at Box are highly talented, hard working, and extremely humble.  They check their egos at the door and pitch in to help one another.....so refreshing!  It really feels like we are all in this together and rowing in the same direction.  

On the leadership and technology fronts, I've never seen the kind of access to leadership and product like we have at Box.  We truly have the ability to influence the future roadmap and serve as a strong voice for the customer.  Box is recognized as the leader in the cloud content management space by all the major analyst firms for a reason.

The pressure from competitors exacerbates all of this as well. Box is the outright best product on the market but it's also 2x or 3x the cost.

Open Communication from higher ups.","Company is struggling to stay on top of a competitive market; therefore a lot of decisions are made hastily in an effort to increase revenue. The result is a lot of short term band-aids on processes that were rushed into execution. This also puts a lot of manual work onto the operational staff.

There is an excellent work life balance, unlimited vacation, free lunch, and good overall benefits. eStaff is well respected and comes across as open and approachable.","The company-wide focus is on becoming profitable and reducing costs. Hiring is slowing or has stopped completely in most teams. Teams are repeatedly asked to do more with less. Growth opportunities are becoming more limited.

Mid-level leadership is spotty (lots of Director and VP level people have been leaving over the last year or two). In Box Consulting, there are some members of the senior leadership team that seem to be good at ""playing the game"" and managing up, but not making any real impact on their teams. New senior managers and directors are brought on, especially within the Growth and Strategy team, but they don't make any real impact and aren't respected internally. Constructive feedback on this team is not welcomed. Meanwhile, individual contributors are leaving and their positions aren't being backfilled but are being moved offshore (which some members of the leadership team are bragging about). Senior leadership within Box Consulting seems out of touch and uninterested in receiving feedback. The only priority is billable customer work - even if that means sacrificing efficiency and process improvements. BC is moving closer and closer to a traditional Consulting org, but they don't get comparable compensation. Time tracking is scrutinized, comments are required, and must be done daily.

Monthly healthcare costs are high. There is no 401K matching even though people have been asking for this for years."

Also, LearnFest and initiatives in your Local Office like Impact Day is always fun.","The main issue is in particular with this role is the recent restructure and the new management who took over. If you are thinking about applying for this particular role, think again. Expect to not be paid at a competitive salary level. One of the pain points we had in general with this level is that our contracts were negotiated so overtime was a consistent venue where we could earn extra money to make up for the continued expensive living in Austin especially. If you are going to take that away to make room for headcount then invest in all your employees and uplevel everyone’s base salary pay for those who signed on with this. The other issue is micromanagement. Oh yes this is an issue that has just begun. If you do happen to do overtime and you are hourly, then expect to put the reasoning on your time sheet and at times get singled out by management to go over it in detail. This can be for anything and I know multiple people have expressed discontent over this and people are quitting over this built on top of everything. We used to get lab days which were days you can go learn from different departments that was taken away too. We have expressed this to management and our People Partner multiple times and the diversity director. I think people are aware. But from what I know and what was expressed to me from my colleagues was that no action was done and our People Partner agreed with this direction. What was said is never followed through for example I was told as long as we clarified our time sheets it would be all good then why are my colleagues and I still being singled out for one/ones regarding this if that truly was the case. Morale is at an all time low and the only redeeming quality are the people you work around. The other sad fact is if you are interested in growing more technical or a certain area in support don’t expect to be placed there immediately or there at all. People are dropping like flies and if they are not dropping overly stressed and burning out from this which is so ironic since the 40 hour cap was not supposed to cause this but it is. Anyways, expect to remain stagnant and if you do get to move to a sub area consider yourself lucky because some of the tenured individuals have not and been passed over a few times and despite working diligently hard are never recognized. This is really toxic right now and if you are a new graduate although Box is a top company and outside of Support it may be better I would not recommend applying for this particular role at this moment. You are better off going to a smaller company and getting a good foot there. People are quitting before their year mark in. The other lack of thing in Box is the 401k. There is no 401k match and honestly Box can do better with making an initiative to do that."

Some other benefits include Caltrain commuter benefits (Box is located in downtown Redwood City right above the train), and like most tech companies we have snacks and an in-building cafeteria and coffee bar.","Product strategy is clear, but questionable. The way that products are shipped at Box always involves at least 3-4 scrum teams to ship 1 thing so naturally, shipping takes a long, long time, if it happens at all. Urgent customer requests come in constantly at a rate that the teams are unable to ship. PMs have a lot of scope, but very limited impact, so unsurprisingly, the PM org goes through a lot of burn out and churn. PMs are then expected to fill in the gaps, which are massive due to limited to no resourcing across design, user research, and analytics. There's an overall sense of nepotism at the leadership level and leadership continuously hires more Director-level PMs to do IC work, because there aren't enough PMs to do all the work.

And to boot, no 401k matching, compensation is lukewarm, no bonuses for PMs under Director level, and no stock refresh until your 2nd year."

- Perks are great: free food and snacks, mobile and gym reimbursements, wellness program, maternity leave, in office activities, fun office deco, electric car charging stations
- Flexible work environment for some teams","- Typical Silicon Valley startup that went public and has its fair share of growing pains.  When I started, 4 years ago, there was a lot more flexibility in terms of development and growth, and the work was more challenging and open to collaboration and innovation.  That culture has slowly died given new management and just the pressures of Wall Street, which is understandable. However, upper management has seemed to let a few folks at the top make most of the decisions and they don’t always lead to ones that make employees feels as though we’re doing what we’re preaching. 
- The company gets caught up in its own politics and puts red tape where there shouldn’t be. If we want to remain innovative, forward thinking, and empower our employees, we must make it easier for them to do their best work.
- Allow employees to actually do their best work.
- politics and favoritism is real.  If you know who has the “power,” depending on department and teams, if you align yourself correctly, you can get promoted really quickly and without having all the relevant experience. As the company grows, this is the worst thing you can do for the future and longevity of the company.  Too many senior leadership with the same, boring ideas and experience is bad for a company, but having a bunch of folks who have no experience in their roles and are given management titles, does not instill confidence nor good morale in those that work for them.
- Pay is obviously not the greatest for those who have been around for awhile. You will most likely be underpaid in a year compared to the market.  Those who are new, coming in with the same title or even less, will start at a pay that surpasses yours.  Make sure to negotiate a salary you’re comfortable with at the start, cause you won’t be making much more than that throughout your tenure, unless you get a title change and true promotion. But even then, you’ll be underpaid."

It has become a highly political and autocratic environment where team leads no longer have autonomy nor are empowered to make trivial business decisions. The department is highly micromanaged and emphasizes “rinse and repeat” so creativity is not considered a value-add. There is significant concern with the lack of communication and transparency. Many people are leaving and/or are being let go and you learn about it when you see an empty desk. Box culture is highly acclaimed, but needs to be re-evaluated and prioritized in this department as it ranks the lowest in employee satisfaction.

Box is also well respected in the cloud space","Inside sales team are pretty bad, but I believe it's because their overwhelmed as they cover 1:3 or 1:4. Have a hard time bringing product to market, not a lot of  differentiators between Box and their competitors especially Microsoft. The channel and partner eco-system is pretty weak. The sales cycle is extremely long.  The engineers and their management openly trash talk one another and AEs. I was extremely surprised the first time I heard it but it was done so much it seemed to be a common practice.  The swim lanes seem to be constantly changing between the AE,IR,OBR, and CSM. There is always push back when delegating, especially between the IRs and CSMs which causes more of a division than anything else. So if you're coming on as an AE be prepared to just take on more of the load if you want stuff to get done in a timely manner.  The comp plan/goals is different between the AEs and the support so you can imagine the issues that may cause if you an your IR or OBR have different objectives. Lastly, there is a high turn over rate for AEs."

My boss and I chat repeatedly throughout the day and I’m a contractor!!! Box treats contractors like second class.

425,Box,The people make the difference,2018-07-05,5.0,Engineer,"The people at Box consistently make my day better.

I've been working in the tech industry since 1988.  I have never, in my entire career, worked at a company that has better people.  I think this is for a few reasons, but the biggest seems to be (as one senior manager told me) ""We don't hire brilliant xyzholes"".   Every time I ask the wrong team for help, they do everything they can to help me, and find the right place for me to get additional assistance.  I have yet to think to myself ""Ok, now I've found the jerk...""

Add to that that Box LAVISHES their employees-  The cafeteria is amazing, the cafe makes a killer mocha, management has their heads screwed on right and ""gets it"".  Aaron Levi consistently says things that are both insightful and shows that he knows what he's doing.  Of all the places I've ever worked (and there have been a lot of them, I've worked for some profoundly dysfunctional organizations-  lookin' at you eBay), this is the one place that I can honestly say that if you have the opportunity to work here, you should grab it.","Some growing pains, but truthfully nothing unexpected.

Engineering directors and up lack vision and focus on short term solves.  Millennial culture with no accountability.  Zero focus on career progression.  Founders are seemingly incapable of making tough decisions.
430,Box,Excellent company to grow or start your career,2018-06-21,5.0,Strategic Account Executive,"After working for a large technology company for a number of years, I can honestly say that making the move to Box was one of the smartest and rewarding professional decisions I’ve made. The company is large enough to provide you with the resources you need to get your job done but also small enough in size to still feel like the work you do makes an actual difference. Fortunately, in my three years here so far I have yet to experience the typical bureaucracy one might expect to see in a decent sized organization. Leadership on the sales side from Aaron, our COO Steph, and management are all willing to get involved to help you close deals rather than simply ask questions for no other purpose than forecasting. There are great opportunities to make money as a sales rep here as well as gain promotions from within. Culturally, Box is a grade above others in this space both in terms of the values we embody as an organization as well as an overall fun place to work everyday.","As we transition to a more solution based selling approach, deals become more complex and take longer to close. Furthermore, the transition from selling cloud storage and collaboration tools to cloud content management requires partnership with a broader ecosystem of vendors and SIs that complicates the sales cycle. Overall, things are very positive and you’re rewarded in terms of commission structure due to these complexities that senior management acknowledges."

433,Box,The times they are a changing,2018-06-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you get on the right team, it can be super fun.

Work/life balance is amazing if you are on a supportive team. CEO & SVP HR do not really support working from home and both have confirmed in various conversations, so do with that what you will. CFO/COO do support it, so if you get on one of their teams, you are usually good to go; it is definitely team based. 

The culture is still pretty good! Employees are really nice, everyone is really supportive, I have made life long friends. Lots of people are leaving though (3 really senior people in the last 6 weeks!! I’ve never see this before.) It’s starting to show that Aaron and Dylan are still learning how to run a business, they lean really hard of people they consider to be smart and seasoned, rarely push back on decisions and it has definitely changed the voice/culture of Box in the last year.

An honest career assessment is: If you get paid what you feel is fair, and you love the team you met with. Take the job - it can be a good career builder, and I don’t see the company getting acquired anytime soon. If you are a seasoned Boxer who is reminiscing about how it “used to be” - it is probably time to dust off the resume, because the times they are a changing and no-one is going to try and keep you (especially the head of HR! - make sure to keep personal effects on the desk to a minimum - the Kremlin/Salem hunters may come for you next!)","Pay - you will be underpaid compared to market value, Box knows this, they talk about it internally a LOT. Make sure you negotiate hard to get what you want before you start, because you likely will not come up to market rate during your time here. 

Since the new SVP came in, people across teams either just disappear (stuff left on desk! Kremlin/Witch hunt style) or give notice. The culture has shifted to one professional face, not authentic happiness anymore, it feels like everyone plays along out of fear they could be next. Leadership loves her, so I don’t see this changing any time soon. She is really changing things - forcing a changing of the guard so to speak. New people are coming in who don’t have any experience with how amazing it used to be, which isn’t necessary bad per say - just kind of sad. 

There are problem VPs/Executives across the company (one in finance has multiple complaints of bullying/harassment, another harassed someone out of a job, the new head of HR struggles with leadership) and some really really amazing ones -the COO  is doing amazing things!

Growth is pretty hard and you have to be dedicated to sticking it out. This year, when they reviewed promotions on stage at a company lunch, an exec who sat on the compensation committee acknowledged that some people didn't get promoted the previous year because they just simply didn't have enough ""time"" in lower management. It isn't about talent or progress, it is about sitting in a role for 3+ years.  

Physical space!! I am unsure as to why we are taking away collaboration space, and putting people on top of one another when most of our 5th floor is empty!? I have heard Aaron visually does not like it when people are spaced out, he wants it to ""look busy"" at all times (hence why he doesn't like working from home), but we are seriously sitting on top of one another and they just took away collaboration space and storage to make room for more desks - the 5th floor is 90% empty. It is crazy."

- Our product seriously has a good chance of changing the market. Depending on how we execute, we can either be a dominant market leader or just one of the few selection that offer the same value. It's both exciting and scary.
- Very clear path of career and personal advancement. Management is very invested in each individual growing in their area of strength and interest. I'm personally very excited to see how far I can grow my career here.
- Pay is great. People actually take good advantage of the flexible (unlimited) vacation plan and management supports it. Work/life balance is great.
- Commute is awesome if you have access to a CalTrain station. Box pays for the CalTrain pass too!","- As Box is an enterprise company, there are times when requirements come down from the top unexpectedly. It can be frustrating to have to shift directions without notice."

While rest of the Bay area is moving towards encouraging and recognizing hard working and dedicated women in technology, seen a reverse trend at Box.
While there are very good leaders at Box that support career development for engineers at lower levels, there are also some of them who are just so insecure and can really hurt their career growth. 
If you are a smart, dedicated engineer and only woman in your team, you will soon find yourself in situations where you have to allow your team to be really demeaning to you in the name of team work. Management goes by pure numbers, so you are at a loss."

Aaron is possibly one of the best CEOs out there, and his vision is very strong. He has almost a reality distortion field like Steve Jobs, and is brilliant! We're constantly providing upgrades to benefits, like paid time off for new families, etc. Box has an amazing metric they track: how many filled job roles for senior positions were from internal hires/transfers? That's huge in my book. The executive team goes out of their way to ensure there's full clarity on Box's mission, it's trajectory, and everything in between.","As the company grows, there's been some increases in politics here and there. It's not widespread, seems to be by org which is good. Every company will have politics - every company. Box can definitely do a better job at making it easier in some orgs (again, not all!!!) to get promoted. A few orgs have shown a decrease in merit-based recognition in favor of, well, favoritism.

504,Box,Top marks for Box,2017-05-16,5.0,Director,"A creative, inspiring company, Box is a place where you can do your best work. Employees are encouraged to take big risks, celebrate and learn from failure and have great pride in their work. Since all employees are share holders, there is a sense of ownership which permeates throughout the organisation - top to bottom. 

The culture is genuine and fun - and not *enforced fun* that you often see at large organisations. The executive leaders are authentic, approachable and motivating. You can book time with literally anyone in the organisation and your voice is heard. 

Since it's a meritocracy, the best ideas float to the surface regardless of position or time served at Box. And because the leadership team is accessible, it's easy to get your good idea on the roadmap. 

The roll-out of the DACI model for making decisions means it's obvious who has the final say; regular hackathons encourage innovation from all areas of the business; and the weekly all-hands tells employees where we are against plan. And thanks to OKRs (KPI measurement tool), it's clear what everyone is working on and what the priorities for the quarter are across the org.

All of these good practices make Box a great place to work. And given where the Cloud Content Management market is heading, Box has set itself up very well to hire and retain the best talent to capture a decent part of the market in Europe.",Working in a remote office takes longer to get decisions given the time-zone conflicts. And it's easy to fall out the loop with core HQ teams.

Don't get me wrong, my manager was a wonderful person and genuinely tried his best to make my experience at Box one of the greatest (he really is a beautiful individual), but it was also his major gap as a leader.  His focus was lost in a myriad of efforts to make Box great as a whole, but I think he lost sight on what it took to build the individuals that worked directly for him.  From what I understand from individuals that worked for him in the past, it was for the same reason why they also moved on to other teams or companies.

Box is a flat organization with no real hierarchy/politics.  This is truly refreshing and helps the lines of communication to be more open than I have experienced at other companies.  Coming to work is fun too, because I am constantly learning and increasing my skill set.  I am encouraged to think outside of my comfort zone on a regular basis and enjoy the challenge.  I have never been micro managed and feel I have a great Manager.  I am also told when I am doing a great job, which I did not get at my last job really.  Box has given me the environment to thrive and be more successful than with any other company I have worked for.  I also feel there is opportunity to grow my career and even transition into other departments and learn a whole new skill set.  I have seen this happen for many people at Box.",People must have a four year degree to work at Box.  I do not believe that should be a requirement.

Make no mistake, the large deals are well on their way and everyone in every industry will be on board.","It's no longer a startup, and the corporate culture reflects that.

556,Box,Musical chairs,2016-08-18,1.0,,"The product when it works.
Looks good on the CV when looking for other jobs
Free food and snacks (not sure this will last forever)","Atmosphere:

You could see the clear decline in morale and general feel of the office since the IPO back in Jan 2015. Yes, we are a public company, we need to be great and achieve greatness...but at what costs?
Some employees lived it well, doing their awesome job like always. Some are useless obnoxious pretentious childish slackers without substance colliding together to make the employees who actually deliver miserable.
During 1-1 or team meetings, company surveys, whenever you would have this type of feedback (“Lot of things are going on, this is how we could fix it”, ""my manager does not want to listen about what is really happening"" or worst, ""my manager is reading the news and chatting all day being no help"", ""there is one employee who is definitely playing all of you when not coming into work”, etc…), no reaction. At all. Even better, managers do not have your back, they will take sides with the slackers.
There are way too many middle managers who seem to get off micro managing, dare I say, tiny dictators.

Then 15+ employees were fired in February 2016 (the wrong ones for 70% of them). They all woke up one morning, as usual, going to work and see their friends/colleagues. All of them were invited into an impromptu meeting early in the morning to be told they were fired then escorted out of the building. And yes, all their belongings stayed in the office, they had to book appointments to take them back. That was a nice touch.
After this, all of us ""safe employees"" attended an All Hands meeting for an update. Summary: you are safe now, it was a tough decision, do good work now, you might be next.

Internal mobility:

This is a fun one. Internal mobility is praised across all offices, you need to find out your next move. What's your next move blah blah because INTERNAL MOBILITY. Word of advice, be ready to kiss butt  (literally and figuratively) and remove any inch of principles/values/conscience you may have. It will never be based on merit, forget that (who rewards employees doing hard work, integrating well, causing no fuss and showing signs of maturity and leadership nowadays anyway?) 

It will be based on how much butt kissing you have done, that's all, you do not need experience.


Hiring:

Quality of hiring is hit or miss.
Amazing employees were hired, I consider them my friends and it is a blast to work with them and learn from them.
Useless employees were hired by useless managers.
The amazing employees stay a little bit over a year then leave as soon as they can.
The useless employees stay and thrive together.

Overall:

I have seen high performing colleagues who became my friends, leave one by one since I started working at Box. They are happy now as they do not have to deal with this nonsense anymore. I also know most of the remaining ones are either thinking about leaving in the coming months or already actively interviewing at other companies. 

Myself, I'm still here, taking my time to find a better position elsewhere and not leave for the sake of leaving even if most days, I wake up and just tell myself to quit on the spot, it will be fine.

General consensus is dealing with childish, rude, unprofessional, inexperienced micro managers is not what we want in life so we are finding solutions on our own since upper management does not care. We have all been screwed at one point since we joined.

Thanks for the “start-up” experience Box, we'll try to be valued somewhere else, good luck with your future endeavours."

Benefits package is top notch, even for remote folks like myself.  I may miss out on the awesome lunches at HQ, but I make up for it in work / life balance.  My healthcare costs are now a fraction of what I’ve historically payed at other firms.  I find not having to count vacation or sick hours to be a boon.  My direct manager and I set a great open channel of communication from day one so I have no concerns about asking for time and being told no, or I’m “over the limit”.  

Box is really easy to use and helps both my personal and professional lives!","As a company, it is easy for the company to work in silos.  There is a lot of talent across the organization and it isn’t necessarily easy to get access to it being remote.  I have encountered this challenged everywhere I have worked remotely, but Box does have tools and processes in place to mitigate this.  For example, we have multiple communication channels to ask for assistance (above and beyond the obvious talk to your manager).  

Communication from the C-level is common, detailed and highly energetic, but I would love to see more of it.  Like I said earlier, working at Box can have that infectious in a fantastic way about it.  More in this case is better!"

The team on the east, that I was a part of, is very strong - - multiple salespeople who are making 500K + every year or more.

Not open to new or fresh ideas from the outside
Benefits.  Yes, free meals are nice but there are no real benefits such as a matching 401K.  Benefits are only given to employees that work at Box HQ.  If you are remote, forget about it.
Leadership.  There simply is none.
Box is spending a lot of money (marketing) trying to make the company look like it's a great place to work.  There has been a mass exodus over the last year due to the fact that it is simply not a fun place to work.  Yes, the stock is a dog but that's not why employees are leaving.  Employees simply don't get treated fairly as their management has not done the job before, thus, don't know how to manage effectively.
Aaron Levie is a plus for Box but he is not a CEO.  He needs to be put into another role within the company and a true CEO should be hired that can make the company profitable and help it be seen beyond just a circus show."

-Over half of your commission that you are paid and evaluated on is completely out of your control, your success and pay depends solely on which rep you support.

No support was offered to staff and certain members of staff had to book an appointment to collect the remainder of their belongings. 

A lot of the staff were left disgruntled and confused as no prior notice was given, people were made redundant with immediate effect. The HR team seemed rather insensitive about the entire process, which is quite shocking as it was carried out by the most senior member of staff in HR.

Boxers are paid at least 30% under market value - and guess what, a recruiter admitted that to me!!! They over saturate the sales teams and cut territories. If you're in the field you're forgotten. The company is trying too hard to focus on being a platform vs still trying to break into the company and territories that aren't cloud friendly.

They try to imitate Google's promotion scheme but don't have the right people on the committees.  End result is that people with good social and self marketing skills get promoted while people who get stuff done gets fed up, become less productive and then leave.

At the time, I was looking at Salesforce, Google, and several other tech companies, but Box stood out from the beginning because of the culture, training, and opportunity for success.  They hired me as an Outbound Business Representative and they offered me a 2-week training course right off the bat, which quickly got me acclimated to the solution and how to sell it.  Furthermore, they offer on-going training that allows you to stay up to date with what's new with Box, and consistent email communication as well.

Soon enough, I was promoted to more of a direct sales role on a vertical team, Inside Sales Representative for Higher Education, where again, I was coached and mentored very closely.  After a year in that role, I was promoted again to Account Executive for Higher Education.

Overall, Box has trained, challenged, and rewarded me for my hard work, which is something I love to see in a company.  I believe in the culture, the solution, and the future roadmap, and can't wait to move to Redwood City, where I'm sure they will continue to keep us Boxers happy.","As a public company, Box has changed quite a bit since I started.

These were a head above existing middle managers. Respect for leadership dwindled, and upper management reacted by promoting the managers who have lost backing of their more senior reports up the corporate ladder, away from dealing with actual project and developers where they are doing even more damage."
618,Box,Used to be better,2015-10-12,2.0,,"Good compensation
Good benefits
Good office (getting overcrowded though)","Lost its charm completely, talking about the London office.

Unless you are close friend with, a boyfriend/girlfriend of, family or get extremely drunk at some point with the management team, no chance for you to develop, get constructive feedback or get promoted.

Basically, nepotism at its highest.

Of course, it does not matter if you perform, the opposite. If you are a high performer, you don't overdo it at parties, or dare to overachieve, you will be turned down. What will matter is if you drink enough and who you are chum with.

People come and go, because yes, good compensation and benefits but witnessing this ""let's bring up even more middle managers to complicate process"" disappointed many. Do note they will not care if you are unhappy about the situation, better to replace with nodding drones.

When groups are formed and you happen to not be someone's BFF, the managers will practically ignore you or worse without context or facts, their friends' words are the wisest.

If you want to join this office, just remember your high school days and if you feel like reliving them, you will be fine."

There was little to no training and the quota was completely ambiguous. Meanwhile, you're being told if you work hard there is endless room for growth in Austin and in your sales career at Box; this was also false. There is literally no where to go but out. As I said above, your coworkers are amazing people, Box really does know how to hire. They do not, however, know how to hire/promote good managers and that is why this team is failing.

Levin delegates down and manages up. Others have been there too long (grandfathered in despite their incompetency) or simply are playing politics as the company grows. None of the senior exec staff took responsibility for mistakes in timing and content on the S-1, rather focus on firing under the table and trimming, which is not a good sign long-term.

It's very frowned upon to say ""Hey- you're doing this wrong"".  If you're trying to do something brand new- the sky's the limit.  But if you're trying to change an existing system or practice, it can be very challenging to do so while tip-toeing around everyone's feelings.  In some ways- it's great to be in a place that's so positive.  In some ways it's paralyzing.

708,Box,A place to both grow your skills and leave an impact,2013-10-25,5.0,Software Engineer,"At Box you never find a shortage of things to work on. You can continue to grow your skills and expertise by tackling new and different problems more than you can at most other places. In addition, the people you work with are some of the best and from a wide variety of backgrounds. This means you even learn by listening.

And since Box is still a young company with problems and situations that are still unsolved, you can use the skills you learned here or elsewhere and leave a mark on the company. Something you work on will very likely be lying the foundation for future engineers and users. It's up to you to leverage that.

The compensation is pretty darn competitive for the area.","The compensation could be higher and internal mobility isn't exactly where it needs to be (they are working on it to their credit). And sometimes the opportunities you get means that you will be working some late hours. I've made it a goal to at least leave when there's sunlight at least twice a week. And as expected with a startup mentality, there's a bit of engineers being oncall which can sometimes lead to annoying weekends."

Box's Women's Network has strong executive support, and it's awesome to see such a strong female voice in a tech company. 

Mentors are readily found outside of the immediate team.

- If you are early in your career,  and know that your growth is going to be limited at a place that is struggling to get to IPO, and are okay with it, go for it!
- Post IPO there will probably be a more grounded corporate identity, rather than the half startup half corporate approach at the moment
- Scaling elegantly is hard no doubt, after all we have all heard of technical debt amongst other things","- BoxWorks had Malcolm Gladwell (!!!!) as a keynote speaker talking on disruptive innovation and changing a mindset..however...
- He was welcomed onstage by a highly inappropriate Ellie Goulding track
- Unfortunately nobody at Box seemed to have paid any attention to the crux of what he was saying- a change in mindset is what's needed, innovation powered by radical thinking
- Not a lot of the complacent attitude that is floating around
- Box does hire smart, but only in limiting hires to Stanford and Berkley. Unfortunately, a lot of the radical thinkers (a particular Mr. Jobs) didn't finish university
- Inexperienced recruiters pushed me and three of my peers into the customer success team- the only team that has it together across the company
- Junior recruiters, so they are limited in placing you at a team that makes the most of your skill set, or are unable to place you as the team you would be an asset to does not exist
- As a consequence, there are a lot of incompetencies, and talent that is so underutilized and stifled by the constant upheaval, that they have to schedule at least 50 meetings a day to get people to acknowledge work needs to be done
- And then chase them around to get the work done (as simple as getting the EA's to book a room, get you equipment that they are responsible for)
- A lot of the why should I do it, its not my problem mentality

Great senior leadership -- the executive staff is a bunch of rockstars","Middle management is inexperienced. And not very good. Which means that unless you are middle management or super senior, you are out of luck. 

Also, there are clear cliques that get all the attention and opportunities. I guess these are all pains of scaling fast, but Box hasn't learnt from all the other companies that have gone through that."
715,Box,Amazing company period.,2013-08-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Some of the best & brightest people I've ever met. Management cares about its people from the top down.,"Food is getting worse over time (but still not bad, and still free)."

Great social aspect +benefits","Middle management not set up (critical- you can't really go to the VP to ask 'what should I be when I grow up')
Great if you are early on in your career
Not so great if you need direction or career advice
Messy divide between a startup and a large hierarchical organization
Messy internal movement processes"

718,Box,Engineers Beware...Don't Work Here,2013-03-26,1.0,Software Engineer,"Free""ish"" food.  Most people are helpful and nice.  They pay pretty well.  This is an acceptable place to work if you are young and inexperienced.  Lots of opportunity to fix bugs.  Lots of opportunity to make the code stable.","Box hires rather than promotes from within.  Technology stack is on the verge of collapse.  The engineering team is consumed with firefighting.  The pay is not worth the poor (sometimes degrading) treatment by management and technical leadership.  My manager talks about their reports and coworkers behind their backs.  The founders have to be ""handled,"" because they are incapable of accepting input from others."
719,Box,Ok company to work for,2013-03-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not much to brag about,Benefits are horrible. Only a select few get rewarded.

Charismatic CEO gets attention and buzz for the company.
New VP of Engineering bringing maturity and leadership to engineering organization.","If you're industry experienced (not ""senior"" as that's 1-2 yr out of college at Box) expect to be working almost entirely with inexperienced/young engineers.  Most are great to work with and want to learn however in general the culture does not value experience; be prepared to see lots of questionable judgement/competence demonstrated by the homegrown tenured developers leading projects.
Engineering caliber and quality of people is below Google / Microsoft levels.  Surprising number of ""seniors"" lacking CS fundamentals (OO design, what's cohesion? using assertions?)  Some B's hiring C's going on (... will hopefully improve as Box adopts more google like model in hiring, reviews, etc.)
Lots of untested legacy code, 10,000 line functions, tightly coupled and fragile code is common place.  Major efforts to write tests and turn quality around but very much work in progress."

It must be people who expected to come in and be respected for not contributing anything. One thing is for sure, Box hires the best, and they expect the best. Now that we are pushing 450+, it is harder and harder to stand out but there are so many motivational factors to put in 110%. We have a lot of VP's, and they are all the brightest most down to earth people I have ever worked with. It is open seating, there are no offices, no cubicles.

It gets overwhelming sometimes, but you know that everyday won't be the same. Scalable processes still haven't been put into place, but it is up to us to come up with those processes and implement them. Also career track isn't quite established in the sales group, but this could be a good thing for some.

-Beautiful and young crowd, average age here would be 25-26.
-Laptop to everyone.","-You will find yourself working 12X7 or 16X5 i.e. >80 hours week. I think it is ok even if you work hard couple of days in a week but working hard all time without any appreciation is not cool. It is almost as if working long hours is made an expectation out of everyone.
-Extremely tight market with a new cloud storage company opening up almost every week. My bet is that it is going to be race to reduce the price till one day some giant will come and start giving unlimited cloud storage for free and shut down business of box, dropbox, etc. etc. It is very risky to join a company like box in a dicey industry.
-Money is burnt on billboards and campaigns which is unusual for a private funded startup and really whacky for my senses.
-New office in Los Altos will not be close to public transportation making difficult for people using Caltrain to commute."
