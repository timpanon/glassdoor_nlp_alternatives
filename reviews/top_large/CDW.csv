They present a culture of diversity and a lot of people help keep it alive. They also promote a culture of sharing knowledge and recognition of our peers through award nominations. 

Supervisors in my department are great people who are all mindful that we're all unique persons with different strengths and weaknesses. Management is still considerate of its employees a couple levels beyond direct supervisors.

There are always opportunities for lateral and upward movement in the company.","I've worked here for 18 months, received multiple awards and been recognized directly by leadership, but have not seen a single raise. Even a small raise to protect our livelihood during inflation would be nice.

Negative revenue from projects directly impacts our bonuses, whether you work 40 hours a week or 80 hours a week. It feels like extra effort can be very easily negated by a costly decision higher up in leadership."

24,CDW,"If it’s good, it’s great. If it’s bad, get out.",2022-03-23,2.0,Account Representative,"CDW as a corporation is great employer. Selling there, you do ethical work you can be proud of (which isn’t always true for sales careers), and corporate treats their employees well. Although, that is all succumbent on the people you work with also being great.

Best outcome: you have a good boss and a good book of business. It’s a fun job that still has its challenges to keep things interesting. You develop relationships with your customers and over time can start making hand over fist while often simultaneously doing less work - both in levels of hours and frustration.","CDW has a very high turnover rate with new sales reps, but also a very large number of employees who spend their entire working career with the company. This is because it is a very sink or swim environment. And unfortunately, sinking at cdw often is not at the fault of the one sinking.

Worst outcome: you have a bad boss and a bad book of business. It’s a tiresome and incredibly frustrating job. You put in loads of work and see next to no reward. If your customers have no money, you can’t sell what they can’t spend. If you have a bad boss on top of that, they will not care to give you better accounts and you’re stuck in a rut where you have to work twice as hard just to stay afloat. It does not help when the leadership system is heavily based on publicizing sales numbers, putting you to shame day after day. On your first day, you might hear what is said fairly frequently at cdw “it’s either the easiest 6 figure job in the world, or the hardest 30k job in the world”. That statement is incredibly accurate."

Expected to buy in yo culture and wait 1.5-2 years to see any kind of decent money. HR and management hypocritically preach about care for employees but really you are just a $$$ symbol to them.

60,CDW,Good company,2022-03-01,4.0,Principal Solution Architect,The company pays well and has good benefits overall.,"If I had to come up with some shortcomings I would say that they could improve their vacation policy, which starts at 2 weeks for everybody. Expect to be busy, since they tend to staff on the lean side, but not so busy that you're working after hours too often. Also the turnover in mid-level leadership is frequent so priorities often change, but I suppose that isn't so different from other big companies."

74,CDW,"Better than most Pro services firms, but quickly slipping away",2022-02-22,3.0,Senior Consulting Engineer,"Enforcing work/life boundaries is not frowned upon
Good base pay / regular pay increases
Employee retention is high; Experienced engineers in every silo as a result
High autonomy in my role","-Poor bonus structure for engineers which was changed prior to COVID, has resulted in large swaths of billable resources not able to hit bonus which was usually a given, resulting in ~25% loss of wages for most engineers; Management has indicated this will not change short-term and so competitive compensation at CDW has slipped dramatically 

Poor stock options - After being here 10+ years I have only ever received stock grants that are less than a single paycheck and vest after 3 years; Yet company has money to make billion-dollar acquisitions on the regular. 

Disconnect between upper management and teams - Upper management has a lot of good ideas, but these ideas and changes are made with no real world input from engineering, or players at the team/individual contributor level, resulting in poor execution of good-on-paper-only ideas

Horrible lower management: Managers routinely act in ways that make most question how they got the role. One manager in particular went AWOL for over a year and came back with zero knowledge on how to perform their role/was not replaced by management. Resulting team went from one of the highest grossing teams year over year in the company to one of the worst, with little to no care expressed by upper management.

-High retention also leads to a significant amount of ageism between younger coworkers and older employees who have been around for 15+ years. Many of the experienced engineers are on autopilot/not open to change and the apathy is real. Young engineers are routinely shut down when making positive suggestions ""because this is the way we have always done it"".

-Sales driven company: Sales can do no wrong, and often sell things that don't exist or make huge omissions in project scoping. Engineering is expected to deal with it and clean up the mess, causing engineers to perform pre-sales work not in their job description on a regular basis. Any attempt to mend the process or attempt at bringing attention to glaring omissions is frowned upon.

-Low mobility opportunities: Changing teams is often pre-determined / given to favorites without opening positions to the general population of engineers."

- typical metrics-driven sales job, managers only care about how many outbound calls you can make
- limited internal opportunities, CDW stresses that they love to promote from within, which they do, but it's difficult to get into management positions still
- lots of bureaucracy, very difficult to accomplish anything, which results in angry customers

There are not many cons to this company because they really do care about their customers and employees however they tend to have a herd mentality for company titles that can make it a challenge still with vertical movement and opportunity. There has been a noticeable diminishing of incentives for business side to outperform past goal. They do collect your ideas, they do listen, but some those may be implemented without you and to the benefit to who is going to champion the idea. Even though you may be performing at a higher skill level, you are advised to seek elsewhere within CDW or elsewhere period, if there is not a vertical position open to accommodate your skill level. Hence salaries are not as competitive since they have the ability to tamper down salaries by lack of open positions and/or titles availability."

The sales teams are a good to get along with","My short time at CDW UK (within solutions) was such a bizarre and unexpected experience. 

Before joining (I was head hunted directly by senior management) I considered myself to be a well respected leader & influencer in my field. By the time I handed in my resignation, I felt the opposite - depressed, frustrated and anxious, with low self-esteem. I was lacking in confidence and I started to feel de-skilled and less relevant.

A few things I wish I had known before joining:

- Solutions at CDW is now just another sales team overlay, it wasn't the community of thriving technologists that I was lead to believe it was. A difficult to use, poorly adopted CRM platform is the primary measuring stick. As a solutions architect, you're measured on your CRM contribution, you could be Elon Musk, but if CRM says you are crap, then you are crap, and you will feel crap.

- It isn't very diverse (mostly white males).

- You're consistently measured against well established product supply driven solutions practices such as hybrid infrastructure (big hardware BOM's for customers) and Workspace (big Office 365 sales, very basic integration on the back of desktop & iPad sales etc). For someone that was meant to be innovating and iterating on a new line of tech, this was distracting, stressful, and over time it became depressing.

- Solutions had already mothballed a number of other new tech incubations. If I had known this was due to the same issues I had faced, I would have turned down the opportunity to join.

- The business as a whole is very vocal about promoting good mental health which is very encouraging but in practice it is very rarely followed. The solutions leadership teams will respond to e-mails late in the evening and in the early hours of the morning and promote stories of coworkers giving up their personal time to 'get this one over the line'.

- Practice leads are toxic about other solutions teams and the architects within them. Team meetings include a significant amount of toxic humour, personally I couldn't wait to get that out of my system.

- Nearly all of the most talented technologists have either left the company, moved out of solutions or are planning on leaving.

Generally speaking, I did get on very well with most of the other solutions architects (and sales in general). CDW is sales company, as long as you know that before joining you will probably enjoy it more than I did. If you go in there and try and get support on the adoption and sale of anything that doesn't related to product supply, then you're doomed to failure. If you are aligned to product supply, then you'll thrive.

I am grateful for the experience but I would never go back."

I have lost two friends to COVID that worked at other locations that caught it at their work. If you are scared to work at your companies and want a safe place to work, come to CDW. The safety director was out here a couple of days ago to speak to us and we were appreciating him doing that. He showed he gave a damn about us. CWS ladies here are also good and easy to talk to. Some of the contractors that are here are not great so we need to do a better job picking who works here.",We changed our safety procedures a little in the fall and got rid of masks and spacing but luckily we quickly returned to using them. We heard our operations managers wanted to make it easier for them and asked for those changes but that safety security and some exec people made them put everything back. I was glad we moved back to masks because we want to stay safe and many of us thought it was stupid to change it. We used to have safety belts that could tell when we were too close and we don't have those gizmos any more and I wish we did. Those made us very comfortable and now we are working too close. I have my vaccine but some of my friends and family are getting sick even though they had the vaccine so we should stay away from each other to make sure it doesnt happen here. Lets make it all like it was before please. I am not the only person that believes this but we don't want to tell anyone and speak against our operations supervisors and managers. I have a friend that works in the configs place and they agree with us and said they need it more because they are very close.

210,CDW,Amazing organization with great direction and opportunities to grow,2021-11-03,5.0,Sales,"Terrific culture filled with leaders who care from top to bottom.
So many areas / departments that are growing and expanding. If you start in sales and have ~3 years of success, doors are wide open for you to move to management, other departments, other roles, etc.
Stock price continues to rise, lots of acquisitions are made to provide more services to offer our customers, and we have great communication.
Investing in new tools for us internally such as Salesforce, Kronologic, Zoominfo, etc.
Opportunity to make great money, might take a little time but the payoff is there.
Many Coworkers around me have been here 10+ years, a bunch now 20+ years... all while welcoming in outside talent and newly graduated talent. Truly a great mix.
Very focused on DEI.
Strong culture filled with many hard worked who get things done.","Nothing unique to CDW is a ""con"". In sales it takes hard work and dedication... but then you can be very well compensated over time.
No more ""rules"" or ""politics"" than any other large company... I would argue that type of stuff is fairly small at CDW vs. other Fortune 500 companies. We still refer to all our Coworkers form our CEO on down by their first name."

226,CDW,A Great Company to Dedicate Your Career to!,2021-10-11,5.0,Solution Specialist,"The company truly values its employees and works hard to show it in a broad range of ways-including through bonuses and compensation. An overwhelming majority of employees have long tenures-because of career continuity and job satisfaction coupled with solid health, 401k, and many other employee perks and benefits. Many employees who left to work directly for partner tech companies at triple their CDW salary came back after a short while-realizing they missed the culture and stability even at a lower salary. CDW calls these employees ""boomerangs"" and there are a great many who tested the waters elsewhere and returned. Employees are very respectful of each other and genuinely always happy to help answer the many questions a new employee will undoubtedly have. Career growth is great at CDW as you don't get trapped in a role because you are awesome at it-you can continue to grow and move internally every 1 to 2 years easily if you want to. Even though salaries are lower than most tech companies-the culture and stability mostly make up for that-CDW tries to keep people employed even when eliminating roles by finding another spot for you internally. A very low % of people have been laid off for a company with over 10K employees. Now there are many more opportunities to work 100% remotely--a direct result of the pandemic.","No company is perfect, and there is always room for improvement. CDW is a large company and though it encourages evolution and process improvement and executives solicit feedback on what works and what doesn't-change doesn't come quickly. Some structural issues create disincentives to do certain types of work because of how bonuses are awarded which makes some roles more challenging than others. Compensation is lower than most tech companies and could use improvement."

- Co-workers and Residency managers are laid-back and easy to work with - the best part about my time there was probably my Sales class.","- This company has a few fundamental problems - it lacks professional people who do their jobs efficiently. There were several communication breakdowns I experienced -- it was easy for me to connect with customers and get them to put in orders, but getting those orders to them was almost always a nightmare. 
- You almost always have to communicate with several internal stakeholders (product specialists, purchasing, bid desks, BD etc.), and these teams are all highly inefficient and unprofessional. It takes ages to get them to answer emails and you cannot move forward with the sale without key information from them, which makes the customer agitated and makes you, being client-facing, take accountability for their mistakes. I once lost a huge sale because of the purchasing department's mistake, and my manager literally told me to lie to the customer and say I got their information down wrong. So not only does all your hard work go into the dump, but so does your self-respect. They gaslight and guilt-trip you. People who rise to the top are brainwashed enough to think they can't do better at an actual reputable organization. Some 
- Embarrassingly low base salary and commission - half the people who were a part of my cohort quit within the first 6 months. The job is a nightmare and you don't get compensated for how much you have to deal with by default. People who stay with them are usually older ones trying to restart/switch their careers, or college drop-outs who are desperate and willing to work 16 hour days and lose their self-respect to make some cash. Young and bright talent from top schools in the country usually recognize their worth within a few months and will get better opportunities with higher pay.

Most new hires figure out compensation is substandard and long term benefits and lack of pension and lack of stock awards don't exist. Executive management has no issue dipping their toe into the Sales pool and taking money from Account Managers. SPIF's which were big part of an Account Managers compensation have been eliminated. Account Managers generally last 16-20 months and realize the futility of a long term sales career before leaving.

In Canada you will be working for 32.5k base, unlimited commission. However you will have little to no support from your managers in making sales.

50% of the 18 sales reps hired at the same time as me ended up quitting within 6 months and 90%  leaving within 2 years. 

The academy or training managers would tap your desk to encourage you to make cold calls and even force the headset onto your head or shake your chair.

They often take you into 1:1s during training where they tell new employees they ""will not make it"" unless they work overtime for no pay.

The hours are 8am to 5pm but you will be asked why you are leaving at 5pm during training. 
In Canada you must swipe in everyday at 8am and ensure you are not late, there is no honor system. Your lunch hour is taken by vendor lunch and learns, where you listen to endless sales pitches from vendors who pay CDW to be there and take up your lunch hour.

I highly recommend you avoid this company unless you need 1 to 1.5 years of experience before moving on."

The work for the negotiations team is always interesting, and for the most part the people are great.","In a little over two years, the team I was part of turned over twice, and 2021 has seen a mass exodus of people in program sales at large, but most especially on the Negotiations team. Job has an extremely steep learning curve, but there's virtually no one left to train you (other than management, there's no one left with more than a year working on public contracts). Broken down vetting processes and a lack of SLAs ensures conflict between negotiators - who are dealing with unsustainable workloads - and the internal stakeholders who rely on that work being done timely. Department as a whole operates reactively, which leaves the team constantly scrambling. Enablement initiatives and process improvement efforts either get abandoned because no one has time or actively make things worse (like the new CMS: no one asked for it, it's barely functional, there was barely any training or communication about when it would go live, it requires substantially more data entry and triples the time it takes to perform simple tasks, and it's only actually useful for about half of everything that comes across your desk). 

While it seems like management is finally making strides towards fixing the substantially below market pay, it might be too little too late (imagine if some of that had gone towards retaining folks with some level of institutional knowledge). For the sake of the people still there, I hope they manage to turn things around. Maybe the benefit of losing all your institutional knowledge is losing all your institutional bad juju. It's still not a position I'd recommend to anyone anytime soon."

404,CDW,Don't believe the hype,2021-05-14,1.0,Engineer,The nicest thing I can say is that it's a job.,"Sexual harassment issues, old boys club, long hours, horrible pay, bottom of the barrel benefits, empty promises, outdated practices, failure to deliver, huge lack of employee resources.

After working in the Managed Services department for a decade, I can tell you that this place is run horribly. 

We were often expected to work 50+ hours with no compensation. 

The worst people somehow get promoted to management, and even openly brag about how many times they've been reported to HR. One manager (who is married and has kids) would ""joke"" about how he'd do favors for female employees if they dated him. 

There is a strong inner circle that gets promoted more often, and refusal to participate completely eliminates your chances at advancing. 

One employee made racist remarks at another, and when it was reported, the victim was punished and the harasser was promoted to a manager. Another time an employee made a racist joke, and when I reported them, I was told to ""stop picking on him."" 

I was paid well under market value for my position, and when I asked if I could be compensated fairly (new hires made twice as much), I was told by my boss to ""get used to eating peanut butter sandwiches"" to save money.

The health benefits are expensive and cover almost nothing. One year I had to pay the maximum out of pocket ($15,000) because none of it was covered even though the provider was in network. They do an employee survey every year, and one of the consistently most reported problems is benefits, but they do nothing to change them. 

I was once kept in limbo of being promised a promotion, but they would constantly tell me ""it's not in the budget,"" then spend stupid money on new chairs, or bigger TVs in my office.

We would often joke that CDW shouldn't have customers because of their complete inability to deliver on anything. The NOC in Managed Services gets an absurd amount of tickets, and instead of focusing on ticket reduction (most of them are meaningless noise), they keep adding on. They also introduce new services that do nothing, but cost money for some reason. They don't sufficiently staff any team, so everyone is spread so thin that you're constantly overworked, and you're treated like garbage if you have a problem with it.

They constantly tout their diversity and inclusion, but women and minorities are treated like crap here, to the extent that it can be an aggressive environment. They once received a report of rampant sexual harassment by managers, and instead of punishing them, they held a series of meetings to listen to the problems women had, and then did nothing with them. But that's CDW, appear to care, but never do anything to prove it. 

I could go on and on about this, but I will summarize everything by saying ""never work here."" I say that as someone who was promoted many times, and was overall treated better than most people."
405,CDW,use CDW as free education....then leave,2021-05-13,3.0,Solutions Architect,"Great training, free education, opportunity to travel",Lowest paying technical position in the country by far. 10 days vacation is a little cheap
406,CDW,Harsh treatment from all levels of management,2021-05-13,2.0,Account Manager,Very little to take from there,Terrible management and unfair treatment
407,CDW,Finally found a company I want to stay with for the rest of my career,2021-05-13,5.0,Manager,"*Very pro co-worker (employee) atmosphere. Most co-workers are very collaborative and want to help you. Since this company is based in the midwest- you generally work with wholesome nice ""salt of the earth ""people. Outside of sales, they aren't cut throat and try to take care of their people.
*COVID Response- the company had all of the employees that could work remotely work remotely, we have a configuration center that was an essential operation, if there were any issues, they had the whole center professionally sanitized to keep the config center workers safe. Our health and safety has always been #1. Unlike other companies, CDW hasn't rushed us back into the office- they have being taking surveys, seeing what people are comfortable with and are cautiously going forward. I'm glad they aren't pushing people to get back into the office ASAP- they been very understanding and been very respectful of employees privacy and wishes. 
* Fertility Benefits just got upgraded BIG time- CDW in 2021 has partnered with Progyny for fertility benefits. You can get 3-4 cycles of IVF, Egg Transfer, along genetic testing covered. This is offered to all employees including LBTQ+ couples and single people who want to start a family on their own. Also they will pay for 3-4 rounds of Elective Egg Freezing which is outstanding if you are an unpartnered female. Having friends who are in deep debt because of lack of IVF coverage with their work, this is huge if you are looking at starting a family.
* A company will never be your family and I dislike when companies compare themselves to that. That being said, CDW is the company that has gotten me closest to that ""feeling"". Everyone here is really nice and I feel very supported here. Other companies I feel like I could get fired at any moment and not know why or because I wasn't part of the ""in crowd"". Outside of sales (they are performance based), if there is an issue, they will have you work with your manager to level set expectations and try to met those goals. There's no surprises when it comes to my performance and I feel much more secure here than any other job I have had.
*Annual Increase- If you have a good rating, CDW usually does a merit increase each year. This is amazing because at least your salary increases each year 
 which helps a lot with inflation. Not many companies do this at all and every year you have to ""fight"" for more money. I'm so glad I don't have to do this anymore and can get a merit increase for being great at my job. When my rent goes higher I don't freak out as my merit increase will cover it and I can maintain my lifestyle.","* Too many, tools process and admin work- 60-70% my job is dealing with discrepancies, pushing orders through, making exceptions etc. CDW makes it work but processes are very complex and it takes years to learn all the nuances of everything. I'm still not sure how everything exactly works and I can thankfully lean on others to help me if I don't know something.
* CDW needs to work in it's diversity. They done an awesome job of promoting white women into their senior leadership and C-suite roles. They need to start promoting people of color and women of color into management and senior leadership positions- that *aren't* D&I/HR roles. I will say as a person of color- this is the most supportive and comfortable working environment I've been. I have no plans on leaving, I know CDW and Chris Leahy are actively working on changing this and I look forward to seeing what they do to change this.
*401k/ESPP- could be much better, not competitive with what other tech companies offer."

CDW Strives to do and be better - CDW is constantly innovating, acquiring companies to broaden and improve their offerings, being introspective about new capabilities, and encouraging employees to achieve goals that further the company's mission.","Hard-working culture - Work/life balance can suffer at the expense of serving its customers

- Promotion for demonstrated performance and potential (I've been in the company less than two years and promoted twice)

They care about coworker success and not only do they encourage coworker feedback they actually listen. There have been several MAJOR changes including acquisitions that came from coworker feedback/suggestions. It's an awesome company.,The only thing I can think of is that CDW needs to do a better job of building culture with remote teams.

They lie, contradict each other, show no appreciation, and give really low raises.  Very high turnover and there is currently a mass exodus of long term employees who are tired of not getting promoted, not being appreciated and being given unmanageable workloads.  Management seems like a bunch of robots, trained to use the same sound bites.  They constantly tell us how every situation can be turned into a positive; they promise change but do not deliver.  It’s a highly dysfunctional environment.  The Sales team is rude, demanding, impatient and treats sales support very poorly.  I am pretty sure CDW pays people to write “good” reviews because I don’t know anyone who is happy working there.  Cheap company, silos their employees, poor internal communication and management will lie to your face.  It’s amazing how much money they must spend in onboarding as most employees leave within several years due to low raises and getting passed up for promotion.  Horrible place to work."

481,CDW,First job out of college,2021-04-06,3.0,Account Representative,Training and experiences are very valuable when applying to external roles.,Base pay is low and commission sharing is pitiful. Get your 1-3 years of IT sales experience and get out. That's what a majority of the reps do anyways.

Pay could be a bit better"
487,CDW,Good Place to Learn the IT Industry and Grow Your Skills that Can Also Limit Career Opportunities,2021-04-01,3.0,Senior Brand Manager,"If you have not worked in the IT Industry before CDW is a great training ground, and the PPM department is a great place to get cross-functional experience across multiple departments in the company inclusive of sales, procurement, finance, and marketing. This experience is invaluable in understanding the interconnectivity of the departments, and how they can be leveraged to differentiate your brand or product.

Overall employees vested in your success and the success of the company. A lot of people really love CDW and that feeling can be contagious. There are a lot of company outings and activities (pre-COVID) with many genuine friendships developed over time.

There are many education and training opportunities. Partnerships with colleges such as CLC and DePaul enabled several employees to earn advanced degrees. Lean Six Sigma trainings occur regularly. Linkedin Learning encouragement. Most anyone is willing to help you pick up a new skill so if you don't have a ton of experience you can get it pretty quickly.

When the company says family first they do mean it. I never had an issue leaving for a doctor appointment, injured dog, or working from home last minute because kids were sick. Much of the PPM team has kids so there is a mutual understanding and respect for this. If you have young kids this is a really good department to be in.

You will work with some of the top technology brands in the world. By understanding how those organizations work and interact with different channels you get a better understanding of the industry in aggregate and not just where CDW plays.

Recent leadership changes in the department bode well for the future. They are hiring strategic leaders with the necessary experience to make meaningful change to better leverage resources.","Pay is significantly below other types of positions in the IT industry (At least 25% less). It is repeatedly highlighted in company surveys and the line is they understand, but believe their total benefits outweigh the salary. The challenge with this line is my wife's insurance was less at 3 separate companies. Maternity/Paternity Leave is far less generous (2 weeks for dads up from just 3 days 2 years ago for example compared to several months). You do not get days off like MLK Day, day after Thanksgiving, etc... that other companies have off and/or schools are closed meaning you have to dip into PTO to accommodate these days. 

Job titles in partner and product management make it hard to leave. Brand Managers and Senior Brand Managers should be called ""Partner Managers"" because the responsibility is working with the assigned partner to grow the business. Brand Managers in other industries are responsible for the P&L for their assigned lines inclusive of manufacturing, supply chain, promotions, etc... P&L ownership does not occur until you reach Category Manager. Your job title responsibilities will not line up with other companies with similar titles decreasing your mobility to other companies and industries in the long term.

Another challenge is you can be blocked from moving to companies in the same industry. Moving to a manufacturer is possible, but approval is often required and more often than not is denied. While PPM leadership will say they have no problem with you leaving to a manufacturer (several have worked there themselves) when push comes to shove they make sure external opportunities are limited.

If you are looking for a career that is marketing focused, PPM is not the best department to be in. A large portion of the department are former sales people who transitioned over making it feel more like a sales organization than partner and product marketing. Marketing is a separate department and PPM roles are responsible for getting partners to invest more heavily in marketing. Marketing is pre-packaged and often leans more towards velocity products like laptops/monitors instead of solutions based products that have longer sales cycles. Regardless of how effective the marketing is you are responsible for selling it to partners.

As CDW has grown the flexibility of PPM roles to influence their business has decreased. 2 years ago you had ability to invest funds however you wanted to grow the business within reason. Today all activities are heavily regulated and scrutinized making marketing and events very cookie-cutter.

Your success in PPM greatly depends on your manager and department. The onboarding process for sales is highly structured, but PPM is hodge podge. With a good manager this can be overcome, otherwise you can easily get lost in the shuffle at the start."

- Commission scales with achievement and tenure
- High earning potential

- The start of this job is like chewing glass everyday for two years.

This job will probably take over your life. 
- Unrealistic expectations, your targets scale each month based on your growth and previous years earning with that account. If that account made a huge purchase last year but buys nothing this year, good chance you won't make target (some commission clips are based on achieving target instead of gross profit percentage)
- Benefits are pretty average.
- Start at 8:00am, unpaid lunch. 
- They schedule constant trainings that clog up your precious time to reply to customer requests/call blocks (lots of them are super useless)
- First class to get trained remotely, this job would be difficult in an office environment, but they haven't set up appropriate resources for new candidates working remotely. Extremely difficult to navigate the endless always changing processes without a team, or manager that can answer questions quickly throughout the day. Instead having to send emails constantly, waiting for replies before being able to get back to customers and managing that in an inbox was a nightmare."

622,CDW,Best company ever,2021-01-14,5.0,Senior Project Manager,"I have been at CDW for ten years and love the culture. a Healthy Work/Life balance is stressed. I have the ability to pick my projects; they are not just assigned. If I am having an issue with a project, my manager and others are there to assist and if I request it. If things are really bad and I believe the project will fail because I cannot fix it, they will take it off my plate and give to someone else. And you are not judged poorly for doing it. In fact, you are praised for knowing your shortcomings and doing what is right for the project/customer.

Management is fair and listens to the employees. We take a survey each year, it is tabulated and then management comes out with an answer to the major issues and what will be done. They share that with the coworkers.","Because of the fast-paced environment, it is hard to take a vacation. Taking a vacation means that someone else has to take your project over for a period of time and we all work very hard; taking on another project, even for a week, is difficult."
623,CDW,No Better Place to Work,2021-01-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,CDW is one of the best places to work. Being able to show up every single day and interact with my team and other Account Managers has truly taught me how to be better in my role.

626,CDW,"Great Team, Intense Training",2021-01-14,4.0,Associate Consulting Engineer Net Sec,"Associate program pays for materials needed for required certifications as well as the exams themselves.

Great internal mentoring structure that is unique to CDW from my personal perspective.

Network Security team is national, and most work has been mostly done remote. 

Company is constantly pursuing new security technologies, and is keen on ensuring the engineers get the proper training to be fully capable consultants for that technology.

Given the nature of consulting services (especially in the security sector), you are constantly being exposed to new technologies. When combined with plenty of projects, it makes for unique job security/opportunity in the form of constantly learning about new technologies that businesses are using/wanting to use.

If you have a passion for technology, starting out as an associate in a given track (NetSec, InfoSec, Enterprise, UC, Wireless) is an incredible opportunity without requiring a ton of previous job experience. The benefits of the program become more clear as you advance, and the connections to make internally and externally are very, very valuable.","Nature of the work itself often requires working late nights around weekends, depending on the technology/product you're deploying.

Base pay is decent, but salary reviews (for associates) relies on passing your second board exam. This requirement combined with massive Cisco certification changes forces the underlying internal curriculum to change. This places associates, especially those who started in 2019-2020, stuck between a rock and a hard place, as you must rapidly study and pass certifications, perform client work and prepare for a board exam that may or may not be changing.

If you fail your board exams, you're essentially delaying your potential for a raise, getting out of the associate program, and progressing your career with CDW."

628,CDW,Interview process,2021-01-14,3.0,Sales Representative,Seems like there’s potential to make a lot of money,"The interview process is long. 
-First, there’s a one way interview where people in a video ask you behavioral questions and then you record a response to them.
-Salary and start dates are discussed in a second interview over the phone for some reason, even though you are not considered for the position yet. 
-When the third interview comes along, they ask you behavioral questions and then discuss training and start dates again. 
-After that, at the very end of the third interview they’ll tell you they have other candidates they’re interviewing before they consider you for a fourth and final interview. 
-If you are not a perfect interviewer, good luck trying to land this job."

654,CDW,Ethics and Integrity Suck/Worst place to work in Canada,2021-01-02,1.0,Sales,"We get food, but you only got 20mins to use the coupon...","This place is toxic. If you want to work in a hostile environment, this place is for you. Managers are literally failed sales people who couldn't make it. They can't manage nor can they provide motivation for team members, they themselves don't know what's going on. The blind can only lead the blind for so long. Do not question management. Do not go to HR, and definitely don't go to the CDW Ethics and Compliance office/dept... 

CDW Ethics office is basically the life line so they don't get brought up on human rights violations or lawsuits. I've seen great employee's be bullied out of CDW for making harassment claims, bullying, exclusion, favoritism, sexual misconduct, reprisal is very real at CDW. They literally make stuff up and ignore their own ""CDW way"". Their promises fall on deaf ears, they talk about integration, innovation, leadership.....It's all smoke in mirrors. They sold us on the glamour and glitz, it's far from that. 

Rampant drug use in all departments. Everyone knows...it's no secret. Probably the worst work environment in terms of managers, training, professionalism, and job growth compared to other places I've worked. This company does not value hard working employees. If your desperate and it's all you have as an option well all I have to say is get to training first, scavengers don't leave much for other training classes. At least the food is free and non taxable.....or is it...."

They do extensive training and make sure youre ready to hit the ground running. Though its very few that make it.. if youre one of the few you can make a lot of money. Be prepared to put in the extra work off the clock in you want to make it.,Base Salary is not ideal. Is more of a who can out last who job. Most of your starting class wont make it but the ones that do can really succeed. All about getting those big accounts when people leave. If you lose one of your top accounts (which happens often) it can drastically effect your performance.

While I prefer to work from home, there is somewhat of a disconnect from your traditional management structure - this is ok if you can self-govern but for individuals who require more direction, this might hinder you from being successful.

I was afraid to bring coronnavirus  to my husband and his mom at home.  i asked my manager to send me to CDW because the employees at my company  told me about the reputation that CDW had for having great coronnavirus safety. They finally had an opening and sent me to CDW. It was amazing! The thermals cameras, the strict security guards that checked the floors all of the time  to make sure everyone was behaving,  and safety employee  stopping by to see if I needed anything  and tell me how to stay safe, and the way they take people out and hold them out 14 days if they are even a little  sick just in case is very good.  We all felt SUPER  comfortable working there because the security guards and manager  didn't mess around  when it came to our safety. And they really care. They even have a HUGE poster in the CDC that tells us we are special and that  they do it all for us. And we can tell they mean it because they would take time to make that and then act on it. I was pregnant and didn't tell anyone until I had to resign to have my daughter  but I want to go back when my new daughter is old enough. I felt safer there than I did when I wasn't at work. We also got free food and employees and contractors were made to feel the same and respected. Oh and fun work.",The only bad thing is having to leave and hoping I can get assigned back there. My husband works at a different company and when I tell him about our safety people and prosses he gets mad because his company is close to us and doesnt have anything like we do to stay safe. He had two friends that died from Coronnavirus that worked at his company. His mom's job is like his too and they keep closing and opening like my husbands because too many people getting sick  in the warehouse and spreading coronnavirus to each other.  So the con is that my husband doesnt work at CDW too because he would be safe if he did and I wouldnt worry. . The other bad thing is that many of the ops supervisors don't do anything but sit down and are too friendly with some of us ladies. Unprofessional. Place is cleaned all of the time but  they have some clutter all over the place.

Investing in the technology and tools to make us effective from our home offices. Leadership has extended WFH through at least 1/1/21 for our health and safety. The company has gone to great extents to keep the distribution center coworkers and contractors safe during this trying time while they continue to deliver for our customers.

*Keeping our Customers at the Center: All coworkers can articulate how what they do everyday helps our customers. It's a shared mission to help our customers with all of their technology needs - and those coworkers who live the mission are rewarded well. 

*Innovation and Growth - Top leadership has invested heavily (bringing in key talent and funding projects) to position CDW for what the future will bring. I have a high degree of confidence that we are prepared for whatever tech trends are next.",*Not seeing coworkers: My favorite part of the job was being in the office with my teammates.

-Base salary is far below industry standard

-Work life balance is non-existent

-Expressing any negative concerns to upper management will be used against you down the line. They do not take feedback and expect you to put your head down and stay in your lane

-Accounts can be taken from you by your manager at anytime without any explanation, even if you built it from nothing. They are purely focused on the bottom line not the customer relationship

I know healthcare costs are always rising, but my CDW healthcare cost is always more than my wife's has been at her employers. Account representative/account manager roles at CDW are very difficult. Base salary is extremely low and even goes down after your second year. The biggest issue though is there's barely any time for proactive selling, which is what we should be doing. Internal processes are extremely time-consuming and wrought with problems. It's basically 80% of your time is more like project management. It's a very transactional sales role.

They don't care about client retention or solving problems, the only care about how many boxes they can flog. And you don't dare question them or suggest there is a better way to do things, if you do that, they will manufacture a reason to get rid of you. It's the worst sales culture I've ever experienced. 

I didn't hire on, I was part of an acquisition (Scalar Decisions, great company, amazing culture) and when the integration was started CDW made a whole bunch of promises about creating an innovative, entrepreneurial culture, Didn't happen, not going to happen. They are trying to turn the skilled enterprise sales team into a bunch of dial for dollars, boiler room drones and it's not going well. The best people have already left and a lot more are leaving, on my team alone over 60% are looking for other work. They are in the process of trying to fire me with cause (literally making stuff up and ignoring their own policies) for two reasons; 1. I am critical of the integration, and 2. they don't want to pay me out for my tenure. It's a horrible place to work if you have any integrity or ethics at all.

833,CDW,Low Pay High Bureaucracy,2020-05-15,2.0,Accounts Manager,"CDW offers an academy program that gives fairly in depth training on a wide breadth of product offerings. The academy gives you a decent baseline understanding of business technology.

Good place to start your career if you don't have a college degree as it will allow you to begin to build a professional network where you can find a legit technology sales job.","Of hundreds of technology companies offering sales positions in the greater Phoenix area this is the lowest I've seen in terms of pay (25,000$ base and a tiny commission on everything you sell). Don't be fooled by ""uncapped"" commission. The SMB teams might have 1 rep out of 20 with a six figure salary. Comparitively an entry level sales development role at a software company will range from 40-80,000$ and an actual opportunity for a short path to six figures.

If you can get past starting at $25,000 a year thinking you'll grind harder than all of your peers you better make sure that you fall within the bureaucratic plans of the husband and wife that lead the chandler office. No matter how hard you work there will be no opportunity for advancement if you do not fall within those 2 directors social rank. At other companies there are various factions that can aid your advancement not just 1 couple. When you leave the company it will almost certainly not be on good terms in managements view.

It used to be sort of fun until management grossly misbehaved at happy hours and forced a 2 drink maximum and if you're seen having a drink at lunch you will be fired.

Overall - If you're college educated without obvious professional red flags you have far greater opportunities than working for 25,000$ in the suburbs for dying monolithic company."

For example, ""customer service"" doesn't actually service any customers.  If a customer asks the most basic question of them, they forward the customer to their sales reps.

The bonus payments are way below any company I have been to.  The salary ranges are below market.  They are trying to hire college grads to lower costs of resources.

That's where it ends.","Where to start. I did not have a good time at CDW UK probably the most unhappy I have ever been in a job. Boss yelled all the time in the office dreaded going into the office which I have never had in all of my working life. Constantly held back and was not allowed to improve.

I am glad to say in my new role and my team are amazing and enjoy going to work now and CDW is a distant memory. It makes such a difference having a nice boss never had thought about it before as I had never had a bad one.

Also, the computers look like they are running Windows 98 and Navision god knows what version. Also, you don't exist to Management unless your sales.


I would never recommend CDW to anyone."

Those are all key attributes at CDW.  Diversity plays a key role, as we have; a) diverse people who can bring a diverse view to business decisions, b) diverse partners (i.e. HP, Apple, IBM, Cisco, etc.) that offer a wide variety of product brands, c) diverse product offerings provide stability as PC sales may be down one quarter, but software, services, solutions will be up which results in strong quarterly earnings, and d) diverse customer segments which provides solid growth (i.e. small business may be down one quarter, but healthcare, government, education, etc. are up, resulting in strong overall growth).  Having worked here for 20+ years, I can attest to the strong integrity, ethics, diversity, and business model at CDW.

She is a bully who is allowed to treat employees like dirt.  As long as she has all the influence, CDW Canada will never progress.  It's hard to comprehend why this bully gets away with what she does.  

The Canadian compensation packages are reminiscent of what you would see in the 1980's.  Most likely a result of the influence of the CFO who is clearly not a proponent of employee satisfaction or job happiness.

This completely archaic style of management has set the tone for the Canadian division.  I have never seen so many people completely defeated, deflated and terrified!!  To rule by fear is the most cowardice act."

912,CDW,Big Corporate Agenda - 3+ Years As A Bottom Feeder Before Any Growth In This Company,2019-11-19,1.0,Account Representative,You have some control on your day. Lunches are supplied by partners.,CDW is a huge corporation that uses new hires and ARs as Bottom-feeders to support the rest of the company. You make a below livable Salary and are given a starter book that consists of angry customers that don't spend with CDW anymore for numerous reasons. Commission scale is set up to have you pay back your first year's salary to CDW in the first 6 months based on the 3% of the profit you will be earning. Profit is also very hard to attain since Amazon and other big players offer the same stuff for A LOT cheaper. This company is the definition of churn and burn when it comes to new hires. If you like feeding a huge corporate whale and watching CDW take all of your profits and hard earned commissions your first 3 years then this job is for you!
913,CDW,Stop Telling People to “Drink the Kool-Aid”,2019-11-17,3.0,Account Representative,Very social environment and a lot of opportunities to get in front of parters and network. There are always events and happy hours to go to and there are select groups of good people here! Account Representatives go through an awesome training program and are given books of business.,"Bro culture. 

You can only build your book so much based on government contracts among other limitations. The common saying is “just give it two years, drink the Kool-Aid and you’ll be happy”. Obviously instantaneous gratification is not realistic in most jobs that are worth it, but seeing is believing and some people just don’t see the same results even if they do all of the same things. 

Horrible time off and package benefits, compared to other “leading” companies."

Everyone said to me CDW is not a place you just stay at for a couple years, it is a place you grow your career. After being at CDW for a year I now completely understand. The leaders here are open to any and all ideas no matter what level of the company you are. I feel respected and encouraged everyday by my coworkers. I never saw myself as someone who left work and continuously wanted to talk about it, but that is me now. I tell my family, my friends etc constantly about the incredible support I have had since beginning at CDW. CDW truly is one of the best places you could work.",There needs to be a quicker transition from contractor to full-time.

Unfortunately the view of the place is sometimes tainted by those individuals that don’t want to work hard and develop a career but as a person who does, i have been afforded development and support whenever I have asked for it. It’s a busy environment and an overly sales led culture that sometimes drives a subordinate feeling at back office level, but the business is maturing, led by some new blood that have recently joined and i personally have been able to work my way up the ladder in a relatively short amount of time. As a female I feel empowered in an industry that is typically male dominated and I am impressed with the businesses culture and values. For those people who are willing to work hard and are progressing it’s a great place to be and an environment that identifies talent, but you can’t expect that to just come to you without putting anything in.",Pay is a little uncompetitive and systems are old.

-for temp-to-hires your employment does not officially start until you are hired directly. So if you are employed in a 3/6/12 month temp position regardless of how long you've been at the job, day 1 of your official CDW hire date you start with 0 vacation or sick hours. PTO is accrued at a rate of 6.66 vacay hrs a month, sick at 3.33 hrs a month so by keeping you temp-to-hire for 6 months you lose 1 full week of vacation vs. direct hire - a.k.a. try not to get hired as a contractor if you can help it.
-pay is embarrassingly low,
-benefits are poor - starts at 2 weeks vacation, doesn't increase until 4 years in
-paternity leave starts at 1 day after 1 year of employment and caps at 3 days total
-for a IT company with teams spread across multiple locations and the connectivity to support it the fact that remote work is frowned upon at best and completely denied at worst is absurd
- change is incredibly slow"

The co-workers at CDW are all good people and for the most part everyone gets along great. There is a lot of talent and knowledge in the managed services and field services departments, so it's a great place for learning from your peers. The work environment is fairly relaxed, and even when sh!t hits the fan everyone still keeps their cool. Most of management would rather discuss issues than bark orders at their subordinates.","As time goes on, the company makes you feel more and more like a number and less like a person. Upper management and HR care more about if you are on-time than how much work you get done or how much value you add to the company. They push on supervisors to come down hard on employees for being 5 minutes late, but could care less if you work an additional 1 or 2 hours on top of your 12 hour shift."

Opportunity to develop marketable skills in a sales-focused environment.,"CDW hires at an entry-level rate, but then has no way of promoting qualified coworkers within the company once they gain a minimal amount of experience. An internal promotion usually results in a measly 5-10% pay bump above an entry-level wage, which pales in comparison to what a professional with 2-3 years of experience can earn outside the company."

1002,CDW,Great people!,2019-06-23,4.0,Field Account Executive,"I love the people I work with.  Down to earth.  Hard working.  Easy to get along with.  I’ve not run into any one that’s a jerk.  There are many folks that have been here 10+ years—very rare in tech sales—and I think that says a lot.

We have an enormous portfolio that we sell.  Services, software, cloud, hardware, telecom, etc.  We are the number one vendor for so many companies.  Our reach is tremendous.","We have some archaic processes and metrics, as you might expect at a Fortune 500 company that’s 25 years old.  Some of our sales tools are out dated...sometimes very outdated. 

We have the very common comp plan problem in sales of adding 15% to what you did  last year and making that your goal next year.  No matter what the actual situation was.  So if you have a big win at an account and now they aren’t buy much for a few years, you can find yourself in a very difficult position. 

The pay here is low compared to the industry as a whole.  As with any sales job, there’s the opportunity to make good money to be sure.  But I think you need to look at it as a place where you’re trading some of the crazy upside you’d have at some companies for a more stable and predictable income."
1003,CDW,Very Corporate Environment,2019-06-23,3.0,Account Manager,"The people you work with are great, you will make amazing friends. 

The training program is very structured and is a great transition into the corporate world. You learn about and sell so many different products that it has helped grow my sales skills in a wide range.

Lots of random free stuff/perks like; gift cards, catered food, team happy hours, and more. Also there are a ton of sales incentives to win trips, money, computers, tablets, and more.","Since it is a very corporate environment there is a lot of micro managing that happens making it feel like high school.   

Also, it is very saturated so most of the accounts are taken by older Account Manager's and it's very difficult to find accounts that don't do business with CDW already. They also over hire people even when there is not enough accounts for the people on the team already. 

Lots of role shifting within the company, it seems like no one stays in the same role for more than 1-3 years. This get very frustrating."

I have never dreading coming to work more than the time I was here. Management does not listen to ideas that come from the people who work with the data on a day to day basis. Employee suggestions are discarded or not taken seriously. People constantly throw each other under the bus because they are scared of management repercussions of making an error. Mistakes happen. And I would rather grow from those mistakes and work with upper/middle management to resolve than be scared to make them by fear of being embarrassed or disciplined. The company acknowledges the turnover issue within the Finance/Accounting department but seems to be missing the underlying issues.

1022,CDW,A Great Place to Start Your Career - An AM Review,2019-06-04,4.0,Executive Account Manager,"The training program is one of the best in the industry. Even with no background in IT hardware/software/services sales, CDW does an excellent job of preparing you to be successful and giving you the tools & resources to do so. The culture is also top notch. Almost everyone is extremely willing to help you be successful, and your engineering talent & Solution Architects will give you the blueprint to qualify opportunities as an Account Manager. If you land in the right patch, there is a genuine opportunity to make money. I was an Account Manager for 6 years and made six figures for the last 4 of the 6. 

That said, you do have to exercise patience and know that those first two years will be extremely challenging. Likely 45-55K total pay. But, if you can stick it out and prove yourself, you will get opportunities to be successful. 

There are constantly vendors in the office giving free lunches, swag, happy hours after work, and promoting vacations & prizes for being top sellers of a specific product. The vacations are amazing, and always extremely well put together.

Speaking of, the vacation time and benefits are adequate. Nothing will wow you, but nothing will make you feel like you are being taken advantage of, either.

Sales Managers tend to be extremely flexible, friendly, and willing to help you succeed if you demonstrate a desire to. I had 5 managers in 6 years, and only one borderline negative experience that did not last long.

Overall, this is a fantastic place to begin your career if you have little to no sales experience. The first 2 years may make it challenging for anyone with experience or major life expenses (car, mortgage, kids, etc.), but if you are just graduating and looking for somewhere to work while living with parents or sharing an apartment with people, CDW should absolutely be near the top of your list.","As odd as this may sound, it is possible to be TOO successful at CDW. The best Account Managers are extremely well compensated, but because of that, it makes a move to any other position internally a pay cut. Some choose to do it for more stability in terms of a higher base salary, but it can be challenging psychologically to accept a total comp cut to move “up” in to leadership.

You do move on to a different comp structure after your first 4 years as a sales rep, one that effectively makes you 100% commission. You’re still guaranteed a base salary, but you have to sell to cover it. For me, this wasn’t an issue given the business I had developed but for some, it pushes them out of the AM role.

The competition is fierce. There are many VARs out there, and all of your large accounts will be doing business with many of them. This can lead to eroding profit margins that make it difficult for you to make money until you develop a relationship with the customer, which can take years.

The Cloud services practice needs more of an investment in personnel, etc. Other VARs are lapping CDW in terms of Advanced Technology services offerings, especially in the Cloud space. Many of your major accounts will still look at CDW as a “box pusher”, even as it has evolved to a complete solutions provider. Battling that stigma can be challenging.

Depending on the territory you are assigned to, the first 2 years can be very mentally draining. You will likely start working with smaller accounts, ones that have been called on for years that don’t do business with CDW. You will fail, ALOT. You will lose, ALOT. Knowing and accepting that going in will help you to look long term at the role."
1023,CDW,Amazing people,2019-06-02,4.0,Field Account Executive,The people here are just awesome. Everyone is here to help you with your customer. Best collaboration experiences in my 25 years in Tech sales,Some tools are a little old fashioned. Lack of a true CRM like Salesforce is a bummer

1031,CDW,Account Manager,2019-05-15,2.0,Account Manager,It used to be uncapped commission and spiffs but the company is slowly taking those away under the pretense of ‘paying for additional resources’ which don’t actually exist for inside AMs. The benefits package is actually very good for not only the IT industry but businesses as a whole. There are a lot of fun outings. The technical training is pretty good. Learn as much as you can and then leave quickly.,Lowest compensation in the industry. Absolutely poor senior leadership. Managers will put in commission adjustments and give away gross profit to other AMs without your knowledge. Very little growth potential unless you’re the ‘right candidate’ (CDW is really trying to be PC right now). Managers seem incapable of handling conflict. Inbound constantly violates rules and regulations and steal orders and management does nothing to hold them accountable. Very little investment in human capital. Senior leaders create new titles for themselves to seem relevant. Certain segments have no support or ISA who will only work with top performers. It’s a mess. Get in and learn the industry and then get out quickly.

You can make more $$ on the draw IF IF IF you've set up your book of business  (or have legit accounts) to support it. Compensation plans can change from year to year, but I think that's probably any publicly owned sales gig.  The process to sell services internally can be tough and painfully slow to navigate, and at times it can be slow to get some things done internally due to the company size.

The reason the company refers to employees this way is because it shows that everyone has a lot of value, no matter their role in the company. 

The company also does a lot for their coworkers by providing a lot of perks that go a long way towards saving money such as free food, clothes, housewares, etc. 

In addition, the company provides a lot of growth opportunities for your career and tend to promote from within. 

Overall, the company truly shows that it cares about their coworkers.","The main challenge that I've been aware of during my years with the company is that they could provide a higher base salary for many different roles and what compounds this is the fact that the company tends to run pretty lean in terms of overall headcount, particularly outside of sales. However, a lot of people tend to stay at CDW for many, many years and this says a lot about everything else the company offers given that people in a decent size city could likely find a similar role that pays a higher base salary."

1106,CDW,Read if joining the Peterborough Service Desk,2019-01-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The hand dryers are superb in the toilets.,"I have worked for CDW in 3 different capacities; Service Desk Analyst, Desktop Support Analyst (2nd line) and Onsite Support Analyst over a period of around 6 years so my opinion I would say is fair, balanced and not limited to one team or manager.

On paper CDW appears to be an excellent way into IT for people who have a genuine interest or passion for technical support, sadly the reality is that if this is your first experience it will almost certainly be your last.

Since CDW or Kelway as it was known then moved from its Huntingdon premises to Peterborough around 6 years ago they have gone through a ridiculous amount of staff, they actually moved offices because they had exhausted the staff pool for the Huntingdon area and literally ran out of staff they could recruit.

They are the only company I have ever worked for that doesn't stop recruiting, it has nothing to do with growth, yes they are growing but almost all of the new customers are taking products that do not touch the Service Desk.

The team leaders and shift leaders are so shockingly bad at their jobs it is almost scandalous, there is a real issue with cliques in the office, all of the shift/team leaders are drinking buddies and could not do the job they are asking their staff to do.

They are now at a point with recruitment on the Service Desk that they will literally take anyone, when they first moved to Peterborough they recruited based on key skills, experience and work history like any good employer would, sadly now they are just giving jobs to anyone who has access to a pair of trousers and a shirt.

They send out an amazing welcome pack when you join, it’s really informative and goes to great lengths to tell you how you can have a career at CDW, promotions are common place and the emphasis is on skill building. The reality is that in 6 years on the service desk (roughly 120 staff total at any one time), 3 people have actually been promoted to a higher position, there have been around 10 sideways promotions (people moving into newly created roles) but these are cut down roles so cannot be classed a genuine promotion.

There is no HR presence at all in the UK so if you have an issue/concern then you can email Co Worker Services in the US or go to your team leader (who will literally ask you to email them and they will forward it to CO Worker Services in the US, no HR decision making is done in the UK). If you have for example a grievance with a staff member or professional concerns that you would take up with HR then you are out of luck here, there is literally no support for the staff. I have personally known of people who have raised issues (some really quite serious I might add) and they have just left the business without getting anywhere.

My advice would be that if you have no IT experience and no qualifications but would like to start a career in IT then join CDW, follow their advice and process calls the way the team leaders want, get 6 months under your belt and then go and work for literally any other company. If you are the kind of person that wants to ladder up without the knowledge or skills then just get yourself in the cliques that are obvious from the second you walk in and pat the right heads, you will be a team leader inside 4 months. It shocks me how much respect this company has in recruitment circles."

So, I’ll let everyone here know the skinny as too what’s going on at CDW. They’re grabbing recent grads and paying them crap money, so they can flip that for a buck by hoping they make up for it within the year. 

You might do well! So I don’t want to discourage you. However, it’s a saturated market and CDW is not cheap. Management will tell you “people buy from people they like.” That was true before price comparisons can be done at the snap of a finger. They pay off profit mostly, so good luck medlar/SMB. 

It’s been a weird time, and I’ve appreciated the business, but I think there will need to be some major changes for them to keep with much much cheaper VARS. Sure, a business relationship is great, but there’s also a bottom line that CDW can’t protect."

Coworkers and immediate supervisors will openly mock and insult you for not knowing what they already know in their 20+ years of experience. If you don't walk talk and act like everyone else they will bully and harass you until they run you out. HR and upper management will ignore you when you bring up the harassment and abhorrent behavior of coworkers and direct supervisors. The clique of hispanic 20+ year employees are dug in deep and will do whatever it takes to maintain the status quo of mediocrity. One of the worst experiences of my life. My last hours there, at the vernon hills in illinois location, I felt I was in imanent physical harm.

To put it another way - I was descriminated against due to my appearence. I'm a reasonably healthy, non-obese individual who tries to eat healthy. Had I documented the harassment better, if I had money to pay for lawyers or felt comfortable in that whole legal system I'd think about pressing charges (after building more of a case first). But I I have none of those things. 

CDW hires sheep. They want the most vulnerable  individuals in society (undocumented, hearing impaired, indebted students, wage-slave parents, elderly etc) to quietly toil away while nary raising a peep or causing any waves. I say this because how I was completely ignored when I brought up how the good ol' hispanic boys were treating me.

This is about the pick-pack department closest to the entrance of where the warehouse employees enter. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.

If you love to shmooze - have at it, and good luck to you. 

There were a few handful of decent, patient, & understanding folks in my section - yes, but they were greatly outnumbered by the 'indifferent', the meek & the haters.

- Never arund to provide ledership.  Always taking 2 hour lunches - gone 11:50, they come bck 1:30 (not just friday) and leave at 4 when they come in at 9.
- Don't know how to train people.

- Always ask very personal questions and won't leave you alone until you answer to their liking, then will make fun of you and embarass you 
- Campany has poor health and dental bnefits
- Very loud working envrinonemnt.  Workers are allowed to play music and not use headphones.
- Managers clearly play favorites.  Pick on and bully quiet ones constantly, and joke with others.  Have not heard of anyone saying they are good managers, they are just there to approve vacation time, or be 17th floor security guards. If there are any ""positive"" posts here about accoutning department after this one, it is fake.
- Probably the worst work envirnment in terms of managers, training, professionalism, and job growth compared to other places i've worked.  the problem is the managers have been thre too long so don't know what the real world is like any more.  What they think is professional or how a company should act, is not normal because they are in a bubble.
- Do not work in CDW-Canada finance dpeartment if you have a university degree (or even a high school diploma).  Your better off working somewhere else.  You will get better training and more challenge somewhere else, and will probably have more professional managers and not be bullied.

Ability to move throughout company to other departments could be attractive to young professionals,"Pay scale is weighted unfairly.  High revenues are needed to hit maximum payout on commission scale.  It benefits tenured account managers that have accounts spending $30mil+ a year, while newer account managers get smaller, scrappy accounts and are expected to make a living off the lower commission payouts.  Goals are also increased 10-20% every year, no matter what environmental issues or industry trends are taking place (example - even when new ordinances are passed in government, and some customers will knowingly have smaller budgets, goals are still increased 10-20%). The company is great to work for if you're not in sales, but the cynical environment and ridiculous expectations make it a less than ideal company to work for.  I would not recommend working here if you're looking to get into sales."
1255,CDW,Account Representative,2018-03-30,5.0,Account Representative,"I have been here for little over a year and have nothing and have almost nothing but good things to say about this position.

For anyone trying to get into the tech industry with little experience, this is a really great place to start and grow.","There is always a bad egg anywhere you go. I unfortunately had to deal with a homophobic colleague for the first few months, but HR was quick to address the issue.

Pay is also very low for the first year. I took a pretty big pay cut to take this position with the thought that I would make it up in the long term. Currently on track to doing so."
1256,CDW,"Lots of work, but can be very rewarding.",2018-03-30,5.0,Account Manager,"The training program they put you through initially is really comprehensive in getting you up to speed on the fundamentals of IT and all of the product segments that you'll be covering.  I'm sure it could  differ from team to team, but after training my manager always seemed to focus on our personal goals and development, and I never felt any pressure to simply hit numbers. There's a good sense of camaraderie between your team and the group you've gone through training with - although many of them went on to separate teams we still keep in touch years later.  The pay probably won't be amazing for most your first year or two unless you hit some luck or really grind at it, but it's probably comparable to similar positions with other companies, except with a lot of added perks. Expect to be inundated with free food, contests, and branded freebies from all of the vendor partners. A lot of opportunity for lateral promotions or to specialize in/work for many of the vendors. The work itself can be a slog some days, but they really seem to do as much as possible to motivate their employees.","Expect to make tons of cold calls daily. Probably 80-100+ early on until you start gaining some traction and have to focus more time on actual customers. I never encountered any negativity, but you'll be leaving a lot of voicemails, hitting dead ends on leads, and chasing after elusive IT managers day after day. 
They provided you with a starter book of business, but you'll quickly have to start prospecting your own leads if you want to get anywhere. Your initial book might have a few diamonds in the rough, but they're mostly hand-me-downs from other account managers on your team because they got nowhere with them.
Finding good customers can seem like a struggle sometimes depending on what your territory is. Some of the more successful account managers seemed to get their break by sharing an account with a more experienced team member - make connections and be eager to learn from them because the odds of getting in on the ground floor with a growing company seemed pretty slim."

As a woman, it’s also difficult to strike early success with some IT managers that are not really used to working with women. Most of your account contacts are men—-a good 95%. Some are nasty and just don’t give a crap about how much you help them. 
-No work from home rights until you hit senior AM role and you only get 1 day from home
-Commission structure changes--after you are here 3 years, NO BASE--you only get paid once a month and have to hit certain metrics to get that paycheck  Of course being in Chicago, it’s just not feasible to live on your own. Looking at your paycheck can be depressing and makes you want to curl up in a ball. 
-No customer visits (depending on territory)--hard for customers to put a face to voice. Your competition can go on site, but you cannot. traveling is restricted to execs for conferences. 
-The paycheck is probably the worst part of the role. Do not expect to make good $$ the first few years--however you are told that your books will change--if you put the time and effort in, you will gain great spending accounts. 
-Starting commission until you are promoted onto hiring team is mediocre. SELL, SELL, SELL to get a bigger %.
-Unsure if its difficult to move to a corporate role  from a sales role--tenured AMs tend to  stick in sales--obviously, the make good $$ to not want to go elsewhere. 
-Tenured AMs tend not to be inclusive and like to include newer reps into their clique 
-there isn’t a lot of micro management, but you’re consistently told to make more calls and get your “touches up” to keep your job. If your average falls below a certain amount, you may be fired. It’s hard to stomach a job that mainly entails being a telemarketer and making cold calls. Definitely not proud of that part of the role."

Also, you will be pulled into endless training's that will be of little to no use to you and you will also be asked to complete other useless training's that pull you away from your job. And lastly, you will find that the thing that will impede you making as much money as you want is not your customers but the company itself. Your resources are stretched and overworked. So, like any other rational human being would do, they prioritize those who bring them the largest deals.

Fun partner events.
Matching 401(k) plan.
Employee purchase program.
Training program.","Pay is way below industry standard and it is based on position and not promotional merit. Management is not going to be transparent about the commission structure  and after 2 years coworker loses the low base salary. CDW also takes 20% of a coworker's SPIFF money, which accounts for about 30% of their overall earnings. If the coworker is in a pre-sales role within CDW S3, the bonus is capped at 150% and there is no SPIFF money. Overall, CDW turnover rate is very high because of the total compensation.

Upward promotions are rare and CDW prefers to hire from outside the company to prevent internal conflict among coworkers. Going through the Emerging Leaders Program has a high opportunity cost for the coworker because of the amount of time it takes to complete the training. New Sales Managers are tossed around and start in the academy with low-revenue teams, which directly impacts their pay. 

Culture varies across each department and CDW partner-funded teams are often in conflict with their external partner stakeholders. This results in an internal toxic culture that persists and CDW will often take the side of the partner and eliminate the coworker or the entire team. The internal bureaucracy also stifles any innovation and management listens top-down, which affects the customer experience."

A couple of months in I knew why I got sidelined while on a gig and the voice from all of my management was 'don't worry about anything else but getting better so you can get back into the game'. My manager even offered to fly my family to where I was, on the company dime.  I can't say that any other company would have done that for their people.

- Good career progression opportunities; I went from an AM, to Partner Specialist/BDS, to ISA over time.

- Easy to land a job with a vendor after tenure.

- Good money to be had.

- Good work/life balance, managers tend to be hands-off.","- Suburban locations are off the beaten path, you're better off driving (they have a shuttle which sucks).

- Management in S3 was pretty bad, a side effect of having old sales guys try to be businessmen. 

They're only good for popping into meetings to say generic things like ""What's the ask here?"" and ""We need to come up with a more efficient way of doing this."" 
Awful, but we all had to suck up to them. 

- Fellow ISA's were a bit arrogant, to the point that AM's were shy to reach out to them. They tended to be belittling to sales reps for not being ""technical"" enough. 
I had AM's outside my territory reach out to me as their assigned ones were, in their words, ""rude"".

- Lots of finger-pointing when business slows - CDW blames vendors, vendors blame CDW, etc.

- Chicago office bathrooms are gross. 

- You have to request access to use the company's WiFi...for a tech company that's pretty silly. 

- People here tend to wear super loud shoes - it was like Jurassic Park with the water rippling sometime. Do you have to stomp around the office?

Groups of managers and their fellow buddies in HR would break off into little cliques and alienate everybody else around them who obviously wasn't worthy of joining them. Seriously, some of the managers and the HR people here had desperate insecurity issues and constantly relied on ego stroking and validation of their obviously quite injured personal feelings. Lastly, communication was poor and morale was also even lower! Nothing is ever resolved here at CDW because nobody there has any guts to stand up and do the right thing. Nobody there has any guts to speak up and say ""hey, we're not going to engage in this type of behavior any longer because it's not right, it hurts our employees when we gossip about them, and it's also not fair to blacklist or target our employees."" There's nobody in senior leadership, both management and HR here at this company CDW who has any guts to stand up and do the right thing.

Aggressive company culture. If you are shy, avoid conflict and turn the other cheek not good idea to join CDW. To get anywhere you are going to have to fight for every account, deal etc with lots of arbitrary decision making that favours high income earners and longstanding employees.

Outside of Sales, very little future opportunities ( for Canadians). Your candidacy outside of CDW wont be competitive either as the core competency at CDW is shipping by volume. Biggest employer of ex-CDW staff is Purolator.

Company is way too focused on a growth model based on touches ( aka calls, not even emails) rathen than strategic account management. 

Some Account Managers are working massive books and accounts only because they ""tagged"" an account although they could be a terrible account manager. There are 1000's of high potential accounts being horded by senior AM's that will never share/split/reallocate to new people. They basically have quit or pass away.

Success depends on Region you work and Manager. If you work East coast just quit now. If you work central/praires quit. If you work education quit. If you work Healthcare quit. Only good region is BC and Quebec. Many Managers are useless clockwatchers that will treat you like crap until you are a 3 year vet and you quitting comes up on their performance review, before that you are worthless. Have fun."

Pay is low and ""raises"" are less than 3% yet your review will always say how great of a worker you are. Going above and beyond will become the norm or is considered to be a part of your job. Laziness and stupidity are valued and praised yet hard workers are just given more work since they are the only competent people. There needs to be more oversight as to who gets hired and how skilled they are. Last few people hired on my team can't even send a properly worded email and yet the Supervisor loves them and praises them for doing crap work. Favoritism will get you a long way at this company. If you try to transfer out of your team/dept, HR will give some bs about how you cannot get more than a 10% raise, yet they offer outsiders double/triple the amount for the same role. So there is no incentive to want to transfer."

No training provided -you are told you use google to solve complex IT issues. A blame culture where you have people reporting you to save their own skin and keep themselves out of the firing line. Constant staff turnover and low morale. A management team that are clueless and only strategy is to scream at you to work harder...or you will be fired. Unrealistic targets and workload."
1516,CDW,Account Manager - MedLar,2017-01-30,3.0,Account Manager,"- Good Benefits
- Great Atmosphere
- Great Support 

I really liked working at CDW. It was my first real ""corporate job"" out of college and it gave me an idea of what I would need to do to be successful in the business world. The people are great and there is always support from higher management to progress in a seriously cut-throat business. 

The people are the only reason I stayed at CDW for as long as I did. Perks are good - free lunches at points during the week, always getting snacks, t-shirts, water bottles etc.. for free from vendors as a incentive to sell their products.

-Great training programs","Their metrics are outdated. If you are not talking on the phone to clients a minimum of 2 hours a day and hitting your metrics for the dials, you can be written up even if you hit your revenue goals. So you could crush your target by 200% but only spoke on the phone for an average of 1:59/ day and get written up. 

Also the base salary is seriously low. For a company that is making upwards of 13 Billion dollars in revenue/ year it is a little embarrassing what they actually pay you. I have heard that it just recently was bumped up a bit for new hires but it is still well below what is normal. Also the commission structure in which you get paid off of is not attractive. Recruiters will do what they can to tell you the success stories of a few reps that make amazing amounts of uncapped commissions but again when there are upwards of 4,000 sales reps that is the exception not the rule.

If you are in MedLar after 4 years you lose your base salary so you are paid entirely off of your commission. That is why many people leave CDW within that time frame because they go to a job that continues to pay them their base salary regardless of how long they have been there. 

Limited amount of ability to upgrade career path - The problem is when you work for one of the branches not in the HQ (Chicago) that those people often get overlooked for some of the open positions. Also you can not apply for another position within the company until 2 years after your start date. - One positive is that you do get plenty of exposure to the over 3,000 vendors that CDW partners with, so while it may not be CDW that will give you the chance to advance your career, there is a way to do this through their vendors."

CDW ranks in the top 10% during the annual surveys for employee satisfaction. The talent that CDW has on their workforce is superlative, and you always have someone to go to with questions – at any level of your professional career. While CDW is a large organization, the individual branches provide a smaller organization feel. Freedom of schedule and trust as a consultant is one of my favorite things at CDW. You truly can work autonomously, as a trusted professional should be able to do. If you want to work for a company, STRONGLY consider CDW. You won’t regret it.","CDW does see a bit of turnover in the HMS side of the house. While this is common with data centers, it may be indicative of needed change. Also, customers of CDW do require you to sacrifice some of your weekends, and nights. If this is a problem for your work/life balance, CDW may not be the best fit.

I'm headhunted by competitors and startups on a weekly basis who are offering 45 to 55k bases and commission structures much more generous than CDW's 3% of gross profit.

There are so many opportunities to grow personally and professionally with the amazing company culture and coworkers. The company wants to continue to grow and improve, and the high-level management listens to this. I consider the people I work with my great friends outside of work. My manager was the perfect amount of guidance and support throughout the internship.",There are hardly any cons for this company other than to make sure to invest enough money in other areas of the company other than sales (even though this is the foundation of the company).

-Leadership wants the best for coworkers
-Hard working coworkers, dedicated to their work and collaborative environment
-Great Partner relationships
-Coworkers have the tools and resources (including budget) needed to get the job done and stand out.
-Big company, small company feel
-Good direction and strategy - Kelway acquisition was a good thing and well executed/transitioned","-Lots of coworkers have been with CDW for more over a decade...many in the same roles.  While this is a testament to a company people want to stay with, and one that takes care of its coworkers,it is also a challenge because some people tend to get complacent and stay in roles too long. 
-Marketing reorg has been challenging and doesn't seem well thought out which could result in losing key coworkers that the company needs to get to the next level.
-it's unclear in many roles where the next step career wise is or what promotion criteria is.  When people stay in positions so long it blocks others from moving up especially in areas like Marketing where there are less positions available overall.
-While the collaborative spirit of the org is great, in pockets it has created an environment of entitlement among some coworkers who don't understand that in business not everyone is included on every decision, nor should they be."

It is paid as well, which is a huge plus.","The intern program is new, there are definitely some kinks to be worked out. All intern programs weren't always relevant to every segment, and there was an obvious focus on sales. Also, Going into the job, I didn't really know what I would be doing everyday so I went in blind, and luckily it worked out well."

Every bit of work I've received has been important, which I appreciate as an intern. That challenge pushes me to improve in my role rather than just sit around doing mundane tasks. Whether it be in getting out of your comfort zone or setting up a plan to succeed, you have the freedom and opportunity to grow.

Along with that freedom comes support from almost every level of the company. I've gotten advice and feedback from my direct supervisor all the way up to the director of my division. All of them were more than happy to help me get where I wanted to be professionally.

The internal infrastructure to support employees is also fantastic. I work remotely, but I don't feel as though I am underserved in my needs at all. I have great experiences with the IT help desk (which is very significant when you work remotely on a virtual machine,) everything physical thing I need is shipped to me in a few days, and I was even given a company phone at an intern-level position just to make sure I can always stay in contact with customers and coworkers during business hours.

At CDW, the sky's the limit, and they give you everything you need to succeed.",I'm surprised at the fact that I can't think of any reasonable cons. I guess the pay could better.

They tend to act like sales people instead of leaders, very little coaching it is a very self sufficient job.  The technical resources you engage to get high commission deals can lose said deals and it is totally out of your control."

Told me he was strapped for time and wanted to cut what should've been a 45min-1hr interview down to 20 minutes.  Didn't make eye contact.  Went completely on script for interview.

I've had years with very similar sales results and my comp package produced 25% less income with the same sales.  Quotas (Goals) are unrealistic and therefore reps are penalized for not hitting goals which have sometimes been as high as an expectation of a  60% increase in sales from one year to the next.

1697,CDW,Account Manager,2016-06-01,3.0,,"The people there are great. Vendors give you many different gifts, tickets to games, free food for selling their products.","To low of salary. Originally was $25,000 base pay. Changed it to $30,000. There are unrealistic expectations and you are told you can make $100,000 within 3 years. It is difficult to build your business, and really depends on what segment you are in and if your manager gives you more accounts to work. Expect your first year to bring home monthly commission checks anywhere from 100- $500. It is rare to make much more than that back to back months for commission. A manager once told me if you arent willing to stay here for 3 years you shouldn't stay for 3 months. You really start making money after 3 years (Some people make money in a shorter amount of time). Definitely, not a job you should take if you are fresh out of college with student loans or you have a family to support.

Furthermore, everyone I worked with was definitely  a support system not just for CDW-related things but for career, college, and anything else I needed. I could not have asked for better mentors to introduce me into technology sales. You learn so much and are given many opportunities to focus on areas within higher education technology that are most interesting to you.","Every school will be different which is hard to account for during the onboarding training that is designed for.all the interns. Thus, when you first start it takes some time to figure out what your role is and how you can help out your Account Team best based on where its relationship with your school is. Some of the training modules are hard to apply to your role because there are previous contracts in place or other blocks.

Just, quit talking to me. My coworker threatened me, and HR tells me he has a hearing problem. (As if I can't  tell the difference between someone who is leaning in because they can't hear, and someone who has pushed me into a corner, and put his angry face six inches away from mine, spitting and pointing his stupid finger at me because I asked him to correct his mistake. That doesn't sound like a hearing problem to me.) He was not reprimanded for this, nor was he asked to move his desk away from me. Later, I began receiving an unpredictable number of assignments every day, I asked me boss to either even that out, or tell me when it will change and he, of course, never did. 
My bosses, and HR, each tell me that these are not genuine problems. I just ""perceive"" them as problems. CDW is gaslighting me, which is a common bullying tactic.

Senior management neglects it's employees that are supporting the sales. This not only is causing a mass exodus of employees that have decades of experience. What's left is an entirely demoralizing workplace. CDW champions it's ""work from home/work life balance"" and it's now become more about how many more hours you can work during a day. Many people in support roles work on weekends, holidays and the normal work day has become 11-13 hours. Working really hard just means you broke even and there's very little chance for advancement.

For me there are no cons as I can find enough work to do to help guide associates through their ACE program while also maintaining a high billable utilization. You're given enough rope to hang yourself and must be self disciplined to work from home and be an asset to the company. If you're easily distracted and need someone telling you what to do all the time, this place is not for you. The harder you work, the more you'll be compensated. There are times you will have 60 hours of work with customers one week, and others you may have as little as 10 - and you should focus on self-educating and keeping up with the latest technology in the industry whenever you have the time to do so.

Manager will remove accounts from team members books of business without discussion, and when asked why, won't give an answer.

Manager will not speak to certain co-workers, which creates a lot of animosity between teammates

No support from Corporate which is in Chicago, so the remote offices get little to no support, and the accounts to work from are sub-par to the accounts that the Chicago team gets

New upper management has been put in place but it is causing less morale then before and making good people want to look elsewhere

She would also give me instructions via email in writing and then would give me DIFFERENT instructions verbally afterward.

Goal calculation is a mystery mixed in with magic.  You never understand why your goals are raised or how they are calculated.  Goals are set on a monthly basis.
If you do very well one month chances are your goal will be higher the next month.
Goal structure is based on profit and because you do not own the account or customer relationship it's very difficult to work towards increasing profitability. 
If you do not achieve a certain percentage of your goal for the quarter you will OWE the company money which can happen!  
If you finish over 200% of goal for the quarter you will be capped.  No one has averaged that for the quarter but there are big modifiers which kick in after 120% of goal. Silly to put a cap on hard work.
The amount of work is overwhelming to say the least.  You will never catch up or feel like you spent quality time to help a customer.  If you are a thoughtful person get used to treating customers more like a number.
A lot of small solutions mixed in with parts questions and very large solutions which you have no time for.
60-65 hour weeks on average just to keep all of your account managers barely happy with your performance.
60-65 hour weeks to get to 100-105% of goal for the quarter   
No real training to advance your career or knowledge base.  Mostly new product training only.
You will never feel like you can put a stake in the ground for accomplishments because you are constantly trying to keep up."

I was told along with other 10 to 15 years we need to hit are production goals or we will be fired. We told them why arent you pulling the other 50% from the warehouse in the office and telling them they will be fired? They have lower numbers then us? (They were from the Philippines ) Oh well that's different they have less then 10 years you have 15 years we expect more from you.

- A lot of people note free food as a positive, I thought it was pretty crappy  a lot of the times but when you are making 25k base, any food is a pro.

- For the most part, the office is full of nice people.

- The directors in the building are excellent at their job and are excellent people.

- You can possibly make A LOT of money.","Strap in, cause this might get rocky:

- There is a group of golden people in the office that can do no wrong. They will get most of the accolades (some deserved, many others not) and they will likely be considered for any and all promotions that happen in that office. If you are not part of that club, look forward to not seeing much in re-assigns when people leave, not being given the opportunity to go on business trips, being the go-to whipping boy when you are having a bad month and generally not being happy with your time at work.

- Med/Lar requirments are not the same as SMB requirments. I would go so far to say that SMB account managers can pretty much make 5 calls a day and not be even looked at twice. If you are on the Med/Lar side of the building, if you don't make 30-40 dials a day, better get that resume ready. Having standards for people to hit is fine, if they are fair and equal within the company.

- You work in a territory and a vertical, so those vendor relationships you build are rendered useless if they are looking to pass a lead to you outside of those.

- Earned a spiff? CDW just earned 20% of it.

- Wanna take a customer out for a drink? Better make sure your manager is there to babysit you. The company is pretty much set-up to keep inside sales people inside, unless you are the top 1%.

- They preach work/life balance, but every time end of month swung around, that sure flew out the window.

In conclusion, CDW is a good company to work for is you can handle the many flaws. I am grateful to the people that helped me along the way. Just be aware that there are sharks too that will gladly go through you for a chance at a pay day."

CDW has great leadership, who set clear goals and expectations, and who then give the tools and resources to achieve them.  

CDW is highly respected in our industry(IT) by our Partners.  Our strong reputation with our partners leads to more business and better service to our customers

The pay and benefits are excellent(though it takes time to build your sales and thus your income.)  One of my favorite benefits, which never makes it into the benefits section of the job description, is the way we are cared for in the office.  We are constantly being fed, clothed(vendors provide work polos and pullovers) and entertained(outings, happy hours, trips and other events.)  

We are better trained and better prepared than any of our competitors which shows to our customers and helps us to win their trust and to earn more business from them... which in turn helps me make more money  We build strong relationships with our customers, with our partners, with our community and with each other.

As an Account Manager, I love the account ownership model and the fact there is no cap to commissions.  CDW puts a great deal of trust in its account managers and allows us to run our business as we see fit(with in reason)  

Lastly this is the one place I have ever worked where when the management says they want to see work life balance, they mean it.  I have never had an encounter with anyone who asked me to put my job before my family","THIS JOB IS BY NO MEANS EASY,  It requires a lot of hard work, but does come with its rewards(see above)

From time to time there are process put in place that do not make sense, at least from my perspective, and those are usually easily resolved, or at least explained with satisfaction.

We have a large number of products and work with a great number of vendors so it can be daunting to learn to work with all of them and to get them to work together.

Lastly financial success at CDW takes time.  Early in my career I did not make a lot of money.  I had to  work and be patient to get my book built up to the point where I needed it to be... It was however very clear that if I stuck to it I would exceed my expectations."

It has really opened my eyes to getting a job involving technology. The thing I enjoy most about it is that technology is always changing. Another pro is that you get to build a lot of relationships around campus. These connections help you more than you think. Also by meeting with different customers around campus it has helped me build my public speaking skills while also learning some key characteristics I need to take to my job in the future. Overall the biggest pro to this internship has to be How flexible it is. I love being able to make the meetings on my own time. This makes it easy to have an internship while also being able to stay focused on school work.,There really are no cons to this job!

I experienced great management, but I understand this can vary depending on which team you get assigned to.

Good culture, great perks and free events. 

Fast-paced job. On some days you will be so busy working with different customers the day will fly by before you know it. Some may not see this as a pro...","They tell you this in the interview, but the first year is extremely tough. You will experience failures before you start to see the benefits/success.

The base salary is extremely low and it takes some time before your commission checks get to where you want them to be.

In such a large company with so many account managers, you can sometimes feel like just a number.

Tough to advance to different roles other than Account Manager."

I am only a supervisor, yet I routinely have opportunities to interact with SVP's and executive leadership.  The culture not only allows for change, it promotes change... fixing things that are ""broken"" is typically impossible in companies this size;  that's not the case at CDW... There is an sentiment here that, while things are very good, they could be better - and we are all responsible & empowered to change things & fix things.","health benefits are mediocre.  Growth of the services segment is coming mainly through use of more contractors, which limits some of the ""team"" atmosphere to services groups.  Being public equates to the classic Q-end push to sell anything that's not bolted down"
1958,CDW,HigherED Scavenger Hunt,2015-07-21,5.0,Field Account Representative,"This position lets you grow as a person and learn new things on a daily basis. I work closely with very friendly employees that help me achieve success in my position. The position pushes your comfort zone sometimes which is something that I really like. Although I am an student intern who works from the University Missouri, I had to the chance to visit the downtown office in Chicago. The office environment was awesome. Everyone is super friendly and it seems like a great work place.","As of now, I honestly can say that I don't have any cons to this position."
1959,CDW,Inside Sales,2015-07-21,5.0,,"CDW boasts a great management team. Everyone is knowledgeable, friendly and very supportive.  Ongoing training occurs daily at CDW. If you love technology this is a great place to work.","There are well over 1,000 products in the CDW catalog. Feeling competent to talk about this vast array of products can be daunting.  Building a book of good business can easily take several years. However, CDW is very upfront about this challenge in the interview process."
1960,CDW,Corporate Account Manager,2015-07-21,5.0,Account Manager,"1) The training. Very in depth, you basically go through 3 separate phases of training for about 6 months until you are released to work with your team. They have a great structure. Training focuses on learning the technology they sell, how to sell, and how to utilize the wide immense of resources CDW has.

2) Culture- having worked in multiple different positions, it was refreshing to be somewhere where there was no office politics going on. Everyone seems to get along, and they do a great job of establishing a positive atmosphere. Managers don't micromanage (unless you get a rare one that does)

3) Perks- So many benefits and perks that come with working here. From discounts, to networking events, to constantly having partners and CDW supply food for their workers. Prizes for selling certain things as well.

4) Definitely the best inside sales job in the market. It is relationship-consultative selling, so after a year-2 years most of the job is just servicing your accounts.

5) Opportunities to move into different roles (if you are goof at your job obviously)","It is fairly stressful at first, lot of information to learn and can be information overload. They pay your first 3-5 months is going to not so good, but if you have the patience to learn and become eligible for commission, you will start seeing the rewards

With there being so much food offered, it can add up quickly."
1961,CDW,Intern- Hourly,2015-07-20,4.0,Intern,"The internship is flexible and fun. You learn a lot and meet so many new people. Every day is a new day that you get to create, and if you like technology and sales it is even better","Not necessarily for those who enjoy working in an office setting, depending on your personality. That said anyone can have fun and be successful at this internship"

1964,CDW,Worst Company Ever,2015-07-17,1.0,Account Manager,"The only good thing about this job was the amount of free clothing, food, and trinkets from vendors.","This company is a disaster. They pay all their sales staff at a base salary that is completely below a standard rate of living.  In a sales role this normally would not be bad. However, they have an awful commission structure, meaning you will never make any money.  They do not factor in what segment you are in.  So you get the same commission rate whether you are in small business or federal.  Unfortunately, unless you get a job in the federal segment, you will never make any money.  Even when hitting your goal, your commission checks are nothing and are usually never seen after taxes and benefits.  

After the money situation, this has to be the most mis-managed and unprofessional environment.  During my employment with CDW, I had the most harassment and sexual harassment that I have ever seen in a work place.  I would get depressed thinking about having to go into work and wonder what type of harassment I would face that day.  I mentioned it to management on multiple occasions (over ten times in five months).  My manager's boss told her to address this to HR and she never did so.  She also told me that there was nothing that could be done.  Then I brought up to another boss, but he just participated in the behavior.  I was told every day that I should not be getting married due to my age and asked every day if I was pregnant (I am not).  People would come in hung over all day and spend their days trying to hook up with other co-workers.  They would talk about your body.  Nearly every day the office put the hard working, kind receptionist in tears for doing her job. 

When I finally quit and had the opportunity to share with HR the terrible experiences I had, they begged me to stay.  The day after I quit, the Director for my location and segment called me and asked me to come back.  This made me so angry.  If the company had addressed serious issues and worked on a making the environment professional, they would not of lost me.  

I urge you to re-consider before accepting a position with this company.  The only people who belong at this company are kids who are still living off their parents money, without a college degree, who only care about getting drunk and having sex, and who do not know the difference between an office environment and a zoo."

Ingredients:

Ego
Selfishness 
Greed
Insecurity

1st, be selfish and take someone's ideas are share without recognizing your team member. 

2nd, boost your ego with a locker room culture and hand shake deals.

These people literally do nothing and wait for people to leave to get accounts, and they get them and coast. Depending on your segment, your team, your manager it can be limiting in your growth. This is a big reason they lose talent and customers wonder why they are switching AMs every year. The base obviously can be better for AM.

2047,CDW,The glass ceiling on glassdoor,2015-05-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Donuts on Fridays.  Quite a few smart, capable managers do care, but have no power to defend their teams or get the resources they need.  Wait, that's a con, isn't it?","CDW is beholden to shareholders.  I've been watching customers walk out after more than 10-15 years as customers.  If you are not the biggest of the big, CDW will not-give-a-crap until you get fed up and leave.  I recently had a customer tell me they found better service from another company at 1/3rd the price of CDW.
For the last 3 years CDW has refused to maintain a head count on teams that has worked for longer than a decade to keep teams both sane and productive.  Recently, one of the sales guys (the ones that wine, dine, and lie to potential customers, as well as promise vapor-ware to get them to sign contracts, told a coworker ""We are not a cheap company."").  Funny they should say that since we've recently partnered with TekSystems to outsource level 1 tech support to India.  If we're going to charge top tier prices for services and products, we should at least be somewhat capable of providing top tier services.
If you are not being hired in management or sales, you will be a contractor.  Thanks to these and other policies, the team I work on went from no contractors to 66% contractors in 3 years.  Then, corporate complained that we use too many contractor hours and demanded that we cut our contractor hours by 50%.  Our team of 22 is now down to 12 across 3 locations and our metrics have tanked, and corporate can't fathom why.
There are some amazing perks and opportunities... if you are in sales and work in Vernon Hills.  The people that deal with the BS which sales fabricates get squat. (Corporate cruise?  Not if you actually work hard for a living.)
Also, it's a class system here.  If you are in managed services, you are lower class.  Field and business services are upper class.  Of course, just like the real world, the upper class could not exist without the lower class.
The ""cons"" I could tell you if it didn't violate an NDA, not that CDW pays me enough to have anything left to take in a lawsuit.  IF YOU ARE PROMOTED, THERE IS AN ARBITRARY RAISE CAP OF 10%.  SO IF YOU WORK HARD AT THE BOTTOM LEVEL, YOU CAN NEVER MAKE WHAT SOMEONE HIRED AT THE TOP MAKES."

2102,CDW,Inside Sales Account Manager review after 3.5 years,2015-03-12,4.0,Executive Account Manager,"This is truly a great company and it is what you make of it! Showing up to work every day doing the same thing over and over again will not get you very far or get you to where you want to be financially. You've got to be very ambitious, hard working, free thinking and quick on your feet - unfortunately most people in this country do not meet any of these....especially the hard working part! I came into this job with a determined attitude and told myself I'm going to work harder than anyone else. I typically spend 12-14 hours a day working - not because I have to, because I want to...I want to beat my competition! Unwillingness to work outside of 9am-5pm is a reason so many do not find success in this position. By my third full year here I positioned myself to earn a substantial amount of money year after year. While most were complaining I was working. While most were going to lunch I was working. Point being, if you're willing to put in the time and effort you can succeed and do well. Unlike most other comments regarding base salary, I wish it were lower than $25k! High risk means high reward! 

There are unlimited amounts of resources at this company - whether internal or from the manufacturers themselves. It all falls on the shoulders of the rep if they're having issues or problems. Be accountable and don't expect everyone to do everything for you. Be a free thinker, think outside of the box and get it done!","Operations should be penalized/pay docked if they make mistakes that costs the reps/company money. There's no accountability for these positions. Nearly every day I spend too much time double checking the work of operations to ensure they did their jobs correctly. Numerous times they've made mistakes and it wastes my time to review and point out to them - or an order goes out incorrectly and hurts me financially. If their compensation were tied to performance, like it is in sales, then they would hopefully be more thorough and detail oriented,"

So outdated as well. I would bring in 100k of business in a day EMAILING people who I had relationships with and they'd put my phone time in the red. Join 2015 essentially."
2130,CDW,"Could be better, Could be worse, overall not good.",2015-01-30,2.0,Account Manager,"CDW is a great company. I love all of the people I work with, and i have a very nice and caring direct manager who is very helpful with day to day things.

Tons of resources to help you sell.

The more tenured co workers are very helpful as well. 
Lots of free breakfasts/lunches and happy hours from vendors. 
Lots of money can be made if you get the right manager and right accounts and stick around long enough

Great industry to be in, I have learned a TON. Great training program as well. 

Paid time off is good. Benefits are OK.","I'll try not to go on too much, but so much favoritism, butt kissing, and politics go on here. The amount of calls you make, and how long you are on the phone are monitored each day. People cheat the system by calling fax machines and voicemails all day, and get praised for it because it looks like they made a lot of calls with a lot of talk time. People call their family and friends and get credit for the talk time and calls. And people get rewarded accounts for it, right in front of my face. Seems like the only way to keep up is to do the same thing, which I don't do currently and will never do. Then for the people who are making legit calls but not ""as many"" as the people who aren't, get emails from management saying ""This is not acceptable, time to step it up"". Managers only care about hitting their goal, and don't care if you are profitable or not come the end of the month. 

I've seen people get rewarded accounts that come in after me and leave before me every day, and that i am consistently selling more than, and/or working harder than. But it goes back to cheating the system in that ""They make more calls than me"" because CDW is too big of a company to go in and check everyones calls to see if they are legit or not. 

A lot of luck is involved, first day on the sales floor a fellow new co worker got a $40k order before even talking to the customer, and got praised and rewarded for it. 

Management plays favorites. But this goes on at every company. 

Base pay is unbelievably low. 25K, non negotiable. Been the same since 1990. I feel like a huge dummy for turning down 35K and 40K bases from other companies. 

I often feel like a dog in a cage, it's a slow paced environment. 

Happy hours and lunches are nice, but they don't pay the bills. 

Expected to make 40 outbounds a day, but kind of hard when I only have 35 accounts to call into, and prospecting is mostly a waste of time because there are so many people who have the same territory as myself. 

Overall it's not the ideal job if you want to live on your own and do things you enjoy, simply because it is not affordable. Luckily I had plenty of money saved before I started at CDW. 

I'll be leaving when the right opportunity comes along."
2131,CDW,Great company,2015-01-29,4.0,,"Culture, People, learning center, management and pretty much everything else you can think of.",Low starting salary compared to industry.
2132,CDW,Love working for CDW,2015-01-28,5.0,IT Architect,Great benefits package.  The onboarding process is very streamlined.  Coworkers are eager to help new employees get up to speed.  Managers allow you to explore and learn the first 90 days without micro managing your daily schedule.  You are encouraged to walk around and say hello to coworkers and learn the business.  Many opportunities to learn about new technology and trends.  I was allowed to use a decommissioned server blade for testing at home. I felt that I was a part of my team the first week.  If I had an issue gaining access to something my coworkers and immediate manager worked quickly to address it.  Senior management took time to introduce me to key professionals across the IT organization.  I find the work culture is great and responsive to the business.  Their are many online training courses available for free and technology companies come into headquarters to discuss there latest software and hardware products.,I can't think of any negative issues through my first 90 days.  Love the work environment so far.
2133,CDW,Solid groundwork for a  successful career.,2015-01-27,3.0,Inside Sales Account Manager,"Free lunch, sports games, dinners, happy hours, events. Lots of fun people. Solid vacation and PTO. Great training program and knowledge if you are fresh out of school.",Very political like most corporate companies. Do not pay their employees like they should. 25k base is almost laughable for the work they expect. Commissions are great… if you stay there for 3-5 years to build your book up.
2134,CDW,Great starter job.,2015-01-26,3.0,Senior Account Manager,"Good work/life balance, ability to make great money, company culture.","Below average pay, incompetent management structure, limited room for advancement."

Fair compensation. Excellent benefits.",Leadership tends to get out of touch once in a while. Communication with direct supervisors could be better. Nothing not typical a large company.
2137,CDW,"People don't leave companies, they leave managers...",2015-01-20,4.0,Sales Manager,"- Great Company Culture and Strong Guiding Principals (The CDW Way)
- Endless Sales Resources... at time, it can be difficult to navigate the waters 
- Health Insurance is very competitive, but dental is subpar at best
- Excellent Management Team who were instrumental in my career development","- ""Process Improvements""... as soon as you learn a new operational process, it's changed and classified as a Process Improvement.  I completely understand that businesses need to change, adapt and improve, but constant changes with guise of ""improvement"" to things that weren't even broken makes it very difficult to run a business smoothly.  
- In general, people don't leave companies, they leave managers... direct managers tend to have the most influence/impact.  When reading through this and other reviews on this site, please keep in mind that they may have had a terrible manager.  I was blessed with amazing managers, who have helped me develop as an individual."
2138,CDW,Lack of structure and lack of big picture strategy,2015-01-16,1.0,Corporate Sales Operations,"Employees are innovative because there is basically no structure.
Lots of food which is bad if you don't want to gain weight.
Employee diversity - they are very supportive of gay rights.","No structure or systems in place across the board. Get your act together! No structure may have worked 20 years ago when CDW was a small company but if they expect to succeed long term they need to put some resources into building a structure or fail. 

Big egos in middle to upper management - please leave your egos at the door. You're not that great. Sometimes I snicker inside or cringe in embarrassment at some of the self-appraising statements I hear. This group (middle to upper management) are way more unprofessional than other large companies I've worked for. It appears they try to hire women that fit the 'mold' however they tend to be high strung monsters to work for. Again, the egos at CDW tend to be out of control especially considering that no one in leadership I ever encountered attended above a tier 3 or 4 university. There is a lot of un-professionalism and nepotism in management which really kills the morale. The favoritism is rampant and to get ahead you better brown nose the right people and fit a certain mold.

Revolving door in sales - VERY HIGH turnover. You never know when your 'coworker' or manager is just going to disappear one day. The company fires people for stupid reasons - usually it's political. They must have to pay a lot of unemployment compensation. Employees feel like there is an invisible hatchet over their neck - not a great way to promote good employee morale. In fact, it seems it's counterproductive. I have seen really good account managers start to fail when they're 'scolded' for inconsequential issues. 

Strategic big-picture thinking is not encouraged. Instead there is a lot of micromanaging and focus on unimportant details while missing the big picture completely. 

An immature culture - lower/middle management does a lot of finger-pointing and blaming. Lots of nice, hardworking people have had to leave the company because a woman above them has control issues. Make sure when you promote a 'coworker' to be a people manager that the power over others doesn't go to their head. Also, start making them accountable for what goes on under them. A failing employee is usually due to a lack of clear direction and the ability to motivate and grow. Treating human beings the same way you'd treat your dog when they have an accident in the house is demeaning!!! I have also noticed a lot of condescending management styles and the use of humiliation to correct errors. Not a great way to get the best from your employees and it makes it very awkward for coworkers like me that cringe when we see this. Remember it's not just stressful for you and the person being 'scolded like a child' - it's very stressful for others around them. Be professional and take care of this stuff behind closed doors. Embarrassment and demeaning adults = bad management. Childish behavior from people in management should NOT be encouraged.  

The communications in this company are horrible! Not only do we rarely hear anything to explain company goals by the executives but when I have seen communications, I cringe at the grammatical errors and inability to articulate strategy clearly. Seriously the entire top tier of CDW needs some housecleaning!!! 

I really don't see this company succeeding long term."
2139,CDW,Total lack of leadership and communication of company strategy.,2015-01-16,2.0,Senior Account Manager,"If you're in sales as an account manager or field account manager and above, it's a great company to start out with. Unfortunately they have changed their commission and goals to where other companies pay better.
Sales driven company.
Many days you will not have to buy lunch or breakfast when you're in sales. 
It's a great company to start out. However, because of the low pay, only the mediocre and the complacent sales people stay.","Since I've been here, I have seen very little communication from leadership compared to other companies I've worked for. Usually leadership communication is used to motivate sales teams and get us revved up. At CDW you'll rarely hear anything from someone above your immediate manager unless you make an error. I feel the lack of communications of the company strategy is going to hurt this company in the long run.
The pay is very low compared to competitors. In fact, I have been recruited by a competitor and will be leaving CDW principally because of the low pay.
For some reason the company is always having trouble computing commissions correctly. If you're smart, you keep track since you will probably notice your commissions are lower than they should be. 
It's a very political company. There are hundreds of employees who have been with the company from the beginning. Unfortunately, while they have experience in how CDW works, they will be lacking in a lot of skills and experience necessary to make it in the majority of large US corporations.
Outside of sales, management is generally poor. Because many of these people worked their way up the ranks, they lack some of the professionalism I have encountered in other companies. I have noticed immaturity and a lot of finger-pointing rather than accountability. Outside of sales, there is a general lack of training and employees are told to watch videos that have little or nothing to do with one's job. 
Overall, I will happy to leave even though I did learn a lot."

CDW has a good structure and framework for growing their employees.  Training is a constant.  CDW has a culture that works hard, gives to charities, encourages team work, provides its people the opportunity to build strong networks, and wants everyone to be successful.  The leadership and management are very accessible.  As an organization, there is a solid support infrastructure for both customers and coworkers.   If you are willing to put in your time and have a desire to learn, there are opportunities to do well and grow.  The company as a whole has great values and very talented people who are committed. You become a part of the CDW family.","Just like every organization, CDW does have some quirks.  You will need to learn how to navigate within the organization.  It can be a very big company and keeping up with change can be daunting.  Compensation ranges from ""average"" to ""can be good"" for most people.  For a very few amount of people, the compensation can be considered ""awesome"" which leads to the fact that there are many organizations that may pay better.   These terms are all relative however if you're a top performer no matter your position, you may then begin to question your compensation.  The trade off maybe better monetary compensation verses a great support infrastructure.  You are now a part of the CDW family."

2152,CDW,Account Manager Review,2014-12-12,2.0,Account Manager,I have been a public sector Account Manager for 7 years.  In a sales role you will not be micro-managed.  There is the potential to make well over $100k if you end up in the correct segment.,Based salary is half of the industry standard.  If you sell in the Public sector you must pay all the contract fees and freight out of your commissions; something they don't tell you in the recruiting process. It is nearly impossible for AM's to switch segments once hired.  The training program does not teach you what you really need to know to be successful and their CRM tool is buggy and unstable.  Limited travel to meet with your customers.

CDW's management is always focused on being a few steps ahead of the market which makes me feel very comfortable about long term potential with CDW.",Working in CDW's professional service organization has the same drawbacks of working for any other IT consulting organization.

Because of this there exists some tension between the engineering teams and the sales teams.  Very often our customers are sold a package that leaves the engineer scratching their heads.  It seems like the sales team is looking after their own bottom line and not the customer. There needs to be better communication between sales and engineering teams for this company to be taken to the next level.  It's not all about the bottom line."

There is a lot of incentive if you are doing everything you can to close deals, but the biggest battle comes from fighting the internal processes in order to make money.

Very inexperienced supervisors, CDW is usually the only company they've ever worked which makes it very difficult for people who come in with a lot of experience.
I've observed a lot of childish behavior and infighting which makes it an uncomfortable place to work at times. Immaturity seems to be part of the culture and widely accepted. 
Outside of sales, the training is disorganized and lacking. 
Too much favoritism although that's probably everywhere. 
I wish leadership would walk their talk. 
Not enough work/life balance. We were forced to take an unpaid hour lunch. I would have rather cut that in half and go home earlier. It made for a long day with a long commute."

This is not necessarily a con, but it permeates everything and is a big part of the culture.  Even if you don't work in a sales role per se, you have to understand and embrace the philosophy or you will not get anywhere.  
Some politics and infighting between divisions (about as much as you would expect for a company of this size).
Competition for internal management positions is incredibly tough, especially for anyone wants to make the leap to management from individual contributor (again, what you might expect at a Fortune 500 company).
Mentoring is encouraged but spotty at best -- if you want a mentor other than your immediate supervisor, you really have to network and hunt for one on your own.

Your manager can make or break your career. If you get stuck with a bad one, hopefully you recognize it early and you transfer to a different department as soon as you can.

They have a focused effort to devalue the role of account manager and have consistently been stepping down compensation more drastically in recent years.  The caliber of people they've hired the last five years is really, really bad, so a lot of your coworkers are there because nobody else will hire them and they're willing to work for $25k.  The fact that they've hired a lot of terrible people recently has also had a bad effect on morale.  It's never been lower since I started.  Even people making top dollar hate their jobs.

(except for the hiring process)
Great sense of team work. The company strongly encourages team work where everybody contributes.","The onboarding process is a bit overwhelming. Too much information, too many internal processes to learn. Redundant and outdated information throughout the material. (But it is an one time process so it's not that bad)."

Many times you get free lunch hosted by company partners. Young environment and you get to wear jeans on Friday. You also get to work downtown in the loop.,"Low base salary, strict management who don't understand for 25K base salary many people simply don't care. Getting stricter and more micromanaging, including pipelining, forecasting, and monthly meetings with boss."
2249,CDW,CDW is the first company I have worked for that rewards you for putting in extra effort.,2014-06-24,5.0,Senior Account Manager,CDW allows me to work the way I want to work and the schedule that works best for me. This has been the first company that I have worked at that rewards you for going the extra mile. I control my paycheck and management helps me reach my personal goals. CDW has allowed me to turn a job into a career.,"Just like all sales organizations, jealousy and frustration tend to haunt less performing employees. Management does work in great effort to show those individuals where they are struggling and how to change in order to become successful."
2250,CDW,Geat company and good support by management,2014-06-24,4.0,Account Manager,"Always selling a different product.  Therefore, required to learn about a new and interesting technology.

The Chandler office has a great culture –fast paced and results driven. Hard work is rewarded and top performers in sales earn a lot of money. The company offers a great classroom training program and ongoing curriculum for leadership and personal development.  Coworkers are dedicated to improving the business and our corporate environment. It’s common to see your peers volunteer their time to increase opportunities around work/life balance and professional development. Lots of fun opportunities to give back and volunteer with a variety of charities. CDW offers tuition reimbursement, vacation time, free lunches/outings, subsidized gym memberships, dry cleaning delivery, mother’s nursing rooms, and a free dietitian. Overall the people and our leadership teams that work here are fantastic!",Sales is not for everyone. This is a culture that requires a strong work ethic and you are responsible for your performance.

2255,CDW,Terrific organization with tons of opportunities.,2014-06-12,5.0,Sales,"If you want to be a career “sales guy” and you stick it out as an Account Manager, you can make a ton of money.  It certainly takes a ton of hard work, dedication, and perseverance, but it has been proven to work time and time again.  Pretty much every “sales class” that comes through has a top performer clearing 6 digits after about 3-4 years.  There are certainly people who don’t do very well and don’t “make it”, but that is usually due to a lack of dedication and/or laziness.  And yes, the average person makes a good living and sees continued income growth, it just takes longer to make the big bucks.  
Between the vendor rewards, the free food, the give-aways, team outings, etc. there are hundreds of reasons to love this place while you bust your butt each day to earn your commission.  If you don’t want to just stay in sales, there are tons of opportunities to go to other groups and/or departments.  The key is that you need a good 3 years of sales success under your wing first.","This is a sales job.  There is cold calling.  You do need to do a ton of research and prospecting in order to find qualified leads.  However, success does come to those with patience and those who keep truly working hard.  It is not for everybody, but if this is the type of sales job you want and/or you love technology, CDW does it the best, gives you the best resources, and gives you the best chance of succeeding."
2256,CDW,My experience was amazing!,2014-06-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Constant follow up.  Upbeat and exciting,Not one con comes to mind.  Best experience I have ever had

2258,CDW,Plenty of career opportunities within CDW to advance in your career,2014-06-09,4.0,Senior Manager Business Systems,"The company is constantly pushing the envelope on getting results and because of that most of the years I've been here we've been successful, have exceeded our numbers and get recognized for that as well.  Even as the company has grown significantly it still feels like a small business with a family owned feel to it. There are also many opportunities to expand your career whether that's to other teams within your same department, switching to a different department all together or progressing up the chain in your department. Also, the ability to have a flexible schedule to meet work and family needs helps tremendously.",The CDW culture is a unique one and at times can be grueling between the extra hours of effort that are needed to make sure things get done and the political landscape that has to be executed just right.
2259,CDW,Worked with many companies and CDW by far holds the bar,2014-06-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Work life balance

2260,CDW,Great learning experience!,2014-06-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"CDW offers a fantastic learning experience for employees at many different levels.  There are also many perks that are available such as a work from home days, a day and Six Flags Theme Parks and various discounts on consumer products and cellular phone plans.  Salaries are fairly generous as well.",Very difficult to navigate the waters due to a large amount of bureaucracy.  To many stakeholders and it's difficult to come to a decision.
2261,CDW,Make lots of money...  for someone else,2014-06-03,2.0,Manager,"CDW has a decent work from home policy, which is a plus. We get free lunches from vendors fairly often, and the location in Chicago is great, with easy access to mass transit.

Overall, I find that the work hours are fine and there is quite a bit of flexibility, although that varies from team to team.

Finally, it's a great job to make contacts, even outside of the IT industry, as we have a vast number of customers and vendors that we work in close contact with.","First and foremost, the pay and benefits. Pay varies wildly between departments and even between people in the same position. If you're in any kind of support role, you're getting paid at 50-100% below comparable jobs in the industry. The 401K plan is rock bottom matching and it takes forever to vest. The health plans are expensive, especially for a company that has 10 billion in revenue for about 7,000 employees.

Even though the pay is low, the workload can be brutal. Lots of teams are completely understaffed, and backfills for positions can take months so CDW can cut costs. Decent IT support could make up for some of this by increasing efficiency, but CDW's IT department is poorly run and ineffective.

The pay issue might be a symptom of management's complete lack of understanding what goes on at the ground level during day-to-day operations. Decisions about how to best manage business processes seem completely arbitrary or based upon erroneous information. 

Thus, for career enhancement, you're better off focusing on cultivating the positive attention of people in upper management than on doing your job competently or displaying initiative, as no one above your direct manager will notice the latter."

- great if you have absolutely zero experience on your resume, put in a year and get out
- great potential income, if people on your team leave","- first 2-4 months are classroom training where the company tries to thin the herd and you make base salary only!
- once you get on the phones, prepare to make 80+ cold calls daily with maybe 2 of them turning into customers
- 8-5 work day, unpaid lunch, basically hourly compensation. (wanna leave 1hr early for doctors appointment? you get docked 1hr pay!)
- you have to clock in/out for work
- cannot work from home
- be prepared to receive your monthly income in the form of gift cards to stores you would never otherwise visit
- you might as well work retail cause you'll make the same amount of money
- no short term disability plan!
- backstabbing and stealing accounts is a necessity to even keep your job here!
- absolutely zero growth options, if you DO decide to apply elsewhere in the company your current supervisor starts to treat you differently

Managers did not care about work-life balance. Acted like they cared but did not.

Benefits suck. 401k pretty bad. The best will be 3% match and the worst can be 0% match, no consistency. Health Plan is one of the most expensive ever with very high deductibles."

The atmosphere here is good.,"Pay is low. I know there are standards for how compensation is handled here at CDW but maybe things should change with that process, it isn't working. It feels like some folks are punished for the position they are in based on ""job title and description"" to the lower end of the pay scale and then others make out by getting rated to the higher end of the pay scale for that position.Seems kind of like a double standard in some cases. Sometimes people end up in positions they should not have especially at the management level. Seems that some folks in management get their position by default and my not be as qualified as others and they don't have the training or knowledge to be in that position.  The training program for sales reps is very deep and thought out to make them the best they can be but for backbone employees and management no effort is put into that training and maybe this should be evaluated and upgrades to training should be made.  A lot of folks feel short changed in the training area. We are a tech company but the equipment that we are provided sometimes is not the best."

A revamped program that provides new AMs with classroom and specialized new hire sales teams to train with.

As far as the atmosphere I'd describe it as ""Frat like"", fairly laid back and a bit of a party atmosphere.",There isn't much upwards mobility to be had for sales employees - limited management and unclear lateral moves.

I have interviewed for a few other jobs during that time but most were going to pay the same or less and I would have to travel more.  Sales positions have the ability to make good money if you stick it out a few years and work hard.  Work/Life balance has gotten much better in the last 5 years or so.

There is a lot of turnover among the new sales account managers as they tend to be right out of college with unrealistic expectations of working 9-5 and making 6 figures right away.  
There is a huge difference in the quality of the first level of managers.  Many are great but some shouldn't be in charge of managing a 5 year old's birthday party.  There are also so many managers now that the chance of getting promoted beyond that is slim.   A lot of sales managers have left recently for greener pastures.  
The bureaucracy now is much worse than it used to be and sometimes it is difficult to get anything done."

All Sr. Leaders are extremely approachable and here you will be working directly with them and they will come directly to you.  There is very little ""red-tape"" that one has to go through.  With that being said, those who are not able to effectively communicate to leaders may have challenges, but those who succeed, will move up fast.","The organization at times is what I would call very ""siloed""  It is difficult to move across teams or groups, but on a good note, it is mostly due to leaders wanting to hold on to their talent.

-Luck of the draw on account territory - The hiring class will tell you what segment your territory will be (med/lar, state/local gov, federal gov, education, ect.), but it's luck of the draw on accounts. You will be given a set of named accounts that could be full of potential or locked out of doing business, and the expectation is to grow that set while bringing on net new customers.

However, I still believe CDW is a good place to work and there are plenty of perks that other companies do not offer.","CDW sells 100,000 different products, and that's a lot to know.

Always something new to learn and teams are competitive.,Low base salary compared to other sales jobs. Working in a team environment is fun and helpful but there is quite a bit of childish gossip which gets old. Customers can be taken without warning so you waste a lot of time monitoring your accounts and explaining over and over again why you deserve to keep working with your assigned customers.
2357,CDW,Good Experience Right Out Of College...Awful After That,2014-02-19,2.0,Inside Sales Account Manager,"I worked at CDW in Vernon Hills back in 1998 when they started to get serious about growing/hiring. I was part of the first big training class with the company going through serious changes.  The initial training was excellent.  It was ""get your stuff together and pass these tests or we aren't hiring you"" type of attitude.  Several people in my group of 60 didn't make the cut.  As a result, I still use a good portion of the computer training and information they taught me today.  CDW is huge and vendors do whatever they can to win over the sales reps at CDW.  As a result, you get a ton of free stuff. One day I was called in to my manager's office and Reggie Jackson was there.  They asked me if I wanted a memory chip or his autograph on a ball. It was October and the decision was easy.","CDW is a well oiled corporate machine.  You will not make it here if you don't know about corporate structure, micro managing, meetings, ridiculous sales goals, etc.  This is in inside sales gig.  You are expected to sit at your desk, all day, and make calls.  It can be exhausting and the pay can be difficult.  Competition inside and outside CDW to sell all things computer has to be recognized."
2358,CDW,It is a great place to work with a great management team,2014-02-17,4.0,Account Manager,"best training in the industry, learn a lot about a lot of different tech.

2359,CDW,I hope your manager likes you,2014-02-17,2.0,Account Manager,"Good foot in the door to industry, with industry tech leaders. Free lunches and perks from partners. No ceiling on commissions.","Culture has changed drastically in the five years or so I have been here. They fire or force veterans out the door and hire kids straight out of college like clockwork. Most will quit in a year or so, however some will stay and make good money. This however is very dependent on whether management likes you. Hit your goals yearly and grow accounts? They don't care so much. Laugh at the bosses jokes, pretend to work, secretly throw coworkers under the buss.. you'll be rewarded handsomely. The inequality in distribution of accounts, advanced training, and opportunities is simply gross.

$25K base is really weak, especially in metro areas like NY. Salary becomes a draw after four years. This exemplifies the approach of this company towards it's people. Instead of investing in employees and encouraging development and retention; they let everyone either sink or swim."

Lots of freebies given out and there are some amazing training programs for various technology systems you can take advantage of.  Definitely, take advantage of the certs.  Also, building relationships with your clients and helping them out with their IT needs is a rewarding experience.  I tended to go out of my way just to make my consistent clients happy; that's a great feeling.","There is a lot of cold calling to begin with, and if you're not comfortable with that, this is not the place for you.  Being successful really depends on the region you are in and the support from your team when you first arrive.  I, unfortunately, was lacking in both of those arenas and my temporary team leader was not all too helpful in terms of training, support, and being able to effectively progress our personal business with the clients.  I felt more like a telemarketer rather than a salesman. CDW hires A LOT of people right out of college and the turnover rate is enormous. Six months in less than half of my initial training team was there and morale was pretty low.  That's how they weed people out (and find their talent).  Also, territorial disputes between your own team members is pretty common.  Many coworkers on my regional team had this, ""I have mine, I don't care about you"" attitude on the team.  They were focused more on making their money on their paycheck (commission) rather than trying to build a stronger team."

They really help you to be able to get the most out of the job by sales training.",Lots of rejection in this line of work but once you learn to get passed that and turn the rejection into a customer you're set.
2372,CDW,You get what you make out of it.,2014-01-29,3.0,Account Manager,Great culture in a pretty high stress environment.   Great training program and fantastic place to start a sales career.,IT sales is a pretty saturated market.    Everyone account under the sun has either been worked or currently belongs to someone.   Many sales managers are old timers who started at the company in the 1990's that have mailed it in awhile ago.   They have no passion for actually managing teams and developing careers.
2373,CDW,Little by little getting worse and worse,2014-01-28,3.0,Executive Account Manager,Its generally a fun place to be at.  Nobody is too demanding.  You have the opportunity to make a lot of money for what you do.,"Absolutely no standards in hiring, enforcement of policies, etc.  Almost every week for the last six months they've had another announcement that is a negative to the sales floor.   It definitely lacks the feeling it did as a company 10 years ago, people aren't PROUD to work at CDW like they once were.  No holiday parties, no anything reall."
2374,CDW,Account Manager at CDW,2014-01-26,4.0,Account Manager,"It is a great atmosphere to work in and there are a lot of free stuff from vendors.  Lots of free food, shirts, and other misc. stuff.  The people are also a huge plus.  For the most part, everyone is always wanting you to succeed and helpful along the way.  The job part is hard (maybe should be in the cons section) but worth it at the end of the day.  When I started, the cold calling and outbounds in general were the toughest part of the job.  I got hung up on and got “not interested right now” or “we are currently working with someone else and are happy with them” very often.  While it is frustrating, if you keep working hard and stick with it, it pays off.  Now I have a lot of different customers wanting to talk to me and know that when they see my number calling, they pick up because they know I have something to add value to them.  I don’t make the huge $$$ or at least not yet (currently live at home if that gives you an understanding of my income) but after working here 1 1/2 years, I can see the hard work paying off.  Also, there are many ways to further your career if you decide sales isn’t the best fit for you.","Sales isn’t easy and you don’t start off on the same pay structure as other sales segments.  I am in the MedLar segment and I know that the Healthcare, Small Business, and Government segments have different pay structures and some are better than the others.  Putting all of them on the same pay structure would level the playing field as I know that while many co-workers that have left CDW BECAUSE of the income, they would have stayed had they not been not the MedLar’s pay structure.  I’m not saying everyone is entitled to make the huge bucks right out of the gate but I do know that the Government sales sector has a much more lucrative commission structure than the other segments.  If all the segments had the same commission payout grid, I think turnover wouldn’t be so high."

Great internal sales programs,/systems, incentives and perks.","Lots of turf infighting between sales, managed services and professional services.

Great opportunities as well as opportunity for compensation.  Coworkers are extremely accessible to help make new career easy to acclimate to.,"The only thing that is a negative so far is the size of the organization and being a remote employee.  It's hard to be able to identify everything needed for the job, but it will all come with time and understanding."

The job itself was great and working with new clients was amazing.,A lot of red tape. Since the company is so large it is hard to get some things done for your customer which makes it really frustrating.

Manager is constantly up your rear if you don't complete an immense amount of work within the timetable given. 6 hours on the phone, two hours on online chats and case work review and all while answering customer emails and reviewing cases. Cases cases caes. You have to complete 30 a day, review 50 and touch a total of 100 overall.

I guess after you get use to it it's ok but everyone that works there has been for years and if you don't get something right the first time they look at you like your stupid. Very mean and many times a manager would call some of us dumb or stupid. But he meant well. The head of our department was a back pain freak and would always complain and would always catch an attitude about many things but the turn over rate was high. No one wanted to work like that for 17 an hour. Great experience but I would never go back to that job again if they called to rehire me."
2381,CDW,Emotional roller-coaster filled with learning and relationships.,2014-01-10,3.0,Corporate Account Manager,"This company can offer you some invaluable experience especially right out of college. The training is amazing with free certifications and the people you will meet are incredible. You will be placed in front of companies that value your business and will sponsor lunch and learns, raffle prizes and give you incentives to selling their products. You will certainly be successful with this company if you utilize your resources correctly and have the ability to network.

Absolutely a great company to come to right out of college or high school if you have the skills to learn, listen and communicate effectively.","CDW is not for someone who is trying to support a family with absolutely no source of income coming in or money saved in the bank already. I say this because it takes time to create and maintain these relationships with these businesses, so you have to have patience and a strong determination to succeed. If you are a parent or in a bad financial situation coming to this company expecting to make a stable paycheck immediately is unlikely, but has happened in the chance of luck and a lot of skill. Make sure to be prepared for the unsteady months of consistent pay because for some the journey to a comfortable lifestyle will be long unless you don't stop and work smarter and harder than your peers!

A lot of people would picture this company as an EXCELLENT job for people who are still living at home with their parents or this is just fun for them because their bills are paid. A lot of tenured account managers whom started with the company 7+ years ago, they will openly tell you to give the job a year and then you'll start to see the potential. For some people you can't wait a full year when you have bills piling up now!

High turnover rate because of $25k base, commission is not the greatest."

This was not met (about $180,000). Once on the team, was informed would be considered 'acquisition' meaning bringing new business in. After a year in a saturated market have maxed out new opportunities (about $1,000,000) in acquisition business. Numbers not enough to convince manager to give more opportunities within existing accounts. Very political and based on managers agenda. Not really a 'team' environment at all--every person for themselves."

2508,CDW,Amazing Career...If you are willing to work for it,2013-09-12,5.0,Solutions Architect,You are able to build a network across the IT industry and beyond as long as you put in the effort. Compensation is a direct reflection of effort and skill. Some may say account books are based on tenure. If you have lasted 10-15 years its because you survived that long while others didn't and were able to build a book of business.,Many people are allowed to remain due to tenure even though they aren't cutting it which makes the large opportunity customers locked in with someone not working hard to grow the business and others miss out on the opportunity to take it over.

- Supervisory-level management is pretty good.
- Good technical environment for entry-level new hires.
- If you like a steady, somewhat stodgy business culture, this is the place for you.","- Lack of leadership and vision at the mid-to-upper levels of management.
- Hardware/software VAR business is not a long term growth business.
- Not exactly an agile business environment.
- Very little effort made at providing career advancement opportunities.
- A lot of group-think.
- This is not a company looking to solve big challenges.
- For a company that ""Get's IT"", they are actually quite slow at adopting new technologies.   A good example is that most internal web sites only really work well with Internet Explorer.  That might have been okay 10 years ago.  But it's totally lame in today's (technical) environment.
- Somewhat related to the previous points.  CDW is not really a technology company.  The vast majority of their revenue is derived from hardware/software sales.  It's a commodities business (akin to selling sugar, pork bellies, or crude oil).  This isn't necessarily a con, but new hires should understand the business model they signing up for."

You can eventually make decent money IF you have the right territory...otherwise you will need to apply for government assistance because the base pay is extremely low.
Good benefits.","They leave very important points out during the interview. First, they do not tell you after your third year they deduct your base salary from your commission. Second, they do not tell your manager keeps a portion of your spiffs (additional money paid by manufacturers for selling their products) 

You are looked down on if you do not spend an extra two or three hours a day working FOR FREE.

During the interview with management, they give you the impression their intention is to help you succeed. However once you start working you are immediately told by management they can not help you because they are too busy trying to make money and closing deals with the already successful reps.

You are also given the impression CDW has above average work ethic, but again this is false. I quickly learned the worst thing you can do is put in the effort to do things properly. So you should just call anyone and put any account in your book, whether it qualifies or not. Because if your numbers don't ""please"" your manager, you will not get any accounts from your manager.

The system is extremely outdated and cluttered. Trying to find workable accounts is like trying to find clear marbles in the ocean.

CDW has a reputation of being the highest vendor in the industry and it's getting more difficult to sell, because customers are not willing to buy the ""value"" at a higher price...

It’s basically an extension of college.  I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that it was fun.  Unfortunately, that is really where the benefits end.  The sales training was mediocre, but the technology training was very well done.  Get 18-24 months experience then get out.","The two biggest issues here are compensation and poor middle management.  For HiEd, K-12, Healthcare, S+L, and MedLar you are based at $25,000k.  This doesn’t change depending on seniority or performance.  Commission is 10% of GP unless you have about $40k in profit for the month.  At that point your base drops out and you get 16-21% depending on the total GP.  To put this in perspective here are some numbers of a typical AM who has been there for 2-4 years;  You sell $250,000 in a month at 8% GP netting $20,000 profit for the company and in $2,000 in commissions for you.  If you do that every month you will earn $24,000 in commission and $25,000 in base for $49,000/year.  You aren’t poor by any means, but it is far below industry averages and around 30% of what they claim during the interview.  To top it off, if you fall behind 80% attainment of goal they don’t pay commission.  They try to hide this from new hires so if you are just starting ask about it.  Goals are often set a few days before the end of the month so this can be a surprise $2-3k hit. If it happens once or twice during busy season then you may quickly end up at $40,000 for the year instead of $50,000.

	Management is made up primarily of people hired from 1998-2005.  In 2006 the company nearly doubled its sales staff so anyone with experience who wanted to be a manager got the job.  This resulted in a lot of under qualified and under motivated individuals in management.  To compound the issues, a lot of the people they started with are now on their teams.  This results in a favoritism that is toxic.  As people leave the company, their good accounts are given to the Managers friends, who then send their worst to the mid-level account managers, who take their worst and send them to the new employees.  This is a huge issue in government sales since new entities are rarely created meaning that hand downs are the only way to get new accounts."

Long term projects are cast aside for short sighted sell now strategies (you're not really an account manager, you're more like a CDW commercial with a phone).   Had several opportunities that needed counsel with tech experts, but they don't exist; they have product specialists yes, but if you come up with good solutions that take some time to develop and you'll see how little faith or trust this company puts into its employees. 

2.  No support from backbone structure of company,  I wouldn't necessarily say this is the fault of the people in the backbone team, as the amount of purchasers they have compared to the amount of account managers is sadly low.  Orders will ship from wrong locations, orders need to be processed by account managers themselves before they can move to purchasing, if something goes wrong with an order processing the account manager has to spot it before anything will happen.  Orders have problems and generally complaints fall on def ears.  This company does  not care about its customers at all.  It makes it hard to tell someone that they should buy from you when the company lies about stock availability, is the most expensive option out there, you've been given no technical training and your value proposition is ""value added IT Solutions"",and has problems with order processing (admittedly they are quick when they get an order through the system though).  

3.  No sales or technical training.  Vendors pay to give presentations about their products to large groups of AMs but its all brand specific and has very little content on solutions.  The amount of technical training you get on the job is pretty much non-existent.  They teach you basic stuff like what ram is and how to pick out hard drives, but nothing even close to useful for real world solutions while talking with someone who knows what they're talking about.  Training is offered through vendors to become more knowledgeable about these things, but, while pushing you and guilting you into work long hours, they also don't let you take this training while you're at work (you have to do it on your own time) which indicates short-sightedness and a complete lack of willingness to develop employees (something they'll preach to you in the interview process).  

4.  Terrible account protection policies, nepotism, and account jacking.  Accounts will be taken from you for no legit reason and if the AM in question is in with middle management, you can pretty much kiss it goodbye.   Accounts are reassigned to people who are family members of more senior AMs,  and, accounts which are completely underworked can be protected and sat on by senior AMs despite the dwindling number of big accounts available in Canada.   The system is incredible disorganized and archaic.  

5.  Relative to the amount of work that you have to put in, the pay is garbage.   They try and sell you on this concept of making 6 figures if you work hard.  If you work hard and your cousin is a senior AM, you'll kill it.  Otherwise, you work hard and you do okay.  Essentially, you're a telemarketer with a fancy title.  Anyone with real talent will do much better somewhere else and should do so.   Their answer to everything is, those who aren't doing well aren't working hard enough, so work harder and longer or you're lazy and that's why you ""fail"".  For the record, I did decent but the ROI on my time and effort just wasn't there.  Definite bait-and-switch from the job described in the interview to the actual job."

There is no structure within support, as there are so many different offices that each person does different things. .
With this company its all about who you know. That is how you get places. They hire management that have no business being in their position. It became a joke as to who was going to be the manager next. For as much work that you put out, you get very little ($$$) in return if you are not in sales. Raises are a joke.

Training program is very good. Looks great on resumes.","It's like being in kindergarten. You will find a lot of drama if something slips up. This includes just having conversation at lunch with an co-worker, if it gets out, expect to be brought into a conference room and yelled at.

The base pay is 25k and there is really no potential to make any commision. The accounts are tapped out. You will find yourself cold calling accounts that a previous account manager called a week ago. It is not unlikely for you to be told to ""F-OFF"" when you call or just blatenly get yelled at by these companies. Stay AWAY FROM MED-LAR Segment. Get into small business where you are just receiving calls from customers and taking orders. Guaranteed commission that way. The guys right out of training were making 35-40k just by answering the phone and placing orders. No cold calling. 

Like I said stay away from Med-Lar, they have currently implemented a new program, where if you do not hit your sales quota, there's a box, fill it up and leave, your fired.

Accounts are tapped out!!!! I can't emphasize this enough. You may get lucky and find a diamond in the rough, but it is very unlikely. 

Insite and Dell are you biggest competitors and they will destroy you when it comes to a price battle!!! If you are going up against these companies in a quote, you will lose. You will have to sell the product at negative margin. CDW's prices are out of control and there is no room to compete. They train you to sell the services that CDW offers. SELL THE VALUE THEY TELL YOU!  Well, they aren't that great because Insite and Dell piggy backs off CDW'S business model, lets them spend all the money to implement new services, copies it and adds it to their own. It's pathetic. 

The only thing I can recommend since its a great company to be apart of is, stick out your 6 months- a year on the sales floor and transfer within the company.

2625,CDW,The worst job I have ever had,2012-04-30,1.0,Account Manager,Great training- The training provided to Account Manager was fantastic and intense. You are constantly learning something new in the IT world.,"The base salary is absolutely terrible and the commission plan is even worse. 
They talk about being a company that build relationships and adds value to their customers, but really it is just a bunch of commodity brokers just like tigerdirect.com or newegg.com. They only care about how many calls you make. You really aren't a sales person there, you are a tele-marketer. The most important thing management cares about is how many calls you make, they could care less about how much you sell or how much profit you make for the company. 
Long hours for low pay in short with an uptight atmosphere."

The best thing about the place is that most people seem to get along with each other. There are tons little perks like free lunches and happy hours. There are a ton of resources available to help you get tech and product questions answered. Benefits are great.,The base pay and commission is too low. It seems like the commission structure changed to benefit mostly newer employees to reduce the high turnover that came from the low base pay.

Year over year you are expected to grow the sales into these accounts by 10 to 20 percent.  If you dont you become in serious danger of being fired.  When a rep leaves mangement will dump large accounts onto your shoulders you have to grow them even if the account has already spent their IT budget on all the major projects they had.  And those accounts are expected to grow as well.
2637,CDW,Get some experience and move on.,2012-02-25,2.0,Senior Account Manager,"CDW has been in the industry so long that most people have heard of them.  Almost no call is completely cold. It's a good place to start a sales career for that reason.  That does have a downside, though (see cons).  

CDW's health benefits are good.  BCBS medical and vision, CIGNA dental.  There's no fronting the cost for prescriptions and waiting for a refund.  All discounts are done up front.

It's a great place to get a first taste of technology sales. There are lots of entry level positions for recent college grads. For that reason, the average age of a coworker is pretty young.  

Systems are very easy to master.  Creating quotes, finding product, and placing orders couldn't be simpler. The system does crash about once a week so be prepared for that.

CDW holds a lot of contracts in the government space, which helps to open doors in that segment.

Having worked at CDW for a few years looks very good on a resume when applying to another sales job, whether in IT or not.","A new AM can expect the first year at CDW to be very difficult.  Unless you come from an IT background you won't know enough to be a real asset to your customers.  If you're on the government side, you pretty much have to wait until someone quits to get a decent account base. There simply aren't new government entities cropping up every day, unlike businesses.

CDW has been around long enough to burn many IT professionals. For that reason, many will not want to do business with a new AM.  

Pay is pretty low compared to others in the industry.  The average small business AM makes $28k a year, so turnover there is high.  If you're in small business, get to med-lar within 2 years or quit.  The average med-lar rep makes $80k a year.  That's not bad, but if you were doing that volume anywhere else, you would be making much more.

The company is not flexible.  If you're an outside the box thinker or get frustrated with broken bureaucracy, you need not apply.  The same processes and systems that were broken when I started were still broken 5 years later.  

CDW sells so much that it's really not great at anything.  It takes a few years, and many bruised relationships, to figure out what you can expect to actually deliver on.

The biggest problem at CDW by far is a lack of leadership at the tactical and operational level.  Managers are chosen based on diversity goals versus capability, and it shows.  I would give a new hire the following advice:  Do not expect your manager to coach or develop you in any way. Do not expect your manager to be able to muster any meaningful advice or resources to help you close business.  Do expect your manager to ask you what's in your pipeline.  Do expect your manager to lie to you.  If you get very good at the job and want to make a lateral or upward move, expect your manager to block you.  Get 3 years under your belt then put your resume out there."

There is a lot of flexibility in your work and in some teams, great balance and workload.","Some sr. management is part of the sales ""good ol' boys"" club.  A lot of promotions are given based on who likes who, rather than job merit.  Sales dictates how to run services and that does not work. Bottom line vs. customer satisfaction."
2640,CDW,Six years and back at square one,2012-02-14,3.0,Account Manager,CDW offers great benefits and a company you can be proud to say you work for.  If you work hard and build solid relationships with field resources you can make a very good living.,The company has moved more towards micro management in the past few years.  Management went from being sales focused to more babysitter role. Account protection has always been an issue for the past 6 years and at a moments notice they can take an account(s) away with nothing in return. That hurts when you dedicate several years worth of work growing and developing accounts to finally reap the financial reward.  Management plays favorites.  Advancement through the ranks is very difficult.

2642,CDW,Steep learning curve.,2012-01-26,3.0,Account Manager,"It is a fun laid back atmosphere.  You are typically not micromanaged.  There is a chance to make a lot of money if you are in the correct segment, like healthcare, MedLar.  HIED and K12, not so much.  They have great benefits, decent vacation time, and promote having fun at work.  They offer a lot of high level technical training, but unless you are already a techno/computer geek, many of the things you sell will be way over your head.  They provode a great engineering/architect group to back you up, but it is often very hard to get on their schedules quickly.","Commission structure is terrible.  If you have one bad month or are in a cyclical segement, you may not receive a commission check for several months until you get your average back up.  They also take 20% of your spiffs despite charging vendors to even run the spiff.  No printer spiffs if you don't sell toner.  If you customer is under contract to get toner cheaper somewhere else, you are out of luck.  Sales goal are huge, and will change in the middle of the month.  I am writing this in late January and I still don't have my sales goal from January, or the rest of the year.  

Upper management pretends they are interested in listening to your ideas on how to make more money, but they are really not.  I spoke with the CEO and Sr. VP's about our international business and us missing out on $30M in business.  Their response was to eliminate all international shipping which gave me a 30% pay cut.  If you are technical and get an engineering job, great place to work.  If you are in sales, it is a great place to learn to sell, but only 20% will make it.  They are constantly hiring because of the high turn over."

All day long you talk to customers who can get the same product cheaper somewhere else and possibly even with free shipping. Also, in the AZ office, their is not a lot of room for advancement. They talk about senior AM and executive AM, but that is all crap. It is still a account manager. Their are AM's and Sales Managers and that is it. Long term, I just do not think that the potential is their. Also, they recognize that their is a lot of turnover. Their philosophy is to hire 20 people in hopes of 2 making it and selling a lot."

2659,CDW,"Great out of school entry level position, making it a long term career is questionable.",2011-11-04,2.0,Account Manager,"Very excellent work culture. It is full of young enthusiastic people.

There is no real micro-managing occurring, you are measured on call stats such as talk time and amount of dials, but those are so easy to cheat it's not even an issue. 

You are left alone for the most part to do your job, and hassled no where near as much as other IT sales positions. 

A lot of great benefits such as free happy hours, after work events like cubs games, whirleyball, free premier steak dinners, and great location.","You are blinded with all the amenities of the workplace, especially when you are young, and do not really realize how your profit is being nickel and dimed away from you. 

The pay structure is terrible when you actually take a good hard look at it. You are payed on a trailing 3 month matrix. This means that you are responsible for having at least achieved an 80% sales goal for the entire total of the previous 3 months, otherwise you receive no commission for the current month. What this requires employees to do, at least the successful ones, is try and sandbag orders by spreading out their orders in order to cover themselves for the next 3 months. Also this means that one bad month can drag you down for the next 2 months after that. So a real life example is if your goal for the last 3 months in total was 600k and you only sold 479K because of one tough month that you had, you receive none of the commission on that 479k. 

This place is really a coin flip on whether you will be successful or not. All the good accounts are being hoarded either by more senior AM's or by your manager, so basically you have to wait around for someone to quit, die, or until your manager has believed you to prove yourself. You will not find some hidden gem that no one is working, that truly is not possible. So if you get put on a very veteran team where no one is leaving any time soon, and your manager is hitting his sales goal through these workers, there is little to no chance you will ever be allowed to work anything of importance. 

CDW is great for working with enterprise level facilities, but if you do not have accounts with 500 users and up, you will struggle to win deals because they are so overpriced on everything."
