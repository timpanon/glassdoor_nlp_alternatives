7,Costco Wholesale,"Great Coworkers, but can be challenging.",2022-04-07,4.0,Front End Assistant,"The benefits are really great! Schedules are posted 2 weeks in advance letting you plan your time outside of work more. Guaranteed 25 hours minimum a week. Your coworkers are usually good at helping with any problems.

They do safety training very routinely, keeping everyone up to date on any new safety protocols. You have the ability to move up in the company. Pay raises arent based on performance, they base it off of how many hours your working.","They estimate your breaks to be 2 hours apart, but sometimes the breaks run a little late. The building can get dry and your working with cardboard alot, some good gloves and a nice hand cream will go along way. If you choose to work on the front end, daily stretches and training your back muscles is a good idea, especially with how much you end up lifting boxes and groceries each shift. unfortunately you will be on your feet for your entire shift, make sure your shoes are comfortable and have good support!"

43,Costco Wholesale,Great Potential,2022-04-04,3.0,Sales,Costco has many good systems in place and a lot of good intentions for its members and employees.,"Costco's employees are unskilled labor. One of the great things about the company is that it promotes from within, but it is based largely on seniority. The problem with this is that unskilled and inexperienced people are promoted. The result is that the management staff is populated by people who have little work experience and no supervisory experience. Very experienced employees with a few months less seniority are passed over because of the value placed on Costco seniority. This makes even the simplest tasks complicated because supervisors are not capable and lack ability to supervise other employees. The workers become Guinea pigs while supervisors try to learn what they are doing."

Job perks are minimal. On-site gym and low-cost deli are the only options. The company did go fully remote for office workers albeit a bit too late. Workers were brought back with a hybrid approach in July, much earlier than many local companies. There is no option to be 100% remote. Of, and IT folks do get the option to be 25% in office at a lower level. Management level employees are required to be on site.

Healths benefits are decent and if you are staying long enough (think 10-15 years minimum), your will get a generous vacation which you will find difficult time using if youa re at a manager level due to the workfload.","Decent pay starts at a manager level and that's where a bonus and stock options kick in. To get there you will need to work many years as an analyst, willing to work long hours at a fixed salary. When you do get to a manager level, you are required to work 50-60 hours a week and your pay will still be lower than many other local companies.

There is not really an option to make decent pay being an analyst or an individual contributor. You pretty much a required to be a manager and babysit others."

118,Costco Wholesale,Terrible place to work,2022-03-25,1.0,Virtualization Analyst,There are not many. If you lack the proper skills for a position. Costco will probably hire you anyways just to get a body in a chair so the lower-level managers can look like they are accomplishing something to senior managers.,"Terrible management from top to bottom. Its a us vs them mentality on those they manage. People with no IT skills what so ever try and over rule people who have spent decades to become a subject matter expert. There is retaliation against you if you speak up for any reason or voice any concerns. You are there to do what you are told. shut up and be happy you work for costco is what management's response to this. Terrible Work from home policy. They have one now, but wont be long till they get rid of it. Managers and up hate it. They want in office 5 days a week. Currently its 5 days a month... but that will change to full time again once staffing problems are fixed. If you are a subject matter expert and have skills then avoid costco at all costs. They will just see you as a warm body in a chair and nothing more."

They also give free membership if you work there,"I was often lied to by my manager about what I can and can’t do because she thought I didn’t know anything . When I first started I was often scolded about something I did wrong , even when they wouldn’t teach me properly how to do it . When I was giving work to do I would ask how to do it and would be told “Just do it” and then be scolded for not knowing how . 3 1/2 years later I see the same thing being done to other newly hired employees and when I try to help I would get yelled at . Another thing is that I work with people who are related to one another . So when my manager is out or is busy from the bakery , I have 5 other managers (who are just employees but feel authority because relation to manager) telling me what to do. The workload isn’t split evenly in my opinion. It’s not a bad place to work at all I actually wouldn’t mind advancing through the company , it’s just the people I work with that makes it horrible ."

- No previous experience required.
- Some benefits rival those only found in a white collar setting. (i.e. cheap healthcare premiums)","- Some of the most boring work I have ever participated in. Probably par for the course for retail.
- Company culture is getting worse and worse, and anecdotally, the people at the bottom who have been around for a while do not think as highly of Craig as they did, Jim, the former CEO.
- Recently announced raises were less than half the rate of inflation the previous year, with menial COL raises scheduled for 2023 and 2024, all despite record profits during the pandemic.
- Company used to be an industry leader in compensation, not anymore.
- The company does not foster growth and leadership potential unless you are willing to give up any semblance of a work life balance. They require open availability (all shifts) and rotate supervisor positions periodically. Salaried managers are required to work a minimum of 50 hours a week and are also regularly rotated to different shifts.

245,Costco Wholesale,Stay away from Melbourne FL loc,2022-03-11,1.0,Associate,"Costco pays well for the type of work, the tasks involved. My daily time preferences were honored.","Nowhere in the country have I encountered a more vicious, hateful batch of managers and supervisors. These people are described by many of the associates as ""Bullies"" but I would go much further than that. Hyper-Critical, belittling, despotic tyrants appear to snipe employees from different depts. to do work they themselves won't to do and use intimidation to do it. These people are insulting, vulgar, and seem to take great joy in demeaning and disparaging good people who work quite hard to achieve their very best. On the other hand, employees who have no other desirable qualities than color of skin, good looks etc., seem to be treated well. I have seen two Puerto Rican managers (who appear to be romantically involved) talk down to light skinned English speaking associates, while treating fellow Spanish speakers with respect. These are unfair prejudices in my opinion. A new store, many people purportedly left the store early on, and those I spoke with reiterated my observations. I think employees, feeling unfairly treated, shut down communication with hostile members of management and this appears to be affecting store function. While most customers (members) are delightful, some are truly awful and this doesn't help either. I think this store needs to take a good look at itself in the mirror and make some serious changes. Costco pays well, but no amount of money is worth spending 35 hours a week in a toxic, soul poisoning environment."

I had 6 bosses telling me to do the exact same thing and would take so much time trying to explain to each one why it would be an osha violation to do it rhe way they wanted. And saying ""no"" to an obviously stupid idea that could cost the company money or get it sued meant goodbye to any potential promotion or day requests. The prettiest managers you can imagine. Promotion through nepotism far more likely than years of good work because management didn't understand how to measure performance on an individuals work and went solely by way of mouth from other employees."

295,Costco Wholesale,Fast paced but the day goes by quickly because it’s always busy. ,2022-03-06,3.0,Licensed Optician,Management is pretty good about swapping shifts if something comes up a few days ahead of time. Members are pleasant as long as they are at least acknowledged when there is a wait. ,A lot of favoritism and petty drama that is borderline harassment and nothing is done about it. There needs to be more positive reinforcement when an employee is consistently doing well. Maybe some incentives for employees who consistently go above and beyond for their members. It seems as though only the manager of each department is incentivized when their “team” reaches sales goals but it takes each individual person to hit their personal sales goals in order for the entire department to thrive. Not enough incentive is given to individuals who double or triple their individual sales goals; allowing for the rest of their “team” to slack off more which in turn causes employees to lose their drive.

Slight growth potential 
Some Coworkers are nice
Pay is well.","Communication is bad. No one will tell you if anything is happening. You will sense you did something wrong or a misunderstanding occurred. Nobody will do further research or ask you what happened. They will take someone else's word for it. Anyone who has played telephone knows how that turns out. The whole story / situation will be very far from the truth. 80% of Supervisors are god awful examples of leadership (human beings as well). Who will antagonize you and make you feel bad about yourself. Make a mistake, I promise they won't forget about it. They will remember the bad, but not the good nearly as much. Favoritism is a huge problem. Favoritism correlates to seniority as well. It makes new employees feel like they are walking on eggshells. They will train you poorly and expect you to know everything. No job security for the first 90 days. I work at warehouse 1249 which is the wesley chapel warehouse. I won't disclose how many years I have been working at costco to avoid workplace retaliation. Just that many coworkers have been nasty towards me and new people. Cliques do exist. Very highschool. Upgrade verbiage at front end during e-block week is atrocious. We are never supposed to say ""guarantee"" or ""cash-back"", or make promises to get people to upgrade. Yet, that is what 95% of front end does. I found the longer I exist there the easier it gets and the nicer people are to me. Although, it doesn't excuse the fact that I have wanted to end my life and have panic attacks before my shifts daily. Also, costco is sexist and discriminatory. No girls are ever doing carts/cart retrieval. Which should be a lawsuit. Women and men are equal and should be assigned the task equally. Additionally, no men work in the clothing department. Everytime, someone is sent to help out in the clothing department it is a women. It wouldn't be hard to do a 120 day HR investigation of those areas to see that what I am saying is true. Don't ever be late."

The customers more often than not were wonderful/pleasant in Tallahassee, FL. In Bridgewater, NJ the majority of the employees/coworkers were/are amazing; had some great work friends that were like family.","At the warehouse that hired me (Bridgewater,NJ) every time I put in for opportunities for advancement management’s excuse was I had no experience, and then they would hire someone else with zero experience either off the street or a favorite from another department within the warehouse. If not outright told no I was completely ignored and never even given interviews/consideration for opportunities after signing a posting. I will never forget how one manager even asked what I went to school for and had the audacity to say go do something in that field! It was at that moment I realized no matter how hard I tried or how great my work performance was, I would never be able to advance/progress. At the Tallahassee,FL location upper management encouraged favoritism and racism. Seemed as if they were doing all they could to get rid of people of color from certain departments. If you are white and female you can literally have the worst job performance and get away with everything (rude to customers, not showing up, lose money/checks, HIPAA violations, etc…) and be considered for advancement opportunities or full time positions. In order to succeed as a person of color at this location you must be perfect in every regard AND kiss up to management and even then you still would barely have a chance. Also if you have children or other obligations forget it. They expect you to be able to work whenever and will change your schedule without notice. Out of all locations I have worked, Tallahassee is by far the worst management wise."

463,Costco Wholesale,I am genuinely glad I no longer work here,2022-02-17,2.0,Stocker,Decent pay and benefits for permanent employees. You are SOL if you are seasonal you dont reap any benefits besides your hourly wage.,"I had low expectations going into this job despite the promises upon being hired, and I still ended up disappointed. I was unfairly targeted due to my disability and my hours were drastically cut as soon as management found out, and the excuse they gave me was laughable at best. I had to exchange shifts with coworkers every week for MONTHS just to pay bills since I was only getting 10 hours a week (which is way below what I was promised upon hiring) and because I was the only one in my entire department with this issue. I worked twice as hard as what was expected of me, pushing myself to the brink of mental breakdown, to prove to myself that I am a valuable worker despite how I was made to feel by management. Coworkers in my department often took advantage of my situation, thinking they were doing me a favor by asking that I cover their undesirable shifts while simultaneously gossiping about me behind my back, which seemed to be a theme in every department if I were to believe what I was being told by those of whom I genuinely got to know. Management would watch me like a hawk and if I so much as approached another coworker to ask a question or give them a reassuring pat on the back, they would reprimand me and make me move to a different spot to continue working in isolation. I never had an issue doing my job, it was fairly easy, but the way I was treated was what made me dread coming into work. Many of my coworkers would joke about how I must have ticked off a higher up because even THEY noticed the way I was targeted.

482,Costco Wholesale,Run.,2022-02-15,3.0,Forklift Driver,There are no incentives to being a forklift driver. Although they will gas it up as the best position. “You’re *like* a supervisor.” Without the pay.,"You are on the same pay scale as a cashier. You constantly get yelled at on the radio. The managers treat the drivers like cattle. Yelling every 5 minutes the time and to hurry up and put up the freight so they can run another truck out. So ungodly understaffed because nobody wants to drive. Most days we run with 4 drivers total with 2 splitting the floor and taking 3-5 trucks by yourself while 4 managers are calling you all over the warehouse for drops. The morale is so bad most drivers are extremely depressed and physically ill from stress. (Depression, seizures, stress ulcers, neck and joint pain) just a few things our drivers currently deal with on a daily basis. Managers telling you to push through the pain of anxiety in your gut until you drop a stack because you can’t even see straight. Management does not care. You are wrong no matter what you do. And good luck getting a different position because you will be trapped once you sign those papers unless you step down."

But I do enjoy the change of pace through out the week","Management isn’t great and reward those who don’t deserve it. Seniority doesn’t mean anything, it’s just who they like that gets promoted. They expect a lot out of their workers. Also if you want to learn to decorate don’t expect to get trained very well. I was thrown into it and basically had to teach myself. I work hard and have been at Costco for a few years, never call off and barely tardy. Still I have yet to get full time.

790,Costco Wholesale,"If you have marketable skills, look elsewhere",2022-01-14,2.0,Inventory Control Specialist (ICS),"Once you pass your 90 day probationary period, it's hard to be fired, and you basically have a guaranteed job for life.
Lots of opportunity to move around the company, and work in different departments.","Compensation is not competitive for the type of work or the region, leading to persistent turnover.
While it's hard to be fired, you can be moved to a different position within the company without your consent, meaning you can end up pushing carts or working a call center.
Movement opportunities within the company are mostly lateral: If you want a promotion in most cases you have to attain it within your current department.
Moving from Hourly to salary is not worth it for senior hourly employees: The salary increase does not match the increase in hours worked or responsibilities taken on, so there is much less incentive for more experienced employees to try for promotions. The incentive is much stronger for new employees to get promoted as fast as possible, so you will often see people with 1-2 years with the company being promoted to manage employees with much longer tenure. 
The promotion process is highly political: You have to be given permission to apply for Assistant Buyer and Buyer positions, and the criteria for being deemed ready to apply is not made clear and varies from person to person. Without any set criteria or performance metrics the deciding factor becomes management likability, with those who are liked the most being promoted much faster than everyone else.
Work from home is not being taken seriously: To be fair they are rolling it out within buying for hourly staff and some lower level salary employees, but its clear management does not trust their staff to get their work done at home. You have to check in when you start, check in when you go to break and lunch, check in when you leave, and keep track of your days work with an hourly task sheet. You are given your set work from home days, and management can require you to come in for any reason they like, and does not allow for a make up work from home day.
No innovation: Costco is focused on their core business, meaning opening new stores and improving product offerings. You won't find a lot of new initiatives or projects within the company that haven't already been implemented by competitors.
Bad culture: not only has the culture turned sour, but there is little appetite to openly discuss the problems of the culture. Whenever they are brought up management becomes defensive and refuses to participate in a meaningful dialogue."

Once Covid hit though, it became clear very quickly that we were expendable. Management doesn't mask up in the office, which lead to an outbreak. Regular employees and supervisors had to basically become babysitters for whiny members and the mask police to members who believed rules didn't apply to them. Management expected us to do this, but never backed us up when it escalated, they just do whatever they have to to make the member happy. Hazard pay was taken away early 2021, and we received a small pay bump that didn't make up the difference. If you get sick or you're out with no sick time you get written up. If you're 3 minutes late (3 times in a month) you get written up. If you make a mistake, you get written up. It's really all about disciplining the bad and never about acknowledging the good.

At Corporate they do intend to follow the law. However, the question at hand is do the managers and supervisors actually know or care when its something they can fudge on a log or report. 

Clock in 1 minute early from lunch (29 minute break) get written up - 
Clock in 1 minute early for your shift or stay 1 minute into over time- wrath rains down- and written up lol

They talk about having a sense of urgency, and they will work you like the slaves building the pyramids. You leave a night shift sore, tired, throbbing, and feeling miserable. your pedometer will say 12-22K steps depending on your section. Youre going to feel stressed and lost, and you'll ask how to improve and some half conscious cigarette smelling supervisor will say you just have to go faster. So you go faster, and its not to their liking, however there really is no set way to do something. Your sent to block down, and they say use your common sense. But when each supervisor has a different methodology or work style and you are trying to learn whats best for you, you feel lost, stressed and painfully lost, even when youre working fast, working hard and trying to figure out how to work smart. 

Forklift drivers are stressed, generally unwilling to help and will run you over if youre in the way. 

If you talk to management about forklift drivers not paying enough attention to foot workers, or bullying you or a coworker your words will get twisted in the management/ employee conversation log and used against you in performance reviews. Anything you say to manager is written down, and they dont have audio recording so its he said she said.

There is no positive about being an overnight stocker.

One supervisor might tell you to clock in early, another might tell you to do it all week, then a manager will ask you why are you here early. And its you that gets in trouble. Not the supervisors for giving conflicting messages...

One Manager told me I could wear my mask under my nose. Another supervisor wrote me up for wearing it under my nose
.
There is a red warning light on the outside of the freezer. It is supposed to warn people walking by that ""work is in progress"" the sign doesn't specify if its foot work or machine work. The managers all have different interpretations as well. Protocol with the red light was never followed, and so if the light is off, and you walk by the door, a very uneducated, and lazy forklift driver will yell at you for walking by the freezer on your way to the trash compactor, Brooms, plastic wrap, RVT or Pallet jack area. 

Men, especially if youre young or larger they will start you in the waters section. What that means is youre condensing pallets of half shopped waters, making them level, even, straight and stacked high. Get a back brace, steel toe boots, get your sleep and hydrate. This is as physical as it gets as you will be tossing 40-60lbs for about 6 hours basically non stop. They will start you with someone who probably hasn't passed their 90 day review yet. You will not receive proper training, you might get a few helpful tips if the guy youre working with is nice, they wont tell you that you can stack multiple empty pallets and have a driver lift/ place the half pallet youre condensining on top - to use gravity and avoid dead lifting off the floor. Drivers wont want to help you do this for the most part, they have their own things to worry about and the manager just walks around miserable, flirting with the girls and being a grouch to the guys. You will sink or swim and you will most likely hurt your back.

If you report hurting your back, you will absolutely get shamed, you get your hours cut, you will be told that ""your work is hard to judge"" even though they put you on a lighter section, they are just trying to build a case to safely retaliate against you. They will make it hell for you. But at least corporate wont fight you from getting a doctors appointment or physical therapy. 



Inconsistencies in the management voices are brutal, causes confusion and everyone plays the blame game. Just like every other paycheck to paycheck job, people are just trying to stay under the radar and get by. 

they keep you on part time where the health benefits are not that good. You still pay a large amount when you have health troubles. 

Its really not a good place to work unless you get in while in college and just stay forever or youre really old at time of hire and they put you on the door or register. But clerk jobs ( payroll, cashier and forklift) are hard to move up into and they really really really haze/ abuse you in the first 90-365 to see if you have what it takes. 

im not sure if this is the same for union buildings. But costco sucks to work at.

There are good people who work there. However the culture set by management is a shame."

- Can move around to different departments
- 401k and some employer match
- Stock options
- Every 1050 hours worked you get an automatic raise (if hourly)
- You can relocate to almost any warehouse you could imagine (even international)
- Pay is great
- Easy work
- Rotating management
- Will work around your school schedule","- It's Customer Service, and during a pandemic it was pretty rough and people can be very demanding, condescending, rude, & on certain occasions aggressive
- Management can/will side with members more than back you up
- Unclear rules and policies management would like for us to implement
- Scheduling can get confusing ; although the scheduling supervisor should come up tp you personally to tell you, instead a sign above the timeclock is placed
- Hardly ever get positive reviews or recognition. You are more likely to get a negative performance log than a positive one
- Too much drama (feels like high school all over again)
- Getting time off or switching shifts can be a hassle

Pay is good, and raises are automatic as long as the employee holds a job lower than supervisor level. Raises occur about every six months when an employee works 40 hrs/week. If an employee works part-time, it will take longer to get a raise because raises are based on hours worked. For the first two raises an employee will receive 50 cents more, then every raise after that an employee will receive $1 more until they max out, which is about $26 for a Cashier Assistant and $27 for a Cashier. Supervisors don't get raises automatically unless corporate headquarters decides to give all of them raises. They get paid about $28/hour, and it doesn't matter how long they've worked for the company.","Management is a clique. It will be very difficult getting promoted into management if you're not friends with the decision makers. Even if you somehow get promoted and you're not a part of the clique, it will be an uphill battle getting trained for that position. Management spends time training their friends and employees who kiss their a**. The company culture that corporate headquarters preaches is lost at this Costco. There's no ""doing the right thing"" and ""teaching"". All this location cares about are membership benchmarks and the bottom line. As long as an employee is able to get a good amount of upgrades, automatic membership renewals, and get members to apply for the Costco Citi Card, they will be untouchable. They can have complaints against them from coworkers and members, but nothing will happen to them because management will sweep it under the rug."

1212,Costco Wholesale,The most honest review you will ever read. Bait and switch.,2021-11-19,1.0,Software Engineer,"- Low-skilled Costco employees are welcome.
- Job security if you're incompetent.
- Laidback environment because the company prioritizes social interactions over productivity.
- Their definition of ""recognition"" is you ask them to recognize you (application needed). It's a ""pro"" if you do not like to be pleasantly surprised and disagree with the dictionary definition of ""recognition"".
- They take care of their warehouse employees. In fact, they take care of them so much that they treat them as equals. If warehouse employees do not get to have vacations during the holiday season, so should the corporate employees who can work 100% remotely on their computers.","Incompetent people run the show. This company is loyalty-based, not merit-based. Stay away if you are any of the following: millennial or younger, skilled, experienced in the IT industry, educated. You will not get valued here. To get promoted, you have to have worked at a warehouse for years doing jobs with very low skill requirements. You can also be qualified if you spend years in the corporate office staring at a wall. Just make sure executives and managers physically see you, and that you master the art of brown-nosing. Your powers are useless here. Oddly enough, there is a strong bias against internal promotions compared to new hires — which shows a bait-and-switch strategy to hiring.
. . . . .
A resulting problem of their system is RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. It is not open discrimination mind you, but if you are of a ""certain"" race, you're the CEO, VPs Directors, and the managers. You also get promoted to senior faster despite having only three years of experience. You get RESERVED parking aka. ""Old White Men Privilege Parking"". Essentially, they want to display to the newer, younger, and more diverse employees who are in power. The end result in the present is similar to what systemic racism created in the US. It was not the intention, but it is the result. The balance of power favors those who were carried over from the earlier, more discriminatory time period. Make no mistake, these people refuse to let go of their power."

I did like the job.,"There was not really any cons to working there. To me it’s just not a place to work if you have outside responsibilities for example children. If you don’t have family to help out with your kiddos just in case they get sick, or the school gets shut down or even if your having a ruff morning it can get really complicated working there. However, that’s pretty much all call centers due to adherence. Also the shift changes every week with the off days changing. Lastly, quite a few people who got promoted should not have. They had really bad attitudes and truly need to be taught the proper etiquette of how to talk to people before being in a higher position."

Costco really respects its employees.,"It takes several years of working to get enough raises to where I would feel content with my salary for the work I put in. But once you get the raises you are coasting. some guys had been there for 15 years, couldn't even speak english but were making 100k per year with full benefits. 

HARD WORK. Costco treats you well but they expect a lot from you and expect you to be on all the time and ready to work. 

Scheduling can be inconsistent unless you are full time. 
Forget about having weekends off your first couple years.

If you just need some sort of job to get by while you work on other stuff, look elsewhere. As great as Costco is, it will eat all your time and energy. 

Join Costco only if you want to advance in the company."

Good because you don’t have to have the difficult conversation about increases but rewards “loyalty” over actual work. I say “loyalty” is if the employees there are actually gonna move ahead in life,If you are a good worker they will lean on you to get 80% of the job done while letting low energy floaters do the bare minimum.

-If you are someone that wants structure, security and a stable job, Costco Corporate is definitly the company for you.","-Communication, specifically what the task requirements are, what are the deliverables, constraints, expectations? Sometimes have to pull teeth to get concrete answers/objectives. Along with over-reliance on email and sending overly short messages that are vague in description.

-Perhaps it is in the department I'm working in, too much manual work and not enough emphasis on using automation to complete tasks or eliminate unnecessary work. 
Like almost, no one knows how to use Gmail Filters or Schedule Send (click the gear icon, go to ""Filters and Blocked Addresses"" and this is extremely helpful if you hate receiving unnecessary emails. Schedule Send would let you schedule send an email on August 6th, 2022 for instance)."

Many people do stay and enjoy job security, even during economic downturns.","Like many companies, Costco recognizes the need to improve its diversity and inclusion at the corporate leadership level. It can be hard for companies started by white men years ago to invite cultural change. The feeling of inclusion, openness, and perceived support varies a lot depending on what area and department you work in. It may be helpful to connect with someone from whatever area you want to work in to get a sense of what things are like for whatever facet of worklife matters most to you."

Food Court in Alexandria, VA GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED! TOO MUCH WORK FOR TWO PEOPLE , then, after a GRUELING shift, TWO of us are forced to break down and clean ALL of the Kitchen equipment PLUS the outer Food Court area, clean 24 picnic tables, take a jack and MOVE those tables and clean the floor. I have degenerative disc disease in my neck and back as well as arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome. I have told my managers, REPEATEDLY, that I cannot PHYSICALLY DO this type of labor after my shift is over. I have doctor's paperwork, and have asked to be transferred , but, they DO NOT CARE! Two people cannot consistently run late , because , one person is in the back trying to make multiple pizza orders while the other is forced to run five registers and do everything else ! EVERY DAY, we run late because they refuse to turn the kiosks off so we can try to start cleaning up in order to not go into overtime. I can barely stand up or walk by the time my shift is done. At home, I am in such pain that I cannot do my OWN housework or cook because I am PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED AND IN TERRIBLE PAIN. The hours are EFFED UP, all over the map, no set schedule and I go days without eating because I have no time to eat before my shift and I AM TOO TIRED to eat when I finally get home.

1679,Costco Wholesale,Endless Hustle,2021-09-20,3.0,Cashier Assistant (Front End Assistant),I met some great coworkers. My location offers great and kindful people who definitely went out of their way to make sure I was adjusting to the job and as a person.,"One of the main issues was how some employees were given preferential treatment. For instance, some of the new hires that joined at the same time as me were given the opportunity to learn cashier while I was the only one left out. I did ask about it, but they never got back to me before I decided to quit. I have seen this also that they will train certain people who fit certain roles. Could be the stereotype, but my first two months consisted of pushing carts for 6+ hours and heavy lifting in Night Merch. I know that I was not given as many Sundays as my other coworkers.

Next, is that there is no formal training. They just throw you there and expect to learn how things work. I have been reprimanded a couple of times for things that are not entirely my fault.

Last, is how they want to push you in your job but never really reward you for your good work. Everyone is constantly told to push certain quotas and it's
 a distaste as you are practically a tool. I am told to go do this and that, but if I do it, they tell me I could have done better. It's a constant loop of raising the bar and not challenging employees for superior service. They expect you to do two peoples jobs and then get yelled at if you can't."

1732,Costco Wholesale,Worst Location to Work,2021-09-14,1.0,Anonymous Worker Bee,"The pros are that you get your required breaks on all of your shift, great co-workers, certified on equipment relatively quickly, and as long as you are doing something you are left alone by management.","A/C in the ecom building doesn't work, as in out of the 20 units that are installed, only 4 of them actually blow cool air. 

Management cares more about covering their own tails, than caring about the employees. A few managers are flat out racist and will only promote their own kind, even if their own kind don't deserve the promotion. There is no confidentiality at all in there if you take anything to management. Management will retaliate against you, even of you are in the right, according to the handbook. In order for management to cover their tails, they will utilize the supervisors to retaliate by proxy. 

Scheduling is a complete trainwreck, where people with much less seniority will get the preferred schedules they want, but those with more seniority will be frozen out and denied their requested schedules.   You are also lucky if you have a schedule that is posted 2 weeks out from the current work week.

Part time employees are mandated to work 40+ hours a week with 24 hour notice and sometimes even less notice than the 24 hours, even though the handbook clearly states they are to give a minimum of 24 hour notice on any and all schedule changes. Management will also change your schedule online and not notify you of the changes, until you clock in on your new day off or clock in late on a day you are scheduled. This happened repeatedly throughout my employment with the company.

Submitting for days off is atrocious, due to the fact that you submit for it well in advance, yet management conveniently ""loses"" your leave request paperwork. You generally find that out when the schedule is released, and they they demand to see your copy of the leave request, as if you are lying to them. This happened to me at least 4 times in 2 years and at least one of those requests was for workers comp doctors appointments.

In general the working conditions are brutal year round and cause employees to burn out very quickly, between the nature of the work and the horrible scheduling.

Employees are able to accrue a maximum of 72 hours of sick/personal time every year, even if the employee works more than the 30 hours in MD to receive the 1 hour of sick/personal time. For example, a full time employee is scheduled 2080 hours per year and that would net under MD law 69.33 hours of sick/personal time every year. But during the seasonal period, employees will work 60+ hours a week and that adds a minimum of 160 hours on tip of the 2080 hours, to come to 2240 hours for the year. If they were to abide by MD law, they employee would receive a total of 75 hours of sick/personal time. But the company caps the accrual of sick/personal at 72 hours every year.

Vacation is only given out on your anniversary, instead of accruing it throughout the year on your pay stubs.

Safety training constitutes 90 seconds of the trainer talking to you about the required training for that month, if they have a current list. Even then half of the training is useless, because it flat out doesn't apply to you. A good number of employees have no idea where the SDS binder is located, because they were never told the location of it. At least one safety trainer had no idea where it was located, when I asked where it was during training on hazardous materials.

OSHA violations in the building are numerous, because management wants results now, and employees that say that they are trying to be safe are retaliated against for refusing to do some tasks without proper PPE.

Management will hire family members and supervise family members, then in turn give those family members preferential treatment and training on equipment or other things, instead of following the seniority policies in the handbook. I know of one manager that hired his nephew and then was the one that interviewed his own nephew for a full time position. Nephew was given full time over other employees that had more seniority.

I was also told by management when I had a death in my immediate family that I would have to use sick/personal time, even though I was allowed to get bereavement leave.

The level of favoritism, nepotism, and toxicity are incredible.  The toxicity is one of the reasons why I left.

All in all, it was a job that got me through to my next job. I suffered 3 injuries in the workplace due to the nature of the work, yet one of them was because there was no safety device on a belt (OSHA violation)."

1802,Costco Wholesale,Benefits Defeats The Pay,2021-09-06,3.0,Merchandise,"Benefits: 
- All benefits are offered to both full and part-time workers.

- Benefits include medical, dental, vision, and life. All are offered and paid through the employer at cheap rates compared to most places. 

- For example, Costco's medical benefits only require a $3 co-pay for prescriptions compared to a $15 charge at your local CVS pharmacy. Doctor visit co-pays are no more than $20. 

- Medical plans also cover specialist visitations (physical therapy, occupational, therapy, chiropractor, etc.) up to 3 months with no out-of-pocket costs. 

Work-life:

- Work-life: Work is work. I mean, it is retail. You see countless numbers of customers - some respectful and some rude. 

- You have your micro-managers and your ball busters. You have those you want to punch in the face. However, I survived it enough to write you this message so you can also.

- PTO, which is separated into two categories (sick and personal and vacation), is given based on how long you have worked for the company. 

- Rollover amount was unlimited. Now the rollover amount is fixed. 

- For vacation time, the rollover amount is now 40 hours. For sick and personal time, the rollover amount is 72 hours. 

- Any time that surpasses the fixed rollover amount on your hire date, Costco pays the employee out for it. The best way to not be paid out for it is to use it before your hire date arrives the next year. 
 
- On your hire date, all vacation and sick and personal time reset. 

- Pay: The pay is unmatched, especially for an employer in the retail industry. As you probably know, most retail companies are only going to pay their employees minimum wage or just slightly above with a pat on the back 0.10 cent raise. 

- However, that is not the case at Costco. Your 1st raise is 0.50 cents, and then $1.00 raises from that point on.","- Limited part-time workers receive no benefits. 

- If you were a limited part-time employee that got hurt on the job, you will not be covered under Costco's benefits. 

- This is indirectly stating that Costco only cares for covering part-time and full-time employees being covered if injured on the job. 

- This is a huge problem that I have brought to the employer's attention on company surveys asking ""what can we do better?"" or through what is called the ""employee suggestion box."""

The biggest issue though was management. The managers all seemed to have a superiority complex. They were rude and degrading. Often when I needed help with things that only managers could do such as grabbing change during rushes they would flat out ignore me. I dreaded every single day I went into that warehouse. I cannot express enough just how unprofessional and unwelcoming the managers were. The res of the staff was really nice and I enjoyed working with them. Customers were also pretty nice overall.

It would've been nice to have more time-off, vacation, and sick days. Employees ""calling out"" was known to be a common practice and hourly employees are demanded to do more physical work as a result.

Warehouse stays surprisingly cool during the summer while working

Bog standard grocery store job just bigger","Such ridiculous standards that it actually gets annoying

Can train into different departments BUT depending on the one your in currently, like say meat cutter, you CANNOT cross train into different department so pick your starting position wisely

It doesn't matter who has been there the longest, if the GM had some friends who needed jobs they got the jobs and more qualified people did not (that's how some people got into manager positions off the bat here with them having no experience)

Managers are salaried meaning they can be REALLY grumpy sometimes when they opted into that life and take it out on their underlings

Hierarchy is everything, like I said earlier, if you have been there for lets say 2 years and a fresh, brand new never heard of manager is hired, they have instant seniority and say above you. Yes that's kind of the point of a manager but their say is final and your experience there is worth nothing.

There is an open door policy that might as well be a back wall no one feels safe reporting to it. Management is rough because they tend to stop caring about you as an employee once you become a manager.

I recall a particularly hot (temp was like 115, ""felt like"" temp was about 143) and busy (probably friday or sunday) day where we were understaffed and just about dying. My hands were shaking despite me chugging gatorades (which, thankfully, they gave us for free) like a madman. Despite this, when it so happened that 2 of us took a water break at the same time, one of our supervisors came out and yelled at us for socializing and slacking off. Constant promises that they'd switch us out with people inside so we could cool off or bring other front end assistants out to help us (all the girls were inside helping cashiers), but they never actually did. 

If you work at a costco that actually switches you out between front end and carts, it's probably not bad. It's definitely a good workout. But at least when I worked at the Bolingbrook Costco, it was one of the most tiring and grueling jobs I've done. Sometimes I would be so worn out that I wouldn't even have the leg strength to get the initial push on a stack of carts, I would have to literally slam them to gather enough momentum. If you're going to work at a Costco, I'd recommend the bakery or meats. Food court is a nightmare, and front end sucks if you do end up getting stuck with carts the entire time."

2042,Costco Wholesale,Stable blue-collar living.,2021-08-02,4.0,Costco Front End Assistant,"Raises are based on the hours that you work, no performance reviews, no sucking up to management, no 'clique' atmosphere. 
Benefits are unbeatable at full time, free vision, free hearing, $150 per year on the company to update prescription lenses, 2 ways to earn PTO. You bank 2 hours per pay period at full-time and around 1 hour of personal time at part-time. You get a week of PTO vacation time after year 1. 2 weeks after year 2, 3 weeks after year 4. 
If you work full-time, after your first year, you are guaranteed to go up $2 per hour per year in pay regardless of 'clerk' or 'assistant' level position in the warehouse. Clerk pay is higher and raises start at a dollar each as opposed to 50cents for the first few. 1040 hours per raise, exactly 13 pay periods at full time to hit it, 26 weeks out of 52 in a year, you will get a raise every 6 months. 
Generous maternity AND paternity leave for people who have babies, foster kids, or even adopt. 10/10 generosity. 
Benefits and claims are easy to navigate, I work full-time with a medical condition that can flare up outside of my control and I've never had a problem with FMLA covering the bad days as long as I put in the effort to communicate with my doctors and my HR rep. Coworkers have had surgeries, unexpected illnesses, repetitive motion injuries, and nobody I've known has ever had a problem with the company making it work for them as long as they put in genuine effort and work well while they're on the clock.
You can move just about anywhere in the warehouse if you work hard enough and put in the effort. All job openings are posted internally first, so 6 months to a year of doing cart crew or maintenance or a position that you aren't keen on will still buy you a shot at moving up, you are never stuck. For this reason, your job never has to be boring. 
There is a Costco literally EVERYWHERE. If you get this job in college and want to keep your living wage when you finish your degree, the opportunity to transfer to a warehouse in whatever city/state/country you have your heart set on is there.","Incredibly physical job. Can be very demanding, and the department where you start is not where you stay the majority of the time. Everyone helps everyone which is both a blessing and a curse because nobody is safe from pushing carts in the snow or cleaning toilets if conditions call for it. I've even seen our AGM's and payroll clerks out doing the grunt work when we are busy. So there's nowhere you can move in the warehouse to get out of physically strenuous positions if you are ill, pregnant, or aging unless you have a very specific doctor's note. 
You must always have extra clothes or proper footwear on your person in case of these situations, if you show up for a shift at membership wearing a dress and they need you in food court, it is on you for being unprepared with long pants and close-toed-shoes to be able to jump where they tell you to jump."

Once you’re in and full time it’s really easy to slack and hard to get fired","Management doesn’t communicate well so each has a project they want done at that moment. They expect a 30min project to only take 5min because they only see it at surface level. 

Pay scale is nice long term, but you have to commit 5+ years to see it

If you’re good at you role, and do the work of 2 people, they tend to keep you in that role vs cross train

No accountability. For those who work, you are constantly asked to do more to pick up slack of other employees"
2047,Costco Wholesale,Good Culture,2021-08-01,4.0,Inventory Control Specialist,"Good company to work for and great benefits.

Has a great base for company culture.","Costco has a hard time keeping up in tech, and salaries. Pay is decent, but for the area they base themselves from it is hard to afford to live nearby the corporate offices."
2048,Costco Wholesale,Good pay and benefits,2021-08-01,3.0,Cashier Assistant (Front End Assistant),Good pay. Benefits at 24 hours a week. Vacation and holiday pay. Diversity in employees,"Random scheduling, no set days off. Management and supervisors are not good at giving seniority benefits such as preferences at work, days requested off and preferred shift times."

2051,Costco Wholesale,"This review is for Costco Japan not Costco US.
Low pay, ok benefits and high hurdle to join the company",2021-08-01,3.0,Merchandiser,"High Pay for part timers, overtime not mandatory, 401k plan provided.

Overall good company to work for and for part timers or fresh grads the full time pay is not bad.","The benefits and high pay of the US does not extend to other countries like Japan that have been stuck at the same pay since 1999, pay is good for part timers but if you're a full time position even in the head office in Japan the salary is much much lower than comparable jobs outside Costco. 

Not much career growth unless you want to get into management which means most likely you work at least 12 hours a day if not more due to peer pressure from fellow managers. 

Depending on the warehouse there is often a culture of gossip, cliquishness and bullying towards newer employees, acting on such violations is not really a priority for local management and gets swept under the rug.

Talent drain due to uncompetitive salaries outside of Costco.

Untrained management due to almost all internal promotions, managers go their positions either by seniority or because there were no better alternatives. 

Extremely difficult to join as full time, you have to get lucky to join as a seasonal and then be the lucky few that gets chosen to remain as part time. 

You can apply to vacancies for full time but you will lose out due to seniority most of the time so you have to wait a couple years before you can get accepted as a full time workers, a lot of people don't want to wait years hoping for a full time position and this discourages leavers from coming back to Costco because they will have to start from the bottom again."

-Even though Costco is hyped up to be some kind of ""premium retailer"" the work is still the same old soul-sucking retail grunt work and dealing with outrageous customers. In fact many customers are actually worse at Costco because they feel entitled from being a ""member"".
-Management can make some ridiculous projects that need to get done by the end of the day on top of our regular workload, while also having a skeleton crew

At times there are a lot of managers/supervisors being moved around the building with people stepping down/switching departments and the scheduling both in consistency of your schedule and how often your schedule can be change (with little to no notice to you) can fluctuate constantly. 

At times when managers/supervisors are moved around the building, or because folks are either stepping up or stepping down, the scheduling can go out the window. The consistency of scheduling as well as the frequency to which changes are made to your schedule can fluctuate dramatically.

2379,Costco Wholesale,Costco isn’t as great of a workplace as it seems for a new hire,2021-06-16,2.0,Retail Merchandiser,"A lot of the employees are fantastic to work with. 
Once you qualify for benefits, they are pretty good.
The job is very physical so if you like a good workout, this is the place for you.","I was transparent in the interview process that I was looking for part-time work for my retirement years. I was informed that the only way to get in at Costco was to start with one of three entry level positions. Merchandising (stocking shelves), Assistant Cashier/Carts or Food Court. I was told that Merchandising might be a good fit for me. I accepted. The job is extremely physically demanding, which I didn’t mind too much as it was a great workout. After two weeks, I started to get scheduled for more hours and with shifts as early as 2:15am. I approached to leaders about how I was looking for fewer hours and they proceeded to schedule me for 39 hours the following week. If I wanted to work full-time, I could simply go back to my regular job and make a lot more than $16/hr. 

It seems as if the people conducting the interviews are disconnected from the people you would truly be working with. Why would they hire and train me, not deliver on what we discussed in the interview and then have me quit? It was a huge waste of everyone’s time. 

There was also this mentality where some of the seasoned employees were constantly reminding you that your first 90 days are like “Survivor” and if you don’t do everything at 200%, they will cut you at day 89."

You have like 20 different bosses and several levels of superiority and everybody thinks they're superior. Management is passive and secretive. Management acts like they're in some sort of superior club. They tried to brainwash employees into thinking Costco is the best thing in the whole world. You have to deal with thousands of people every day. Is a mentally physically and emotionally toxic environment. They have to provide amazing benefits to the employees because their health WILL suffer. Don't don't even get me started on their seasonal hiring process the most stressful thing I've ever been through. They want you to have complete open availability they can schedule you in the middle of the night if they want and they don't let you know how you're doing so for 3 months they say they're going to hire like 10 people but they don't say who so it's this crazy competition where you're literally losing sleep and still don't know if you have a job. It's like dating someone who won't commit and giving them your everything heart and soul meanwhile you don't know if they're out there sleeping around on you. Then if you get hired on you literally get the crappiest shifts ever, you never have a set schedule, you can never plan too far in advance because Costco RULES your life for $16/hr. Every thousand hours you work you get a raise but not much. It takes a very long time to tap out at $25 an hour and by then you have no soul. All the people I've met that have worked there for a long time are so worn down seeming not happy and not in good health."

2445,Costco Wholesale,Depends on the Warehouse,2021-06-07,3.0,Refund Cashier,"Costco is known for their great benefits, but as times have evolved their benefits have become sort of mediocre to other companies. The positive side of all of it is that you still receive benefits as a part time associate. This is something many jobs do not offer.","I have much to say about my experience at Costco. They claim to promote from within but nepotism is ever adamant. Age discrimination is, and I say this with utmost certainty, the number one reason why I have not moved up in the company. I rarely make mistakes and I am a hard worker who achieves much in my short amount of hours. I know myself enough to say that I would deserve at least a chance at a full time position none the less a leadership role, but I was under 20 when I started my employment there and I am still young. Every time I apply they either don't give me a reason or tell me I lack the experience necessary. I have been there for about 3 years and have never gotten a higher role while I have known others that have gotten promoted who have been there for less than a year and certainly had far less experience than I.
As my headline states, it depends on the warehouse. Some warehouses welcome you with open arms, and others would rather you sit in your assigned corner and wait until you're called. Best of luck."
2446,Costco Wholesale,Fantastic for  students,2021-06-07,4.0,Bakery Assistant,"If your a student Costco offers a programs that will allow you to take significant time off work/will work around your school schedule (one co worker moved to another country for school and only worked part of summer vacation). you also get raises based on hours worked you also receive benefits for part time employees such as 50% of dental & physio, 30% on ortho etc. You receive 8 paid sick days a year and 2 weeks paid vacation that goes up over time (I believe it caps at 7-8 weeks). Starting wage is always a dollar above minimum wage & When you hit top rate which is currently $28 you qualify for bonuses (about 1500 after tax twice a year). If you’re full time you are guaranteed to get 40 hours a week and if you’re part time you are guaranteed 25.","The usual cons that come with a job, management is always trying to pull the wool over your eyes, the environment can be extremely catty at times, you have to work extra hard to get promoted if you’re a woman, when you pitch intelligent ideas they throw them straight into the trash, people don’t want to do their jobs so you end up doing yours and everyone else’s.

Stay away from this location ( Borough M in NYC). This location would be the perfect case study for any business school on how not to conduct a business. - from basic business operations to people operations.  Training and Professionalism- do not think they know the meaning of the word here. Apparently using vulgar language is an acceptable form of basic communication here. Training does not exist. You are thrown into a task without training and then are written up for performing the task incorrectly. Managers do not know how to work in a smart efficient manner. Employees have to work harder because of that. Organization does not exist here. Employees are constantly looking for basic supplies ie. pens, staples, staplers, jacks, shrink wrap etc.
Forget about find a broom and dustpan.That could take about half an hour. 
Extremely cliquey. Longtime employees who are supervisors/ managers do not reprimand longtime employees ( basically their friends), while have no problem reprimanding newer employees. Some supervisors are more interested in gossiping with the employees then actually doing their job.  Some cannot handle the pressure and get extremely snippy, frankly nasty. One customer even stated they would have fired this supervisor when they heard how I was spoken to. Too many good people left because of this unprofessional and high school atmosphere.   Certainly the only thing that I learned here is how not to conduct a business from all aspects. I would probably only hire less then a dozen people from this location."

2854,Costco Wholesale,Inadequate staff during pre-Covid holiday season,2021-04-14,3.0,Front End Assistant,Workers are educated about their rights. Everyone is treated equally and judged only on their actions.,"During my time at Costco I found everyone around me pushed to the absolute limit trying to keep up with the absurd amount of foot traffic during the holiday season. I had heard that Costco treats their workers well, but, in my book, pushing people that hard is not treating them well by any stretch of the imagination. I have never had a more grueling and exhausting job in my life. I never want to work at Costco again. 


This is a company that literally sets up its stores to accept an INFINITE amount of traffic, but it is only able to accomplish this level of functioning by destroying the mental health of their employees.


For some people-- who are naturally athletic, interpersonally friendly and sharp, but not very book-smart, this is a great job. Everyone else stay away."

3117,Costco Wholesale,As accurate as possible,2021-03-13,4.0,Meat Wrapper,"The best things about this job consists fairly of your fellow coworkers in the meat department. It’s usually a pure sausage fest in there. 
Every 1000 hours or so, you get a raise of about 25-50 cents until you max out at around $26. 
They provide you with an opportunity to buy fractional shares of their stock post-tax. This can be a great deal if you plan to work at costco in general. Since a long term investment plan usually results in a lower dollar average cost. (Not financial advice just my own experience)
After you max out they give you a bonus check of about 2000+ depending on years of service and job title. 
Health insurance, and dental insurance is insanely cheap. About $50 per month and additional add on are about $60/month. 
The healthcare that you get is actually decent for the price you pay. Vision included.
If you plan on moving up, it’s relatively easy if you work hard, and show up on time, and minimize call outs. The pay ranges from $27 an hour as a supervisor to About $75k SALARY for managers. 
Sundays are paid as time and a half for hourly employees only, this means that a person earning the entry level $16 Essentially is paid $24 an hour on sundays. And a supervisor about $40 an hour on sundays. 
Vacation time is very generous as your years of service rises. It starts from about 1 week of wages when you first start, 2 weeks for your 2nd year and so on until the max at around 4 weeks after 8 years or so. It mostly depends on the hours you work. 
The company also contributes to your 401k if you invest in one. They invest about 3% of your wages for the first 4 years and then 5%+ after. They also match your contribution to a max of about $500
Managers make real good money.
Prescriptions that you need are also insanely cheap thanks to the insurance they provide","The work can be overwhelming at times. And working in the meat department everything is heavy as hell. I’m talking 50+lbs. in fact, its accepted to have back problems after working here for so long. Wearing a back brace marginally makes it better. 
It’s always busy and the supervisors and managers are like hawks waiting for you to slow down or mess up to write you up, and kick you out. 
Everything is ruled with an iron fist from top to bottom. I mean for capitalism, it’s cool I guess efficiencies and all that. They need that competitive edge. 
But it comes at a steep cost. Your mental health. For reference, I started taking anti-depressants for severe depression because of this place. You can’t just work hard, you need to work at an insanely unreasonable pace. The output that we generally produce is never enough. And the managers rarely thank you for the hard work. Now this is not the case for all managers. There are legit managers and there are cruel managers. But the share of bad managers far exceeds the good ones and the good ones end up quitting or ask for a demotion. 
Costco loves promoting from the inside, but from my 5 years of experience working here, the ones that sweet talk their way up are usually the managers that are terrible. 
Let me define this. 
A bad manager is one who plans for failure by not giving the team direction and always creating a hostile environment with their constant barks and unhelpful criticisms. 
Ex of an actual convo. 
Manager: “I’ve observed you working for thelasthours and I don’t think you are producing enough, our counters are empty.”
Employee 
“It’s a very busy day, and there’s only 3 people working today. I am doing my absolute best right now” 

Manager “not a valid excuse”
Keep in mind he scheduled it to be this way. 
And if you want to go on vacation, during the holidays good luck getting the dates you want."

If your married it's $60 a check with you and your spouse, who will receive vision, dental and health insurance equal to yours. The vision is through Costco Optical Department and you receive free exams and $170 toward glasses, contacts, etc. Honestly, I could keep going, but you get the idea. You start current at $16 and you get a raise every 1050 hours, which easier if your full time, then you top out around $25-25 an hour. Once your topped out twice a year you receive bonus checks about $1500 and will increase with years of service. They start you with about two weeks vacation and then it increase by a week every 5 years.","Your schedule and your days off can be change to fit the needs of the company at anytime, but primarily applies during the holidays.

Most customers were awesome

Free membership","Working in membership is all of the stress of sales, with NONE of the upside. ZERO commission. ZERO training in sales, most of my coworkers couldnt sell and the one who could was overqualified but was very rude to coworkers.

I was hired for part time despite saying I was willing to work many hours. I wanted to be successful and grow within the company. I accepted the part time offer because it was 'all they had' and decided to go to school to improve myself in my off time. They then started giving my 39 hours a week, after i told them i could not work on certain school days. Management demanded my schedule from the school. I guess I could be trusted with cash, credit cards and customer information from their database but not that I actually go to school

I got a second job and they REFUSED to work with me on the hours I was scheduled and told me to make a choice between my other job (offering full time hours, commission and a higher wage) and Costco. 

Accused me of lying about a medical condition and had a third party harass me via telephone to submit medical records, even after giving management a doctors note. I could have sued over this.

Most coworkers are absolutely miserable and will do their best to make you miserable as well. I was disrespected, gaslighted and straight up harassed into asking for a department transfer. Most of that department is gone now, so maybe the newer crew is nicer, but management literally sided with the bullies."

Great Military leave benefits - I left for the military after 2 years, served for 5 years, and returned to my old warehouse 2 weeks after completing my contract topped out, making $25+ an hour and maintaining seniority. Worked while finishing GenEd college courses and left on great terms.","UNION Buildings with lots of seniority SUCKSSSSS
The bad part of good retention rates is that people work here FOREVER. Many stays in the same place, and many union stores, essentially lock out the opportunity to go to some positions, or you end up losing every opening to people who are completely lazy but have been there for 25 years. Jumping around departments taking all the entry-level positions possible.
Lack of leadership skills with management. My manager became very close with some of the ladies who were barely a year in the store. She even had them on her wedding court. All 3 of those girls were supervisors within a year without having any reason other than their friendships. VERY CLIQUEY. Those who worked and mind their business had clear disadvantages.

Good people.,"The recent pandemic has brought a lot of good and bad out of people....and the companies we work for. I have learned Costco is far less concerned with thier employee's well being than they are with thier bottom line. Despite COVID outbreaks and employee concern, we are still expected to happily show up to work everyday (even during statewide shut-downs) when the option to work remotely is a safe and productive option. The company has an outdated culture of the good ole boys club, with minimal advancement and pay increase for minorities and females along with being closed minded on culture today. The ""costco way"" is focused on the operations business and the corporate teams are blended into the pool of ""diversity and inclusion"" Costco claims to represent. Although Costco has been lucrative in light of the pandemic, this culture cannot thrive forever and many good corporate employees will (continue to) be lost."

Lack of pressure to sell in clinic. 
Diversity in the WHSE
A lot of people that work here are very nice and friendly.
Despite all the bad I have experienced here, I would highly recommend this job but not at this location.","My immediate manager made work incredibly toxic and difficult for me. The person that was hired to fulfill this position lacks all abilities to do so.
Clinic environment was very stressful for everyone, creating separation, lack of team work and lack of trust in this clinic.  You have to walk on eggshells. 

Everything was documented and despite managements best efforts, the situation remained the same causing further tension in this clinic.
Senior management did try to help multiple times but ultimately gave up and left me to figure things out on my own causing me to feel unvalued and unheard. 

I had no option but to go on unpaid stress leave (2 months) causing me extreme stress and anxiety over the security of my job. I have never been treated so poorly  in a professional clinical environment where I am asking for basic respect and decency.

No firm actions were taken to resolve this issue which was very unfortunate, as it left me no choice but to quit. Leaving Costco was one of the saddest thing that happened to me. I was bullied for a little over a year and I was the one that lost my job. Despite all of that, I genuinely loved my job and wanted to stay and grow with the company. I think Costco overall is a great company but this location needs to pay serious attention to this clinic.

It has taken me a long time to post this review because the experience I had here truly saddens me."

The base level employees who make the place what it is and do all the work are amazing and kind people.","Hard physical work. They have you pushing carts for months and months even if you have seniority. They are weird and old fashioned about even small visible tattoos or a nose stud. The higher ups with the company are cutthroat and controlling, and it's very clear that they feel like they are alpha dog.

-Safety should be an even higher priority, I worked in major sales for 8 years with experience in other departments, the upper management will continuously bombard you with tasks over the radio when your department will be under staffed because the front end needed them, but they never understand that you need them too, so your handling 2 different members at the same time with less staff & still trying to finish the first task they asked you while still answering respectfully for each call. Sometimes I would be alone in the department and the staff would make me move big furniture alone and would never send anyone to help, but whenever they asked for our help we always went up to the front end.

4177,Costco Wholesale,"Hard Work, But Micromanagement & Constant Negativity From Supes A Downer",2020-10-22,2.0,Food Service Worker,"I don't know where I start on this one: 2 years at the food court/cafe after transferring from stock replenishment. Passed my 3- month probation in Dec 2018, and I was happy. The job is straightforward and it is very hands- on and the more you do it, the easier it becomes. The pay is very generous (better than other places, who offer less money for the same type of work) and I'd say accurately reflects the hard-working nature this type of work offers. As long as you know what you are doing and just get on with it, you'll be fine. I am here for the money above everything else, but I go about my job in a professional and respectful manner. Fast forward to the present day, things are not the same as they were before the pandemic hit for me, but I am fortunate to have a job.","People quitting after 3 years or so, lots of arguing, fall-outs, nothing but stress, but it was busy. There is high turnover for a reason or two: at most people would say they are satisfied & content, but other than that, none of us, well me, especially are happy, it is a very physically demanding role, can be emotionally draining and rota changes/scheduling is chaotic and can be a hassle.  One would feel like they are doing the work of 2 or 3 people. Supervisors would be on your back by criticising you whenever you make a mistake or micromanage the heck out of you. Mostly negative, scrutinising feedback and rarely any encouragement or appraisal offered -, unless they are in a good mood (some would even threaten you with the sack by saying things like 'by x, you won't have a job anymore'. It can be soul-destroying). Also, I understand the pressure supervisors are under, but taking out their frustrations and rage and anger out on us doesn't make us any more productive -, rather this is a sign of poor leadership skills on their actual part, and instead of being an example to us and being helpful, they are being a hinderance with their micromanaging, which is an absolute turn-off. As well as the micromanagement, there is blatant favouritism shown towards certain employees due to being the same 'culture' as them in the warehouse. It's like high school with the clique-y groups. This is a very cutthroat environment: either you have it, or you don't unfortunately and they don't even train you properly, and supervisors are in no hurry to slate you when you make one mistake. Doesn't help matters also how front end is also the main priority, whilst the food court/cafe is underdeveloped, understaffed and overlooked in contrast to other depts. I've never done this type of work before and I always try to do my best, - and after seeing people quit this dept and spoken to people who have done so, I could see why they had had enough. It is worse during the coronavirus pandemic and working under exceedingly (and shall I say overly ambitious) high expectations and the pressure being put on me, even with the seating  and tables removed. Very few people stay in the long run, and if things continue and I am not happy or satisfied come next year later on & post- covid, I might be the next to leave. Funny about how the TV media and press raves on about Costco being a great employer with good benefits that exceeds other retail companies ... but when it comes to the food court, nobody talks about how through this department, the grass is not always greener on the other side. That's because, it isn't. Work-wise, it is no different to working at KFC, McDonalds along with all the hassle, negativity, criticism thrown at you, but for without going home smelling of burgers, fried chicken and chips and inferior pay that KFC, Mcd's offers."

4431,Costco Wholesale,"Good job to start, but eventually get out of there.",2020-09-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Excellent pay and benefits. The company takes care of its employees there is no doubt about it.,"The only way to move to up into a good position is if you are married to a manager, dating one, or just straight forward agreeing with everything the higher-level manager says (even if they are wrong)! 

Management has their favorites who they make unique accommodations for. They also give positions to recent graduates (that's what they will tell people when denying them) over a person who has been dedicated to the company for years, even though Costco says no degree is required to move up. 

Another thing, because ""employees get paid well, they should be able to do the work of 2 or 3 people"" (those were the actual words of a manager). The employees are overworked and stressed out. Many people think employees stay there because they are very content with how they are treated and compensated. Although the pay and benefits are great, most remain there because they have a family to support, no education or have been there too long to start again; therefore, they tolerate the job and try and make it through their shifts.

Most employees have been working there for years; it becomes like a family environment, which is good. However, management is very unprofessional, do not respect people, tell other people's business and they let their ""buddies"" get away with everything. 

Too many hard working employees (long-time employees) have left because of the managers' inability to follow the guidelines and procedures and their unprofessionalism."

Even if you're the most qualified to get the job, they're not gonna give it to you. They would prevent you from getting an FT promotion at all costs just by reducing your hours before you hit 8 week period. Some people get their preferred dayoffs just because they're the favorites or even more senior than you. Even if you perform very well, you're not gonna get any recognitions by promotions. Promotions are highly based on seniority. Schedule and number of hours are based on that too which sucks because some of those more senior staff are underperforming and have less credentials than you."

4467,Costco Wholesale,2 Years At Costco,2020-09-04,5.0,Front End Assistant,Great benefits are provided even for part-time workers.,It's tough to work as a college student
4468,Costco Wholesale,College retention part time employee,2020-09-04,5.0,Front End Employee,"Great coworkers and starting pay. As a college student, they will work around your class schedule. I worked longer weeks during school breaks and weekends when I had class.",It is a fast paced working environment. If you aren't down to be actively running or pushing carts your first year this isn't for you.
4469,Costco Wholesale,Morning Stocker,2020-09-04,2.0,Morning Stocker,Good Pay while still in school and great benefits,Some Front end managers and supervisors. a lot of favoritism and scheduling if it does not involve school
4470,Costco Wholesale,good working environment,2020-09-04,4.0,Assistant,friendly supervisors and good salary,no cons when I worked at costco
4471,Costco Wholesale,Don't Believe in the Hype,2020-09-03,1.0,Produce Associate,Honestly this work is not what its made out to be. If you work the front end doing super easy work (except with carts) getting full hours this job will be great but if you work any of the hard departments and the HARDEST depart of produce then this job all depends on your team. The pay is okay lots of warehouse jobs willing to pay $15 hours as a base and raises are only hours put in (5-8 years) to be maxed out.,"There are alot of cons at Costco at least at the Duluth location. The co-workers in the afternoon and evening shift are filled with despicable, condescending, and immature workers. You're practically in a high school with how much judgement you get and they aren't very high on character either. As for the produce department the training is absolutely horrible at least at the Duluth location. Their training is a sink or swim environment which is why they're are short staffed. It also doesn't help that being short staffed that when you do get a hard working employee that being short staffed you can't train to teach that employee because nobody can teach them. Costco is not a good place to work and their turnover rate at least in the Duluth location is high and why they struggle to have employee stay at the hardest department like produce or any other very rigorous department. None of the co-workers shed any explanation or pragmatic way on working the morning shift at Costco and is why everyone literally everyone in the produce department is over 28+ years old (the youngest being maybe 27). Don't believe in the hype at Costco unless you work a easy department like front end, customer service, HR, or any other easy department. Working at the hardest department you still get paid the base pay as anyone. If you think working produce is the same as working the front end doing no labor work but getting the same pay the produce department will always have a terrible culture, short staffed, and high turnover. Costco might be pay alot but eventually these types of work environments, culture, and pay will get their back turned on by their employees and will kill long-term success and vision. I wouldn't be surprised if Costco ends up getting beat by another competitor in the next 50 years. Also, good luck working at produce when there is so much dead weight and everyone is 50+ years old. Costco is a terrible place to work. It takes you 1-2+ years to get full time and that only if it is available and everything falls in place from your training, hours, and availability. There are so many variables at Costco that benefits are not fully given either. You get part time benefits which is no equivocal to full time."

4477,Costco Wholesale,Overwhelmingly Negative Environment,2020-09-02,1.0,Inventory Control Specialist,There were very few pros of working at Costco.,"Costco has a culture of negativity, blame and bullying of staff. They also have a weirdly cult like obsession with telling you how good Costco is without ever actually proving that they are a good employer. Staff are currently being forced back to work during a pandemic having to wear face masks 8 hours a day after having previously been told it is not safe to have everyone in the office. This demonstrates that they do not care about their employees."

There are several different departments you can be trained in which will give you a more versatile experience and job opportunity.,"Communication from management or to management can be weak; there have been a few occasions or school classes I have had to change my work schedule for, and I directly and clearly communicated it to several of the managers and I was still scheduled for days I was unable to come into work. Many of the employees at Costco do not seem to enjoy their job...possibly being that they have been there for years."

In fact if you actually do get to do the responsibilities your accountable for its a miracle. Decent wages at the surface but to be a manager means they own you and expect you to work whenever they need you and they could careless what is happening with your family on the outside.

My manager has been with the company 25 years and he closes the front end every single day and has two week days off. This is a member based company so we bend over backwards for our members and get genuinely walked all over us as employees. The words I’m going to go to corporate or I’ve been a an executive member for 10+ years and I send a ton of money at your store, go along way and we have to find a way to say yes. Yes I understand that’s how customer service works but unfortunately when you have a member screaming in your face because they forgot their ID and want to buy liquor and as a corporate company we are required to ask for ID if you appear under the age of 35 and your manager tells you to just go ahead and do it to get the guy out out here...that’s not okay, that’s illegal and makes me look stupid for refusing you service just to end up ringing him up anyway. That’s a small minimal sintuation I can name 100+ situations. You had to have to serious backbone to work for this company. Management has very high expectations as for as performance.

During snowpocolypse, Costco started to punish employees who couldn't make it to work and didn't have the PTO to cover it. They later reversed the decision for hourly employed, but salary employees were still not allowed to use sick time for weather excuses.
When COVID started to become a concern, many employees asked for accommodations to work from home.  At first Costco refuses because they felt it was unfair to those working in the warehouses. Then people started to get sick, so they started to let people who had health concerns work from home. Then someone died and Costco got slammed in the news. Well, once members were upset Costco started sending people home. 
Now Costco is requiring people back into the office - even teams that are working successfully from home and maintaining productivity. They won't allow LOA, wwon't consider health concerns. When you ask someone in management with other people around the answer is ""We will take it on a case by case basis."" When you ask them 1-1, the answer changes to ""Quit, demote, or go to the office.""
I joined Costco because of their reputation, but their unwillingness to adapt is destroying that reputation and it's apparent its a repeating issue. 
Hiring internally is also really only possible for certain positions, other positions still require experience or applicable degree like most other companies FYI."

After 5 years I got 2 $1,500 bonus per year; at 7 years 2 $2,000 bonuses per year; and at 10 years 2 $2,500 bonus per year. The highest was 2 $3,000 bonuses per year  at 20 years of service. The quality of work and employees is top notch. They have a generous medical and dental package. It was less than $40 for me and my child per month taken out of my paycheck. They have paid sick leave and paid vacation time which steadily increases after years of service. The call in process was quick and painless. They offered a free trip to Hazeldon and FMLA leave through the company for my struggles with Addiction. They stuck by me until I couldn't fight my addictions any longer and decided to resign. Most of my Costco friends still work there and are lifers. We remain friends to this day.",It is a tough  working on your feet on concrete floors 40 hours a week. My body suffered with a lot of joint pain. But since being drug free and moving from MN to a warmer state I have no more joint pain.

On the 1st day of work I was asked to go outside do carts instead of new hire orientation and I was also asked to wear a soiled smelly vests (that was dumped by the last one who used it) in a box full of dirty vests,ropes and trash bags. I was talked down rudely by staff for simply asking for guidance. Workers have poor work ethics and respect to management. Too many ""supervisors"" giving conflicting directions and poor instructions. The workers make many inappropriate remarks about members while working."

Employees AND management gossip openly about each other, sometimes in the break room for others to hear. Managers take credit for hourly employee's hard work. A pathetic excuse for a sexual harassment policy. They do an ""investigation "" which usually results in the guilty person just being moved to another location instead of fired - allowing them the opportunity to sexually harass again (I've seen it personally, and they are still employed). There's this attitude of ""be thankful you have a job"" which makes employees reluctant to speak up about about issues. When someone does speak up their words fall on deaf ears with some managers. Management spends a ridiculous amount of time on theie phones."

You could be running around everywhere all day or be stuck doing the same thing all day. Most of the supervisors are pretty easy to talk to because they understand some of the work struggles faced by assistants, but management is very distant and seems to only look at us as workers and members as dollar signs. If you try to stand up for yourself against an irate member, be prepared to be talked to by management and try to defend yourself as best you can, but there can still be repercussions even if you weren't at fault. Work-life balance is pretty much nonexistent since your schedule can change on a dime. If the store is short staffed and busy, don't expect management to come in and help, in fact they will just stand there in front of the registers and watch you work your you-know-what off"

All the other benefits are pretty good too. 401k only matches $500, but that's not bad for this line of work. The wages are good for comparable jobs in unskilled labor.

I had blisters and feet were bleeding while working 60 hour weeks during the crona pandemic and was recently let go with no reason. They said they had multiple reasons yet didn't have to share them. What a load of crap you used me to work throughout the pandemic you slowed down then proceeded to fire 5 males out of 30 employees they hired. Oh and the other 25 were female oh yeah non got fired only 1 quit. I guess she wouldn't give in to there sexual favors policy. Oh and dont get on a supervisor bad side they all turn on you.

4831,Costco Wholesale,Really Think About It...,2020-04-07,4.0,Front End Assistant,"The experience was overall good. Some supervisors were better than others with direction. You could tell immediately the ones who really will respect you and be kind instead of pushing the envelope with their role as supervisor. The hours were good but you really do work your butt off. You are there to work and not mess around in any capacity.  Some of the customers were really fantastic. You meet A LOT of people there and that can also be the highlight of the day, meeting someone who is actually happy to be at Costco. I would say the best part about working there was the employees. You become a type of family when working together for that long. Be prepared to be thrown into any position at a moments notice and make sure to look appropriate or you will get sent home. Being put in another position gives you the opportunity to learn the new role but also to know the store better to help customers= Win. 

Do not EVER be late. It does not matter if your mother had a heart attack three times in a month and you were late each of those times, you will get a write up.","Customers can be very mean, especially during the holidays about carts. Be prepared to get yelled at in the pouring rain by customers because there are not any carts left. People can only collect so many carts so fast in the rain or just in general.  Telling management you need more people will sometimes help but most often then not they will just tell you to keep working and do your best. Getting yelled at is not in the job description so consider that. One of the biggest downfalls to working at this job was the supervisors. I hate to say it, but only a few of them really work hard. Having supervisors that do not come at you maliciously if you do something wrong is important. We are all human and we learn from our mistakes, so just know that some of them are so headstrong about their position they think it is okay to admonish employees for doing one wrong thing."

They promote within which is nice and it is especially a great job for those without a degree that wants to succeed. Also another benefit  is they are all over the US so you can move to other locations without having to change jobs .,Due to job promotion opportunities and just wanting to change departments there is too much movement at times and it messes up the dynamics of the department once running smoothly . Store managers tend to change stores aprox every 5 years and you could have a great working store and a new manager who is weak  come in and destroy the dynamics of the store promoting fear and division.  Some promotions are favoritisms driven And clicks with managers form creating a stressful environment . I sold memberships inside and outside store and it is a very hard job in which you are not appreciated or compensated with higher pay and cashiers make more money then you do. Returns is also in the dept and you are expected to help but if you are not “ labeled” as a cashier you do not get paid unless you keep track of the hours kn the reg.

Every single change has to go through the CEO (or his office). He might be a good CEO for retail, but certainly not a good one for IT. He needs to trust his subordinates. . 

I will not be surprised if Costco stocks plummet in a couple of years or so if nothing would change, because the tech people who keep Costco operations up are ignored, in favor of archaic culture perpetuated by management who are very inexperienced with modern tech practices. . 

Compensation is still very uncompetitive, both with salary and benefits. It's a tiny bit better than last year but still falls short compared to the industry average. You won't get enough time off, and you won't get to telecommute (If they say otherwise, it's a lie. Trust me, I work here). Their selling point is job security, which is a double-edged sword: good for lazy and incompetent people, but bad for everyone else who works with these people. . 

Again, no telecommuting. Reason? In the name of equality. There are a lot of employees who are required to be in the office, so tech workers (who should not have issues telecommuting) suffer as well. NO equity, NO fairness. It is simply just, equality. . 

If one employee catches a virus, everybody has to get them as well. This is the management's definition of ""fairness"". Seriously, I am genuinely concerned not only for my health, but also for my life. . 

To their credit, some in management push for change. But again, if the supreme CEO says no, everybody just agrees and all hope goes away. I am not sure exactly how this works, but this is how many people in these positions describe it to us. . 

No one has a real voice, which is why people like me opt to voice out our concerns here in Glassdoor. They continue refusing to listen to the workforce—the people who are not in any political hierarchy—the ACTUAL tech workers. Do I think Costco is a good company to work for? Maybe for retail, but definitely not for IT. . 

Also, you pay for coffee. If they say there is free coffee, they are talking about the coffee infused with used socks. Real coffee here costs money."

The people you work with are amazing and if members give you trouble, the supervisors will always hear you out first.

4977,Costco Wholesale,The grass isn’t always greener on the other side.,2020-01-29,2.0,Stocker,"Costco pays its employees well* for work that requires little skill.

*As of March 2019, the starting rate is $15.00 across Canada. A $0.50 raise is incurred after working 1,040 hours, then a $1.00 raise is incurred for every 1,040 additional hours worked until reaching the top rate. The top rate is $25.25 for Service Assistants and $27.15 for Service Clerks. At this point, employees become eligible for lump sum payments twice per year that start at $3000.","1. Little opportunity for full-time employment.

All employees start as Seasonal or Regular Part Time (RPT) employees. RPT employees are guaranteed a minimum of twenty five hours per week. Seasonal and Limited Part Time (LPT) employees are not guaranteed hours. Opportunities for full-time employment come by every now and then but they are awarded strictly by seniority, even if the most senior applicant is woefully incompetent.

There are opportunities to pick up additional hours in the warehouse as an RPT employee, but these are generally hard to come by. Overtime is out of the question. Management will have you sign a document forfeiting any accumulated overtime should you do so.

2. Little opportunity for growth and development.

The only way you’ll move up in the company is if you’re an attractive female willing to put out, so I’ve been told...

3. Little regard for health and safety, or upholding their own ethical values when handling health and safety claims.

The average warehouse has three times as many workplace accidents than the average Walmart. When you’re inevitably injured, expect management to do everything in their power to jeopardize your WSIB claim. Tactics include incorrectly completing paperwork, withholding paperwork, withholding mail, and outright bullying and harassment."

5032,Costco Wholesale,Great Company to Start Out With or Even Stay With,2020-01-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pay is fair. The more you work, the faster you get a pay raise. Working past 8 hours counts as overtime (pay x 1.5). Sunday pay is also pay x 1.5.

Schedules are flexible, especially if you're a student. But remember, it is retail (at least at the warehouse level), so the management's/company's needs come first.

Benefits are incredible, even with a part-time position. Instead of elaborating, I'll just say that you would want your company to have the benefits Costco has. When Google was #1 and Costco was #2 on Glassdoor a few years ago, not even Google's benefits were as good as Costco's. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
I don't know if that's changed for Google.

Management is pretty good. There have been three warehouse managers at my location since I started working there. The first one was lazy. The second was very hard-working (now retired). This third one is also hard-working and probably shows more care about the employees than the previous two. So, I'd say each one has been overall better than the last.","There is not any real training prior to starting the job, at least for the department I'm in. This can be tough for newcomers (and it can lead to a lot of rework for current/long-time employees). Fortunately, my experience at a previous company helped me a lot.

The company works with a lot of legacy systems or with software feels like it is still stuck in the 80's or 90's.

Management at other locations can be very political in some departments.

Regional managers do not always communicate well-enough with each other. One says to do one thing, and the other says to do the complete opposite."

5034,Costco Wholesale,"physically demanding, fast paced",2020-01-05,3.0,Member Services,"I worked as a seasonal employee during the 201 holiday season.  The pay was $15/hour with most weeks being worked part time at around 24-30 hours.  I assisted at check out lanes, pushed carts up from the parking lots, helped members find items in the warehouse, folded clothes, and put items back on shelves from where members dumped them in the warehouse.

The seasonal job was a great way to learn about the company.  I got to try out a lot of different spots in the warehouse and got some good insights into how the company is run for members and shareholders, as well as their policies for employees.

Costco hires with HS diploma or GED.  The warehouse that I was in had several staff members with disabilities (physical, behavioral).","Seasonal work rarely leads to full-time, permanent employment from what I can tell.  Out of over 25 seasonal staff members, I believe they are keeping less than 5 on after 89 days.  The people I know are being retained are all very young so I wouldn't say that Costco hires people over 50 despite press to the contrary.  

The work is very physical.  There is no allowance in the seasonal workforce for physical limitations (for example, a bad knee or back).  There are no sick days or holiday days as part of your employment.

Management at this store are not particularly accessible.  At orientation, we were told repeatedly 'just ask a supervisor or manager', but with the pace of the warehouse operations, there isn't time to sit down with anyone.  All conversations are handled on the fly and I found this led to misunderstandings that then required circling back around and being taken for a 'talk in'the office'."

Warehouse is closed on the following days: New Years Day, Easter, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas

You are paid for the holiday closures listed above, in addition to a floating paid day for MLK jr.

Part time employees receive benefits listed above at a slightly lower coverage rate.

Casual dress code: Jeans or shorts, collard shirt, tennis shoes

Paid sick time and paid vacation time.

Depending on your supervisor, you may get a Saturday or Sunday off once in a while without requesting off.","High pressure to work faster and harder every day, regardless of size of task/project.

Members have high expectations for level of service, meaning they will give you a hard time if you ever utter the words ""no"" to any request or demand.

Management is not eager to train employees. Training is self sought through advice from other coworkers or on computer - which is difficult to find time to do so on a daily basis with high foot traffic. 

Full-time status is extremely rare and hard to reach due to low turnover - regardless of cross training you wait until you either transfer to a warehouse, someone else transfers out, death/illness, or retirement."

I’ve spent the last 20 plus years in the corporate world managing business units, and this is the worst environment and job I have ever worked at. The people, especially the supervisors act at a high school level. The professionalism is horrific, they talk down to you, do not value you, and practice being crappy to the new people. This is a mindless job that they take way to seriously and over analyze wiping of a counter, or packing a box. 

Most of the time there are 7 supervisors standing around watching 30 people work, like they are prison guards, it’s ridiculous. They talk behind your back, the older workers stare at you and laugh and want talk to you and treat you as if you are not welcomed into their cool group. They start rumors about you and literally think they are the cool kids on the block, or much like the people that work at the DMV. As if being a cashier is some sort of high ground in life.

Cashiers dont care if you are new they need to make  their numbers, they hate you  because you slow them down cause your training on the job they dont care about training you, neither do managers There is no training at all, but dont mess up what ever they throw at you cause by osmosis you should know, we will tell you at 3 weeks what a mess you are.  God dont be too smart you will make them mad., -Managers some, have no skills other than bulling those below them on the job scale. Dont like you.. go push carts when your sick, in the cold, cause I dont like you,  hello middle school.  Push you to the brink of exhaustion  during the holiday and week ends. A lot of front end people are in pain from the heavy lifting yet others just stand around including managers. Women get the brunt of this front end heavy work. Heavy lifting all shift. Never fail to push you to the level of breaking your body and spirit. Just not worth it, life is too short to sell your soul for a few bucks and benefits. Oh and get the Visa card, you will get rich with the card and thats all we take. Have you heard of our sale of urns and caskets and 2 percent cash back  on your funeral after the holidays, on your Costco Visa?"

5086,Costco Wholesale,I was working there as a seasonal.,2019-12-07,2.0,Front End/Cashier Assistant,Time and a half on Sunday. Closed major holidays. Free food in break room sometimes.,"The jobs at Costco are very physical, so make sure you're in a good enough shape and you can handle it. They have you pushing carts outside in the wind, snow, freezing rain etc, for 2 hours in a stretch (if they forget to call you back in, expect to be there for 3 hours in a stretch. Not cool, Costco! You'll be helping the cashiers put things in Members shopping carts. Don't expect much help from the Members to unload their carts filled to a brim, because they'll just leave them there and wait for you to do it. Then they'll ask for everything to be put in boxes, and it has to be done a certain way and the boxes have to be custom made or to their liking if you don't want to be insulted and called a useless worker. You'll also have to go fetch them items that they either realized they forget to grab, or they just decide in the last minute that they don't want some perishable items that you have to run all across the end of the store to put back. A lot of times, Members don't read the price signs, so they don't know that some items come in pair otherwise the cashier can't sell them. That's when you go fetch them the other item because they tell you flat out that they don't feel like going back on the other side of the store to get them. You'll do lots of fetching and returning perishable items, whilst trying to box their groceries. If you're a closer, like I always was, they'll have you clean the entire register area, ie; sweeping and moping floors, empty garbage etc, all on your own, with no help. Then they'll tell you to hurry because you have to help out on the floor (they call it boxing). Be aware that no matter what your age is, your body will hurt constantly. I've had many sleepless nights because of the way they abuse their seasonal workers. You'll also have to be part of their clique for them to like you and/or consider you for a part time or full time position. Where I worked, there were a lot of Hispanics, and believe me, they didn't like anyone else. It was pure hell for me as a white woman to do my job because most of the cashiers were Hispanic, and they made my working life at Costco a living hell. I felt like I had stepped to a different dimension/realm. I left before my time there was up, as many before me did. I could cope with the hard, physical job, I just couldn't handle being insulted and put down just because I'm not Hispanic. The managers/supervisors are not nice, to say the least. They don't seem too happy to work there. I'm guessing they just stick it up for the money and great benefits. I'm glad the Universe sent a new job my way, and finally got me out of there, because I was dying."

5115,Costco Wholesale,Review of Corp IT,2019-11-21,1.0,Functional Analyst,"Medical/Dental benefits are good. $15 co-pays, ~$24/month cost for an individual employee.","For the first three years there is *NO* 401k match. There is no set policy on a 401k match percentage,  its whatever they deem to give and they only contribute once per year at the end of the year. Employees lose on accruing interest. Costco takes a kick back of the 401k fees but will not disclose how much. 401k fees are high.  Vacation time is only 2 weeks for first five years. However management gives some new hires more vacation time, a totally undocumented and unfair practice. Base benefits are not applied to all employees equally. There are no stock awards or ESPP. There are no bonuses. The work space consists of low cubicle walls with 4-6 people squished into a cube. There is no place to park, unless you have been here 20 years then you are gifted a reserved space. Telecommuting is not permitted. Promotions are based on who you know not qualifications. If you did not work on the business side or been here long enough to fail upward,  it's almost impossible to get into management. It's a sexist environment, which management seems clueless about. Complaints about this go nowhere. The opinions of  vendors or consultants are taken over the  skilled IT employees. Much time is wasted as people just BS during meetings and pretty much the rest of the day. Generally unprofessional environment, no one is prepared, no one is accountable, no one has a plan."
5116,Costco Wholesale,good pay but you're just a number,2019-11-21,3.0,Customer Service Associate,If you have no ambition. You can stay there and you're seniority will allow you to make a livable wage,"poor hours,it's hard to get days off or weekends off,  poor management"
5117,Costco Wholesale,Depends on the Warehouse,2019-11-20,3.0,Deli Clerk,The benefits are amazing and the pay is awesome,"Depending on where you work, the managers are useless. Not all warehouses have a bad assembly of managers, but unfortunately, I was stuck with one of the worst warehouses I have ever seen. They didn't take proper care of their employees; a friend of mine got so sick from trying to follow the workload that she had to take a week off. And they STILL treated her horribly after she went back."
5118,Costco Wholesale,Bakery wrapper turned into bakery prep,2019-11-20,3.0,Bakery Wrapper,$15 an hour. Time and a half on Sundays.,"I was supposed to be a wrapper yet I’m lifting at least 50 boxes of 50-80 pound boxes of frozen dough repeatedly throughout the day to put onto trays. They hired two men to be wrappers yet make the women do all the heavy lifting with pallets and stocking frozen dough into the freezer while playing Tetris with all the rusty racks in the way. They expect to change a schedule the day before and it be okay. No breaks. Huge language barrier when you don’t speak Spanish. Spanish music playing loudly all morning until the store opens. Being snapped at to work faster. Older employees being mean to us seasonal employees like we did something wrong, they just stare at us and talk when we walk away. Bakery is so loud, when people talk it sounds like whispers so you have to yell. People who’ve been there for 20 years expect you to remember everything by your second shift. I’ve already sprained my knee, my foot is swollen, and my wrist is swollen. The heavy lifting is always done by the tiny women while the men get to carry around plastic trays. I used to want to work here forever and now I dread going into work. I can’t wait until the season ends the first week of January. When they hire you they tell you, “we all started as seasonal so just work really hard and be in the top 10 and you might get hired on permanently” typical manager talk to get you to work your butt off for the season. Some of the managers are really really nice and genuine, others seem bitter. They are usually only hiring in the bakery as they said the turnover rate is so high, people always quit their first month. Two people who got hired with me quit their first day. They tell you that you’ll be a bakery wrapper in your interview which is easy fast paced work but then they actually tell you, “that’s just what they hire you as but you can turn into prep or whatever we want”."

5181,Costco Wholesale,Makes me believe retail can be a career.,2019-10-23,5.0,Bakery Associate,"1.) Amazing benefits for $46 a month or $23 a paycheck. I am Part-Time and get to reap the benefits. Good stuff.
2.) Guaranteed 24hr week if you are a regular part-time employee.
3.) Old-Styled Company Environment(also a con.)
4.) Great pay. You get a raise every 1046 hours or something like that. If you're full-time that's one every 5-6 months. Cap out in six years unless you promote.
5.) Management genuinely cares about quality in its department, workers, and products. It's a breath of relief compared to where I use to work.
6.) Corporate Leaders are actually likeable. I met the CEO a few months ago alongside some of his comrades and genuinely liked the experience. Other district/regional leaders have been generally fun to listen to for advice and making the department upkeep it's quality, purpose, and continue offering the best for the members.","1.) Old-Styled Company. Promotions are based off of seniority alongside qualifications, but seniority bares heavy influence when it comes to promotions.
2.) Five-day Availability required, so expect a lot of five-hour shifts. Not an issue for me since I am five minutes away, but I know someone who drives nearly fifty miles for a five-hour shift.
3.) If membership sales are down, your hours will go down. It's not your fault, the warehouse just doesn't have enough payroll. Even if it's busy every day, Costco makes such a low-profit margin outside of memberships it might not even matter that much.
4.) Don't ever skimp out on remembering certain commandments, quality commandments, and certain policies. You will regret it. Not really a con, but there's a lot to remember. It's usually common sense but when you try to go for a promotion you may be asked to state word-for-word specific policies and commandments.
5.) It's still a retail job. Your schedule may be inconsistent, your days off will be split, you may be asked to work an odd-ball shift here and there."

I was so excited when they hired me on, I wanted to grow and have it be my forever job. In my orientation I was told after 6 months I could ask to be moved to a different section. Working in the food court was difficult. Not only was the work hard but most of the employees are so rude to each other. One went as far as asking me why I work if I’m First Nations as we get everything paid for. I kept my mouth shut because I was a new employee and didn’t want to start anything. I’m a friendly person and try to be nice to everyone but 4 months in that proved to be a mistake. They made me sign a confidentiality agreement so I can’t say much except an employee who works all around the store started making very inappropriate and creepy comments that made me worry for my safety. I new I had to report it to management. After 3 weeks of “investigating” the solution was that they told him he wasn’t allowed to talk to me anymore and I  was just supposed to accept that. I brought up being transferred to a different store and they told me that would mean they failed and couldn’t have that. By the end I felt like I had nothing to work towards there. My only option was to trust that because they had spoken to the man who threatened me I should feel safe. I didn’t. My last day I went into the lunch room and the man was there. I was going to eat lunch in my car but I couldn’t bring myself to come back to work. I called the management to let them know. They said someone would follow up with me. It’s been 2 weeks and no one has."

5294,Costco Wholesale,"Cashier Assistant: packing groceries, running errands, pushing carts, stocking, blocking down,",2019-09-03,2.0,Cashier Assistant,Most employees not in management are awesome to work with. The pay is probably the best part with guaranteed hours plus benefits. Always busy so time usually flies. Two breaks & a paid 30 minute lunch for an 8 hour shift. Shifts vary for part timers 4-8 hours. They are very much about a “sense of urgency” which basically means the job is your daily workout.,"Lots of challenges. Always stressed, always under pressure, & highly criticized by members/management. The worst part is the management, & how they choose to run the business. They make a handbook & all these fancy 10 page long policies just to pick & choose when they want to follow them. So if you’re not a favorite you’ll get the handbook punishment, if you are favorited, you get an undocumented talk from a manager saying to correct an action. They are horrible at prioritizing. They break rules all the time, set horrible examples for leaders, yet expect lower employees to always do the right thing & not make mistakes. If you’re the kind of person to wear your emotions on your sleeve from things going on in your personal life, expect a conversation from a higher up telling you to essentially be a robot. They tell you they need you to get over it & overbear you with saying it’s not okay to feel that way at work because the members are more important & we don’t want to rub them wrong or ruin their shopping experience. Write ups are the literal definition of nonsense. One manager will tell you it’s okay to do X & then you get a write up a week later for doing said X. Communication is expected from lower workers, they ambush you with “you need to tell your higher up everything you do every time you do something”, yet the managers never communicate. You get frowned upon for not using the restroom on your breaks or lunches, especially within 30 minutes of taking them. When I was first hired everything I did was done the wrong way. I had one manager tell me how to do something & then the next manager I’d work with said that was wrong & showed me how to do it “correctly”. That is literally with everything, & every manager tells you how to do a task differently. It is stressful. The members are also extremely entitled, you’re expected to wipe the corners of their mouth after a meal. It is soul crushing. You just have to stand there smiling & eat it. Otherwise you get a write up for explaining the policies of the business, that you can’t allow them to break the rules because they “do it all the time”. So if you tell them they can’t do something you get in trouble, if you allow it you get in trouble. No winning. There are definitely cliques, a handful of employees are nothing but bored workers who create major drama. There are a ton of negatives, because I like to enjoy my work environment. Granted I know you get a fair share anywhere you go, but this place is overall exhausting. You can never win, even if you know you were in the right, it doesn’t matter to them. It wasn’t right enough, or that was good, but “do this instead next time”. They let the members walk all over you, & some employees. Like I said they pick & choose. It’s exhausting, frustrating, & stressful. You get guaranteed hours, but it gets stressful if you pay bills. One week/pay period you’ll work minimum 24 hours, the next almost 40. There was a span of 4 months that I got no more than 24 hours a week. That’s a 600 dollar check. When you work a ton of hours you can get up to 900+. If you were to apply, I would highly recommend to go to any department other than the front end. Every other department seems to run smoothly, front end is under a microscope. Managers always watching & picking your work ethic apart. As you can tell from my super long list of cons, it is a job that isn’t a joke, but also is. Major pros with major cons. The pay can be worth it at times, but all of the stress makes you dream of quitting. Main issue is management, if you can handle the rude, entitled members, that’s one thing, but the higher end is corrupt."

Communication is worse such as gossip and talking behind co-workers back.

Room for growth but management doesn't seem enthused on giving you any information about it.

As a seasonal, lack a lot of information and training. You are pushed to the lions den right away. 

Training was obnoxious and not helpful.  You Learn by making the mistakes first and get written notices left and right.  Then you will learn.

Dead weight

Parking - have seen people recently resorting to buying scooters to get from the parking garage to the IS buildings. Scooters! Honestly I don’t blame them that’s a long walk and the shuttles are slow. 

Slow shuttles. If you have to park at the main garage, be prepared to wait for the shuttle then wait as you stop at other buildings and going through Issaquah traffic. And if you have a manager that demands you work your “shift” be prepared to have to figure in your commute time not just from your house but also the commute from the main campus so you be on time for your “shift”. 

Food is cheap(er) but not that good. Even the coffee in the deli isn’t free. Never worked for a place that didn’t even give their employees free coffee. 

Seems like most people don’t care about their jobs. The probably had no experience doing what they are doing, just trained on the job. Here, read this “job-aid”... Never managed Active Directory? No problem!

A lot of former “cart pushers” in IS that don’t know anything other than “Costco IT”. (Which is usually the wrong way to do it). Others that now that they are out of the warehouse and at corporate are just on “cruise control” (do as little as possible, watch YouTube, go shopping at Best Buy, etc) until retirement. 

The good people all leave because they can’t enact change

No work from home AT ALL.  - this is especially frustrating because considering what they pay tech workers you can’t afford to live anywhere near 

No incentive. I’m a top performer but why should I even try? The difference in yearly raise is 1% between myself and the guy who falls asleep at his desk every afternoon

No accountability. You can literally cause a mistake that results in millions of dollars in lost profit/sales and nothing happens. 

Holiday vacation blackouts - this is the dumbest thing for IS. There is a change freeze during this time anyways. This is the PERFECT time for IS to be able to take vacation. 

Issaquah - traffic is so bad. Most of this is Costco corporate employees. Since you can’t work from home it only makes the issue worse. Also if you work in IS you have to work out of the Issaquah office. Nowhere else. Mind you that you can’t afford to live anywhere close. Be prepared for an hour commute each way to Maple Valley/Covington."

Customers: Since they pay a membership fee, you owe them your life - or that's how a handful of them act.  Don't look to management to back you up in a tough situation. I suggest looking into meditation and heavy drinking.

Company Morale: Day of orientation they let you know that once you past your 90 days, its really hard for Costco to fire you - which reflects in a lot of the employees. Most give 30% effort which brings down the work morale for the great workers. Why give 110% when most people are getting by with 30%?"

5567,Costco Wholesale,"Could've been great, but it wasn't",2019-05-13,3.0,Certified Pharmacy Technician,"Free  membership; good hours (pharmacy is open from 10-7 pm Monday-Friday; 9-6 Saturday; closed on Sunday); nice lunch break 30 minutes on the clock, 30 minutes off the clock.  Patient load is significantly smaller compared to other retail/chain pharmacies due to people thinking that you can't get in the warehouse without a membership (so 90+% of pharmacy clientele are members).  Pretty sure they have good benefits too (I didn't get them because I'm still on parents insurance and such).  And they have nice, quality goods in the warehouse.","They didn't want to work with my schedule.  You have to be available to work on Saturdays (maybe not every Saturday but you have to have open availability since the pharmacy is not open on Sundays);  they were really dodgy when talking about the pay.  Costco doesn't really care about experience.  Everyone starts out at the same amount which is $14-14.50/hr then you get a raise whenever you work a certain amount of hours.  It's nice if you plan on making a career out of working at Costco but if you don't you might not wait around to see that $25 cap, especially if you only work part-time.  So if you see anybody saying ""oh I make 18, 20, 21 dollars an hour,""  check their location and then ask them how long they've been working at Costco."

The environment is generally quite negative, quite a few people looking forward to leaving which is not surprising given that your breaks are counted to the last second.

I've worked in retail a few times and this was by far the most unpleasant."

5591,Costco Wholesale,Shelf Stocker,2019-05-02,5.0,Shelf Stocker,Hired part time work full time hours,Assigned to three different departments
5592,Costco Wholesale,Was good at the beginning,2019-05-02,3.0,Supervisor,"The hourly wage was great for retail, highest in the industry period, point blank. No one else even close (for supervisors in retail). 

Work schedules were exact. You basically work the same schedule, no OT, week in and week out. This is great for someone who owns a side business or has school, etc, kids, etc. You don't have to worry about your schedule being erratic. 

Holidays were pretty good. Costco observes most holidays, Easter included. Plus, you receive 3 float days of which you could take anytime during the year.

A 5 year employee that made supervisor by their 3rd year, would look similar to this:
3 weeks vacation
3 float free days
22.50-23.00/hour
Get a chance to pick set days off","Due to the higher pay rate for the average worker, you will probably have a thin staff. So, a cashier(or any hourly employee, except for pharmacy and optical) will work the register, return merchandise to correct areas, ""zone"" large areas like foods, frozen goods, soda and detergent area, candy/nuts area, give breaks to other depts, push carts, load merchandise...A supervisor may be seen from time to time pushing carts, working the food court, running the register, stocking, and supervising 20+ employees.

Rush hours are early opening, noon, and 4:30-6:30 pm, expect there to be long lines, people complaining, several employees asking for their breaks (even when running the breaks on time) some breaks end up running together...

Expect to always call for help out of other departments if you are running the front end where the registers are. Also, expect to work like you're fighting fire on Friday, Sat, Sun. This is when everyone comes out and lines are all the way to the back of the store, store shelves are scattered, everything is out of place and you must recover the store before sending people home but they cannot have OT...it gets terrible at times.

If you're a stocker or supervisor on the stock crew, expect early mornings and early shifts heading home but also expect to change the layout of certain areas 3-4 times a week. Sometimes you will change a layout for one item only to change it right back the next day because that item is sold out. 

It only takes so many times to lift a green-egg grill before your back gives out."

These guys need serious help on all accounts of equality. I work in the depot in Dallas and I have to say that these guy have 0 time management skills. Be prepared to suffer, because this job is not about work ethic at all, it is 100% a popularity contest. You will not get anywhere if you work hard in this company they will keep you on the ground. Best bet stay back do your time and just talk to people until your told to work. Instead of being proactive. They reward laziness and punish hard work. Now if you are any form of black or African American male, You will be favored the most, above everyone and no one will rarely tell you, you are wrong or
Messed up, even if you are unsafe, a lot of people here get on their phones while they are on EPJ’s and forklift even while driving on in lanes. This has been brought to multiple levels of management and no one has said anything to the people who do this. This is completely unsafe, to do this on any equipment especially where you already have bare minimum of line of sight. If you wanted to move up in this company and you are a hard worker and one of your strengths is work ethic and integrity. Then I would strongly suggest stay away or leave the company. They treat those work ethic like pack mules and servants and treat lazy Individuals  like masters. The true people who run this company are lazy people not the CEO, the CEO should see how their employees are truly treated the ones who care about the deadlines and work hard to finish all their work. Instead of the mentality of “let’s make this work last all day so we can get all of our hours and maybe have roll over so we have more work for tomorrow. “ that statement has been said by some supervisor here and a lot of employees. Those who work hard and want to get their job done are ostracized by their fellow employees and management, for working hard, and are forced to work even harder to pick up the slack."

Pay is decent as a manager.,"The job is monotonous and advancement is very tenure based. Upper management has no clear plans of what to do but just wants you to ""figure it out."" It's really a trap job. As an hourly employee you get paid a great wage for just showing up and there's no performance factors that come into play. Let me repeat: there are no performance factors that you are expected to live up to. They can talk to you they can ""p-log"" you, which is a slap in the wrist but as long as you show up to work on time and don't miss too many days or do anything stupid you're fine. But you'll be doing the same work. Every day. As a supervisor you make a dollar more than the highest employee you manage. But again you turn around one day and realize that you're not going anywhere. Most people there are zoo animals and are lucky to work there because they would never survive in the wild aka any place that holds them accountable for their performance."

People look at you like you are a second class citizen. You are very busy helping out members but supervisor Leon yells at you to pick up a small piece of trash in the floor because his lazy behind cannot bend over to help!  What happened to lead by example?  And this person has no concept of allowing his staff to bully new or temp employees.  Suprised Costco hasn't had lawsuits for discrimination?  People are afraid to speak to each other like humans.  Only talk about Costco stuff.  And you are competing for a permanent position with other temp help.  Trust me for less then 15 bucks an hour it isn't worth the humiliation!  Teamwork is a joke.  I finished and they wanted me to come back but I got another job M-F for 21 dollars an hour.

I was in my 60s during the 18 months I spent working there, and slept VERY well after each work day! As with all jobs that involve working with the public, having a very thick skin is an advantage, as Costco customers can be quite nasty to cashiers and cashier assistants--a phenomenon I never quite understood. Plan on working nights until 10:00 occasionally, or even frequently, depending on the whims of those who write your schedule. You will likely work non-stop and at a physically taxing speed during holidays and weekends.

I understand that most higher positions are applied in house (Need at least one year experience with Costco) but as someone who has supervisor experience, I'm denied an opportunity. In my mind, it shouldn't be hard to train a new supervisor and teach them Costco values and ethics coming from another employer.  Lack of communication between supervisors, breaks go out from 30-60 minutes late, throwing production off when staff of around 30-40 are waiting. I typically worked outside pushing carts, which I'm fine with but when we are told rules such as ""Don't wear your hoods while it rains"" because our manager would rather us get wet than get hit by traffic. I understand that but it came across as an insult to my intelligence. I can't fully turn my head side to side when crossing? And lastly, one of the disgusting things that I've seen while employed was the endless harassment of long time employees to newer ones, related to that would be similar to a High School, with cliques."

-Cheap benefits compared to most companies.

This is a huge con though if you want to actually get work done since there is a lot of dead weight.","-Management doesn't really care about you, and doesn't listen to feedback at all.  We had an employee survey that, after many promises, was never given serious consideration by management.  After repeatedly saying they would release the results, it was swept under the rug and no official response ever came out of it.  The main response was to hire a different survey company, who released results that Costco IS had the worst results of any company they had ever surveyed.  I also found internal documentation showing that management had paid for cultural consultants to come in years ago for an assessment.  The consultants summarized all of the issues perfectly and management chose to ignore all of their feedback.  Costco management has a culture of doing whatever they want at the expense of their employees.  Costco management as a whole also has a reputation of being a good-old-boys club.  Just Google ""costco management sexism"" if you don't believe me.  Management is filled with suck-ups who really don't care about you, and only want you to fall in line.
-Management is for the most part not technical at all, and this really hurts the IT organization.  It wasn't uncommon for management to transfer from the warehouse to IT.  The running joke was that we had bakery managers running things.
-Costco IS has a culture of awarding tenure over ability.  They don't care if you work hard or not.  All that matters is how many years you've worn a Costco badge.  This is reflected in the parking, vacation, 401k and other policies which reward people who have worked there the longest.  It doesn't matter if you have 15 years of experience prior to working at Costco.  You won't be taken seriously unless you've been there a really long time.  Speaking of vacation, it is totally non-negotiable.  You start with 2 weeks of vacation up until 5 years.  The 401k is the poorest of any that I've ever personally seen with a maximum $500 match for the first year.  They basically treat you like a warehouse worker even if you work in Corporate IT.
-Parking absolutely sucks.  They have an insane reserved parking spot system that rewards employees who have been there 15+ years.  At one point it was so bad if you weren't at work before 7AM you weren't getting a parking spot and would have to shuttle over.
-There is a real lack of accountability.  It doesn't matter if you only work 5 hours a day, as long as you are able to man a chair for core hours, you will be receiving a paycheck.  I saw people cause multi-million dollar outages through negligence and they were not punished.  I never saw anyone getting fired for anything and it was really bad.
-Working from home is strictly prohibited, unless you are a contractor.  They repeatedly wouldn't allow us to work from home, but at the same time they were willing to allow it for contractors.  This felt like regular employees were being punished while contractors were being rewarded.
-The on-call rotation was the worst I've ever been a part of in 15 years.  When you are on-call expect to be paged at all hours of the night.  You won't be able to have a normal weekend because you will be repeatedly paged for the dumbest reasons.
-Technical debt is a huge issue at Costco IS.  If you're big on 1990s IT concepts this is your place.  Things like the cloud were in their infancy and were already being misused at Costco.  There was no serious planning, and no vision by anyone in the IT department with any real power.
-The pay and benefits were very poor for the Seattle area.  This really needs to be addressed because they will have issues recruiting and keeping the quality employees they are going to need to modernize Costco IS.
-The Costco IS office space really sucks.  My team was in a huge 2 story building that is an extremely large open space.  The cubical walls are only about 3 feet tall and people's voices carried for miles.  If you were trying to get any serious work done, you would basically be required to buy expensive noise cancelling headphones.  The building also featured totally inadequate parking.  At one point people parked across the painted line and got towed.  It wasn't a good place to go to every day at all.  It also smelled like mold in that building, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some serious problems with it."

Essentially telling you to not make exceptions to certain rules, but then when a member asks to speak to a manager the manager will not back you on the rule and let it slide. However if you just skip the whole process and ignore the rule yourself you will get written up. Sometimes there can be too many supervisors overseeing the same thing and you get conflicting roles assigned and a bit of back and forth where ones tells you to do one thing ten the other says something else. Then the first will return and scold you for not doing what they told you to do."

Throughout the employment, no one mentioned that depending on the companies needs, we may not be working later in the season.  eventually, all us seasonal employees saw that for the month of january we wouldn't be working.  again, no notice of this at any time during my employment.  my thought then was, ok, that's terribly dishonest, but i still need money.  then, on the last week that i'd be working there, when my schedule was full of hours, they call me before my shift and tell me I don't need to come in.

In my time so far I have learnt many potions including Front-end assistant and cashier, pharmacy assistant cross training and now membership assistant. With membership there is lots of promoting with MasterCard and upgrades but as long as you tell the members then what more can anyone expect.",There have not been many downsides of working here. Some that I can say is it does take some time to move around since there are so many employees within your warehouse and other warehouses that you can be competing for a postion with. Also to be making well above minimum wage or to get full-time does take quite some time. So as long as you are patient and are doing your best eventually you will get what you want.

6008,Costco Wholesale,"Easy Job made difficult by petty, rude, and lazy Supervisors/Managers",2018-10-29,1.0,Stocker,"-You get benefits even if you are part time.
-Advancement opportunities at other warehouses.","Lazy supervisors that make you do their work. You will be told to sweep their area they were working in, bail their trash, stock their stuff, etc while they stand around and talk to each other.

Disrespectful supervisors and managers talk to you like you are a child. I get disrespected on a daily basis, even the members talk down to stockers. Do not try to retaliate because they will bully you by doing things passive aggressively so it will be hard to report it. 

Petty staff that look for reasons to mess with people. For example I had to print out signs but the printer was out of paper. Like how I usually do I was going to replace the paper. I opened up the 2nd tray because that is the one that was out of paper and that prints the type of signs I needed. Some clerical worker/Front end staff gets mad at me and tells me to close it and open the first tray. She says the 1st tray is for letters and I tell her I don't need that one. She then tell me I need the 3rd tray. I showed her it wasn't the right one. Then she says the 2nd tray (the one I had open in the beginning) and she tells me:  ""Well, next time look at the screen and learn how to read."" 

What is crazy about this is that it had nothing to do with her. She was not using the printer and  when she saw that she was wrong and I was right from the beginning; she starts throwing out insults. Similar to a lot of people that work at this warehouse she is petty and have a superiority complex and when it got challenged she resorts to insults. There are many more examples like this where people not involved get involve just so they can talk down to you. 

Another con is how you are treated like a child. You are not allowed to use the restroom unless you are on break. If you use the restroom while not on a break they consider that ""stealing"" from the company. (They told us this at a meeting that was suppose to celebrate our hard work but it was just to yell at all of us because some people don't follow the rules). Good luck getting a break too. There are plenty of times I was forced to skip my 15 minute break to do something for a supervisor. What they do to not get in trouble is they make you stay 15 minutes after your shift so they can say you took your 15.

Your schedule will change constantly and if someone takes off then you are going to have your day off taken from you. All they have to do is notify you within 24 hours and they can take it away. 

They are also very strict on clocking in and out. You have to clock in right on your time not a minute early or that is considered stealing company time.

The job is very easy but the managers/supervisors make it complicated by using ambiguous speech. They will tell you: ""Grab that pallet over there"", and there are three pallets over there. If you go back and ask for them to be specific they will yell at you and if you bring back the wrong one they will yell at you. 

The Supervisors and Managers act like they are better than you and they do not appreciate their employees work. They take advantage of good will and niceness. They even tried to force me to  answer math equations to stock and they ended up getting it wrong themselves because the equation they set up  was incorrect from the get go. 

We were forced to go to their once a year meeting. The problem was that it took place at night and people and had to come in early the next morning (4:00 am/etc). They had us work first before the meeting which was a problem for others because they wore clothes that was not fit for work. I wore my regular work attire but others didn't and had to get their good outfits dirty and had to work with out steel toe boots. They should have told people that they would be working. During the meeting they said it is to celebrate our hard work but majority of the meeting was just a lecture on how we don't work hard enough.

Never enough supplies, you will have to move pallets by hand sometimes because there are never enough pallet jacks or flatbeds.

This place is a nightmare, I have never been disrespected so much at one place. The members talk down to you and so do employees that are higher in the hierarchy.

Also never help the cashiers, these people have the nastiest attitudes out of everyone. They are always unhappy and yell at you for any small mistake even though you are helping them.

For example, I was helping a manager print sign's and when I was walking back one of the front end cashiers looked at me and said ""Why the **** are these on boards."" Someone had put the boxes at the front on a pallet and she didn't know who; so she chose me to take it out on."

6055,Costco Wholesale,Bad fit for me,2018-10-12,3.0,Cashier Assistant,"The pros to working at Costco are well known. They offer excellent benefits, raises on a regular basis, and 99% of customers are happy so the emotional toll of doing retail isn't really there. Costco is an interesting company to work for because 100% of their profits come from membership subscriptions. They do treat employees well because the corporation wants them to treat their members well. One thing that I really liked about Costco was that while there are little rules here and there that seem odd, there is always a method to their madness. You also get in really good shape while working here! The other employees at my job were great including the supervisors and most of the managers.","I quit after a month due to a disagreement with management. It is VERY taxing on the body to work here and after a week the managers had ""the talk"" with me that I needed to hurry up or quit, after I had clocked out for the day. Which is illegal since they were forcing me to talk about work after my shift had ended without paying me. Of course, they didn't say that I needed to quit, that's also illegal, but they can imply what they want. One of the rules of Costco is that if you take care of Costco, Costco will take care of you. They treat their employees well, but some don't make the cut due to the physical demands which one of the managers told us on our first day. No ""welcome to Costco"", it was more of a ""Costco isn't for everyone"" while we were still learning about our new jobs.

 I was scolded for not walking fast enough while looking for carts outside. I found this to be hypocritical when the majority of the orientation was all about being part of the Costco family. Anyway, I quit because the managers told me I was doing a bad job when I was trying my absolute hardest, going home in pain and sore every night, and really trying to make the job work.

It was also frustrating that the managers were constantly looking for employees doing something wrong. If you're looking for something going wrong, then you're going to find it and build a bad impression of your employees. I heard several times ""If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean"". The problem is that the managers don't see the members coming towards my station when I'm waiting for them. If I don't think I can start or finish a cleaning project in the time it takes for a member to reach the cashier station then I'm not going to start one.

Finally, most of the employees there don't want to train new people. I would ask for help and get blown off."

6166,Costco Wholesale,Lame company to work at,2018-08-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I met some nice people that I hope I can keep a good friendship.,"- There are no trainings: you deal with it. One day watching the crowd is enough for them. And one of the supervisors even said, after we complained about this situation: ""Yeah...CostCo doesn't do trainings..."" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The worst is that, after having so many mistakes with memberships at the auditing - because of lack of training -, they threatened the staff stating that, if more mistakes were made from that on, there would be disciplinary actions.

- Management /supervising not well prepared: Once, a bunch of new hires were at the counter and nobody knew how to deal with Groupon memberships. There were NO supervisors available to give support. We had to wait for 15 minutes and customers were lining up and getting frustrated. During my first day at the counter, which I had NEVER been before, I was asked to use a new system. I told the manager I never used that before and, shocked, asked me: ""WHAT?"" and then I felt guilty of saying anything.

- They don't warn you that you can change departments anytime: they make you sign a paper and they call out what position you are assigned, and that's it. Because the warehouse was new, they overhired, just to give support during the opening. Then, based on poor reviews, they started laying off people or changing departments.

- Poor evaluation feedback: instead of talking on what you are good at and give advice about what to improve, they just make you sign a piece of paper with ridiculous feedback. They don't even give you time enough to take all in, make you read fast and just sign it. 

- The manager lacks communication skills: constantly saying that you are doing a great job, but in reality is planning to change you to a department that is with no employees."

I also met some of the coolest people at Costco and shared some fun times with these guys.","Before I write my cons, I just want to say that every employees time here are different, there's no equality and it really depends on which store you work for as well the managers you work under.

I disliked the favoritsm that managers have towards certain employers and when ever I wanted to get cross trained or an opportunity to move out of my position, it felt like I was moved to the side for a newer or favored worker as it took 5 years just to move from morning stocker to night stocker which does not fare well with me as does the many false promises I've encountered. And lastly when I tried transferring to other stores for opportunities, for the most part I was treated like I was worthless despite being there for 12 years at the time."

- If you have another job while working here...Costco will help you see all the things about it you took for granted and failed to appreciate.
- Managers are militant about you taking your breaks and lunch (for legal reasons)
- Almost all of your coworkers are hard workers!
- The customers are great!.
- The company is profitable because employees work at warp speed.","- Management doesn’t acknowledge you or your hard work
- The company motto is “always in a hurry, never rush.” Trust me, you are rushing ALL the time!
- You will never work so hard for so little pay anywhere else.
- The daily job assignments for seasonal workers appears to be stereotypically gender-based.
- The gals are sent to fold clothes for hours,
or to straighten socks/underwear/shoes/towels, while guys get to box groceries, do go-backs, collect carts, and help customers.
- If you come down with the flu and a fever due to having such close contact with the public during the flu season, they expect you to come to work anyway.  Management brags about how they did this when they were sick. 
- If your flu lasts more than 2 days, you are required to go to the doctor for a note, if you expect to keep your job when you return.  If you live alone, this means you drive yourself to the doctor while sick with flu and fever to get the doctor’s note.
You pay your medical facility a $40 copay for the doctor’s note which then takes you four hours of work to recoup. What  is also baffling is that they expect you to work sick, all the while you deal with the members. This is all unwritten, of course. So much for treating employees and memebers with respect and integrity."

Guaranteed 25 hours per week for part- timers. free costco membership.,"Costco is a super busy pharmacy. Members act very entitled and do not understand or respect you, wait times or coverage issues even if it is explained. 
There is probably politics in every workplace. Costco operates based on seniority so there are a lot of opportunities for employees who have been there longer. You can be the laziest worker doing the least amount of work possible and still be paid top rate without any consequences. Good workers are not acknowledged. Sometimes have to work 7-9 days straight because everybody is rotated to have weekend shifts. No set day-offs. Part-timers are still scheduled 5 days a week even if it is just for 5-hour shifts at different times of the day so having a 2nd job is hard to juggle if you have or plan on getting one."

The Costco environment selects for risk-averse, mediocre employees. This is because the company brags about not firing anyone and there is very little accountability. Loyalty and tenure is valued above all considerations. You could be an expert in your field and you will often be passed over for others that have no real tech qualifications but have been with the company for decades and have demonstrated the requisite fealty to the ""Costco Culture"".

I'm not saying that there aren't people who enjoy working in Costco IS. There are. However, the people that thrive there are people who would not be able to surivive in other tech environments. They are very grateful to have a desk job with decent pay and low expectations. The department is thick with these type of people and they exhibit the worst cult-like group think behaviors. Innovative types are quickly informed that their best ideas are not ""the Costco way"" and will be ignored.

6339,Costco Wholesale,Definitely better than other retail jobs - but it's still retail,2018-06-11,4.0,Night Merchandiser,"Better hourly pay than most other retail jobs. Starts at $14/ hour for every new hire. Scheduled pay increases based on total number of hours worked guarantees no one gets overlooked for raises. If you get promoted into a full time position, you are guaranteed to make $25 / hour within 4 or 5 years. If you stay part time, it will take longer, but you are still guaranteed to  get to $25 / hour  eventually - even if you never get promoted.

Good benefits. And part time employees get the same benefits package as full time employees. 8 Paid holidays a year for every employee. Lots of paid time off, especially after working there for 3 years.

Working Sunday is always time-and-a-half.

Opportunities for advancement is decent, and mostly based on seniority.

Very difficult to get fired from Costco. Their disciplinary policies are clear and you will always know exactly where you stand. No surprises.","Unfortunately, with the scheduled raises and liberal disciplinary policies (difficult to fire people), you end up with a lot of lazy, just-do-the-minimum-to-keep-my-job, type of employees who don't get fired because they don't break any rules and who, even though they never get promoted, stick around because they are getting paid well due to their scheduled raises. This means you have some freeloaders who are nothing but a burden to their team, causing the hard workers to work even harder.

Advancement into supervisory and manager positions requires butt kissing and there is sometimes allegations of favoritism. This really depends on what quality of warehouse manager you have at your particular store.

Promotions below supervisor positions are based more on seniority than performance, so the best person for the job does not always get the job.

They have a pretty low standard for who they promote into supervisor and manager positions, in my opinion. A lot of the managers are not good communicators and overall not very intelligent, so they can be frustrating to work for. Some of the managers are great though. 

Unless you've worked there 5 or more years, you will almost always be working every Saturday and Sunday. Also, from Thanksgiving to Christmas eve is a ""blacked-out"" period for time off requests. So no time off during this month will be scheduled. The holiday season is very chaotic and stressful. And every Saturday and Sunday are chaotic and stressful."

Work/Life balance is good for most employees in corporate,"IT compensation is the worst in Seattle area. There are no incentives for individual contributors, other than a safe place to stay and retire with minimal effort. Costco doesn't believe in rewarding IC's at corporate, so the only way to share in monetary incentive programs is to be in management. Looooong vesting on stock; get promoted in November and you won't get a raise, but wait, next October 22nd you'll get your stock grants associated with your new position. Now, wait another year before you vest your first 20% and 20% per year after that. So, once you've been doing the job for 6 years and 11 months, you are now realizing the full compensation for the role. (Provided they didn't make you do the job for 2-3 years before the actual promotion, which is also very common). People are not held accountable in IT. They make it near impossible to get rid of anyone. Combine the inability to get rid of poor performers with the lowest IT wages in Seattle and you wind up with arguably, the worst IT department on the West Coast."

Great Return policy 
Flexible work schedule","at my warehouse we had a severe problem with incompetence within our management. The supervisors are usually the ones doing all the work,but we had a constant swap out of management. What I came to find out is,these managers made egregious mistakes that are fireable offenses. I.e. FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS, railroading veteran workers into quitting,making an illegal system for sick hours,and completely disobeying osha protocol. 
On top of that,their pay structure has changed. It will take years for you to make a livable wage unless you sell your soul to management and get into a supervisor position. Again,this is an experience I had and found that my warehouse was unique. But I personally,along with others,was written up unwarranted after a situation I wasn’t even involved in. That manager was caught for a THIRD time falsifying documents and instead of terminating an employee who has blatantly displayed a lack of regard for laws and rules...they just transferred her to another store. Which they do. Which perpetuates the culture."

They used to try to send people home early when they could because of budget issues. 
Other days, they asked if people could stay longer if they needed help.
You are expected to work all jobs, not just the job you apply for.
 For example, I applied as a cashier/ cashier assistant, but half of the time I would be pushing carts, fixing the clothing, restocking returns, or standing at the door. People from the gas station would work inside sometimes, people from the bakery/ deli would be at the registers sometimes. You are expected to do all jobs depending on what has to be done.
They also tend to favor older employees over newer ones, so as a new employee you can expect to be bounced around the store a lot more."

Costco is slow to change, Costco is losing talent to competitors who are paying more, Costco continues to reward seniority more than talent, promotion/growth is almost impossible to come by, continue to contract out because they refuse to pay anyone more than a warehouse manager...

No one leaves, so there is no turn-over, no positions open, and if positions do open, the company re-allocates those roles to others.. no/little promotion opportunity.   Since the recession in 2008, the company maxes the annual raises at 3%, which isn't keeping up with the cost of living.. it used to be 5%, especially in the Seattle area where Property Taxes and food, gas keeps rising..  exponentially, where Costco is  headquartered... so it doesn't feel like a ""raise"".

6559,Costco Wholesale,Part time worker,2018-03-05,2.0,,"Standards for the store + organization, benefits for part time staff at 50%, you get a membership for free","- When you start, you will always start off at Part-time, Part-time at Costco is minimum 25 hours
- If you are an adult and live on your own, 25 hours a week will not cut it with your bills. If you want extra hours, you have to kiss managements bum for them to allow you to have hours in their department. You constantly feel like you are chasing someone to get hours and its ridiculous, people shouldn't have to do this or worry about making ends meet.
- It will take you approx 7-9 years to get Full time hours (40) if you stay at your current store, or take a job in the store no one wants
- The quickest way to get a Full Time job is to move away from your area when a new store opens 
- Everything in Costco is based on seniority, which to me is a huge negative, even if you are the hardest worker and go above and beyond in your duties, you will not be promoted
- Your breaks are split into two half hour shifts, which to me is a negative, you will have to scarf down your meal within the allotted time frame and punch into the clock exactly on time (you always feel like you are rushing)
- Upper management is terrible. These people are always angry, always too busy to talk to you like a human being and they think so highly of themselves. When I was working there, I told myself that I would never become management. 
- The hours at Costco are a complete joke, you will never and I mean never be able to have weekends, not a single one.  It is not a thing with Costco. I worked with people that have been there for 17 years and they still had to work weekends and random shift starts.  
- You always hear good things about Costco but never the bad and I really wonder why, so here it is. 

All in all, this wasn't the place for me. I like to do my job and do it well. I like companies that base their promotions off of hard work and dedication instead of time spent in the job. I also enjoy having set hours and knowing what my pay cheques will be every week. I left this place to become a retail manager."

6598,Costco Wholesale,Costco is awesome to shop at and work for.,2018-02-20,4.0,Tire Technician,"I tell everybody that if you do not have a Degree or know a trade, or if you are going to school and need a part time job, you need to work at Costco. To anyone reading this considering working for Costco, know that you could be a part time cart pusher making $25/hr getting bonuses twice a year, with excellent insurance and a 401k. Getting sick/vaca, and all the benefits you can think off. Just for being a good retail employee.

The best way to get in at Costco is you have to know someone already working there who can vouch for you. OR, do what I did and ask for the hiring manager and make sure they know your name and face. That way when they are hiring, and they see your name, they can schedule an interview. Costco main hiring season is March/April. They also hire extra seasonal temporary employees in October. But just know that they can just let you go in January when seasonal position is done. It is a temp job. BUT when March comes around, you can ask for the hiring manager and let him know you worked there seasonal and loved it and want a permanent position. It is best to create a relationship with either the dept manager or hiring manager while working seasonal so they remember you when permanent positions open up.

You start off making $13, IF you can get in. You get benefits (incl. sick/vaca) after your 9 month probation. The thing about Costco, if you are reliable and a good worker, meaning you aren't calling in, hardly late, and give excellent customer service, you will make it past your probation. Its that easy. So as long as you make it past your probation period, you will make it at Costco. Costco does not keep bad employees. They have a strict tardy/sick call policy. They have a strict attitude policy. You cannot go to work with a bad attitude and show it. Hint, that's why every time you go to Costco, everyone seems like they love their job. its easy and Costco takes care of them.

You get raises based on the amount of hours you work, not by your work ethics like most companies. Like I said earlier, if you are employed at Costco, there is no reason you aren't a good worker or have good work ethics. So raises are based on amount of hours you work. they reward based on how much time  you put in. Typically its 50 cents for the first 3 or raises then its $1 after that. Top out pay is near $25. That's how you can be a cashier assistant making great money. It's just based on the amount of time you work. You start out part time, min 24 hours a week. But you can always pick up shifts, ask other dept. to be crossed trained to further your knowledge at Costco making you able to pick up more hours easily. Plus, it lets managements know you are serious about being employed at Costco. Once a full time position opens up, you can apply for it. But know, there are other part timers who are putting in for that spot too who been there longer than you. But if you have no tardys/sick calls, and great relationship with managements/supervisor, and the others have lots of tardys/sick calls, you can easily be picked. The same goes to applying for supervisor positions. I've seen 2 year employees go from pushing carts, to becoming a supervisor and go from $14/hr (24hr/wk) to $26/hr (40wk) because they took care of business.

Once you put in enough hours, you start to earn bonuses twice a year (after each inventory). and bonuses are based on, again, the amount of time you work. And its for full timers AND part timers. 

Another thing that is true about Costco - Sunday Pay. Its time and a half. So if you are making $25 mon-sat, you are making $37.50 on Sunday.

You do not get employee discounts. You do get a executive membership ($120 yearly value) and 3 basic members to give out to family/friends ($180 yearly value) The good thing about getting the executive membership free, is that anything you buy (other than gas, pharmacy, and tobacco) you get %2 back yearly. So if you shop there, every year, Costco gives a check of what you earned and you can use it there, or cash it out.

SO the pay is great. And like I said before, if you are working there, you are good employee. Which translate to, the people working at Costco are great to work with. You make friends, sometimes long lasting friends. I've seen employees meet their wives there. It is a family oriented retail store. They have EAP (employee Assistant Program) if you ever need it. Costco does care about their employees. Costco have Christmas parties and give away things. You get all major holidays off.  Costco is an excellent place to work at. 

Costco does not mind hiring students. If you are in school, they work around your school schedule. You have to turn in your school schedule and let them know when you can work. They will never make you pick Costco over School. A lot of Costco employees who went to school and graduate sometimes just stay at Costco. I know an employee who finished their teaching degree, but ended up staying at Costco because of pay and everything else great about Costco. That how great working at Costco is.
But they will never be a secondary employer. Meaning, if you work for Costco, and have another job, they will not work around another job you may have.","I have not read any of the other reviews here, but I will I be honest as I can about any 'cons' working at Costco:

Nights and weekends. you give that up. At least until you make it to the top of the totem pole in your dept.. That can be hard if you are in a big dept like 'front end' or in a dept. where employees have been there for a long time. You can ask to have more opening shifts and maybe a weekend off. But be careful asking for Sunday off (Sunday pay is time and a half). If you are trying to have a family, it is rough working nights and weekends. That is why I went to a different career path. Wife worked 8:30 - 5 m-f. and I wanted to as well. But I know Costco employees who make it work.

Favoritism/Friends - I don't see that much. But I know it exists. Costco recognizes that. Their warehouse managers and warehouse manager assistance are rotated with other warehouses to prevent that. However, lower level management usually aren't. I can see how they can create a relationship with their employees. It's honestly just human nature. But it is also unintentional in my opinion. It is your responsibility to recognize that and report it if you feel like you aren't being treated fairly. Costco has an open door policy. 

Tardy's- That is the only thing that bothered me. If you are late more than 3 times in a 30 day period, you will get written up. This has bit me in the butt a couple of times being that I didn't get out of class in time for whatever reason. Its easy to loose track how many tardy's you have sometimes, but it is your responsibility.

The upside to that is, write ups fall off your record after 9 months. 
Their policy is, if you get written up 3 times within 9 months for the same thing, you will get suspended. if you get written up 4 times within 9 months for different things, you will get suspended. They make it hard to get suspended. You have to be a joke to loose your job at Costco. If you notice you are not able to make your shift on times, it is your responsibility to let you supervisor/manager know to work with you on your shift so you are not late. 

No call/no show - this is also something that bothered me, but understood why it is like that. According to the handbook, you have to call in no later than an hour before your shift or it is considered a no call/no show. Which means, if you call in 30 mins before your shift, its a no call/ no show. And a no call / no show is an automatic write up. Again, it falls off in 9 months. no biggie. its just, even if you called, if it is within the hour, its a no call no show.

Black out days for vacation - This was also annoying working there. But not a deal breaker. Costco busiest time of the year is November and December. You cannot request vacation during November or December. So if you have a family tradition, know you may not be able to attend unless you work something out with the warehouse managers. Sometimes they might work with you, but most of the time, they might tell you 'if I let you have vaca then I'd have to let everyone have vaca'. 

Inventory - Costco does their own internal inventory twice a year, and the week inventory falls on, you will not be able have that week off. For instance, lets say inventory for your building is the second week of February, more than likely, you won't be able to take that week off. And you for sure will work inventory day. Whether you are running the business, counting that night. So if you anniversary or birthday is on inventory day, the best you can do is just ask to run the business so you can celebrate that night instead of counting inventory after the store closes. If you are counting inventory, your shift will most likely be 6pm-2am. However, inventory is not miserable. It can be fun, especially if you like counting. They do feed their employees who are counting with good food. Also, know if you are eligible for bonuses, you get your bonus on your check shortly after inventory. Which is a good way to keep tract when inventory is, or when you get your bonuses.

My cons are not really cons. Like I said, I haven't read any of the other reviews. I am sure most of the bad ones are from losers who couldn't hold a retail job and wanted to come here to talk down about Costco. Like I said before, It is hard to get in, but it is hard to get fired. You have to be a loser to get terminated form Costco.
I know I wasn't going to make Costco a career because I was in college. So I wasn't striving to be a manager, even though I did become a part time supervisor in the end. I loved working at Costco. I always knew, had I needed to, I could have made Costco my Career and been happy. I just didn't want to give up my nights and weekends with my wife.

 Costco is a retail store, but it is not just a job. You can make it a career and become a manager in a dept. making about $60k a year. Or a supervisor making about $40k-$50k a year. you might have to just give up your nights and weekends for it."

-Decent Healthcare by industry standards. 
-Almost impossible to get fired (job security).
-Not in Seattle.
-Free Gym on site.
-Deli is OK.","-Pay is dismal. For the surrounding area of the home office you cannot afford to live anywhere. Taco Time and Brown Bear Car Wash actually offer higher starting pay right now the street then they do at the Corporate Headquarters and offer benefits as well. 
-Management is horrible. Due to compensation being so dismal they will 99.9% of the time lose any talented or qualified employees who would be competent managers leaving only those who have a masters in brown nosing or the nonstop flow of nepotism from upper management and executives. 
-Basically zero employee appreciation which has gone more and more downhill since Jim has left the company. 
-Retaliation is rampant. 
-Many improper relationships between management and employees working under said management leading to very questionable promotions. 
-HR is a joke and if sought for assistance will only aid in getting yourself blacklisted for promotion or any advancement. 
-Zero incentive for employees leading to long term employees becoming extremely complacent and doing very little work compared to peers while being paid at times much much more than harder working counterparts. 
-TOP DOWN Lack of care for employees. It was quoted from the latest shareholders meeting when asked about low pay and cost of living for the area that Craig just stated we make enough. Easy to say when your taking in $650k a year. 
-Education is worthless in this company. Your degree means nothing and will not get you anything here. Anybody with any higher education beware high school dropouts will be your equal. 
-Employee holiday party will cost you $150 and they do not accommodate enough tickets for all corporate employees. Only the few special ones who are not living paycheck to paycheck and can afford it are able to go.
-Zero upward movement. Basically have to wait for somebody to have a heart attack to retire for any movement to happen."

One person who'd been there over a year told me they were looking for another job because they'd ""hung in there"" for a year, and only had FOUR weekends off in over a year AND-sometimes they had less than 20 hours a week on the schedule (even though they were hired ""full time"")"

6767,Costco Wholesale,Costco Travel Reservation Agent,2017-12-21,1.0,Reservations Agent,Nice building. Great Cafeteria.,"There is a valid reason why the turnover rate is so high at Costco Travel. 

Costco Travel’s rigid adherence to their rules, despite the employee’s best efforts, is inhuman. For example, if you are late by one minute, you’re written up--and it only takes a few write ups to be let go, out the door, bye bye. It doesn’t matter that the main artery traveled that morning was icy during one of those rare unfortunate commutes, nor does it matter that there was a 9 car pileup and you could only travel ten miles an hour to get to work. And it certainly doesn’t matter that you have an exemplary history of being on time and you adhered to their strict protocol. I was told, “If there were two hundred other people late that morning, then you would be excused.” Translation: You, the employee, have no value. You are not to be believed, or trusted. Risking your life is expected. Acts of God are not excusable, ever.

Their inflexible and dogged observance to The Rules makes it impossible for them to see the trees through the forest. They are short sighted as far as their employees are concerned---you are replaceable. They’d rather keep the training classes full  every month rather than spend any effort to keep the employees they already have. 

And don’t believe their song and dance about chances for advancement. Trust me, they want to keep you right where you are: Peons in the company. The slaves rowing at the bottom of the ship keep the boat sailing smoothly.

Job opportunities everywhere and easy to promote.","Very low pay compared to other companies around, especially in the Seattle area. Very slow to change and adapt new technologies. Management continues to obtain all kinds of different tools that do the same thing, and push upon the employees the worst of them, even though there are already functional tools that people already use, management believes there is only one way to go, even if everyone else does not agree. 

When challenged, upper management said: ""In my experience, I know that it is going to happen anyway, so I learned to just go with the flow and accept that I cannot do anything, so I suggest you do the same"""

6785,Costco Wholesale,AVOID SEASONAL positions.,2017-12-09,1.0,Front End Assistant,I was given a turkey- after- they realized they had enough for seasonal personnel.,"Very disappointed- You are not respected if you get an injury while at work. I was doing great the 1st week on front, everyone said - great work and I was fast- until…  I had an old injury that was irritated due to weight repetitive stress, I tried to work with it.  I finally had to tell management - I was put on go backs (you push a cart all over the store putting back what customers decide they don't want at the checkout). The 1st 3 days was OK, by the 3rd day I was being reprimanded for not ""checking in"" with ""management"" every 15 minutes. 1st I was never told this, 2nd only  1 ""supervisor"" who came on 1/2 way in my shift got mad at me for not driving by with my go back cart -to ""check in"" with her. So she would know where I was and if I was really working. This is a little insane- as I was already in trouble for something I was not ever told the 3 days I did this and was told I was doing great prior to this. ALSO Costco is crazy on any Friday - Sunday.   This is holiday season- store is packed with shoppers, my cart was packed so high with cloths and food more so than it would be on a non-seasonal weekend. It would take 15 minutes to put back one or two items and try to fight my way back to the front - and this would cause you to fail you would be told you are taking too long. I was told that carts take 20 minutes to empty. ALSO I was told by one of the store managers to grab things from the areas I am putting back and put them back as well.  I would love to see them do it in 15- 20 minutes during the holiday.  To get one cart done like this, you would have to be superman or mow some shoppers down getting from the back of the store to the front. Setting up to fail is not my idea of “Respecting an Employee""- Neither is treating someone who wanted to do a good job – gets hurt- they refuse to put you on any other job they move others to who are not struggling with an injury. I was put out no work available. They told me they won’t move me.  Even with a doctor’s notice, they feel you are faking it. I was even told that by my front end supervisor when my doctor faxed over my restrictions. To make matters worse- I was told they needed to have my 30 day review they day they told me they could not work with my restrictions-Repetitive stress. I was given a So-so performance review and they told they could not evaluate in my 2 weeks I worked before my injury, if I would be hired permanent, as they have not had time to evaluate me. But they did a good job of humiliating me with a so-so review? As an executive  club member, I see this company in a whole new light. This one store is proud they are not Union- and believe me you will be treated unfairly if you are not a perfect human specimen and have an issue."

-Good benefits for part time employees. Cool small side benefits too, like free turkeys on thanksgiving and a free executive membership.

-Managers are generally friendly, professional and very willing to work with you.

-Constantly busy so time flies by.

-Everyone works hard and pulls their weight for the most part. Most lazy people and whiners get weeded out in the 90 day probationary period so you generally work with competent, motivated people.

-TIME AND A HALF ON SUNDAYS!

-Lax dress code for most departments.

-Always get your breaks on time. Two paid 15 minute breaks in an 8 hour shift is a blessing. Break room is pretty nice. Free food occasionally as well.

-Paid vacation and sick days after a while. 

-Good opportunities to advance, but only if you're willing to move due to having such low turnover.

-Crazy low turnover. Says a lot about the company as most large retailers, wholesale or otherwise, suffer from horrible turnover. Can make it hard to advance however.","-The ""training program"" is horrible. They give you a two second intro and then throw you to the wolves which is very stressful for new hires. If you have two brain cells to rub together you will get the hang of it eventually, but it is embarrassing to both the new hire and the company when they aren't shown basic things and mess them up. Even after being there almost 6 months I still haven't learned everything in my department, simply because they don't teach you. Causes a whole host of problems and is hands down my biggest complaint about the company. They wait for you to make a mistake instead of helping you prevent them in the first place. There are rules I wasn't even informed of until I broke them.

-Very outdated equipment and computer systems. The company computer system runs on DOS basically and is a nightmare to navigate and not user friendly at all. Even cash registers look like something from the 80's. Food court couldn't even accept cards until very recently.

-They will work you to the bone, young, old, male, female, Costco will squeeze every drop of productivity out of you and you will leave even short shifts totally drained. Not really a negative,work is mean't to be work after all, but it certainly isn't great either.

-Part time employees are forced to work 5 days a week for no reason. Leads to a lot of pointless and annoying 4 hour shifts. It would be a lot more efficient if part time employees could work 8 hour shifts 3-4 days a week instead of 4, 4 1/2, 6 and 8 hour shifts. It needlessly complicates things and is hard on work life balance.

-Very strict about clocking in and out. Will get written up if you go over 8 hours or over 5 hours on a 4 hour shift. Can't be late or you risk a write up. 

-Not a very fun place to work. Somewhat serious culture, not much time for socializing or getting to know your fellow employees. Not a huge negative, but it isn't a positive. There are some cool people and you can occasionally crack a joke or two, but for the most part everyone takes thing very seriously and focuses on work. Again, not horrible, but it can make work a little soulless and boring."

Always moving so time goes fast","My location plays favorites, so they will hire and promote somebody over someone else with a better interview/resume/work ethic,
Takes way too long to move up in company unless you know someone or kiss their butt,
Pay increases drastically too slow. I worked for one year and my pay per hour went from $13.00 to $13.25,
College degrees do not matter here,
NOT student-extra curricular friendly. Will not work with school and sports schedule. Must choose between work or activity,
only sent males to cart duty even though front end assistant job description says cart duty, 
always had females sweep front end and block down domestics (equality?),
would be on cart duty for 6+ hours a day and come inside and always sent to freezer-cooler while still sweaty and wet,
front end assistants that were older in age NEVER did cart duty, even though it is in description and none had a medical note (believe me I asked),
the hours you work are based on seniority and if you needed to work early one day a week they would not let you,
when blocking down after close, someone would miss one thing and a supervisor would take a picture and show the employee what is wrong and have them go all the way back to fix ONE thing instead of just doing it themselves and telling the employee they missed something,
everyone in the warehouse, even managers, would tell us that, especially during the summer, an individual could not be on carts for more than one hour at a time, and consistently supervisors would leave employees, like myself, out there for more than 3 hours at times without being called inside or given a break, on multiple occasions I would start my shift at 2:30 and not be called inside until my lunch at 7:30 without a break. I had an arm injury and a back injury at different times during my employment with a doctors note that said no heavy lifting and supervisors and management could care less, and if you ever, ever, got sick while at work, they would never believe you and when you'd ask to go home they would say to stay for a little longer and you'd end up working the entire shift."

6994,Costco Wholesale,"Awesome place to work, especially if you're a college student",2017-10-05,5.0,Bakery Clerk,"The pay and benefits are the best part about working at costco. They really take care of you. You start at $13/hr and just go up from there.

The 401k is awesome. I've contributed 15% of my pay for ~2 years and I just hit five figures as young 20 something. If it wasn't for costco I wouldn't have utilized a retirement account anytime soon.

I also think their company culture is very relaxed.  A lot of people break dress code and no one cares. But really you can just wear a nice pair of khaki shorts and a polo and you're good. 

Very rarely does any one get mad, upset etc. I hardly ever feel stressed or rushed at work. My job in the Bakery is the easiest job in the world. Sometimes you need to be on point and work hard, but there are definitely slow days where you're on cruise control (and just for reference I work in a high volume store). 

It's not hard to move up in the company. Many, many people have gone from a worker bee to supervisor in under 2 years and that puts you at the top of the payscale (~$25/hr).

The longer you're with the company the more preference you get when it comes to scheduling, moving to different positions etc. This makes it very fair in my opinion. Why should someone who just started working the other week work 7-3:30? No the guy who has been here for 5 years gets that shift.

Costco has employee cookouts, free food sometimes, wellness programs, a physical therapist who comes in and helps with any pain you may have. They really care about you as an employee.

You can take winter leave every year which grants 4 weeks off anytime during Jan-March. This can definitely be helpful if you ever need a break for work, or want an extended vacation.

If you are a go getter, work hard, do what you're supposed to etc you can go as far as you want. The people who are miserable working at Costco are not miserable because of Costco.

You can certainly live a great life making a career at costco.","I think the biggest thing problem is with the coworkers. Costco protects their employees well, and in my opinion almost too well. It is almost impossible to get fired unless you do something really, really stupid.

This allows people to get away with things they shouldn't get away with.  

There is also potential for micromanagement. A supervisor or manager will make or break your job. I've had supervisors who simply want to display their power and make your life harder for no other reason than that they can. Some managers are great with scheduling, time off, man management and so forth, some aren't.

A lot of my coworkers are pretty rude. I'm surprised that with the attitude and entitlement of ~1/2 of the workers at my store are employed, let alone employed at costco. There are some really nice people that make up for it though.

To sum it up Costco as a company is great, your experience 100% depends on the people who you work with."

7011,Costco Wholesale,very discouraging place to work,2017-09-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Good benefits and pay is better than most retail.,"i have been working at Costco for over 5 years and have never encountered a more corrupt company. Every manager goes by their own rules, even director make up rules and claim that its specific to their warehouse only, like removing limited part time positions or forcing students to work 5 days where its not an official written rule. They don't take complaints seriously as employees who have harassed someone end up getting promotions. When you're a student or have a family forget it, there is no work life balance and they're not accommodating. They force part timers to work a min of 32 hours and 5 days when they go to school full time, and if you're not happy they tell you to go to the limited part time where you have no hours guaranteed, which is difficult for someone trying to pay their education and expenses. Although your a student or have a 2 year old, they will give you shifts til 11:30 pm a couple times a week and tell you too bad. Managers can be very condescending, have no communicate skills, and most can't even spell properly. You will get a position over someone else based on seniority rather than qualifications. For example, although you have excellent selling skills, they will give the position to someone whose been there for 10 years and only wants the position because the hours benefits them. Promotions are based on favouritism rather than choosing  a hard working motivated employee. Managers need to be better educated and learn to respect employees; for instance i had a manager walk away for me while i was talking to him or texting and not take me seriously. if you want a job that makes you happy, and gives you a good work life balance, i suggest working elsewhere."

Union stores especially are full of dead-weight that are impossible to fire.

But when I worked there I was still stuck closing for a year and a half straight and it was always a fight with my school schedule and such a headache and I'd get my time off constantly denied when other people that have worked less than I have would get theirs approved. 
They told me I could get out of food court when I got another position inside the store and ended up still being in food court for months.
I've met wonderful people through costco (my coworkers were honestly the best) but I cannot stand how messy and unoraganized that company is on a whole.
On a regular day we'd have minimum 3 sick calls and on top of that already be short staffed 5 people or so since it takes them like 7 months to replace people that quit. Unless you have really bad medical conditions and need the benefits, I'd look for somewhere else. I never felt like what I got paid was enough for the 3+ people that call out on a regular basis. It got to the point where I only showed up to work solely cause I liked my coworkers and that's not a way to live life."

- Excellent benefits, even for part-timers.
- Free Executive Membership for employees.
- Upward mobility; Costco promotes from within. Many supervisors and managers were once lowly clerks themshelves.","While Costco as a *company* is great, certain individual locations may not be so much. At my Costco warehouse every department is understaffed. Departments are constantly borrowing employees back and forth, even when doing so impedes productivity (i.e., not knowing how depleted the freezer aisles were because you were up front all day helping members load their shopping carts at the register). I myself have been made to do the workload of two employees on a semi-regular basis, and am still expected to get out on time. Driving a forklift, especially inside the freezers, is not something you want to rush. These machines weigh 9,000 lbs and the floor *will* get slippery. While all this corner cutting was going on, there was a mandatory company seminar explaining how well the company is doing.

Another minor con is that seniority is prioritized. This has resulted in a backlog of part-timers who can't become full-time employees because as soon as a position opens up another coworker there a day longer than they were grabs it up. I know some employees that have been waiting literal *years* to finally go full time."

7118,Costco Wholesale,Every time I go into COSTCO I get all the things I need in one sitting.,2017-08-24,5.0,Pharmacy Technician,Awesome benefits to working with COSTCO. They make sure that they are helping the employee and the customers at the same time.,There are short hours in the shift. I expected longer hours for my shift but the standard 4 to 6 hours for a shift starts to grow on you
7119,Costco Wholesale,Great company to work for if you have no college education and have a family to feed,2017-08-23,4.0,Certified Pharmacy Technician,"Wonderful company to work for. As long as you come in on time, do your job, and are friendly with customers. At times management will annoy you, and you will feel tired from it all. However its good to reflect that you are making a decent hourly wage when you reach your cap ($21 i believe) and are able to support a family on this income. If you do not have a degree then working at Costco full time is pretty decent employment.

Friendly employees who work together, Costco benefits ($3 and $9 prescriptions; cant beat that!), hearing aid, optical benefits, 401k, discount on your monthly phone payments, scholarships for students, health related programs for employees, Free costco executive membership, Free turkey for all employees on Thanksgiving holiday, company picnics, opportunities to climb higher and become supervisors, managers, etc. Costco takes good care of its employees and frowns upon working OT and working off the clock, makes sure you take two 15 min breaks and one 30 min break during an 8 hr shift. Will gladly train you if you want to switch departments ex: bakery, front end, cashiering, Returns, Membership, Stocking, Janitorial. Paid vacation time. The amount of personal days off you receive depends on how many hours you put in. Thus if you use up all your personal days, better start working to earn more! Great place to work for.","Supervisors/Management can be up your butt for really trivial things. You may come across one that frequently has a sour face and acts like they dont want to be there, which I understand! But as supervisors and managers they should not have such an attitude with their employees.

Customer. Service. Is. IMPORTANT.

Costco greatly values its members, thus if you get hired be prepared to kiss their feet and treat them like royalty. Its very important to make the members feel welcomed and helped at all times.

Management forbids employees from trying out samples from venders, even if you are clocked out for break. The venders (usually) do not care and will offer you samples anyway--but be discreet!

7127,Costco Wholesale,Cashier,2017-08-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The relationship among managers and employees was always good and it was a great work environment that was very rewarding.,Long hours outside in 95+ degree heat.
7128,Costco Wholesale,Pros and Cons,2017-08-21,4.0,Front End Assistant,"Great benefits - You qualify for health benefits as a part-time employee within three months. Medical and dental are both through Aetna, and it is $23 per paycheck. Generic prescriptions start at $3 for 30 day supply.

Continuous raises - In employee handbook you will know when you will get a raise, which is every 1040 hours. Every new employee starts at the bottom of the payscale, so you are not paid for how much you are liked, rather your time given. The employee handbook will tell you how much others make in each department as well as supervisor pay levels.  Employees working that have worked over 12,500 hours will receive a bonus twice a year.

Breaks - You MUST take a 30 minute unpaid lunch if you work over 5hours, which must be taken before the 5hour mark. 5 hour shift means you get 1 - 15minute paid break, over 5hrs 30 min (unpaid) + 15 min, 6hrs-9hrs - 1 30 min (unpaid) plus 2  15 minute (paid) breaks. Working over 10hrs means 2 30 min breaks, etc. Most supervisors/managers ensure you take your breaks though I try to keep up with mine before I go over the time. In addition, my warehouse gives you an additional minute to get to your break as they make sure you are not given the break time right after the clock changes. You will be told your start time (one minute ahead), and you add your break to that, so 3pm break would mean return at 3:15pm, or 3:30pm if its a lunch.

Schedule - You will know 3 weeks of schedule at a time, which is posted on paper sheets in the breakroom. Some locations are trying out an online schedule though. My schedule rotates and they do give me random Saturdays/Sundays off plus a lot of instances where I have two consecutive days off, though not always.

Most supervisors, managers, and coworkers are easy to talk to and treat you fairly. Harassment is taken seriously and they make sure that they have zero tolerance towards it.","Hours/Schedule - Part time employees can be scheduled work as low as 24 hours per week. I would love to get full-time but it is hard due to low turn over from full-time employees. Warehouses are normally staffed 50% full time, 50% part time.

Environment - I am technically front-end assistant, but 95% of the time I am outside pushing carts in all weather conditions (except storms where they do bring you inside). I don't think its fair that all females work inside and only males outside, this should be addressed company wide to make it fair.

Cleaning - Aside from pushing carts, you are also responsible for picking up garbage from the cart corrals (from the cans), as well as all the wrappers/cups/paper/left over food left behind in carts which happens 85% of the time.  Members also leave behind cardboard boxes all around the parking lot, which need to be either returned inside to be reused (kind of unsanitary if you ask me) or if in poor shape thrown out/recycled into compactor.

Loading - You will also be loading cars, trucks, Uhauls, trailers, etc with not only bulk items but heavy furniture such as china cabinets, 300lbs ceramic egg grills, work benches, steel shelving, etc. You can always ask for help from your coworkers, or ask the member service team at the doors to page for assistance, but a lot of times help is slow to arrive or doesn't arrive at all. Members expect their purchases automatically fit into their cars and occasionally do not want to help even when they are in perfect healthy condition. This requires a lot of creativity to maneuver the objects to fit just right, or tons of unboxing of items which takes a lot of time due to packaging and taking to the back to be compacted."
7129,Costco Wholesale,Costco employee,2017-08-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"pays well, great benefits, bonuses, free membership",Working nights/weekends. Would go back in a heartbeat if i could avoid nights and weekends.
7130,Costco Wholesale,Just a number,2017-08-21,1.0,Food Court Employee,24 years of service. Went part time because daycare is so expensive and I have 3 kids.  I asked to limit my hours to 25 per week but understand if I need to work more during Xmas ect. I was told that I need to work a minimum of 25 hours up to 35 hours...  So I give up preference of days off and vacation request seniority to go part time and I can't limit my hours to 25 on most occasions?? So why wouldn't I just stay full time?? I was actually told then maybe part time isn't for you and I should go limited part time. 24 years of service and I'm told I should go limited part time with no guarantee of hours whatsoever?? Really??,"Our transfer request policy needs reform. Yes Costco is under no obligation to transfer you. I get it but when they do and you transfer you have to wait 6 months to be apply for another position, ( you can apply but you can only get the position of no one applies) so a brand new hire only has a 90 day probabtion period and most companies for that fact only have a 90 day probation period. So for example I took a transfer and I applied for a part time morning stocker job, my self and one other person applied. That person 4 months with Costco and myself 24 years. Guess who got the job, not me.  I get why there is a policy in effect but 6 months is wayyyyyy to long and really there should be certain circumstances such as you can beat out a employee who has less than one year service."
7131,Costco Wholesale,Warehouse positions,2017-08-21,4.0,Service Deli Clerk,"Great benefits, love to promote from within. Most managers work well with employees to find a schedule that fits you. Picking up extra hours is easy, always posting in the break-rooms. Great job if college was not your route and want to work for a loyal company that treats employees amazing. Smaller things like bringing fresh fruits and veggies on Friday just to show they care is really neat.","If you have a degree it really isn't a great place for you to utilize your skills as majority of the positions are hourly based with no experience really needed. Really big on seniority so at times even when you work harder than does not mean you will get the days off you want, open position, etc.."

-Made me appreciate my current employer more
-Dealing with the people here makes you good at spotting BS","I worked here for a while before deciding that I needed to get out. I was far too smart and motivated to be held down by a company run by incompetent managers. The people here like to think that they play nice but be warned it’s just a cover and you will likely get talked behind your back. Especially, if you are good at your job. 

The managers, especially the female ones are either dumb or crazy, sometimes both. They tend to be washed up from other companies who didn’t want them and they carry a huge chip on their shoulder. The problem is that you can’t be fired here so you end up getting a lot of bad management. 

They also try really hard to brainwash you into believing that they are the best company to have ever existed. Their Kirkland brand might be the most affordable but it definitely isn’t the best quality. Upper management also won’t think much of your education unless you happened to have also came from the warehouse. In addition, they proudly boast that they don’t need to hire “Google level talent” which even if true, is not very motivating. 

Another perhaps small thing is that for a massive retail company, they do not give you any snacks/food for free.  Not even coffee. They have “free” coffee but it’s horrible and most people just opt to buy it instead. They also do very little social events for workers. They have a BBQ and thanksgiving dinner but it’s very lame and outdated. They have a yearly Xmas party but you have to pay something like $50 dollars to attend. They also pressure you to donate to charities by boasting about the top donators which is very tacky."

I applied to Costco, and went on two interview where they considered me for Front End, Stocker, and Gas Attendant. Right off the bat, I told them I would only do Front End. Manger told me ""No heavy lifting"" involved in that job because you leave heavy items in the cart. It wasn't until orientation that I heard about ""cart pushing"" and my co-worker was also taken aback by that. In neither of my two interviews did any manager say that you would have to go outside twice in a shift for 1+ hours each time in the heat to push in lots of carts. There was also heavy lifting involved after closing when you have to put stuff back (i.e. printers, speakers, etc.). I quit after my first day due to the strong physical labor demands and being upset at the way Costco handled its interviewing process and being upfront (seems unethical to me!)"

7242,Costco Wholesale,Not bad for retail,2017-06-29,4.0,Stocker/Supervisor,"Employees, both part and full time were offered excellent benefits.  401k, paid time off, vacation time based on the number of years you've been with the company.  Many retailers can learn a lot from this.  Pay raises came based upon the total hours you worked.  Many in the company believe in a positive work/life balance and will accommodate employees' needs.","It can be difficult to get a full-time position even if you've been working there for a long time.  Workplace politics, just like anywhere, can be killer.  I've witnessed a lot of ill-qualified employees bumped up to supervisor and management positions just from being in the right circle of friends.
I was also given the impression that even with qualifications, degrees, certifications, etc, that if you start with the company in the warehouse you're all but blacklisted from moving into a corporate role with the company."

A few bad apples get through but that happens anywhere. The work is fast-paced, fun, and keeps you in relatively good shape. Excellent place for people that hate desk jobs since if you hold out for a few years it pays as well as one. Most of the store-level management are excellent.","Seniority plays far too much of a factor in promotion and internal hiring. I've seen weaker, but more senior staff picked for promotion over more skilled staff that would do much better, which in turn can have a long-term negative effect on business. 

This doesn't apply to me, but for new folks the pay scale is much slower now compared to when I started. Benefits are still decent though.

Too much emphasis is put on the opinions of the corporate-level management who, in many cases, have never worked in the departments they are in charge of. Frequently, we get told to change procedure in a way that is counter-productive and arbitrary. Often, feedback on these procedure changes is not well received."

7274,Costco Wholesale,Costco HQ - You don't make that much,2017-06-18,3.0,Analyst,"- A LOT of opportunity to move around and explore different roles to see what you like. The company really does value promoting from within. The general rule of thumb is to work your position for around a year before you can move around.

- Salary increases are predictable, which makes budgeting very easy.

- It's hard to get fired. You would really have to screw up to lose your job.

- Hours are flexible, great work life balance.

- In the words of Jeff Bezos, it's ""a 'country club' where people go to retire"". Take that as you may.","- Company pays below market wages for jobs at corporate (usually around 15~20%). 

- A lot of people are jumping ship to other companies in the area  because wages at corporate are below market and the cost of living in the Seattle area has been rising at a very rapid rate.  People openly talk about leaving the company with each over lunch. 

On the flip side of this, you get a great work/life balance. So I believe that while the overall salary is low, you are paid fairly for the amount/level of work you do.

- No tuition reimbursement or assistance with continued education.

- Many roles are so narrow in scope that it is hard to develop transferable skills that are valued in the marketplace. Part of the reason why tenure is so high is because a lot of employees get ""stuck"". Some managers call it the ""golden handcuffs"".

- I do NOT work in IS/IT, but I have heard from multiple sources that morale is low in that area of the company."

-Executive membership and rebates 
-Open door policy and health/dental benefits for part timers 
-Cheap food in the food court","-At times it's like high school all over again. Some coworkers/sups are pretty rude. Lots of really picky and rude members. I have had to bite back my tongue many times. 

-I have seen a decent amount of favoritism and special treatment to employees that slack off. People who started at the same time or later than me somehow got promoted to other departments and received new training/opportunities, and I had YET to receive any of this even though I was  begging for it. 

-One of my coworkers referred to me as a ""rented mule"" because I did nothing but push carts until I injured myself and had nothing but physical problems afterwards. I was often left on carts for 6-8 hours a day. I had to get a workload restriction, but even with undiagnosed health issues they continued to work me as hard as they possibly could while some of my coworkers got the easy treatment. 

-Board runners need to learn their jobs better. My breaks were conveniently forgotten quite often when I was on carts. 

-The schedule changes all the time. Split days off are the norm, and it's hard to plan anything. There's no work-life balance here. It's hard to get vacation/days off when you really need it, and if it's denied, you're out of luck. It also takes a LONG time to accrue sick pay.

I honestly work very hard (I am not a slacker by any means) and I get nothing for it. I am very discouraged by the lack of fairness and the stress this job imposes on your body & mind. You have to be careful with this company, otherwise it will chew you up and spit you out."

If I failed or withdrew from a class, he told me I'd be written up.

They only hire after seasonal work, wich is good for employees and employer and even better if you manager loves you from the very first second she or he saw you, then lazy people don't need to make much effort their managers already likes them, so there's no need to work hard all the time,you just need to pretend that you work when they are around.

Two more things1.  that place is like a militar régimen, they  have endless rules and prohibition regarding everything, they even force you to bring your water in a translucent container but it has to have a straw, 2,  a lot of their costumer are very mean and demanding with the employees, because they pay a yearly membership  in other to be able to buy there so, they feel entitled to do   it.

-Health insurance and benefits are good.
-It's a good job to have while you sort yourself out and figure out your life.
-You can make a career out of Costco. 
-If you don't like your current job position, you can always change departments as postings come up.
-If you have been here for 2+ years, you are impossible to fire unless you drastically screw up.
-If you are loud, have an aggressive attitude, and can command a presence, you won't get overwhelmed by the members, and this job will treat you better.","-The ""we care about the employees"" motto is questionable. Everyone resents working here. Morale is low.
-The members treat you like dirt, in their eyes, you are nothing but low class sub-human trash of society. Push carts or do maintenance long enough and you will see.
-The warehouse is perpetually understaffed. It's hard to take pride in your job when your department is always a mess no matter how hard you work.
-If you are employed here long enough, you can get away with doing the bare minimum. 
-The managers will take advantage of you, manipulate you, and overwork you, if they can.
-Retail attracts the lowest/weakest people in society. That means a good amount of people who work here are either unintelligent, uneducated, lazy, broken, depressed, have mental disorders, have physical health problems, or some combination of all of the above."

7476,Costco Wholesale,Sales assistant,2017-03-24,1.0,Hertfordshire,Good money for a retail job,Terrible management.  Utter disdain for hourly paid staff
7477,Costco Wholesale,Good place very messy,2017-03-24,3.0,Stocker,The starting pay is very good compared to  other wholesale or retail stores.  They offer benefits for full-time and part-time employees after your 90 days.  Also they offer a continuous raises based on how many hours you work.,Management sucked they wanted you to scratch their back in order for you to get anything accomplished that you needed done.  The employees were very messy they wanted to know everyone's business and gossip all throughout the day.  The rolls at Costco are very strict no matter for time or part time you have to work five days per week no exceptions according to the Costco employee handbook.  Most people that get employed through Costco stay there because of the continuous raises so everyone knows everyone business.
7478,Costco Wholesale,Prison Camp Costco,2017-03-23,1.0,Front End,The one and only reason good to work here if you can survive working part-time for years before attaining full-time is the potential pay of $23 an hour for doing jobs you would never be able to get paid that much for anywhere else.  That and you'll get two $2500 bonuses.......... If you don't die by then depending on where you live depending on the weather.  You'll endure the elements believe me.,Oh so many.  One i think it's actually a con to say you pay more 'livable' wages than other companies.  So let's say you make $13 an hour starting BUUUUUUT your most likely only going to work 24 hours a week.  Most part-time employees only get that and that's four fifths of the workforce in the company.  That's full-time minimum wage right there because your not getting the HOURS you need to pay the bills.  Disgusting.  Most people quit the job before they can advance in the raise system.  Also this companies jobs are BRUTAL.  Imagine your not working at wal mart pushing carts with a machine but YOUR BODY.  Costco has the largest shopping carts in the world because all the products are bulk and monstrous.  I walk over a half marathon a day doing that at times and i once walked a MARATHON over 26 miles on a huge busy day.  PUSHING CARTS!!!. Not to mention IN ALMOST SUB FREEZING WEATHER!. All i can say is this company is guilty of violating human rights laws in my opinion it will DESTROY YOU!!! It will DESTROY YOU SOUL.  Working here is like working in a prison camp If they didn't have a raise system no one would stay and go elsewhere.  Another thing if you start working here DON'T GET HURT!!! THEY DON'T LIKE HURT PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WORK AGAIN PRISON CAMP!!!. It's no wonder they're union in parts of California it's not union where i live I'm a Republican and don't really go for those things but Costco is a place of madness i hate this company.  I feel like I'm in hell when I'm working.  It's like the hunger games during seasonal cut.  But I'm holding out going through hell and keeping going BECAUSE I've got my eye on the prize of the mythical$23 dollars an hour if i don't die trying.

7495,Costco Wholesale,Review about working at Costco IT,2017-03-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"1) ""No pressure"" work environment
2) Flexibility to move between teams
3) Great insurance rates
4) You get paid every 2 weeks as full time. That is 2 extra paycheks in a year. 
5) Job Security - most used word in every meeting when anyone ask about vacation and compensation packages. 
Sorry to rain on the excitement parade, I would have given more stars if the cons are less.","1) Most teams are unprofessional and are very hard to work with. They push back work and you will have to go in rounds to fix the issues. They are rude and arrogant as there is no penalty for bad behavior.  
2) Your total years of experience does not matter, number of years you have put at Costco is what matters. So, you get very low 401k contribution - 2 weeks of vacation a year for 5 years, no bonus, no stock options unless you are a manager and 2% salary raise is considered the maximum they can get. 
3) No telecommute as they cannot offer that to the warehouse employees(this is their logic)
4) Below market rate salary. So a really skilled employee will not join unless he/she is settled around the Seattle area. 
5) Very slow recruitment process. 
6) No employee discounts whatsoever. They give you executive membership card though. (you can take +1 for family and 2 basic membership for relatives)
7) They do not spend much on IT infrastructure(tools + talented people) but expect Google/ Amazon type features in their software applications. 
8) Very basic relocation allowance and assistance. 
9) Things are tough for an employee in work visa as they do not offer visa sponsorship for dependents (you have to pay it out of pocket), will not pay for Premium processing(that is a $1225 out of your pocket) and unbelievably slow to even respond to a query.  
10) IT Office location. Issaquah is very difficulty to get to and get out of during peak times. 25 mile commute is surer to take anywhere from 45 to 75 minutes. The farther you are, the more you will spend time on commute. Buying a property near Issaquah is very expensive as a decent house will be at least 550000 - 600000 dollars and upwards which will probably be more than what one can qualify for using Costco's compensation package. 
11) The slow work style will actually hurt your skills and speed over time. It will take some homework to get back to where you are if you get laid back. I say this because I have been there and experienced that. 
Most of the awesome reviews are either from the Warehouse resources or from the resources whom moved from warehouse to the IT department. Please understand this reality before you join IT if you are seasoned professional as I have seen many awesome resources leaving Costco as soon as they get a nice offer. If it works out well here, then I am happy for you!"

Someone with less experience will be promoted before you simply because they have been with the company longer.  

Also, Costco is a place for employees to become lethargic at their job.  Many have been with the company 20+ years and have no drive to move up because they make one dollar less than the same amount as the supervisors.  So, you have many workers that don't move up because they don't have a reason to."
7540,Costco Wholesale,College Program,2017-03-01,5.0,Member Service Representative,"They are very supportive of my educational Goals, after working with the company for 3 years. I have been able to attend classes and gain my education and hold my spot in my company for when I returned home for off seasons. The pay scale is great and aggressive.",Some management can get quite entitled and treat their employees improperly due to this. You don't have much choice in your schedule.
7541,Costco Wholesale,Terrible store and overhyped company.,2017-03-01,1.0,Merchandise Stocker,Good pay. Flexible scheduling. But that's where it ends.,"Management and supervisors are largely incompetent and are nothing short of corporate ""Yes Men"" who will exploit their workers to get more done in less time for less pay. You will usually be doing the work of three men and expecting to accomplish a five hour job in under two hours and if you protest; management will either just shrug their shoulders or they will condescend to you and intimidate you and can fire you for virtually anything real or imagined. Management and supervisors do not respect you unless you suck up to them.

If you are hired for Seasonal and manage to be hired on Part-Time you will be on a Probationary period; the time you worked for Seasonal does not count. So essentially you will be on a 180 day probationary period.

Employees who have been there longer than you do not really support you or even each other because there is no union and thus no real employee support; management lords their authority over you and will even brazenly insult and even intimidate you if you protest at their mistreatment. This company says it ""cares about its employees"" but in the time I worked there I saw that that was nothing short of a publicity stunt; the store has it's favorite brown nosers and it's preferred suck ups and cares not for worker safety or the smooth operation; the store runs its workers ragged and then tells them the job was not done to corporate satisfaction. 

The store will have ""walks"" from regional and even corporate on an almost weekly basis. Management and supervisors will do their little song and dance for the suits while at the same time throwing their workers under the bus in order to make themselves look good.

Costco values it's agenda more than it does their workers; the company draws you in with talks of great pay and benefits and flexible hours but what they don't tell you is that you will usually be given less hours yet expected to complete twice the amount of work in under a short period of time.

So in short: if you enjoy being worked harder and harder each day, enjoy being insulted and looked down upon by your bosses and being overall stressed out on a daily basis while chasing the carrot of ""great benefits"" whilst also being expected to smile and nod and jump when management says, then I suppose Costco is the company for you."

Health insurance is affordable and good.,The job is too easy. Yes very hard work but for me I enjoy working. I seriously believe i got dumber over my 20 years. Not very challenging just labor intensive. No movement where I was so no room for advancement. I believe Costco should test for management positions like other companies to keep the warehouse managers friends and family from getting promoted  too many AGM's that could barely read and write. Too many VP's with kids fast tracked into staff and AGM positions. Management pay is low compared to hourly pay scale and work load required for managers. Because I had exceeded the top pay in my job my raises were less than 1% a year for 10 years. While hourlys received 2%-4% a year. Work life balance is also non-existent for management.

I work in a Costco that opened in August, 2016. Here is my list of CONS: 1) Benefits do not begin until ""the first day of the second month following completion of xx hours."" I waited 5 months for benefits. They do NOT explain this during the hiring/orientation and it is not written anywhere. 2) Everyone works 5 days a week. I drive an hour a day to get there (round trip) which is not worth it for a four hour shift. Costco refuses to consider longer shifts in fewer days (maximization of hours) for part-time employees. 3) Two different managers told me prior to hiring that it is easy to pick up extra hours in other depts. This is a bald-faced lie. In six months I have been able to get exactly 5 hours from other depts. I now have two other part-time jobs to supplement my income. 4) Managers are rude and disrespectful to employees. When I reported one manager for making a sexist remark to me I was told, ""I wasn't party to that conversation so I can't comment on it."" No action was taken and no follow up was done. 5) Training is an absolute joke. Supervisors walk up to you while you are working, read a few sentences out of a book, scan your name badge and, ta da, you are ""trained."" 6) Previous experience does not seem to matter at Costco. I applied and was interviewed for an open position, one for which I had a lot of experience. In response to questions I gave examples of my experience and the interviewing manager responded with, ""when was that?"" then asked if I had ""more recent"" examples. I feel all of my experience is relevant but they do not seem to agree. Also, this reeks of ageism. 7) So-called processes are up to the whim of the manager in front of you. In any given day you may be told to perform a task differently by each manager who crosses your path and, without formal/consistent training, it's impossible to form a foundation of reference. Employees are left feeling that they never know how to do their job and/or the goal is constantly moving. Several in my warehouse have stated they now just go through the motions to get through the day. 8) Favoritism is rampant and obvious. Favorite employees (esp friends of managers) are given more hours or longer Sunday shifts (time and a half) over employees who have been with the company longer. This is not opinion--it is in black and white on the posted schedules. Also, favorite employees are told privately by managers when hours or openings are available in other depts. Many of the employees who opened this warehouse have already left, some are working their two week notice as I write this and I am actively seeking a job elsewhere. Costco is not a ""great place to work."""

And it is not enough to suffer the rude, disrespectful treatment with a smile and a thank-you-sir-may-I-have-another.  All it takes is one fellow worker, fully vested into the order of Costco, that doesn’t like you, to black ball your effort to simply earn a living.  A report is made to management behind your back, with absolutely no grounding in the truth, and your side of the story is uncalled-for – they want scapegoats instead of answers.

However and unfortunately not too many pros about Costco.,"The longer I worked at Costco and the more I learned, well at least at the Costco I was employed because I understand that all Costco's are operated differently. I learned that they are the most incompetent, industrial aged, oppressive, and untrusting organization. The operations could be better and if it was not for the gas station and membership Costco wou7not be a leading corporation. The managers and supervisors, not all of them, but the majority of them are micromanagers, extremely incompetent, no reward for hard work, approximately 70% of the employees are on some type of drug, and before I quit learned that 100% of the employees hate there job and they feel like they are stuck. Unfortunately,  this is true, the model that is used is to always change your schedule,  so every week an employee will have a different day and time of work, this includes weekends. Therefore with no consistency in schedule difficult to pLan an escape. The illegal nepotism at Costco, aunts, mothers, sons, and cousins all working together.  The illegal culture, consulted that using the bathroom is only during your break and when spoke in opposition it was noted in my review as negative whereas in the state of California it is illegal to inhibit any employee to use the restroom. It is not a career, it is a job and a job for those who live at home, for example, college students, in which if one ask would notice that is the majority of the employees.  It was not a good experience and I should be thankful because it provided motivation to leave."

Once you make it passed a certain time frame he money isn't bad depending on how you look at. Your wage is relative of course but upper management can easily land you in the six figure range when you consider benefits and bonuses.,"First level supervisor and line level employees seem to really get the ""short end of the stick"". It is almost as though Costco thinks that everyone is making great money and they can justify treating employees like they owe them something to be lucky enough to have such a good job. The fact of the matter is $13 an hour at part time is nothing one can live off of if he or she doesn't live with their parents or roommates. If you are above $25 you should not be starting over at Costco unless you have a second job. However, if you can ride the wave it will pay off in the long run.

One thing for sure is training. I believe training really helps out the store, the employee and customer. Training is essential, you have to know the ropes of the store, learn the lingos (block off, soft goods, headlines) especially for people that have never been in retail. I feel that training is so important. A employee can not do their job efficiently and to their full potential if they don't know how to do things. It becomes chaos when you send an employee to do something and they don't know how, therefore you're basically going backwards now having to take the time and teach them. So you've got all these new employees with no training or clue on how the store is being ran, rambling around asking questions (while on the job, and warehouse full of customers) completely backtracking just to show them how to do things, when I believe that could've have all passed in a one week worth of training or maybe even a couple days."

Senior employees are often rude, tired of the job, and lazy but still get better pay, better hours,and better treatment over harder working newer employees. Most of these senior employees feel ""locked in"" to Costco because they're paid so well and coddled by management. Why risk going anywhere else? You can tell who is a senior employee at Costco just by how mean and lazy they are. Typically, the lazier they are, the longer they've been with the company. This is a company wide issue, not just a single location.

I was laid off by Costco twice due to being a ""newer"" employee even though I had worked at the company for almost 2 years. I was even told by the manager who laid me off that he wishes he could lay off other, more senior employees instead of me; but he can't due to Costco's culture of ""who cares if they work hard, as long as they've been here a long time.""

It's not uncommon to see senior employees throwing tantrums because they were sent to push carts fold clothes, etc  because they feel that they are above that kind of grunt work. That's unacceptable behavior, but management embraces these types of people because, again ""seniority > work ethic"".

A few other cons are:

7932,Costco Wholesale,Membership / Front-End Associate,2016-10-07,5.0,,"Costco is a good employer, especially if you are a college student or never went to college. Unlike competing retail or grocery stores, Costco pays employees above the market rate while also guaranteeing pay raises--based on hours accumulated at work--up to a more than reasonable level. While I was working at Costco, I started off at $12 per hour while Sam's was starting employees off at $9 per hour and Wal-Mart at around $8 per hour. Other local grocery stores in the area started employees off in the $8-9 per hour range as well.

If you never got a single promotion in any form whatsoever, you could still work your way up to $20 and some change per hour as your regular (non-overtime) pay rate, which is roughly the same hourly rate as an entry-level supervisor. To make things better, Costco also provides an excellent benefits package as well as premium pay on Sundays. The premium where I worked was 1.5x your standard pay rate--just for the simple fact that you are clocked in on Sunday. 

My $12 became $18 per hour and as a college student at the time, and supervisors made $30 per hour instead of $20. Again, not for overtime. Just for working on Sunday. What employer treats their employees this well?

You also have the ability to work your way up the corporate ladder with or without a degree. The department managers at the location I worked at earned salaries between $60-80k per year, and many of them did not have degrees. I'm sure you'd hit a ceiling after a while if you never got a degree, but even if that ceiling is an $80k salary + full benefits, that's much better than just about any other company would offer an individual with a high school diploma. 

(For the record, the store manager at my location started off in the front-end department sacking groceries for customers, and worked his way up to being in charge of an entire Costco store. Not sure if he has a degree or not, and it honestly wouldn't surprise me either way. I'm sure he is pulling in a six-figure salary, plus performance bonus, plus full benefits package.)

If you did earn a college degree on the other hand, Costco makes a pro-active effort to place you in an area where your education and skill set is utilized. Marketing degree? Marketing department. Accounting degree? Accounting department. Management degree? You'll probably get fast-tracked to a management position in the store, or get moved to the corporate location. And if you do go corporate, then even more opportunities become available.

If you're interested in learning more about Costco, search for ""Costco Craze"" on YouTube and watch the video. It's a 45-minute documentary that goes into much greater depth than what I've shared here. 

To conclude, my personal opinion is that Costco is an amazing place to work if you don't have a college degree. If you do have a degree, it's still a good place to work (especially if your degree isn't particularly marketable, such as a liberals arts or social sciences degree). If you have a degree in a subject that's more in demand (think business subjects + STEM), you can probably find a much better job than anything Costco has to offer.","Jobs are extremely boring and tedious. Not intellectually stimulating or emotionally rewarding in any way. (Exceptions do exist, of course. But chances are you won't be the corporate wine buyer, chief marketing officer, or CEO.)

When you're slammed with stuff to do, it's all mindless work. You're running around sacking groceries, organizing carts, making hot dogs, folding clothes, doing data entry, sweeping the floor, etc. And when it's slow, you are pretty much watching the clock and counting down the hours/minutes/seconds until your shift is up.

Quite frankly, your academic status (i.e., do you have a college degree and if so, is it an economically valuable degree?) will determine how the pros and cons of this job balance out in your particular situation. 

If this is the best job you can get from a financial standpoint, then yes it is worth it. Be a good employee and work your way up as high as you can. If you can tolerate the dullness of the job, Costco does provide the opportunity for you to build a financially stable future.

If you have better financial opportunities available to you, then I'd recommend seeing if you can get a more satisfying position at Costco corporate. (At minimum, it'll be like any other corporate job you'll apply for anyway.) And if that doesn't work out, then obviously you can find something better."

No matter how many customer kudos you receive it doesn't weigh in with some supervisor or whether you stay or go. For some supervisors giving all you have is not enough and the company will not try to move you to a different department where you will be a better fit.

I'm a student who was hired part time (minimum of 24 hours/week) but got stuck doing 35-40 all summer. Once the school year rolled around I had to ask three managers multiple times to cut my hours before they actually agreed to do it. You also will probably never get out on time because they hire the bare minimum amount of people needed for each department and max out your hours, so most days we closed with 3 people when in reality we probably needed 5 to close on time. Also, at least in food court, there are no opportunities to switch departments. They don't want to let go of their employees because they know no one wants to transfer INTO food court to take their place."

8059,Costco Wholesale,Wrong culture for IT professionals,2016-08-25,1.0,IS Analyst,"Decent health benefits at very reasonable rates, good retirement benefits for “lifers""","Culture, dead weight, vacation policy, having to use the Costco pharmacy:

Costco has a very well defined and well-known culture.  They are known for promoting from within.  In fact, in Costco culture it’s a badge of honor to have started in a warehouse and have worked up into a corporate position.  While this is commendable, it does come with a down side, especially for IT professionals who come in from outside the company.  The warehouse culture is pervasive, so much so that they don’t believe in allowing telecommuting (warehouse workers can’t do it, why should you be able to?).  They believe that people need to be at their desks in order to be productive.  And we’re not talking about full time or regularly scheduled telecommuting.  They don’t even allow it for ad-hoc situations like having to stay home with a sick child.  This alone makes it very difficult to attract and keep IT talent.

During recent IS employee engagement surveys this point was again made to IS management.  The results of the survey continued to show a decline and management’s response on how to improve things?  Offer leadership training to all IS employees and improve the on-boarding process.  The first and second level IS managers are well aware of the ridiculousness of this since they are on the front lines and hear about it first hand from the employees.  Some of them, who haven't totally consumed the company Kool-Aid, try to work around the issues by allowing unaccounted for time off and ad-hoc remote work, if needed.  However, these managers are few and far between and are risking their own careers to at least try and make things better.  The root of this problem is that there is a total lack of autonomy within the company and within IS in general.  The rules are made on high and do not allow for deviation.

Another IS specific issue is if you work in a group that has on-call responsibilities.  If this is the case, you are required to make use of your own personal cell phone and there is NO reimbursement.

In general, the leave policy is horrendous.  Vacation is two weeks per year for the first five years (three floating holidays added after one year) and only six sick/personal days per year.  Again, this is probably a great deal for warehouse employees, etc.  but in the IT world almost all places start at three weeks.  This is especially egregious here thanks to not being able to work remote and therefore having to burn the precious time to accommodate having to handle personal items during the business day (such as waiting for the cable guy to show up between 8 and noon).

Another issue is not allowing ANY vacation over a roughly six to seven week period beginning the first week of November to roughly the week before Christmas.  This means not being able to visit family for Thanksgiving because you have to be back and in the office on the Friday after.  I understand this is a big time of year for a retailer, especially a predominantly brick and mortar one.  But there should be more flexibility to allow corporate employees to spend this time away from the office.

The Costco culture tends to lead to people spending their entire careers there.  It’s also very difficult for anyone to get fired.  I was told the only way to get fired was to either break the law or to mistreat a customer.  Due to this difficulty in firing, Costco is littered with “coasters”, people doing just enough to not get fired.  They are pervasive and they are not limited to Costco “lifers”.  The sad part is that others are well aware of those who are coasting and just have to deal with it and make up for what work they should be doing.

While they should be commended for how well they do treat the warehouse employees, they should also remain aware of the fact that professionals sometimes have different, loftier expectations.  This is especially true for IT professionals who have so many alternatives in the Seattle area alone.  Unfortunately, IS management is well aware of this and quite okay with it.  In fact one of them is quoted as saying “[w]e’re a grocery store, we don’t hire Google level talent.""

They have no programs in place to allow for spot bonuses or other compensatory awards.  And, as for yearly salary reviews, I was told (after being hired) that 3% is the maximum annual salary increase you could expect and then being told that nobody ever gets that (because it requires executive approval) and that 2% is “the norm”.  Knowing this in advance is extremely demotivating and is probably contributes to the number of “coasters”.  In the end it all comes down to a lack of incentives, and conversely, disincentives.  There are no true rewards for superior work or going above and beyond and there’s no punishment for failing to live up to your assigned duties.

And, finally, having to use the Costco pharmacy is the absolute worst.  It’s not open 7x24 like several chain pharmacies, nor does it offer a drive-thru window.  That also means having to fight the normal Costco parking lot just to pick up a prescription.  This is especially aggravating at the Issaquah warehouse, given that it is right next to the corporate campus and is always crowded.  It also makes it difficult to fill prescriptions if you are out of town and not in vicinity of a warehouse.  They used to allow use of other pharmacy networks, but that has slowly dwindled away to being solely Costco."

I think the worst part is that you are working a retail job. Costco is claimed to be some great but really it's only great compared to fast food and other retail jobs, so pretty much compared to the worst jobs in this country. 

We get force extended every day we work so we are always there all night.

A lot of the people in managerial roles shouldn't be. The leadership is very questionable, and I think that has to do with most of them being uneducated. So they don't know how to think for themselves. They just regurgitate what they are told by other managers.

I know all the work we do is pretty much mindless but Costco needs better training for their staff. It is literally non-existant. We just go out there and are told to follow someone so we can learn from them."

Just because they're related to a worker doesn't necessarily reflect a good work ethic in that individual. 

Staff is afraid to speak up due to retaliation and potential ill treatment. (Change in schedule, reduced hours, etc.)

When issues are brought to management for solutions, don't pass the buck and blame someone when it isn't done or done correctly. Just get it done. 

If the mission statement is to take care of their employees, then ASK what can be done...don't wait for the employee to bring it to your attention.  Regular upper management meetings only address the departmental issues. Ask the people in your department what needs to be addressed.

8227,Costco Wholesale,Ok job if you are just looking for something short term,2016-06-13,2.0,Front End Assistant,"- Attitude:  About half of the employees I met were ok.  I wouldn't have mind getting to know them more.  
- Pay:  The pay starting out was ok for a part time position ($13 in OR).","- Attitude:  The other half of people I met gave me a nasty attitude/vibe.  I think it was because I was a new hire and looked like I was fresh out of high school.  So I didn't feel like I was respected by everyone there.

- Poor hours:  It's really hard to actually get hours and advancement opportunities.  

- Bleed it out:  The vibe I received from management is you have to bleed for the company.  They want you to drink the corporate Kool-Aid and and really push it forward on to people.  Starting out, you can ONLY get a front-end position, mainly helping box groceries, doing carts, cleaning, or running across the store to grab merchandise.  I had a few years of supervisor experience previously and tried to make it known that I was interested in possibly a similar role.  That was never discussed again after my interview.  People that were hired after me, who this was their first job, were given almost 40 hours a week, while I was barely getting 20-25.  Even employees who were around a year or so were struggling to get even 30 hours.  Again, it's very hard to pick up hours and advance when management isn't given hours out.

- Sales whether you like it or not:  On my first day, I was forced to push membership upgrades onto customers, without really knowing the program I was supposed to be pushing.  I tried to make it known I wasn't quite comfortable doing that, yet the answer I received was along the lines of ""You just got to do it.""  It made me feel really uncomfortable that I couldn't even get proper training on the program.  Even one of the front end managers said to me that there were quotas to be met, and if they weren't, there were consequences.  He didn't go into depth what he meant, but it still didn't feel professional.  As someone who recently started with the company, the vibe I was getting didn't line up with anything I felt in my interview.

- Probation period:  You have to wait a 90 day probation period before you're actually a permanent employee with the company.  If you call out sick or do anything out of line, you can be terminated before your 90 days, at least that's what another employee advised me if I wanted to stick around."

They fired 50 ppl at our new store for making small mistakes or being late once. Some management is very rude and not approachable. If you are a new employee you will be disrespected multiple times.

This does not surprise me however, just because of knowing what type of people are managers.

As one member of staff has put to me: ""You have bad managers, but then you have really bad managers, so it makes you think that the bad ones aren't so bad.""

As you may have already read from another anonymous employee sources on this site, the handbook is definitely used as a weapon against you, regardless whether its abiding the law. The handbook is also a rarity in physical form. I have worked for 8 years and have only ever received 2 (They are released every year and you're supposed to receive one yearly). The first one was when I first started and the other in 2014.

There has been instances that have led myself to research through government websites for UK employment law to protect myself and to defend controversial acts that management have carried out on staff.

For instance if you are ill a few times, you will get a counselling meeting which is basically a telling off for being ill...too many times. Regardless how serious the illness sick time is, you still get one. Even if your illness is protected with a doctors note STATING that the patient is unfit for work, that will still be added as a sick absence and will contribute to another telling off or suspension. 
I know this as it was used against me. I eventually found that providing a doctors note doesn't and shouldn't be counted towards your absence record, however I found this out after It was done against me.

Like others state on here about being on a top rate, I couldn't agree more. It does not literally say anywhere that management deliberately attempt to get top rate staff into trouble to push them to either quit or get sacked, but you know its happening and other staff members know that as well.

The major problem with this is that UK Costco employees have no union or rep, so nobody gets help, nobody knows how to get help, so we are muted in silence whilst this all happens. 

If any employment regulator or journalist was to ask a UK Costco employee how they get help if there's a problem with management or head office, I can guarantee they will not know. The only known way to report a grievance is to report it to head office, however you have to state your name/identity AND the manager/staff you are reporting against is immediately notified, which you could argue is general practice, however I know no one favours this as staff are concerned they are to be a target for victimisation or then to be deliberately pushed into trouble over another separate issue to then be faced with un-favouring outcomes. 

If you look up the differences of being a leader and a boss, you will notice that the actual job is the same, but the manor in which the manager conducts his work determines whether he's a boss or a leader. I personally believe there is at least 90% of Costco UK managers that are bosses, if that.

If you've read this far I hope this has given clarity in giving a detailed insight into the work ethics of Costco UK management. I cannot prove that all managers are like this, but I know personally that the ones I've worked with, are all bosses.

Finally referring back to the handbook, It is against the handbook to slander the company on social media/online so my review could be interpreted as an offence to which could lead to me getting a counselling notice, suspension or a dismissal, so therefore anonymity is crucial for my safety and other employee safeties. Please bare that in mind glassdoor."

50% full time and 50% part time staff

Or you can do your job day after day, year after year.

You need to work another part time job

Even at $24 hour at 25+ hours week, if you got a job at $15 hour full time, its the same.

You would save working 8+ years at only $15 hour full time versus working up to $24 hour at 25+ hours week over that time period.

At $16 hour 25+ hours week is the same as full time minimum wage $10.45 hour

8382,Costco Wholesale,Costco is Full of Hate,2016-04-06,1.0,EARLY MORNING STOCKER,I can't think of anything that could possibly justify enduring the hostility and hatefulness that is found within the company culture of Costco Wholesale.,"It was as though I was working among prisoners. You are dehumanized by your coworkers who have a sense of superiority as a result of being there for so long. 

...Costco has been praised by many for being such an ethical company. In reality, the only facts that contribute to that ideology are that employees make a few dollars more than they would at Walmart, in addition to higher-up positions that pay considerably more than their counterparts at comparable retailers. There are also good health benefits. However, no amount of money should be able to justify emotional abuse and ultimate objectification.

There is homophobic hate-speech thrown around casually in a jokingly manner. During one of my first few days, I was pummeled by a shelf of about twenty boxes of Synergy drinks, all of which contained 6 glass bottles. One employee who noticed asked if I was okay only to subsequently alert the person from whom I was taking direction with the statement, ""You didn't tell him that the shelf was broken!"" (I was stocking the drinks as they collapsed on me.) The man then came out of the produce cooler and said to me, ""Just do one layer."" He then walked back inside of the produce cooler. I was left with bruises from the occurrence, and it was basically ignored by everyone.

The company culture at Costco is repulsive. In reality, the people who constantly praise Costco and consider it to be the most ethical company ever are most likely members of the higher middle-class who would never find themselves in any comparable line of work. With that said, they view the people who work at Costco or within any similar contexts as people whom they're above on the social hierarchy ladder; they think it's wonderful that the incompetent, poorly educated people who occupy the bottom of society's rankings are given the amazing opportunity to make $13 an hour as opposed to $9. Would Walmart be viewed as the holy grail of employers if they raised their pay a few dollars and increased their benefits? If the answer is no, then Costco shouldn't be idealized like it is today. Costco is a glorified Walmart. Costco is a place in which you will be demeaned and put down if you approach anyone with kindness or compassion. Kindness and compassion have no place there, and the majority of the staff aren't even capable of recognizing anything of the like. It's like a prison in the sense that the employees feel as though they're empowered by being able to treat new people as if they're worthless indentured servants. I had to endure the wrath of the person who was supposedly training me during my first few days when I made a mistake with stacking oranges. A few boxes fell over, and she screamed profanity at me. This was in conjunction with being treated as if I was her misbehaving child who needed to be disciplined. 

Honestly, Costco Whole Sale is the worst context in which I have ever found myself. It was depressing just waking up to know that I'd be going there after the first day, because the first day exposed so much of what they're about and set the time for my brief experience there. I had never been so dehumanized and put down before working at Costco and around some of the most volatile human beings I have ever encountered. I left with physical injuries as well as emotional ones. Costco is a disgusting place that only perpetuates some of the most hateful mindsets in society. I will never be returning, and that is the happiest thought I am left with after my abusive experience at Costco Wholesale."

8395,Costco Wholesale,Was a great company to work for,2016-04-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Costco is a company that is in a league of its own. Starting from the bottom up, emplowest to management, there is a standard in which all are held to. Unlike other companies that seem to levy all rules and responsibilities on a select few great quality employees while allowing the rest of the crew to slack off and bend and break rules without consequence.

A very fair starting wage when I first began working there in the early 90's. As long as you're not afraid of some work, this company is a great and steady place to work + benefits. Raises depend on hours worked, and not by favoritism.","There is hardly a con to working here. Everything is as it says it is. When I worked there, the butchers weren't union."

8411,Costco Wholesale,"Good Benefits, - Management needs refined",2016-03-29,3.0,,One of Costco's greatest benefits is the insurance and retirement.  The premiums for the insurance is very affordable and excellent coverage.  The retirement benefit 401k is company matched. They are getting better at a more work/life balance approach.,Costco is a continued growing company with many faults that tend to be overlooked.  The young management that they are now hiring are inexperienced within the industry as well as how to manage people.  This makes a very difficult work environment.
8412,Costco Wholesale,"They tricked me into becoming a janitor, and I quit after two months.  Never, EVER again!",2016-03-28,2.0,Cashier Assistant (Front End Assistant),"-Much higher starting hourly wage ($11.50 - $12.00) compared to many retailers
-Guaranteed 26 hour work week for part time employees
-Guaranteed time and a half on Sunday for all employees; this takes effect immediately for new employees
-Free leftovers (pizza, sandwiches, etc.) from the Food Court after closing; this is great for a convenient dinner, if you’re part of the closing crew
-Free water for all employees assigned to the parking lot for cart retrieval
-The dress code is very flexible; you need to come in with a collared shirt and covered shoes, but the rest is generally up to you.
-Managers allow employees working after closing to bring their own music to listen to while carrying out assigned tasks.  Absolutely anything goes, so you don’t have to worry about anyone complaining about lyrical content, your preferred genre, etc.","-Costco’s policy is to start all new employees, regardless of education and work experience, as Cashier Assistant.  According to Costco’s careers page, “Please Note: These jobs may not be open, but are representative of jobs at a Costco location.”  Combined with the fact that you can apply for any position listed below this disclaimer, you’ll find out quickly after getting hired that this is more than a little misleading.
-“Cashier Assistant” is a euphemism for “Nighttime Janitor”.  For the majority of your shifts, you will be scheduled for a few hours after closing to mop floors, clean trash bins, bale trash and plastics, and clean bathrooms.  This is never once mentioned in the job description online.  It makes one wonder why Costco even has a dedicated maintenance staff at its warehouses in the first place.
-Benefits for part time employees take 180 days to take effect, compared to 90 days at other companies
-Supervisors and managers tend to pick favorites.  If you’re not one of them, you’re not likely to have an easy time advancing yourself within the warehouse.
-Costco offers little to no training.  There is one day of orientation and little else.  Occasionally, you can be assigned to roadshows, e.g. Seafood, and without seeking guidance from another employee, you can’t be reasonably expected to know how to perform the task properly.
-The reflective vests available for employees on cart retrieval are filthy, smelly, and never clean."

First off, the pay is not as advertised in big cities. Start off pay will be between $13 to $13.50 per hour.  I was told by my hiring manager that no one comes off of the street as a Supervisor or Manager but to my amazement at our perspective meeting the week before our store opened there were at least 4 Supervisors and 1 Manager who was hired off of the street. Understand that if your are hired as a stocker that you will be cashiering, assist the cashier by boxing the members groceries, round up carts outside, help with the janitorial duties, and finally stock.

8428,Costco Wholesale,Service Deli Assistant (Rotisserie),2016-03-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I enjoyed above average compensation while working for Costco, and a free membership.","Duties assigned to the deli closer position were beyond reasonable expectations for a single person. As the closer, I cleaned up the deli room from the morning crew's usage prior to my arrival and during my working hours, prepare and cook sufficient rotisserie chickens for members, and clean up the rotisserie areas of the deli and meat department. The standards of cleanliness were nearly impossible to be met by a one worker assigned to do all of these tasks. Moreover, the morning crew would only extremely rarely make an effort to help keep things maintained and cleaned throughout the day, leaving a huge mess that could be painstaking to deal with on an especially busy night (for chicken sales). Furthermore, choosing the right amount of chicken to prepare was almost purely guesswork, which potentially added more time onto the amount of work to do because of the time to harvest, and the wasted time preparing the chicken and cleaning up the mess. Ultimately, the worst part about working in the Costco Service Deli was dealing with the absolute lack of consideration and cooperation from my coworkers who could have cared less about what I would walk into, but who also demanded perfection upon their arrival in the morning. This could only possibly be matched by the unreasonable expectations of the management, inside and outside of the deli, to sufficiently clean all required areas to par, alone. I absolutely recommend that the practices and policies of the department change before anyone decides that it is a good idea to enter this position."

8431,Costco Wholesale,Good company but seniority based.,2016-03-22,4.0,Service Assistant,"For a retail environment, they offer exceptional starting wages. They expect you to work hard and the raises are based off of how much you work (as an hourly employee) rather than merit. This creates loyalty but also produces complacency in many. They have pretty amazing benefits and take care of all of their employees. There's a super low turnover.","Advancement is based heavily on seniority and, like anywhere else, who you know. Raises based on hours worked encourages complacency in the long run. The low turnover also makes it a hard company to get into.

Show up to work on time everyday, do your job, have a great positive attitude you will be successful. Cashiers are making 50k+ a year as well as some stockers. If you are a good worker and you have potential and you want to move up it will happen as long as you do your part.","Regular hourly employee are making 50k+ a year with a bonus, supervisors are making 55k+ a year with a bonus every 6 months.  Managers start at 62k a year without a bonus. Most supervisors never want to move up because they are or can make just as much as a manager. There should be some seperation there. I mean who would actually want to deal with what manager has to deal with for an extra 7k a year? The same for a regular hourly position. That's why there aren't many good managers in the company.

I had no work experience what so ever, outside of my home where I filled the duty of many, many job titles! They were willing to give me a chance and the break I needed, to care for myself and children. I started out as part time and still hold that position today, but I work more 40 hour work weeks than not. There are times when I am only scheduled the min. 24 hours, but I always manage to pick up shifts in other departments. If you are willing to be trained in all departments, as I am, there is no reason you can't work a 40 hr work week.You get what you put into this life and that holds true with your job too :)  now, 12 yrs later I am still here at Costco and I still love my job. I love my co workers, we are all a big huge family here. I now make more money than my dead beat ex husband, who left us literally homeless and with nothing. I topped out in pay after my 5th year with the company and make $21.80 and hour, Monday-Saturday and just over $30.00 an hour on Sundays. I have paid holidays, amazing health/Dental/life insurance, a 401k plan that has grown way beyond what I thought it could, I didn't even know what it was when I started.and twice a year I receive a bonus of $2,400. I feel like I'm living fat on the hog, compared to how I lived when I was married. Costco has been my blessing! :) I love this company sooo much! This is where I will stay until I drop dead or retire, which ever comes first :)","The only con I can think of is, I wish employee's had their own restroom and didn't have to use the one for the public. It is always full, with a line and there have been days, that I spent almost my whole break waiting for and using the restroom. The only time I got off of my feet is when I sat on the pot. No bueno"

Costco is the best place to work that I have ever been lucky enough too stumble upon. The benefits are superb. The hours are great. Yes you are expected too produce. You won't get out of probation if you can't produce tho. Every 3 years we get a new handbook with salaries and benefits that only get better. You have to practice solid customer/member service.

Retail hour can be tough and you have an inconsistent schedule every week.
8512,Costco Wholesale,Best Retail job you can find,2016-02-18,4.0,Forklift Driver,"Much higher than average pay for a retail position, you start currently at $11.50.  You max out at I think 24.50.  If you are working full time I think you reach the max by about your 5-6 year.  Decent retirement plan with a 50% matching up to 6% of pay.  Very good health, dental, and vision coverage.  They do try to take care of their employees.  It's still a retail job though. So taking care of you employees means a less than some other companies in other industries. Costco always promotes from within. You will never have someone who comes in who doesn't start by pushing carts or working at something like the food court or maintenance.  You job will be extremely secure. I have been working here for 3 years and have seen a number of people who probably should be fired but never are because Managers are afraid. Overall though, the quality of people that costco employes are top notch for retail.","Be prepared to spend years here if  you want a chance at reaching management positions.  There are many people who spend over 20 years here just working normal cashier jobs.  Would need at least 2 years before you could be considered for a supervisor position.  

Because costco puts high priority on tenure, it makes it very difficult to move within the warehouse if you haven't been there long.  

Managers also sometimes use trickery in postings in order to only hire who they really want. I once applied for a position that I had previously been trained for and had extra training to extras jobs within the role that a new person would not.  The manager called and told me that the posting that I applied for was actually for 2 different positions, one that I already had and that the other one had already been filled before they interviewed me.  Please explain to me how they can fill a position before everyone was interviewed?  The hiring manager just didn't like me so he chose to use trickery to get around moving me into the new position.

Because Costco only promotes from within, most managers have never been managers before and have absolutely no training to do so.  Some pick it up but many of them lack important skills needed for managers.

Onboarding does not exist.  You will spend a few hours doing paperwork but that is it. You will never be trained when you start at any new job at costco, everyone is just thrown at the job and hope that you pick it up quick.  Rules for the warehouse are not communicated until you break them."

They never help they just stand in the front of the store and do ABSOLUTELY nothing. They dont help you. They dont train you on how they want things. And get mad when you do not perform to store standards. They are a complete joke. And it is ALL based on what manager likes you for the duties you'll do that day. It is not an equal job. Its full of CRAP.
8547,Costco Wholesale,cool,2016-02-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very affordable high quality health insurance benefits even for PT employees. Great for working parents who split up child care and need coverage. The key to succeeding at Costco is to work hard, have a good attitude and be nice to people. It's hard work and fasted paced, you have to be down for that to succeed.","At this warehouse you are required to work 5 days per week, even if you are PT at 24 or so hours. This means lots of 4-5 hour shifts rather than fewer 8 hour shifts which is tough for those who commute a long distance to work or have to cover day care."

8554,Costco Wholesale,Part-Time Student Worker,2016-02-06,5.0,Morning Stocker,"The pay raises are based on a total hours worked scale which is nice if you are only part-time and possibly not looking to make it your full Career. Even though I was only scheduled part time, you can always ask if another department needs help after your shift and put in 8 hours if you like. There's also time and a half on Sunday's and free executive membership for employees!

As a stocker they make you work hard, but it kept me engaged and helped me work much more efficiently, I was never bored or standing around. They are very flexible with students and made it easy to work only during summer and winter breaks. 

There are managers I liked more than others, but I think that's true at every job. If there is a manager you work really well with you can approach them to see if you can work with them on a regular basis.

If you work hard, managers will recognize it because Costco does a great job of filling higher positions internally.","I noticed the managers can sometimes work pretty long hours as salary employees.

Morning Stockers come in very early (4 or 5 am) which I'm guessing is a con for most people, but it also opens up your day.

If you work during opening hours you'll have to deal with a lot of customer questions because items are constantly getting cycled in and out or simply around the store. This requires you too keep up with how things change everyday and it makes quite a few customers grumpy."

They don't tell you that means there may be some days all you do is fold clothes, stand at a table and give samples, and become a janitor when the store closes. If you don't like to be in the same place for long and don't mind having to answer to a supervisor 27 times in one shift then you may like it. Some days are hectic and some boring and mind numbing.

Try to minimize FT staff in favor of cheap part time staff, than wonder why there aren't any experienced staff around.
(Especially true in the Fresh food depts.) Don't value experience. Just keep hiring anyone with a pulse, and if they don't work out get someone else. Just keep your labor costs low by churning through newbies. Turnover is incredible. If they could get rid of all the topped out staff they would."

Fantastic location, terrific company!","Costco retains some of the longest tenured employees I've ever seen.  At the time I arrived in 2007 the average tenure was 14 years.  People here regularly celebrate 20, 25 even 35 year anniversaries! As such, positions in management are limited, and at the top are extremely rare -  reserved for those qualified few who have additionally provided lengthy service to the company.

I have worked for a few major retailers, and most of my colleagues work in retail...and I have never seen a company take such good care of their employees. Amazing pay, unheard of benefits, and a great work environment. They close at 6 on weekends. If you get the opportunity to work for Costco...TAKE IT! They have a set pay-scale which is extremely generous with raises every 6 months (as of January 2016 top out is 23.05 an hour) and when you top out, you get a $2500 bonus every 6 months. They also give you time and half on Sunday's.","I wouldn't call it a con, but Costco's take on loss prevention is a little different and takes some adjustment to get used to. First off, you don't get an office like any standard loss prevention roll. You are working out in the open in the back office...this means everyone is always walking by and looking at what you are doing, this makes internal investigations exceptionally difficult. You will also spend a lot of time reviewing transactions to solve member disputes - like a customer will say they got charged for 3 cases of water and only bought 2 etc. Costco doesn't have the shoplifting activity of a standard retail environment, so you spend a lot of time auditing things policing the building for safety. Since they take such good care of their employees, internals are scarce as well. Bottom line...if you are looking for action, this may not be the place for you."

She also used the beginning of my training against me, saying that because I had made mistakes that was a big deal to her.  I said to her ""well, I learned how to fix my mistakes by myself) and by the time my 30 days were up I was doing much better.  She said that it didn't matter because of my previous mistakes.  Also the two ""training"" me had  NO patience and when I would ask a question (because of improper training) I got snapped at.  So, I was not sure if I should be asking questions, so I stopped.

It's great they promote from within but the void of educated people that are troubleshooters hinders what business could be and sometimes can be perceived as immature. The managers play favorites.

One's livelihood is easily affected because of certain mandates from corporate rather than hard work. To build a strong more nimble company, you utilize the strengths of the diversity rather than push people up the ladder unmerited. From the worker perspective, there's favoritism based off who like you rather than the work you have done. The warehouses act as independent companies, with the general manager being the dictator and everybody else the underlings. The environment is cut throat if you are not in the circle and the management will come after you for any reason - eat or be eaten is the mantra.

It gets 1000's of ppl/day and you are expected to go FAST and RUN stuff back customers don't want at the last minute.  In other warehouses I've seen ppl walk but in this run you're expected to RUN Forest RUN!!  You're also expected to sweep and continually pick up minuscule pieces of garbage off the floor WHILE you are loading carts and ppl NEVER stop coming down the lane to check out.  If you stand still for 1 second between customers, they will say you are idle!  They also expect you to clean toilets even though in other warehouses I've heard they don't do that.  You will SWEAT every shift.  You will be expected to go out in the parking lot, freezing rain or blazing heat, to push 10 shopping carts at once.  They don't want to see you do less than 10, and they still want you to do this quickly.  Oh, and good luck finding parking during the holidays when you come to work.  But if you're late due to NO parking spots, they won't care.

Management at this warehouse is also a total joke.  The open door policy is all for show.  If you try to address any issues, they will see you in a negative light and not listen to what you are saying.  You are just a number to them, with over 400 employees normally and close to 500 during the holidays.  Managers stand around and talk about employees and shoot the breeze, while employees work hard.  It takes YEARS to get full-time here for most ppl and years to get to a decent pay rate.  You pretty much will be part-time forever, and you will be expected to be available whenever they want you.  The schedule varies widely and you will work mostly on the weekends.  This is retail for you, a field which I will no longer work in.  It is not worth never seeing your kids to get pushed really hard physically, for minimal pay really and to have managers and supervisors treat you like you're nothing.  It's very cliquey at this warehouse too.

If you are lucky, you might enter Costco through the greasy food court or maybe even the bakery.  But most people have to enter through ""front end assistant"" meaning bottom of the barrel.  Some people are stuck there for 10yrs. plus!!  They don't care if you have an education or not.  I'm so glad I do have one and I can move on to bigger and better things now.

They are like family, you like some better than others of course. There is a position or department for almost everyone. If you decide you don't like the spot you were hired into, odds are there is still something there for you. It's a union building, which has its own pros and cons. The pros being that you have someone to back you if the job isn't looking out for you like you know they are supposed to. Cons are the entitled attitude some people get as a result,  and the co-workers who still have a job even though they are lazy, crazy, or bad at their job. There is a new warehouse manager who is a great improvement on the last one, but that won't last forever.","I have a great work ethic. I notice that, perhaps because of the union thing,  people who are lazy seem to never get in trouble. The management comes to expect a poor job from them and knows their performance won't improve with criticism so they don't bother. However, if you do a good job and they come to expect excellence from you,  any tiny mistake is a huge deal (depending on the manager/supervisor). Because they expect excellence from you, there isn't much gratitude for all your hard work, with some exception. I've had some great managers/supervisors, but never for long. The managers who aren't ruthless don't seem to last as long. There seems to be an exceptional lack of empathy from management, that I'm not sure is exclusive to my building. Friendships among employees, especially between employees and supervisors/managers is somewhat actively discouraged. They call us a Costco family,  but do not promote a close knit environment. What good rapport there is we create among ourselves. No team building or bonding to speak of. A palpable rift between regular employees and management seems to be the goal."

If hired permanently, part-timers are eligible for benefits after working certain number of hours. Hourly pay rate higher on Sunday. In my warehouse, most employees were friendly and helpful. Most members (customers) were friendly. Costco is not open on major holidays and doesn't extend hours very much for the holiday season. I was allowed to have some schedule flexibility but that would vary from one supervisor/manager to another. The environment is high energy and fast-paced. Unlikely to be bored. Jeans and sneakers OK, collared shirt required.","Work schedules are printed and posted in warehouse; employees unable to view schedule online. Schedules can and do change so if you don't work every day, your schedule could change and you wouldn't know. Managers/supervisors sometimes call employees with changes but not always. Even seasonal employees receive a 30-day performance review; unfortunately the experience may be less than optimal, as managers and supervisors seem to lack basic management skills. Because most workers are hourly, schedules are strictly monitored to the minute. You must take your breaks and lunch at specific times and for the allowed length of time, not one minute difference. If you make a mistake, you may receive a ""counseling notice"". If you read other reviews, you will see these same items identified by others. You may be standing or walking on concrete floors for up to 8 hours, requiring very good shoes, possibly orthotics or other support. I also had compression socks which helped a lot. If you interact with members, be prepared for anything. There were no written procedures for jobs that I saw. Most of the training is done on the job on the first day, very little after.

My supervisor was great and understanding as well. Benefits were good too. Other then that, none.","Quite a few come to mind. 
- First off, the communication from upper management is absolutely atrocious. There is very little promptness in the tasks they demand, such as changing up the items on the fence by the entrance in an hour or less before the store opens. There is a difference between business demands and just needlessly doing more work. Most of them lack basic communication skills (which does not surprise me since I am sure none of them went to college or anything.) They just seem like they like to fumble around because they severely lack experience or intelligence in their position and duties.
- The scheduling is a joke. I know my supervisor was not responsible since he did not have a choice. I will say that when he was gone though, I had never dealt with such a lazy, irresponsible, and unorganized manager who was temporarily overlooking our department in Major Sales. The manager had scheduled me for the early morning shift when I had blatantly reminded them 4 times to not schedule me for that time since my schedule would not allow it, but it happened anyway. This manager also completely ignored my time that I had asked off for a friends wedding that I had put in over 3 months ago. Yet, that was ignored too since my manager was out for an injury and no one else could approve it. I had to hunt down a manager for weeks to get it worked out. Immaturity does not go well with managerial positions. Hourly shifts were awful to work, especially the 4-hour shifts totaling 24 hours a week for months on in (roughly 8-9 months) because of ""cutting"" payroll. If you are going to cut payroll for months at a time, do you think workers will stick around for long? Of course not. However, managers can also do this so they can get a big, fat bonus check for not using all of payroll and kissing up to corporate for better ratings. So, no consideration for employees whatsoever. The managers are despicable.
- Disorganization is prominent in this warehouse. Whenever the front end was foolishly under-staffed by one of the immature jr. managers (aka supervisors), they would pull all other departments up to the front to put groceries in baskets. Seriously. Of course, this made us look even better with members, since there was no one else to assist in Majors, Merchandise, Domestics, Food Court, or anywhere else. No thoughts about keeping at least a few people in each department in order to run breaks as well. Yet, managers would much rather see groceries put in boxes then assisting members anywhere else. We received numerous member complaints because of the managers' brilliant plans to turn every department into a post-holiday rush ghost town."

However, in the middle of your career maybe not. If you're looking for a fast-paced company then Costco probably isn't going to be the best choice.

Management seems nice.,"First off, they get you in with the promised benefits, but you aren't allowed the benefits until one year of employment and you must be a full-time employee. Secondly, their training is pure crap. They will throw you out to be a clerk's assistant before they have told you how you are supposed to do anything. Don't worry, they will give you a buddy to teach you... But that buddy will leave in five minutes. Then you will have upwards of three more buddies who will tell you to do something completely different than the last. The clerk will blame you for being new, even when they haven't even scanned an item yet. The clerk will not answer questions, and your new buddy will be nowhere to be found. Communication between the clerk and assistant is bad, training is poor, and the people who work there treat other employees rudely.

8928,Costco Wholesale,Think working at Costco is good?  Think again,2015-09-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Health benefits.  Sometimes free food.,"At Costco, you're paid a low, measly wage.  There are only 2 types of wages in the world - wages you can live on, and wages you can't live on.  Costco - like so many other greedy companies - doesn't pay a living wage - not even a decent wage.  At Costco, you're expected to learn and perform many different job functions.  They'll want you pushing carts, working in the deli, working in the bakery, working in photo, being a cashier, bagging groceries, etc... So essentially you're learning 5-7 different jobs, but you're getting paid the SAME low - non living wage - that you'd get paid working anywhere else working only ONE kind of job (such as being a cashier).  This makes no sense - and it's surprising to me the number of people who would agree to work at Costco.  Usually the people working at Costco are either parents, who don't have much choice, or much younger people who don't have enough knowledge to know any better.   You're also expected to work 5 days a week, even if you're part time.  This also doesn't make much sense.  One of the biggest advantages to working part time is NOT driving to work 5 days a week.

At the top rate employees earn $23.40 an hour for a service assistant position and $25.20 an hour for a service clerk position. At top rate you also earn $3000 twice per year as a bonus. If you work on Sundays you earn $4 extra per hour on top of your regular rate. 

Here are the breakdowns on how much employees make per year at full-time working 40 hours per week. This list does not factor the extra money made when working holidays or overtime: 

• $54,384 is how much a service clerk not working on Sunday with a $6000 bonus makes per year at top rate. 
• $55,920 is how much a service clerk working on Sunday with $6000 bonus makes per year at top rate.
• $50,928 is how much a service assistant not working on Sunday with a $6000 bonus makes per year at top rate.
• $52,464 is how much a service assistant working on Sunday with a $6000 bonus makes per year at top rate.

Of course it might take 5-7 years working full time to get to that top rate, but none the less its still really good money. Employees start off making $11.50 per hour.","Its Retail, but pays $50,000+ a year even if you work as a janitor there.

You'll never be able to finish early because there will always be bad employees that never finish and you have to go and help them.That's your reward for working hard - more work. The result of this is most employees doing just enough work not to get fired. It actually benefits you to be lazy. After being at Costco for a while you'll notice that there are untouchable employees that can do and get whatever they like. This is because the managers are afraid of confronting people that  are problematic and  most of the managers are just ""yes men"" . There's a few that actually have some balls but not many.

How often do I need to put on a fake smile for customers? How fast do you expect me to throw stuff into a cart or stock items without messing it up? Isn't doing my job correctly, showing up on time and making members happy more important than being a smiling portrait? Never mind the fact I was driving 50 miles a day in rush hour traffic and still made it to work on time everyday and did my job as expected. I've never been fired from any job ever and their reasoning for it was completely unjustified. I found this company's expectations unrealistic and it treats their new hire employees like garbage.

Many of these traits have waned over the years with younger employees and those who are new to Costco simply have not experienced ""expectations"" in the workplace which is why so many ""seasonals"" find themselves not being called back after January layoffs or re-assigned to the Member Service as a last resort to prove their worth to the organization.

9065,Costco Wholesale,Best company I've worked for,2015-08-09,5.0,Cashier Assistant,"I started a little over a month ago as a Cashier Assistant. They start you out at $11.50/hr and your raises are based on the amount of hours worked. within 5-6 years you can max out at $21.50/hr or so (i forget the exact amount) and this is assuming you don't promote to management. Management treats you very well and even own up to their own mistakes. I got forgotten once outside bringing in carts for 2 hours in 95 degree weather. I actually didn't mind this as I have worked in worse conditions so I didn't bother to go inside and say anything about it. Regardless once they realized i was still out there they called me and in immediately apologized very sincerely and sent me on my lunch break and informing me that i didn't have to stay out there longer than 20 minutes when it's above 90 degrees outside.

Benefits start after 6 months so I don't have much experience with that but i hear it's really good.

If you're part time it's a corporate policy that you don't get scheduled fewer than 24 hours/week. plus sundays you make 1 1/2 the normal rate of pay. (ex: if you normally make $10/hr you'll get 15/hr on a sunday)","Don't expect to start full time. they like to start you off with 5 hour shifts with a couple 1, maybe 2 8 hour shifts thrown in per week. However, from what I can tell, it's worth sticking it out until you can go full time. maybe find a 2nd job to fill in hours until this point.
 
hours and the time of day you work are based heavily on seniority. Higher seniority gets the morning and daytime shifts. Just starting out, expect to work the afternoon/evening closing shift."
9066,Costco Wholesale,Costco Employee,2015-08-09,5.0,Maintenance,"Best place I have worked at, want to go far within!","A few, but amazing non the less"
9067,Costco Wholesale,IT Analyst,2015-08-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Stable and clean environment.  Mostly laid back with a little flexibility on hours in the office though you need to be there daily.  If in the right group with the right manager (rare) you can get support for professional development.  Infrastructure spending is adequate.,"However, I used to wear Costco on my sleeve.  I can't any longer.  Management is made up of a lot of 20+ year employees with little vision.  The fact they like to hire within promises that external ideas are kept there.  it's still the 90s at Costco corporate.  Very cliquish; you are in or out.

Inconsistent management regarding performance.  Some managers are only good at creating spreadsheets that mean little to nothing.  The open door policy of going up the chain if you're not happy is worthless.  Management is always in the right no matter what.

As for compensation, if you are in IT, you are the only group in all of Costco that does not get a bonus.  Here is a huge inconsistency.  One of the arguments for not letting IT staff work from home is because ""warehouse workers can't do it"".  Yet they get bonuses and IT does not.  There are very few perks and the ""lunches"" they provide twice yearly though appreciated, are sub-par.  The recent employee engagement effort was basically to re-iterate that nothing will change.  Salary doesn't compare to similar companies' IT compensation.  Raises don't meet inflation and the huge rise in cost-of-living in the Seattle area.

Leave is kind of a joke.  You get two weeks for five years then finally get another added after that amount of time.  Sick leave of 5-6 days per year is pretty lean especially if you are a parent.

If you have solid IT skills and experience, the hype you hear about working for Costco is from warehouse employees.  Take your talents elsewhere if you want a satisfying career."

9102,Costco Wholesale,Only for certain types. Speed users preferred. More like boot camp then work,2015-07-24,2.0,Cashier Assistant (Front End Assistant),"-Great pay
-Great benefits 
-4th year emp. Can make 24.70/hr at lowest pos.
-If you like work that never changes, do the same thing every day, and enjoy no peaceful moments 
-never ending boot camp to test you limits
-every once in a month you have a bearable day","-Big brother: you are under constant surveillance there are on average 36-to 48 managers, asst managers. Supervisors. Apart from a few of them they almost all do absolutely nothing, except stand or maybe roam always watching.
-Pressure- you might as well work with a gun to your head, stopping to even get water is a sign of weakness.
Managers galore- most employees couldn't tell you their appropriate command structure especially in the front end. This leads to the worst part of working at costco. Since no one trains you to do anything (they believe in learning by doing), you'll soon find this manager wants it done this way, while a certain supervisor wants it another way. Then the asst manager walks buy and blames you for it being a disaster.
2nd biggest problem- this job gives special treatment to long Time employees and such on a scale that is unprecedented and probably downright illegal in labor laws. Management and supervisors except floor supes. Do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. if there was an Olympic sport for standing and doing nothing Costco would sweep the competition. Just wait til one of these ""managers"" writes you up or tells you how to do your job.

Good pay is good pay but other than being a manager the job is about as miserable as it gets it 21st century service jobs. 

Also they will lie to you saying you only get 26 hours a week. What they then do is schedule you for the most grueling 40hr week possible back to back with another. My marine cousin says it's exactly like boot camp. They want you to fail and no one is on your side. Expecting sympathy for even the more moderate medical issues is hopeless. Management DOES NOT CARE. They are however; thorough because they know they'd have a stack of lawsuits go through the roof from ex employees. 

- I essentially was fired for being overweight, my entire stint there veiled concerns about my weight were brought up almost daily and the exacerbated by the fact that I'm a moderate sweater. All other people in my position were attractive females. They worked maybe twice as slow but I took all the grief for it everytime. 
Costco is happy to make you fat with their industrial butter and cheesecake, just don't expect an overweight guy like me to load your basket. I'm obviously a sub human to the attractive females.

-none of the choir of managers/supervisors will agree on anything you do or are going to be sent to do. One time a ten min argument ensued on the managers walker talkies over whether an employee too his lunch or not. They are redundant and their seniority flaunting makes it hard not to flash off on them.

It's fun helping members. For the most part every customer is friendly. Health care benefits are good for part-time.,I literally get worked to the point of exhaustion!!! I am part of the bakery department. I clean all the mess the bakers do! And being a sanitation worker is hard because you have to do it alone and in a 5 hour time frame Talk about rushing this job seems to be a job for two people not one. You need to be fit and not have a life to do this job in Costco because believe me the next day you are just plain and simply tired. You are exposed to all the nasty left over of baked food that is almost like goop in your hand. You are not allowed to wear ear protection because if a customer needs you you won't be able to hear them and that's horrible because the vent fans are ridiculously loud and the metal against metal when washing the pans and what not is loud and piercing to your ears you get your clothes at some point completely wet! You get a 15 min break that you take because you are exhausted and dread it at the same time because it's precious time wasted. You are exposed to all types of chemicals and mold. Hours are not consistent they shift over and over again. It sucks that I have to write such a long con but for the pay its not worth working in the bakery dept or anywhere other than being a cashier assistant they will make you over work for every penny they pay you. And oh yeah most of the people writing positive reviews are prob long time workers who did not want to achieve something higher but stay doing the same job for more than a decade. I would not recommend this job for a person who is seeking a part time job while in college. If the sanitation job had another person then it would be great! But for one person it's back breaking and super exhausting.

Sometimes I feel 'guilty' if I take my entitled 15 minute breaks because it may mean I may not finish on time and face even more consequences...not right at all.
I hate having to 'put on a show' when the bigwigs come around and pretend everything is fine and dandy.

Procedures that change weekly with no rhyme or reason, that we usually can't carry out anyway due to the above.

Putting customer's items in carts and boxes makes you want to go crazy after so many hours. Customers get mad at you for little things, such as running out of boxes or not putting their items in boxes to their liking. Management often switched up my schedule without notice. One night I had checked my schedule  for the next day, It said I was scheduled to start at 8am, so I got there the next day at 8am. When I went to clock in, it wouldn't let me. Turns out they changed my start time to 1pm at the last minute! I had to wait around for 5 hours before starting my shift. I couldn't go home because I lived about an hour away. They have done this to me on several different occasions. Some employees can be rude, especially if you are new. They get mad and upset over little mistakes you make.

They practically want you to staple your lips into a permanent smile. I came from a competing retail chain with 4 years behind a till. They fired me 45 days into my 90 day probation primarily because they 'didn't think I smile enough' or 'had no expression' with members. I was never rude, snarky or offensive, built rapport where possible, pushed promotions as much as I could, did any other task as assigned without delay and tried to keep the lines moving at a steady clip, just not with a toothy grin. 
They gave me my 60 day review a mere two weeks after my 30 day. Hardly enough time to make noticeable progress in the direction they wanted. Of course, management doesn't know this and only saw two reviews with little/no improvement.
 Alas, I was well within the 90 day probation, so they could fire me on a whim, and I no longer work there.

Speaking of employees, there are many great people that you get to work with. I also hear that the benefits are great.","First off, you are put on probation for your first 3 months. If they don't like anything you do within this period, including calling in sick, it will get you released. They want you to work 5 days a week, regardless of how many hours you get. I think that's a bit ridiculous for part time work. Food court work is constant and demanding. You are constantly told to work faster and harder. Nothing is ever good enough. The department very rarely feels properly staffed and you very rarely get out at your scheduled time if you are closing, which is always your fault for not working hard enough."
9196,Costco Wholesale,Good,2015-06-20,4.0,,"Very affordable high quality health insurance benefits even for PT employees. Great for working parents who split up child care and need coverage. The key to succeeding at Costco is to work hard, have a good attitude and be nice to people. It's hard work and fasted paced, you have to be down for that to succeed.","At this warehouse you are required to work 5 days per week, even if you are PT at 24 or so hours. This means lots of 4-5 hour shifts rather than fewer 8 hour shifts which is tough for those who commute a long distance to work or have to cover day care."

-Promotions based more on personal feelings and less on actual experience or seniority 
-Middle Management will be professional one day then the next day they will be making inappropriate comments about staff and members
-Starting pay,  while decent,  isn't great.  There isn't a way to fast track promotions or pay...  You gotta stick it out.  If you are just t entering the work force this is acceptable but if you have experience, and no longer a young buck,  this may be an issue. 
-Inconsistent with rules regarding availability and request offs depending on the employee. 
-Extremely difficult to gain full-time status as postings for such position is few and far between. Often these positions will be filled by other full time employees who are switching departments. 
-Many employees will be used to fill positions that have a different pay structure without being compensated accordingly

For those interested they also give you a free membership. They are closed on Holidays also.,"Where to begin. Costco was a very confusing place to work and no one was ever on the same page. For a new employee who is searching for a stable company to be part of, it was tough not knowing what to believe on a day to day basis and sometimes getting yelled at because one manager asked for something another manager didn't want. Talking to management, especially the GM, was like talking to a person with special needs. You kinda just had to say, ""Ok."" Trying to find the logic never got me anywhere. 

I began to notice that most of their long term employees were stuck there. The pay was so great that they didn know where else to go. Most of them pretended to be happy but I could tell they wanted to quit. They kept trying to get me to cross train to be a cashier and I learned very quickly that it was because most of the cashiers wanted off of the front end and needed a replacement. I recently caught up with one of the ringers who moved to another department and had to take a $0.50 pay cut to do it. He is much happier.

I got two very positive reviews while working there. No complaints. I was flattered but had to wonder if they even paid much attention to me since there was very little constructive criticism which always come with reviews. 

Believe me when I say that I kept all of this to myself, worked hard, did anything I was asked, tried as many new things as I could, constantly asked for feedback...and they let me go.  I was crushed and even a bit jaded. What confused me is that no one told me I was being let go. I had to go find a manager and ask after everyone else had been told they had made the cut or not. Her response was, ""they should have told you during your review of you were being let go or not. I think you were one of the seasonal a we are not keeping."" 

""Gee, thanks.""

Also, they have a way of getting people to buy more items by moving things around in the store, so that when a customer is out looking for an item they have bought before, they might buy more aids if they have to go lookin elsewhere. It may increase sales but it's hard for a front end assistant when they have to run out to the floor to find something for a customer while they are at the check out line and can't find it because they moved everything the night before.

Anyway, the pay was great but I have to say I wasn't impressed, especially in the end. I like being in a work environment where I know what is going on. It's easier."

It was great to walk out of work and get some groceries out of the way.,"I felt the management in the bakery was a bit condescending and unappreciative at times.

Good work-life balance, even for positions with on-call duties.

Relocation package (as long as you live outside of WA).

Craig Jelinek seems like a good guy, who holds with Jim Sinegal's ideals.

Easy to coast, if that's your thing.

3% raises every year no matter how little you work.

Costco's business model seems to work as well or better overseas than in the US.  q.v. how well Costco is doing in Korea, Japan, etc...

Company is crazy profitable.  At least for now.","No telecommuting (but there is on-call work that you'll have to do from home).
Schedules are not flexible (e.g. 4x10, 9x80, flextime, etc).
Compensation for salaried IT staff is subpar, no bonuses unless you're a manager or above.
No raises for promotions unless you're making less than the minimum for your new position -- and even
then it's not automatic.
3% raises every year no matter how hard you work.
Architectural decisions in IT are made in a vacuum (mostly by people who have recently moved to IT from elsewhere within Costco... e.g. from real estate or the bakery)

At a recent Employee Engagement meeting where they discussed the 40% approval rating of management in IT, a VP recently discussed how 80% of respondents entered in a 'tell us the top thing that the CIO ought to change"" questionnaire was compensation, and #2 was telecommuting (which Costco does not allow).  

However, senior management chose to ignore the top two responses to the CIO and instead focus on #3, ""Communication"", citing the reason for not addressing compensation as ""We don''t want to hire Google- or Amazon-level employees.  We're a retail business.""

Additionally, nobody in IT understands Requirements-Gathering, and the 'solution architecture' group offers cookie-cutter, created-in-a-vacuum advice that anybody inoob n their 2nd year of IT at an IT-centric company could give in their sleep.

Most folks who actually belong in IT leave after 2-3 years, leaving IT full of people who prefer to coast, who don't really belong in IT, or recent hires from out-of-state who have to figure out how to pay off their relocation package or else wait 2 years until it expires and they can find something new.

Most IT folks that have been around more than 5 years have been ""Costco-ized"" and had their drive beaten out of them; the only thing they work hard at is making sure that they don't have to do any real work."

9321,Costco Wholesale,Great Job If You Don't Have a Degree; I Do.,2015-05-03,2.0,Membership/Marketing Supervisor,"- Great pay if you're hourly. I mean, to get ~50K a year without a degree and no union-backed blue collar job experience is nothing to whiff at. The opportunities are not the same for salaried employees however.

- Corporate and Regional are generally willing to help you. Notable exception being IT, but Tax, Audit, and Legal were always willing to help whenever we had a particular issue that was over our heads. 

- Quick advancement.. you can get a new position within months. Progression from regular -> sup -> assistant manager wouldn't take long if you pushed for it.","- This company is antiquarian/stingy. It's absolutely mind boggling how a company of this scale runs virtually every aspect of it's store on technology that was used when the company was founded. I could only imagine how much red tape had to be cut to get bottom tier computers with software that doesn't work.

- IT department is non-existent; non helpful. Good luck resolving an issue with anything as simple as wiring to setting up a new network in less than 36 hours. Seriously, what do they do in Issaquah? 

- If you're not an hourly employee, pay actually sucks. Considering how much regional and corporate shoves down their throats, they're really underpaid compared to market. Even regional and corporate employees are under-market. 

- Informal training… shadowing's fine when you have a willing participant. During my tenure, only one out of the four or five people I shadowed were of any use. The rest just didn't say more than 5 words to me while they did their work as if I was invisible. 

- Corporate Culture Koolaid… Look, I get it. You love your company. That shouldn't preclude criticism of obvious issues in our policies. People need to be flexible and adapt… This is clearly not evident in management's response to workplace issues.

9414,Costco Wholesale,Life trap for the complacent.,2015-03-14,2.0,Cashier Assistant (Front End Assistant),"Pays well compared to most retail jobs. If you become a cashier most places you can expect to make about 9 dollars an hour, at costco they start you at 11.50 and raise you 50 cents every year or so (based on hours worked). Benefits are great. 
 
It's downright impossible to be fired.

If you find a niche within the company, like a department that just really suits your fancy and makes you feel fulfilled then you will happily work here forever.","The thing about working here is that you will either chase after a supervisor position for about six-seven years and eventually work your way up to it and make a fair amount of money for a fair amount of responsibility OR you will find yourself making 15 an hour after a few years of working there, doing work that deserves 9 an hour and (assuming you don't want a front end supervising position) you will be one of thousands of people who can do your job and who cannot do anything else. If you want to work at costco for the rest of your life, this job is for you. If you think you are signing on for a ""college job"" good luck my friend. You will find yourself making more money than your skills deserve and unable to leave the business because of it. Try applying ANYWHERE after having only had retail experience for the last five years and asking your potential employer to give you 15 an hour for it.  No one will want you. Either you will have to take a huge pay cut to make a lateral move, OR you stay at costco for the rest of your life and watch as your dreams of having a career in whatever field you went to college for, whither and die. Most people who work at this company never leave. Not because it's such peaches and cream to be a cashier or a cart pusher, but because your work experience amounts to nothing to anyone but retailers and you're at the only place that is willing to buy your soul for it.   

I know hundreds of employees at Costco who have tried to leave for years and could not do it. I've even watched as employees who hated working there were nearly fired multiple times and while they were hanging in the wind waiting for the phone call that would tell them whether they still had a job or not, said that they actually kind of hoped that they would be let go so that they would have an excuse to move on to something else, even if it paid less. NO one gets fired there, It's practically impossible."

The benefits, paid days off, holidays, time and a half on Sundays..","Most managers or people who have positions of power are not mature enough to handle people, much less treat people with respect or common decency.  Will not start out as full time, there is a lot of favoritism, racism, and a very tattle-tail culture where people push blame on non-favorites rather than take responsibility for their own inadequacies.  People in upper management (some people) are very unhappy people, and they take their unhappiness out on everyone else.  You will never hear about how you succeed, you will hear about how you failed often though.. Also some managers treat you like a second class citizen, or assume you are lazy, stupid, or purposely negligent.  This gets very old, very quick."

9429,Costco Wholesale,Disappointed With Unprofessional Staff,2015-03-09,1.0,,So far I haven't met any yet. Although I am trying to give the benefit of the doubt that not everyone there will treat me the same way as I was treated today. I've heard good things about Costco as a workplace but it wasn't exemplified today by a management or HR type employee.,"I've never been employed or interviewed at Costco but just hear me out.... I spent an hour working on my resume and then another 30 minutes working on the application for Costco in Arvada, CO. I was told by a cashier that I should apply and that they may be hiring. She told me that after applying I should call and talk to someone about my application so that's what I did. When I called a woman answered and I told her I applied and she said to hang on and she put me on hold... OR SO SHE THOUGHT. I'm still on the phone listening to her talk to her coworker about something else that they were in the middle of. It sounded work related and since my call probably interrupted them, I was understanding. Then there was a lot of moving around like she was carrying the phone around or something I don't really know but after that she started mentioning how someone on the phone was asking if they're hiring and that some cashier told me to call after applying and ""are we hiring or not?"". Now before you call me a sensitive sally.... it was how she was saying it. VERY RUDELY as if I was a huge inconvenience to them and that it was dumb of the cashier to have told me that. It was all huff and puffy like ""ugghh what a drag this person wants to apply here"" and then when she answered the phone she said they weren't currently hiring and so I asked if I could leave my name and number for if anything opens up and she said no that they weren't hiring. I said thank you and she said goodbye and hung up. I just think that this whole finding jobs on the internet thing is hard enough and I spend so much time and energy practically working a part time job to call and get some snotty attitude like I'm not worth their time. This is not the first time I've seen or been on the receiving end of this kind of attitude and I'm sick of it. So to all the managers or whoever takes those calls... please try to think about how hard that person probably worked and how nervous they probably are to call and ask if you have something that would mean a lot to them. You've been there once too and if you haven't.... well then I'm sorry you don't know how to be polite to people."

9490,Costco Wholesale,Beware!!!!!,2015-02-11,1.0,Bakery Wrapper,Better come prepared to work hard!,I was hired on as a greeter/ cart puller. Went through orientation for that specific job. Then at the very end of the orientation they switch me to bakery wrapper. So they set me up for training with this guy who complained the whole time and didn't really know how to do his job correctly. Then on top of that the training was during one of the busiest weekends of the year. Therefore I had to learn quickly and on my own. Coworkers were rude and backstabbing waiting for you to slip up so they can tell on you. I told the supervisor I go to college fulltime and even though I was hired on part time 24 hours. they still had me working 39 hours a week. The turnover back there was crazy. Workers wouldn't last a week because of management.  90% of the time I was cleaning the bakery and 10% was wrapping.  Worst job experience I've ever had by far!

9526,Costco Wholesale,Very old-fashioned seniority based IT department,2015-01-28,2.0,Applications Developer,"My comments reflect only my experience in Costco's IT department.

- for some teams/people, flexible hours and work/life balance (40 hour work week)
- job security, Costco has not ever laid people off in the home office
- you work at one of the most stable, generous retailers in the world
- the medical benefits are cheap and generous","My comments reflect only my experience in Costco's IT department.

- seniority based culture rather than a meritocracy, similar to working in a union
- on some teams, some people are overworked while others leave early all the time and do little work
- only 2 weeks vacation to start until 5 years, non-negotiable
- no stock options or bonuses for IT employees
- salaries and raises are lower than average, we lost many potential good hires to that
- very low 401k match and few perks until more seniority is reached
- full telecommuting schedules are not permitted and it is generally frowned upon even on an ad hoc basis
- very slow, bureaucratic environment
- 10k maximum relocation allowance for non-management employees which might be tough for bigger moves/families
- there are a lot of old technology (AS/400 and RPG) IT employees who know nothing else and are modern technology illiterate
- there are a lot of people who started in warehouses who are now in IT and have little/no formal IT training or outside experience
- lots of bad decisions about software packages and putting everything in the cloud
- lots of projects languish past their due date or are cancelled and/or restarted halfway through
- if the warehouse workers knew about the waste going on in the home office they would riot, since they work hard
- lots of managers who should not be in leadership positions
- senior employees/management are very resistant to change
- the executive management is not rallying the troops and morale is very low in most groups"

Plus, the company maintains a set of ethical standards I can endorse,  so I do not feel ashamed to work in retail.","You'll still face many of the same challenges here that you do in any other retail position: entitled customers, the occasional co-worker who gets under your skin, and even a middle manager or supervisor who think they can get away with not pulling their weight. The internal computer system they use (for ordering and entering data) is also somewhat out-moded, and it would improve workflow greatly if they got this up to speed in all departments. It would also help their members if they did some beta testing on their websites and phone prompts, because people are always calling us with confusion about who to call for what they need within the store or online."

I got my exercise in everyday by pushing carts and running around the warehouse by doing hot and cold go-backs.","I was told to smile more when I thought I was already smiling. Plus, they want you to stay/look busy and not stand around if there was a problem at check-out or a member was writing a check by organizing boxes underneath register  even if they're already organized. It seemed like a waste of energy. Also, I wish I had more opportunity to stock heavier items after close such as beer, juice, etc. Management shouldn't take an employee's physical side and turn them down to do stocking instead of assigning them to clean underneath registers and break room."

Very friendly atmosphere among the members and workers. Great opportunities for promotion.,Middle-management has a problem consistently communicating their wants and concerns. There is a certain amount of rudeness (which is forbidden according to the employee handbook) certain supervisors and managers have towards the lower echelon. A few managers also like to throw other people under the bus instead of taking responsibility.

9643,Costco Wholesale,customer service,2014-11-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I worked for Costco in Seattle and they were very accommodating with my schedule,Not to many personal growth opportunities
9644,Costco Wholesale,"Some goods, some bads. Difficult to recommend to individuals looking for a long term, rewarding career. Good for someone who just wants to work, not necessarily excel.",2014-11-28,1.0,Cashier,"Costco's benefits are very good, largely because they subsidize the cost to employee greatly. A full time individual can get full benefits for their entire family for under $75 per month, which is undoubtedly fabulous. The pay is generally good for what you do.","Sadly this is where the list gets long. 

I should preface that these observations apply to the Pacific Northwest, USA stores. I have heard much better things from friends in the southeastern USA stores.

While the pay is generally good, the way an employee's wage is decided has very little to do with overall skill. The deciding factor for a person's wage is the total number of hours worked. In short you could have two individuals where one's work is sufficient, but not excellent and a second whose work is superior and the wage earned doesn't reflect this difference in quality. If you are a go getter, it's very disheartening. 

I had a manager explain it to me this way. An employee who has been with the company for a long time will be paid better, because we assume they can do the job better than a newer employee. 

When you take into account how hard it is to get let go once you get past a year of employment there is very little incentive for a longer term employee to do excellent work, because the pay is the same regardless. Further the average employee is dis-incentivized to do good work, because hardly anyone leaves and thus there is very little upward mobility (at the warehouse level, I can't speak for corporate or regional headquarters).

Like with any job, there are good and bad managers. Regardless the corporate culture at Costco has very little to do with the improvement of the employee, rather it is mostly about appeasing the manager to whom you work for. The attitude of 'CYA' is the most prevalent amongst managers and supervisors. In many cases the job is not working collectively to improve quality and performance, but instead 'do as the boss says.'

This attitude is most apparent at the time of a corporate walk. Most mangers make a strong push to  clean and set up the store to make it as pretty as possible for the walk. This doesn't accurately reflect the true operation of the store in question, from the viewpoint of an auditor you're just putting lipstick on the pig. Again this is disheartening if you're a go getter, because it's not about any constant improvement, just make it look good for the boss. 

As a result of this attitude, many of the managers spend very little time investing in their employees. The net effect is a number of undertrained individuals, or individuals who would like to receive training that never actually get the opportunity. This is further compounded by the fact that most employees never leave (because of the wage and benefits) As a result, the opportunities likely never come to fruition. 

In the event that an opportunity arises, because of the culture's emphasis on seniority, it is very difficult for a newer employee to move up. I can speak to this personally because while I am qualified and very skilled, (college graduate with strategic management experience) I was passed up twice for individuals with much more seniority. Again, I emphasize, if you are a go getter/goal oriented, this is very disheartening. 

The main reason behind why individuals never leave Costco is largely correlated to the overall earning potential at other retail establishments. It's nearly impossible to match the wages/benefits package at another retailer. In particular if you are not college educated, from an economic perspective you're earning potential is more limited, and as a result Costco's overall package is very appealing. Within the culture there isn't a large incentive placed on further education, the net result is that a degree in the realm of a Costco warehouse isn't very valuable. 

In short order if you're an individual who is goal oriented, motivated by excellence and a strategic thinker, Costco is not a fitting long term choice. If you're looking for a stable job and just want to go to work and come home, Costco is right for you."

Good bonus (once you manage to reach top rate)","Low staff morale.
Lack of training.
Blatant favouritism.

When I first came to costco (nearly 4 years ago now) The company was about putting customers first, keeping staff happy and making a profit (it is a business after all)
But since the new CEO took over I have noticed a change that is making the job become unbearable. It is all about profit, profit, PROFIT. 

Staff do not matter whatsoever.
I now see managers becoming bullies, no matter how hard you work it's never good enough.You are made to feel worthless and sometimes stupid. 
Incompetent people being made supervisors (but if you're pretty it doesn't matter) 
Managers that are getting away with murder, but there are no consequences for them.
High levels of favouritism.

I now feel sorry for people on top rate, as they must wake up everyday thinking will I be moved today.
I once aimed to become a supervisor, but I was not willing to be the ""fall guy"" or to cover peoples backs when they have made mistakes. I was also not willing to flirt or do more to get ahead (as a lot of people have)
I see people working so hard for costco, going above and beyond, but they don't even get a thank you. But the moment you make a slight mistake, they are all over you.
In my department now, 80% of people want to leave. But it is hard when no job at that skill level will pay the same rate.
I used to go in looking forward to the working day, now on my days off I dread going in. And once I'm there I can't wait to leave."

9667,Costco Wholesale,"Diverse high schoolers with single mother and fathers working for better, but is Costco?",2014-11-13,3.0,,"- The average income starts at $11.50 for anyone new (even the janitors) and rises with time and opportunity. A quarter the work for cashiers compared to cart pushers and literally a quarter added to the pay. This continues up the ladder until it's nearly getting paid for smiling (of course as it get higher chances get slimmer but that's good considering you only need a high school diploma to apply).

- Everyone who is there is encouraged to smile and be approachable and most do. Except those who are unable to be easily terminated for deep integration reasons semming around policy and political reasons. (the untouchables)

- Job opportunities ebb and flow yearlong in this work. There is a seasonal hire and ongoing regular internal posting of openings. And the process is straightforward as possible.

- Meet many new faces and facets of life in a day's work.","- It's a tough start for a beaten man. 

Since the start income is comparably higher than other competitors in the retail industry, the work itself, management practice and politics justify required 'excellent member service' from day one until your 90th day on the job. (Read: Slaves need to appear happy and ready while on the clock, neither sad nor confused.)**

** What being ready looks like is well dressed, healthy, and pleasing to the member and manger. Being pleasing is possible to do without money, the others not so much, and this makes a significant impact on part-time hires starting out with bills and little educational adjustment. They can barely afford rent and groceries, let alone come to work looking good enough to serve someone before the next month's bills are stacked at the neck. And considering most of the workforce is made up of diploma seeking high schoolers and single fathers and mothers with the possibility of child support payments likely, it can be hard to watch people overwork themselves for literal bare means to do it again tomorrow.

We haven't even gotten into the rising work force of college educated graduates who choose Costco and have to justify working at janitor or cart pusher level before anything else because the hire policies don't even account for upcoming differences in the current norm of classic hires (high schoolers, mom, and pop) with their different life and work experience. This may be a opportunity or complete loss depending on how Costco treats the issue of college educated new hires at the policy level.

- Manners be damned for the low and damned.

No joke on the happy rich slaves expectations. There is basically a public high school uniform dress code policy in place for everyone and it goes from head to foot (read: you choose your outfit and learn on the go). And I think it creates key consistency in needed areas that this matters like deli and foods, but can be just ridiculous to the people who are work-first looks-second. This job is somehow about working-looks.

- In many ways this job is more about politics than hard work and service. 

The fee paying members are expectingdly uppity and so they like to have their way (even if it only makes sense in the moment). So be ready to do things sometimes more than one way. And management will oftentimes instinctly side with member greed because customer service doesn't like to say 'no'. No surprises here folks."

Good Product Lines from Top Manufacturers: Phonak, Resound, Rexton (Siemens), Bernafon (Oticon)
Top end audiometers/testing equipment
If you are married/have kids, Benefits are pretty good, very cheap top coverage healthcare
Relaxed Dress code - Polo shirt, jeans, running shoes
Costco already has good reputation in retail","- Way too much ambient noise in sound booth from people walking, alarms, forklifts, children yelling, (embarrassing)
- Sound booth not isolated from audiometer, Patients can hear mouse clicks and any small sounds
- Entire department exposed, no roof, no privacy for patients or the hearing specialist, Patients constantly walk up without appointments, there is never a secretary full time..., No lobby/hallway for patients 
- Noahlink/Audiometer is embedded into Sycle.net CRM, always crashes when you need it to work the most, GET BETTER SERVERS TO HANDLE THE BANDWIDTH.....its not that hard, Costco just loves to be cheap
- Constantly changing schedules, worked many late evenings on weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays with no tests or appointments
- WAY TOO MANY PRODUCTS - order forms, receivers, domes, aids, remotes, bluetooth kits, vender reps times a million models times 4 manufacturers 
- No different than anywhere in retail, management treats and yells at you like any cashier or forklift operator that can be trained in 2 weeks....
- No standardized sales presentation
- Too much testing protocol, leave it alone, they change it every month...
- Costco lets people return past the 90 day period any time a customer complains (I had a PT return aids that were 4 years old.......full refund)
- Warehouse Managers are absolute idiots, they have little to no training on hearing aids, let alone the hearing aids sales process, they are all over you for nothing, then when you need them they are nowhere to be found
- Costco acts like they are above retail, besides having decent pay, they are nothing special, dont drink the costco koolaid...
- I would only recommend costco if you are married/have kids and need the benefits, otherwise there any many better ways to make more money and be actually rewarded for selling hearing aids
- Member service ....they can treat you like garbage, this should not be allowed
- Little to no incentive to sell more hearing aids then you need to...you wont be rewarded either way"

9696,Costco Wholesale,Good benefits but hard work and politics.,2014-10-20,3.0,Night Merchandiser,"Flexible hours, good starting pay ($11.50/ hr as of 2014), great affordable benefits after 6 month intro period (PPO health, dental, 401k matched by company and life insurance if interested), free executive membership which includes 2% cash back on things you buy at Costco (excluding gas). Pay is increased at set intervals based on hours worked, which you can track on the employee website. Part-timers are guaranteed 24 hours per week. Full-timers get 40 hours per week. Sundays pay time and a half (except at some unionized locations). Paid holidays. Paid vacation and paid sick/ personal leave- One week each after first year. Two weeks after two years, and so on, up to four weeks. New openings in all departments are posted in the break room for all employees to apply for if they wish. I really appreciate the fact that all employees wear a name badge with their first name; from part-time seasonal employees, to the vice-president coming to visit the warehouse.","On your feet all day, running around without wonderful air conditioning, They promote based on seniority, not necessarily merit. You have to deal with less-competent leaders being promoted to supervisors/ managers. If your manager is one of the good ones though, the job is much more tolerable. Upper management would rather cut hours to save on payroll than have enough employees to run the warehouse properly, which makes more work and lots more stress for employees. Although there are opportunities to move around in the warehouse, there is little room to move up. If there is a position you would like, you have to get on that supervisor's good side. Costco's main priority is keeping members happy, so you have to deal with a LOT of unpleasant and rude people, and help them with a smile. They are very strict with clocking in and out. The computer will not let you clock in a second early. They do allow 3 minutes leeway after your scheduled start, but at the fourth minute you are considered tardy. This includes your half hour lunch break. They don't usually just give people full-time status, it mostly comes about as an accident (working FT hours for a certain number of weeks switches you to full-time permanently) or by applying for one of the limited FT positions. Additionally, if a FT employee ends up not working enough hours in a certain number of consecutive weeks, they will loose their FT status and only receive 24 hours/ week."
9697,Costco Wholesale,"Great Benefits, Terrible Management.",2014-10-20,3.0,PM Stocker,"There are a lot of good things about working at Costco. Firstly, the benefits are amazing. The medical/dental/vision plans are offered to everyone (even to part-time employees working 24 hours a week) and are fairly cheap. You get paid sick leave, up to 6 weeks of vacation (I believe) and can make around 40k~ wrapping hot dogs in a stuffy food court. Epic.","It's not all roses, sadly. Management is probably the biggest downside to working at Costco. Mileage may vary significantly, as each warehouse carries its own culture and community, but the Costco I was exposed to sucked. Hard. Most managers are reasonably nice people who've been worked to the bone by the overbearing Warehouse Manager. The Warehouse Manager cares about one thing: achieving bonuses. Bonuses for cutting payroll, for eliminating shrink, reducing costs, etc. During my tenure I watched employee morale plumb the depths as all the good managers escaped the overlord and the remaining managers went insane from having to come in at 2AM every few weeks to move steel.

Additionally the work is pretty much mind-numbing. The money is good but unless you REALLY discussing the weather with strangers all day I can't imagine finding this type of work fulfilling."

You get full time hours for part time work. They always let me stay extra hours.,"Management communication is terrible. The managers constantly fight with each other in front of lower enlisted.  They have no respect for each other. And fully take out there own bad leadership on the people below them. I have worked here almost a year,  It has not got better.  Positive comments toward employees like ""Good Job"" or ""Keep up the awesome work"" type comments are unheard of. If you don't stick up for yourself you will get walked all over as I have,  until I raised my voice at management which I would never do at any other job. But at this place its acceptable to do that. I have worked at five different warehouse type jobs to make extra cash in between careers. And this place for sure is not worth the struggle for 12$ an hour. Its like full physically demanding slave labor with no real mental reward. We have been short on equipment like pallet jacks and little things that keep the flow going and they won't spend the money to get new stuff even though they pull in massive amounts of cash at the Yonkers location. Its Packed everyday with people. Much behind the scenes work is needed and the upper leadership knows it but won't spend money to fix it. You can see it on emoyees faces that they are not happy. Not hard to tell."

I was a costco fan for a while prior to working here, and afterwards I have even more respect for the company. Costco truly knows how to take care of their employees and therefore it trickles down to the way their employees treat their members. They understand the idea that if the people who work for the company are happy, then the members are well taken care of. I also think this was the best choice I could have made for a part time college job. I had medical benefits and a 401k that they matched. At 19, I really didn't understand the importance of that, but looking back I really appreciate that. They also worked with my school schedule to make sure that it didn't conflict too much. Lastly, Costco hires really great people, and I have some of my closest friends that I met when I worked there during college.","The only con would be the crazy hours that I worked, however that was mainly due to the fact that I had class.

They say that they can't fire you unless you don't show up ever or you steal.   Raises based on hours worked.  Time and a half pay on Sundays.  Major holidays off paid.","These managers are never happy, it is never enough for them... you would think the 60k +bonus (just to start; at the lowest management position almost every single manager makes much, much more than that, GMs make 160k +), you would just think making all that money would help you not be jerk.  Not true.  These guys [and one or two gals] take the cake for bad management.  The very most they will ever work is 55 hrs. a week (which happens never) and they get a TON of paid vacation time.  In the non-union shops it's everyone for themselves, there is no sense of worker solidarity so management continues to mistreat employees as far as they can get away with it. They're never happy. They're always about micromanaging and pressuring you to go home early to save on payroll because they are salary and their bonus' depend on it.  When you mention the rules to management about minimum hours you are guaranteed they get real angry, real quick and you can kiss opportunities goodbye. In fact, they claim to have an ""Open Door policy"" which is a joke.  You are screwed if you bring any kind of complaint against management to a higher-up, kiss your opportunities to advance goodbye.  Management is condescending, they think they are superior humans who deserve to be where they are because of their hard work or smarts or whatever lies they tell themselves.  The truth is one gets into management at Costco Wholesale through the buddy system.  Break out the kneepads if you want to move up.  Let's see, they're also terrible about scheduling, calling in sick, pretty much everything so it creates an 'I don't really care'' attitude among employees who will get away with the most that they can get away with.  Hourlys all know the rules and how far they bend and will stretch them.  Management deserves it.  They got what they gave.  I heard a floor manager talking about how the Union shops were bad because he can't get away with riding workers and racist/sexist comments.   ""They say that they can't fire you unless you don't show up ever or you steal.""  It's for the most part, true, but every day they try to get you to fire yourself.  Management especially rides the ones that have been there longer because you get pay raises by the hours you work and it cuts into their labor costs.  After you've worked there about a year, they want to fire you more and more every year to keep the door revolving."

In addition I like how we don't have to stay any later than 8:30pm on weekends and we're closed on major holidays. For someone like me who takes major holidays serious, it's great knowing that I don't have to work on Thanksgiving. On top of having holidays off, Costco is very flexible when it comes to accommodating school schedules for student employees. And if you go to certain trade schools Costco will also help pay your tuition. Furthermore, I'm fortunate to have coworkers that make the work environment fun. Last, it's nice that employees get a free Executive membership after completing their 90-day probation period.","Supervisors need to get on the same page as one another, as do managers. There have been many times when I have been told to do a task one way just to get lectured by a different manager or supervisor and told to do it a different way.

9774,Costco Wholesale,Costco wholesale UK management shambles,2014-09-04,2.0,Various Roles,Good pay for unskilled workers. Annual optical voucher. Good bonus,"Don't get rota until week before. Expected to be available 4am to10pm. The biggest issue at Costco is the management. I worked for Costco for 15 years and saw the quality of the store managers and head office managers slowly decline. Started off with a good manager who realised that the staff made the store and ended up with a manager who wouldn't even speak to some staff. I noticed a culture of favouritism, if your face fit you were ok. The last manager I had at Leeds actively sought to dismiss staff on a higher wage and employ someone new to save payroll. He deliberately set out to make life difficult for staff who challenged him on his dubious decisions. This was rife and led to some very suspicious interpretations of the Costco handbook. With regards to the handbook, most managers treat this as a weapon to be used against staff and it is not worth the paper it is printed on. Managers routinely don't follow it if it isn't in their interests and interpret it as they see fit to suit themselves.

Head office staff are not much better. The senior management will back up a store manager regardless of the situation. They also believe that they are right, to the point where they will ignore the law! I was due in to a disciplinary meeting regarding sickness and requested it be rescheduled due to health. This was flatly denied and I was told the meeting would go ahead if I was there or not. This is in direct contravention of employment law as published by Acas. When I pointed this out to the HR, training and development manager at head office. He stated that this wasn't covered in the handbook and therefore didn't apply! He then backed up the managers statement and added that he was coming up the meeting from Watford and didn't want the hassle of rearranging. 

There are a lot of problems with the management, who don't follow all the rules and they know it. I witnessed a senior manager arguing with a member of staff. The staff member walked off and the manager tried to run him over with a forklift truck! When a complaint was made to the store manager, he pulled the staff member to one side and told him that if he continued with this complaint, the store manager would personally see to it that 'his career would be over'! I was also warned off giving any witness statement if asked for one. 'We will not accept a witness statement that doesn't say you saw nothing'. That's not me paraphrasing! These are direct quotes that I witnessed.

A motivational speech by the admin director that I heard sums up senior managements feelings and opinions of hourly staff. 'If you aren't happy here or don't like the way the business is run, that's fine. Please feel free to look elsewhere. But bear in mind Costco pay the best and you won't get anything like the wage you get now at our competitors.' - Nice!!!

If your face fits, great. If you hourly wage is maxed out, watch yourself. If you don't want to become a target, keep your head down and your mouth shut. Do not question or challenge store management, otherwise that will be your card marked for your whole time there. Don't bother escalating to head office as they will ALWAYS back up the manager. Do seek advice if you are in a disciplinary situation as Costco UK (rather arrogantly) do not adhere to UK employment law. They believe the handbook supersedes the law!"

Now who wouldn't want to work here. Awesome company,At times it can get stressful especially the beginning of each month due to EBT (food stamps).

To add to that, whenever you do see them outside of work, at least they show that can be well meaning people who make a living.","There is a ton of politics played in the job. Getting a demotion is easier than getting a promotion. If you are not a favorite and want to leave a department, a manager can use something against you to prevent you from leaving. Regardless what duties you have here unless you work in administration,  everybody out there is just one injury from not doing what they can do again.

Co-workers are very willing to assist you with any questions you have. Very flexible with school schedules.","The initial training is very broad and doesn't cover anything specific. It is obvious that the supervisors, in the front end at least, have favorites and do special favors for them (sending them home early and extra breaks). The location manager, at my location, makes false promises. For example, he said that the cart crew would be rotated ever two hours, especially during the summer months; we work eight hours without any rotations. I've received most of my job specific training from my coworkers, not my managers. Supervisors keep promising to train me on the register, but have yet to do so."

You cannot beat the compensation package considering the retail industry.  You get to interact with members and provide that exceptional member service that Costco prides itself on.  My leadership team is phenomenal -- I am impressed with their dedication/leadership/expertise.

Advice for potential team members:  It is difficult to be apart of the Costco team but if you get an opportunity:

-Agreeable and reliable employees get taken advantage of with scheduling and time off requests;  apparently you have to make a big stink to get what you want
-Rampant disability and FMLA abuse seems to be incredibly hard to punish, so there are lots of issues with bad coworkers who are  seemingly untouchable. Causes unfair increase in personal workloads leading to very poor morale
-No sitting makes you tired at the end of the day and hard floors can be hard on the body
-Like any pharmacy, dealing with drug seekers and addicts can be a drag
-Isolated nature of pharmacy means not very much camaraderie with other employees
-Most management has no concept of what pharmacy does and has to put up with

My manager in deli is great hardworking person but he seems to be one of the exception's.,"I have worked in the deli and the front end there is alot of physical work which i dont mind but we are trained to work as fast as we can to get work done regardless of employees physical safety. there is plenty of favoritism and upper management is cold and unfriendly with little professional training or people skills, often times seems management cares more about there next promotion and not at all for employees that keep the company running. Getting full time is extremely difficult."

9901,Costco Wholesale,7 year employee,2014-06-05,5.0,Meat Cutter,biggest pro is advancement opportunties.  i've learned a lot in my time here and have moved up considerably.  once you're topped out you make a very comfortable salary,nepitism plays a huge part in most warehouses.  whether or not you move up can unfortunately be decided by how much your managers like you.

9904,Costco Wholesale,9 years and still growing?,2014-05-31,3.0,Front End Cashier,Since being a full time employee for over the 5 year mark I recieve two annual bonuses. I also cant complain about the health & dental benefits we receive. Friendships develop so fast and easy,This is a very mental and physical job. It isnt for everbody. Working weekends and nights at first is a must unless your in morning merch or bakery. Favoritism plays a factor. it's almost who you know not what can you do. When a posting goes up for a position 9 out of 10 times they already know who is going to get it. Front End is by far the worst position at Costco. the most physical demanding and you deal with all sorts of attitudes
9905,Costco Wholesale,Excellent career with Costco,2014-05-31,5.0,Front End Manager,"Excellent benefits and wages. Generally speaking, it is a great atmosphere to work in.

We have had both types and I'm glad to say that i love the gm we have now"
9908,Costco Wholesale,Costco take care of employees,2014-05-29,4.0,Front End Supervisor,"Overall, Costco is an excellent company to work for. The offer great pay and benefits and there promotional opportunities come often. The hours can conflict with life depending on your position. Management can be cut-throat but then again Costco demands the best.",The biggest con is having to work weekends and not being able to take time off during the holidays. Other cons include business hours and even finding parking. The culture varies among department. Front end has a very diverse culture while the morning crew is a testosterone driven macho show.
9909,Costco Wholesale,An absolutely amazing place to work with great career opportunities.,2014-05-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Job security is a definite plus.  Where some companies laid off their employees during the recession, Costco did lay off one.  The benefits are also great (health care, 401k, AMEX, compensation, work/life).  The ability and opportunity to move up in the company is what I love the most.  Costco allows you to create a career path and will help you achieve your goals through training and mentorship. Hiring up from within is one of Costco definite perks.","Pay at the Warehouse locations is well above average in retail.  Pay at the corporate office (compared to other equivalent jobs) is fair, but only average for the new generation of employees."

Hours are flexible and range from 4am to 11pm.,"As in any retail business, hard to get any vacation around holidays, before or after. Senority is weighted heavy when  seeking promotion within.

Coworkers are nice. 
The work is decent. 
Guaranteed 25 hours a week as part time.","Favouritism, especially shown in terms of promotions and requesting time off. 
They want your only priority to be working there, which is challenging as a college student. 
The work can be frustrating, and the supervisors and managers don't really listen to what you have to say. 
If you request to only work the minimum hours (25 per week), they don't honor that. 
If the management has a problem with how you are doing your job, they don't talk to you about it, but instead will at things t i other employees about tell problem."

They usually promote from within. When you're on top of your game, management LOVES you!!!","The promotion is based on seniority, not performance. Someone hired one day before you, will get the promotion! It doesn't matter if you're better qualified for the position. Don't get seriously ill either. They'll expect you to be good as new when you return. If you're not, WATCH OUT!!! The management that once loved you, will quickly turn on you. There's entirely too much favoritism. It's not beyond a supervisor or manager to harass and single you out. It's sad that a company with such a good reputation, would resort to such tactics! They'll easily forget everything positive you've done, and the ""Appreciation Awards"" you've received."

But all in all although the work is tough and labor intensive (front end) the pay off is truly a reason to stay. Also at our costco the opportunities for advancement are always available because the ever growing company is always promoting from within. Almost forgot a big perk on Sundays is time and a half pay.,"Wagons wagons & more wagons. Don't expect to advance from the bottom without putting in an 1hr or more everyday pushing wagons. Men, woman young and old everybody has to do it and it sucks (unless if you've advanced to cashier then you get a free pass). Another thing with costco is people of all ages work there some have made it their career which is fine but if your a newbie on the floor and they bounce you assisting every cashier on the block chances are your gonna get stuck with a few who enjoy whipping items your way and making your job 100x harder cause like I said there just waiting to turn 65 and get out. And lastly the labor, having to transfer a wagon filled to its peak with dog food and 50lb rice bags from one cart to another for loss prevention measures can and has been re reason for many injured on the job."

I paid 20 bucks a month for a $500 deductible with no co-pay.  The hourly compensation is more than fair, and I got the sense very quickly that management was eyeing the most competent workers for advancement.","The only true frustration I had at Costco was when the Floor Manager would contradict the instructions I received from my Section Manager.

Guaranteed at least 24 hours as part time, and 40 for full time. It's a really great company, Costco really takes care of its employees. It's an especially great job to have in college. I go to school full time and working evenings and weekends works perfectly for my schedule, now that I am only scheduled 4 nights a week. The pay is also the best in the retail industry. I work at the membership desk and as a refund cashier, it is a really easy and laid-back job, probably the best department to work in at Costco. Also, it's a pretty laid-back environment, even when it's busy, just depending on the management.","On the job training only. This is bad because everyone who trains you will tell you something different, and it's hard to know the correct way to do things if you are never officially trained by management. This was especially hard at the membership desk, where there are so many rules you could be breaking, and so many processes that you have to know and could screw up really badly if you aren't trained right. Most departments schedule part-time employees 5 days a week, even if they are only working 24 hours. The food court is the worst job you will ever have at Costco. Seniority is everything at Costco. Don't expect to move up unless you've been there at least 5 years. Also, every job at Costco is really repetitive and mundane, but that just comes with the territory of the industry. They compensate you well, which makes it hard to leave, even if upward mobility is slow and even if the job is simple and unfulfilling."

Also, the vast majority of it's employees have given up whatever career ambition they had to remain at Costco for the rest of their life.

10004,Costco Wholesale,Employment review,2014-03-19,1.0,Membership Sales,This by far is one of the worst companies that I have ever been employed by.,"When I went in for my interviews with the front end manager and the asst. general manger ,I was upfront and honest about me going back to school. I told them that I would have an open availability until January, but once school started my availability would change and that once I started my clinical rotations that it would change again. I was told that would not be a problem, and it wasn't until I started my rotations. I immediately told my manager what my availability change to, and again he stated that would not be a problem. The next day while I was in class, I received two phone calls from my manager, and I responded with a text that I was in class, and that I would call him back when I was done with my exam. My manager then responded back telling me that I needed to bring in a copy of school schedule, along with my clinical rotation schedule. I responded back that I didn't understand why this was a problem since he already had a copy of my school schedule, and that I scheduled my clinical rotation around when our new store was at it slowest. The next night when I reported for my shift, I was called to the office by my manager to sit down and talk with him and the asst. general manager about my job at Costco. They started off by telling me that they just didn't know if they were going to be able to accommodate my new availability, and I stated to them that I was upfront with them from the beginning, that I did everything to make it to where I could work nights and have an open availability on the weekends , and that I had been in upper management for over nine years with another retailer, and that what they were doing was wrong. They then came back stating that they could work with my schedule. Well I thought that was the end and everything else should go relatively smooth, was I wrong. I have been harassed by the head H.R person, and written up four times within  a four month time frame. I have been written up once for talking to another employee, I have been written up once for when I clocked out three minutes past my scheduled time and I even asked a supervisor to call my manager to get help down to the membership desk so that way I didn't go over. I also got written up for not taking my lunch within the four hour time frame, and when I tried to explain to them that I was running back and forth from the exit door, to the front end to help assist the cashiers, and back to the membership desk to help cover everyone else's breaks and lunches and that I didn't think about taking my lunch until we slowed down. I was told that it is the employees responsibility to take their lunch, and not the managers. Well if that's the case then why did the supervisors use me to cover everyone else's breaks, but not help cover mine? It seems to me that this company is just like another corporation they take care of the people that they like and harass the ones that they dont, just to get them to quit."

I was told repeatedly that this was a great company to work for and, in the fact that the pay and benefits are great, they were true. That's about where things end though. This location was/is managed TERRIBLY. Managers would constantly contradict each other causing issues with lower level employees. My dad always told me when I was younger, ""Too many chiefs, mot enough Indians"" and never has this stood truer. 

Advancement
It seemed like the only way to advance would be if you were willing to do something you knew nothing about for the sole purpose of ""learning more about the business."" So the fact that the former tire center manager is now the bakery manager and knows nothing about baking literally means nothing. If you have the hours in, don't get in trouble, and apply, you pretty much get promoted at some point."

Competitive pay for a retailer, but retail is also a low wage job class.","One word… Politics. Do not even think of moving up in this warehouse unless you want to play politics.  You can be a top performer, never call off, good attitude and unless you're in tight with some staff level management forget a promotion. 

I've been told college degrees do NOT matter. The only thing that matters is previous retail experience. Had this manager actually read my resume they would have seen previous retail experience. When confronted with this revelation I was met with a blank stare.

There is no consistency to job instruction because the real problems are never solved and everything decision is based on opinion.  Management wants to flip flop instructions every 6 months probably because otherwise they are irrelevant employees. 

There are too many cooks in the kitchen. A forklift driver will give a set of instructions, half hour later the supervisor changes them, half hour later department manager changes them, a day later a staff level manager changes them, a week later the GM changes them.  

Favoritism is a huge problem with management, and they aren't afraid to show it. Some employees are harassed the moment they finish a task to find another BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE CLOCK, while other employees will leave for lunch and not punch out till they get their food back to the break room.

Everyone is made to feel like they are replaceable.  Can someone please explain to the managers that none of them are IVY league grads, and the manager down at Walmart could do just as good of a job.  

The only thing the GM is worried about is their bonus. We are constantly short handed to conserve payroll.  At least the previous GM was getting his hands dirty with everyone else when times got tough. Also short handing crews forces people to hurry, creating more accidents, more injuries, more call offs, and more workplace resentment. 

The Costco handbook states you must be given 24 hours notice before your schedule can be changed, but if you deny to stay extra hours, 10 minutes before you leave, management will hold it against you. Sorry some people have kids and can't get a babysitter with 10 minutes notice."

Thinking outside the box does not exist here. Creative types take note. The next day will be just like today. The corporate philosophy is hypocritical. Member service is supposedly a priority but long lines and lack of employees assistance is not uncommon. Expect drama, politics, nepotism, and many employees in relationships with other employees.

-Unbeatable pay/benefits when you take into consideration how straight forward and brainless the work is.
-Management is pretty consistent about your breaks in making sure you get them on time (30min lunch, and two 15's if you're working 8 hours)
-No uniform and dress code is pretty laid back.
-Free membership
-""Never a dull moment"" This is a double edged sword though.
-Most cashiers are friendly, and even if they aren't friendly, the job is so fast paced that you don't have too much interaction with them anyway.
-You get the opportunity to work in a lot of different areas and departments. One minute you could be assisting a cashier, next you could be folding clothes, next you could be pushing carts. Again, it's a double edged sword.
-It's nice to actually see supervisors ""get their hands dirty"" and help out sometimes.","Cons:
-Customer service based job so, obviously, you deal with some rude people. That's pretty par for the course though in retail.
-Front End is CONSTANTLY under a microscope from upper management and it can be nerve racking.
-Hours fluctuate WIDELY week by week and you don't get many to begin with. It's not really a ""living wage"" if you don't schedule your employees any hours.
-Since hours fluctuate so often and management REFUSES to work around another job, you can kiss the option of a second job goodbye.
-It feels like upper management just ""wings it"" everyday and just play's everything by ear, so naturally that causes a lot of disorganization and can be very stressful when plans are constantly changing.
- How your day goes is decided HEAVILY on who your cashier (partner for the day) is, what mood they are in, and if they're willing to work as a team with you.
-Managers expect you to learn something after being quickly shown once. Which can be frustrating if you're seasonal (like myself) because you don't work often and are taught new things everyday.

10092,Costco Wholesale,A mostly positive place to work,2014-01-18,4.0,IT Analyst,"This has been a very supportive environment at a company that consistently gets great reviews by customers and investors.  The corporate offices are clean, well maintained and of course, have a warehouse right across the street to browse when your work is caught up or you just need to do some quick shopping.

Every need I've had for my workspace has been honored with few questions.  The co-workers are positive for the most part.  Training is generous.  The compensation, though a little low is adequate.  Health benefits are good.  Work-life-balance is important to the company and they certainly honor it to the best of their ability.

Just writing this review reminds me how lucky I am to be working at Costco.  I know that most are happy working here and Costco pays its warehouse staff much better than the industry standard.  Walking through the warehouse, you'll see how many happy workers there are and all are eager to help any one asking for it.","The biggest one is IT are the only employees not receiving the bonus the rest of the company receives twice a year, from what I understand.  Another is it is hard to distinguish between the salary vs hourly mentality.  e.g. I've been told I can't take some extra time off because I'm salary even though I worked X amount of hours beyond my scheduled 40/week.  At the same time, you need to make up the time if you need to come in late or leave a little early.  Not a huge deal."

The benefits are also outstanding, even if you are part time. I was laid off before ever getting any.","Well, I only worked here for a month. The store was brand new, and I, along with dozens of other people, were laid off only weeks later. I have no idea why they hired so many people, but I heard 50+ were let go.

The supervisors were cruel and abused their power, and did not consider your feelings in the slightest. There was at least 3 managers who I never saw smile in my whole month there. Even though I had a slight foot injury during one shift, my manager still forced me to push carts, as opposed to cashiering. 

I was also almost written up for ""taking an unexcused break"". That break? Putting my lunch in the fridge, which took all of 15 seconds. 

Calling people who shop there ""customers"" is taboo, since they pay a couple bucks a month to shop there, making them think like they deserve to be treated like royalty, and want you to wait on them hand and foot."

10132,Costco Wholesale,Front End Assistant,2013-12-05,3.0,Cashier Assistant (Front End Assistant),"I have been working for Costco for almost 2 years and I am still currently employed as of December 2013: 

Pros: 
- You start out at 11.50 and you gradually get raises depending on how many hours you get. Sometimes, though, this can take a long time! 
- There is an opportunity to apply and change departments if you do not currently like where you are at. 
- Costco was willing to work my school schedule and important things related to my education: like giving me time off for my graduation or other things just as long as I gave the enough notice 
- Once you hit 6 months, you can get health insurance, which is why most people stay 
- Relationships formed with my co-workers; getting along with everyone. 
- Very active job which can help you stay in shape
- Free membership","Cons: 
- The front end position can be very demanding, fast paced, and stressful especially on weekends. It is NOT for everyone. 
- Customers can be downright nasty at times. Not all, but some will belittle you and talk down to you. I've had members push me out of my way and would not let me touch their groceries, and they were not nice about it either. 
- Weekends are really bad, at least at my store. It gets so busy members complain about not being able to move the crowds are so large. 
- You are under a microscope when you work in the front end. If you do one thing wrong that's all you hear about. 
- Hours are inconsistent, which makes it difficult to find a second job. One minute you work 10 to 4, and another day you work 130 to 10 pm. 
- Managers can't always agree on which protocol to follow. Rules change all the time. One manager tells us to do one thing and another manager tells us to do another. 
- Seasonal people are hired, but not always kept. Often at my store all the seasonal front end people are off on Sundays and Sundays are our busiest day."

Except for the managers there are smart employees with great future.,"Managers lack people's skills, they demand respect but do very little to earn it. They pee on you all the time, there is little organization which thankfully does not radiate to our members, employees are asked by a manager to do one thing and a few minutes later the same manager or another pulls you to do something else.

It makes it very easy and natural to get excited to help people and feel good about recommending stuff.","Like working there. My only complaint is the company values to not assign tasks by gender, but not a lot of passion to uphold it. If a man and a woman start work together, the man will go out on carts, and the woman will stay inside. They send gals out later in the day, but only when they are caught up. It's odd because the gals get upset about being viewed as favored, or unable to do it. The guys get significantly less access to learning Costco function.

Overall, Costco is a good job to have, but shouldn't be looked upon as a career. Currently 19, and I've been working at Costco for a year now. I put my two weeks in because I'm going to be a full-time student. Even though I was a part-time employee during my summer semester, it was very time consuming. Pay rate is great, and so are the benefits especially with 401k, but I suggest that if you're young, you work here as a JOB not a CAREER. Many of my co-workers say that if they had the choice, they would go back to school.
They say that Costco has a way of ""sucking in"" their members with benefits and good pay. But it's unfortunate if you aren't happy with what you do. If Costco is what you want to for the rest of your life, then so be it. But take it from who observes many things in life; Costco employees are miserable! Everyone waits by the time clock to go home. It no job anyone dreams of, it's just a job with good pay. While you still have the time, don't forget to actually do something with your life."
10223,Costco Wholesale,"Good company, experience WILL vary.",2013-08-15,3.0,Various,"I was brought on at their West Plano location in Texas (far north Dallas). So far they have been flexible with schedule as advertised, Pay is solid and the up most reaches of management are helpful and high caliber. This location is one of the highest grossing stores in the nation so I expected as much. Pay is good at all levels to my understanding.","After speaking with a friend who's employed at another location and checking my experience with one's listed here. I  can reiterate some points others have made emphatically.  

If you get on someones s list you're screwed (Not GM or Asst GM but food manager or whomever). There are ""threats"" levied to new employees. Normally along the lines of ""There are plenty of people looking for work out there !!"" or "" These guys have been here and passed their probationary period, YOU HAVEN'T!"" You will be treated unfairly at times and really need to decide if minimum wage is worth that to you ( The ""great"" starting pay is that if you get a location that's understaffed  or something along those lines and manage to get more than 27 or so hours)  11.50 starting at 24 hours  is essentially minimum wage at full time hours.   

Try and find a stable location if possible, be weary of large scale employee issues, new high up management and so on. In a big city you should have a Costco or three to pick from.    

As crude as it sounds you run into the ""been here since my high school years"" guys who have no other professional training or ethics training. I've found this to be rampant at Costco from word of mouth by longer tenured employees and websites similar to this.  

Many employees have ""in-between career job syndrome"" and while having made it past their probationary period they really lack initiative. 

Costco's ""Journeys"" program while seemingly really progressive may have placed unqualified individuals in management positions. I recommend further or revamped ethics and management training to those who were unable to get a qualified college education or solid professional training. 


For whatever reason my location had a new amount of hires at one time resulting in a severe lack of proper training. While the opportunity is well received in this particular scenario it may have been best to bring in well seasoned employees from other locations before being unable to properly train new hires. 

Too many disagreements between supervisors and management,  pay and hours aren't as advertised always, hours flexible but don't expect anything resembling a normal work week, Cashiers under heavy stress and at times hard to work with. Conflicting visions on the proper expectations of your position, Injuries not handled as well as advertised during interview/orientation, Forklifts and other equipment lacking unnecessarily proper maintenance, Many who love their jobs here work on the front end only or in photo, bakery or an ancillary department. Many floor employees not long tenured and have different view. Conflicts not resolved well between employees often over looked until problem too troublesome.   Shipping often OK'S products that need to be returned to vendor due to damage during transit, Unrealistic expectations from regional bosses on ""Walks"",  Daily deadlines unrealistic and do not take into account  seasonal variables(weekends, holidays, location inventory. Dont miss any days either, that will seal your fate...  Long story short if you expected Costco to be the big box retail store that's different and "" worth it"" don't be surprised."

10252,Costco Wholesale,Great company with its own set of flaws,2013-06-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Very stable job and company.

- Costco is a good brand to work for.

- Very healthy meal options as well as a gym in the basement of one of the buildings makes it very manageable to keep healthy and work the (sometimes necessary) long hours at the same time.

- Good salary benefits","- As was stated in a lot of other posts, the fact that after a certain time of employment, it's very difficult to be terminated. This leads to a lot of complacency and employees who otherwise would have been terminated for not meeting up to job expectations to not be fired and hold out until retirement.

- There are definitely a limited amount of promotional opportunities for the number of corporate employees. This makes competition very fierce. But to put a positive spin on this, this also puts all of the weight on you to stand out and make yourself known that you want the job, and you are the best candidate for the position. It develops character. 

- Your experience at Costco is highly dependent on your immediate supervisor and manager. There are managers who take a genuine interest in making sure their employees have the opportunity to grow within the company and as a business professional. Others seem as they are more focused about meeting a specific quota or bottom line and see you as a liability more than an asset. It's true what they say, employees don't leave companies, they leave managers.

- Warehouse experience carries more weight than formal education at times. But this applies more towards the buying side (in which it actually makes sense for a potential buyer to see the business and the flow of inventory from the ground-up) than to areas like IT."

There isn't any opportunities to make a spectacular difference and get recognized and compensated for it , but if you like teamwork and don't mind a bit of drudgery, then this is the place. After the stars in your eyes have disappeared from being hired, then learning their system, work just becomes work here. Yes, you can move up but because turnover is so low, it can take years to go anywhere. I suspect as the economy picks up, that will change as new positions will open as new stores are built.

Great if thats your goal, but not so much if you're just looking to make a little extra cash. Also, it seems that your previous resume of experience, education is not evaluated in promotion decisions or placement meaning those with less education, but more time of service are more likely to advance into supervisory and management level positions.

The degree of work as an entry level employee at the base rate is quite a bit daily. Managers/supervisors often use the higher retail rate of pay as justification for being extraordinarily meticulous. As you age with the company less is expected of you in terms of speed.

10316,Costco Wholesale,Costco Thurrock Letting Down Great US Company,2013-04-12,2.0,Service Clerk,"Before this review gets all negative, i must stress the good aspects. Firstly, with a variety of different departments, there is scope for progression in the company from the bottom up if you are willing to put in the work. Traditionally, this company has always been supportive of it's staff at difficult times and family values were always considered important, even if this attitude is dwindling. The pay and bonus scheme is better than most retail jobs also.","The core of the problem is simple - the US sent over a dream and its UK counterparts have tarnished it. The Employee Handbook, the supposed Bible of Costco which is supposed to set out its ethics and rules is flawed. Constant re-writes and re-issues fail to address the basic problems which centre around the poor treatment of its staff. Different departments need flexible staff to ensure standards are met and shelves, pallets and cabinets are stocked. Staff are asked to be available between 0500 and 2200. However many have often worked outside these hours to help out and get no extra pay for nights or anti-social hours. And recently, where before there was more structure and planning behind shift patterns, managers are making staff change from earlys one day to lates the next with little thought to how this effects families, with next to no notice for employees to sort out possible complications. Where there was once a flexibility and mutual respect between management and staff to ensure 'Showtime Readiness' and the quality of goods to our members, there is now constant friction and upset under the current stewardship. Staff are stressed constantly by bullying tactics and rule changes, excuses used by the management to balance wages and profits. If a member of staff has managed to accrue full time status and top out on his/her wages, a £4000 bonus every year seems like a superb thing to most people and should be commended. But now the current management looks to punish staff on top rate, constantly telling them they are not doing enough work, all the while forcing staff members to change departments with no notice at all. There is absolutely no training plans involved at any level, with a generation of supervisary and managerial staff clueless to basic employment law and man-management skills. Promoting from within is admirable in any company, but training is key and Costco UK does not want to spend any of its vast profits on this. Instead it leaves these senior staff unprotected. A culture of favouritism for staff that are willing to crawl and back-stab to succeed is spawned as a result with complaints having to often go out of the warehouse to be resolved fairly, and 9 times out of 10 managers are not punished, trained or told to how to change their approach to amend these issues. The recent changes at the top of this warehouse have backfired terribly creating massive division between staff and management."

Having a business degree will not make you any more valuable than someone else with no education or special training when it comes to advancement opportunities.

Generally, other warehouse employees tend to be more educated and personable than other comparable retail companies.
The company policy is to promote from within and you will see people moving up within the warehouse and also moving over to corporate.","Due to the company policy of promoting from within, warehouse management seems to be heavier in employees who know how to run the various departments, but lack basic management and motivation skills.  Nepotism and political favoritism seems to be the main work ethic motivator.  Hard work and providing good member service tends to get ignored in favor of playing politics.

Countless good, hardworking individuals at the warehouse level get passed over for promotion because they are not related to someone higher up or because they spend their work hours working and providing member service rather than building political alliances.

As a result, it is easy to feel defeated in attempts to do an excellent job when unfair promotion practices are in place"

 If you're willing to work hard and put in the hours you have the opportunity to become a manager if you have above average skills.","For part timers it's hard to get regular hours because management is always trying to cut costs so when it's not that busy you only get around 20 hours per week unless you're an old timer and you're friends with management. 
  Some rules regarding payroll are not always enforced with early pay raises and longer hours for certain employees who should be getting less hours than part timers due to favoritism. 
  Not all employees are treated equally and newer employees must abide by the rules while long timers often do not. 
  Some managers and supervisors are inept and not very nice which tends to cause friction amongst the workers. Yelling and losing one's temper will not get the job done faster.

Good luck on getting that raise. Your schedule will fluctuate wildly, and you may not get the same hours you got last week.
Schedule changes EVERY week. Unless you're management, which is harder to get into than the DMZ between N. and S. Korea. Unless you know someone, then yay! Good luck working your way into mgmt. if you don't know anyone already working there.
Your job will change from day to day until the day you get stuck somewhere. Then you're THERE. 
Really into the Costco Way, meaning they're better than anyone else and you better do it exactly their way (really?), you are NOT encouraged to think independently or outside of the box even if it's toward improvement.
Penalties (you get written up) for clocking in more than a minute or two early or late. Yes, some people pad their time but most of us do not. Leads to employees hanging around the time clock...
Really top heavy with managment. Little snippy people who wear red vests that, according to them, know more and are better than you. 
I injured myself while working there and asked to switch to lighter duty for a few days but was told no and asked repeatedly ""Wasn't that a pre-existing injury you had before you got here??"" Really insulting, and no it wasn't.

Mostly family friendly.,Working almost every weekend with very few Saturdays off.  Promotion potential can be difficult.  Administration is sometimes out of touch with the way things happen in various departments.

A great place for a steady job as no one gets fired from Costco.,"Their IT infrastructure and systems are still in the 90's. They are trying to move forward but, this business is retail and really does not need the IT arm to keep growing. The systems and methodology are from the 80's. Modernization is a joke, they are still trying to modernize their  systems after 6 years. Currently there is no one at the helm of the modernization effort. A lot of the people here are hiding out until retirement. This house needs to be cleaned!"
10476,Costco Wholesale,Great almost Everywhere Else BUT My Store (so I'm told),2012-09-10,2.0,Pharmacy Technician,"Great Pay.
Great Benefits.
Some awesome people to work with.
Lump Sum Payments once you hit a certain number of hours.","Some shoppers (members) feel they can walk all over you because they pay to shop there. Store Management will always take customers side, which sets a precedent for them to misbehave again and again because they know they can. I'm not talking providing customer service to make a dissatisfied customer happy, I'm talking about constant verbal, emotional and in some cases near physical abuse (customer hitting objects, throwing bottles/boxes at co-workers) by certain members who should have been refunded their membership (if they had one, Pharmacy doesn't require one for RXs) and asked to leave. Keeping these customers has (along with other things) killed moral and actually makes it harder for us to help other patients.

Department Manager doesn't care for same reasons listed above. Gets NO backup from upper management and had stopped caring because of constant abuse.
Some people I work with have a horrible attitude."
10477,Costco Wholesale,Great,2012-09-07,5.0,,Best company I ever worked for.,Wish I would have started with them 20 yrs ago.
10478,Costco Wholesale,"Not bad for a retail job, but far from great",2012-09-06,3.0,,"The starting pay is a lot better than you will find at similar jobs. Holidays off and 1.5x pay on Sundays are also unusual for retail. I found the hiring process to be easy and streamlined. The raises start quickly and return often - also they are based on hours worked, not merit - this is good and bad as hard workers and lazy workers alike are rewarded the same. Benefits are also excellent.","The management team (at all levels within the store) seem very young and surprisingly inexperienced, in spite of having worked for the company for a number of years. Following the leader and avoiding free-thinking will often get you the furthest in retail, and Costco is no exception. 

Favoritism is rampant and obvious, as is sexism. Men push carts, not women and only women are allowed to fold clothes, because ""men won't do a good job"". Many coworkers have made similar observations. The amount of flirtation between (often married) leadership and staff is extremely unprofessional and frequently crosses the line into harassment. Hourly leadership frequently works off the clock after their shift to finish work but avoid having to ask for approval to go into overtime. Salaried management turns a blind eye to this.

For a company whose #1 item on their code of ethics is ""obey the law"" they seem to be pretty good at doing the opposite. Disappointing."

On the busiest days, there would be no boxes at the front end for me to grab to box up the customer's groceries, so I'd have to search around the store for ones on the shelves. Of course I had to move around a ton of people that were there. I was moving as fast as I could, but apparently it wasn't good enough. The cashiers would tell me I was doing great, then they would complain about me behind my back. Very deceitful."

If your young and inexperience,the managers and supervisors WILL take advantage of you and your ability. 

Morale is terrible for starters. I doubt your going to find more than a handful of employees that actually like working and putting up with the crap that goes on here. The warehouse that I was at felt like high school all over again. Cliches divided by race and managers. I was 19 when i started working there and I felt like I had more maturity than some of the managements.

Management here is bad. Promotion comes in form of favoritism and not ability. My own warehouse has gotten so bad that one GM was replaced for another because the former ignore an employees problem with racism. Stupid move on his part as this employee brought in an attorney and the warehouse lost a lot of money. Personally,I was subject to such problems. I had one incident that one manager yell obscenities towards me infront of paying customers. I reported him to a assistant GM but he got a way with a slap on the wrist.

My worst incident was when I was assign to cart duty when they were severely understaff (this was a huge problem at my store,the GM was THAT greedy) I was ringing the door and waiting for someone to open so I can clock out and leave. The same manager that cursed at me ran up to the door and kicked it and was a couple inches away from hitting my face. It was a metal door and I could have severely been hurt. This manager got away with that too.

My last year at Costco was the most nerve racking and im glad I left. I came out leaving jaded and a lot more pessimistic about my future jobs. Thankfully im at a job currently that is the complete opposite. Heres my advice;Dont make this a career,this is just a job. Keep going to school and leave  when you can."

-No matter how hard you work, it's never good enough
-Managers are constantly changing their minds, and if you're confused, it's automatically your fault.
-A little bit of training goes a long way, but managers are ""too busy"" to want to train you.

 I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that Costco is a great company to work for. It has great pay, and great benefits... no other retailer can compare! I worked in the Front-End my first week or two, and it was an absolutely fantastic experience, though short -lived (getting to that)... but whatever you do- make sure you work in the afternoons. I made the unfortunate mistake of saying that I was available at all hours, and they've abused it. I was interviewed for a position in the afternoon in the front end (where the mangers are actually very friendly and encouraging), and after my first week, I was thrown into the 4AM-12:30pm stocking shift without notice. I've been stuck in this position ever since!

 The managers in the late-night/early morning shifts are all very full of themselves (and contain dangerously high levels of testosterone). They are incredibly miserable because they have to be up so early, and take it out on everybody else. I've been in the retail business for over 10 years, and I have plenty of experience... but I am constantly undermined, my opinions never mean anything, and I am never good enough, even when I work myself to the point of exhaustion... thing is, I'm not the only one mistreated- everybody working this shift is constantly mistreated and borderline abused too. If you want to work for Costco, make sure you apply for an afternoon position where crabby morning-people can't get to you!

 This past week I was even written up. I am relatively new to the company, and have found out a majority of the company's policies on my own (nobody tells you anything, so if you have questions, ask, ask, ask!!!). Nobody told me that writing in the exception log three times (The Exception Log is for when you forget or misplace your badge to punch in or out, you write in your shift in the exception log) counts as an automatic write-up. I understand it's a three-time offense and the write-up is automatic, but still, a fair warning goes a long way! And honestly, had I known that writing in the exception log counted as an offense, I would have been much more careful about forgetting my badge!

Sorry Costco, though I enjoy shopping at your store, my time working here is up."

10548,Costco Wholesale,I enjoy working for Costco Wholesale and have made a decent living.,2012-05-10,5.0,Front End Cashier,The wages offered at Costco are some of the highest paid in the industry. Our benefits are awesome and bonuses twice a year are fantastic. Time and one half pay on Sunday are great.  Paid holidays throughout the year and personal time off are competitive. We most all feel like a huge family.,Favoritism by managers is a real downfall. Management covers for each other when ethical behavior and compliance issues are raised either by other managers or hourly's. Management does not always follow the guidelines set out in the Employee Agreement Handbook.

10551,Costco Wholesale,Poor management and treatment of the employees by management with absolutely no assistance for resolution from HR.,2012-05-06,3.0,,"Superb benefits and most colleagues are a pleasure to work with. Outside of direct management, the company sets a fun and exciting work environment. There are alway various employee events and activities. Great cafeterias with awesome food at very affordable prices! Corporate has a beautiful and fun campus.",Poor management in some departments. Some managers severe lack of training and skills in managing successful and positive relationships cause employee discord. Some managers treat employees unfairly. Some managers talk very negatively to employees. Some managers have a lack of respect and empathy for employees. Some managers have unreasonable expectations of job performance. Unfortunately no support from corporate HR for assistance to resolve the issues and therefore the employee is retaliated against by the management for going to HR for help which causes the other employees fear of speaking up for help.
10552,Costco Wholesale,Costco is a good place to work.,2012-05-04,4.0,,Costco hires all of their managers from within so if you work hard enough you could go from pushing carts to management.,It seems like regardless of education Costco wants to put their employees through the trial of working on the floor.

Products were fresh and high quality when I started. Membership prices increased and quality began dropping. Food made in-house now came pre-made and frozen. More management positions were added that were superfluous. People became resentful at being micromanaged at all times. Gossip and disrespect among the workers is rampant. The standards for quality are in name only and it's all about speed and profit. Safety and sanitation go right out the window as they would at a Wal-Mart but they still act superior to other stores. Some jobs are easy and others backbreaking, but all receive the same pay leading to more animosity. The store manager is rotated every 3 years so they never become competent. The managers just swap positions constantly and claim there is room for everyone to move up."
10556,Costco Wholesale,Great pay and benefits.,2012-04-27,3.0,Front End Cashier,"There is not another company that will come close to how well you are compensated. If you compare any positions pay alone to another competitors it is at least double if not tripled.Then you add in great health care, bonuses, sick time, paid holiday, and vacation time.",Employee's become content and comfortable and stop giving 100% which means others have to pick up their slack. It is very easy to start to feel disconnected from your co-workers instead of feeling  as part of a team due to lack of  quality leadership.

Benefits for even part-time work after 6 months. 
Chance to meet some nice people working in your sections and shifts who ARE NOT managers.","When I was hired I was told that I would be guaranteed 25 hours per week in a part-time position. After some math I found that this would sustain my way of life, but just barely. After working here for a short while, I have found that with these supposed labor laws, I have to clock out 15 minutes before the 5 hour mark or face consequences. This bleeds money out of my paycheck before I even see it. Management is hostile and intimidating over any issue and will not listen or help work through things. There is no compassion, and only mindless/soul-less corporate rhetoric which they have had branded onto their brains. If you get mildly hurt on the job (like I did with my back injury), you will still be met with an i-could-care-less attitude. They change your work hours as they please with no warning, and punish you if you miss these random changes. If you ask about why your off-days are suddenly split up and all over the week, you will be met with very lame excuses such as 'it is because you are part time' or 'I do not handle the scheduling.' You will be under the rule of several different managers and supervisors at the same time; so much that if you do something one told you to do and another doesn't like that, you can be punished. It gets needlessly confusing and frustrating. Everything is so micro-managed and drone-like that it doesn't make the extra $3-$4 per hour above minimum wage worth it. Management NEVER has anything positive to say about your performance, and only put effort into finding every little thing wrong with what you did, even if what you did was correct. There is never praise, and only 'room for improvement.' If you ask questions in even a friendly manner about their sudden and unfair changes, you will be met with threats of being fired, or as they like to call it, 'terminated.' In my first month, I was threatened with termination at least 4 times for mistakes that were not mine (made by management) and for simply asking why I my work hours were altered in such an unfair way."
10568,Costco Wholesale,"Great benefits package, however there is a price you will pay for that.",2012-03-27,1.0,Outside Marketer,"They offer the best health care benefit package, which is why most people stay.  Also the hourly pay for retail workers is exceptional.  The warehouses and corporate offices are closed on all major holidays, which is exceptional for retail.","If you are looking for opportunities for growth and advancement this is not the place for you.   The management is not trained to support employee growth.  They love to belittle, intimidate, and threaten employees.  Management takes great joy in finding wrongs as opposed to looking for behaviors to praise and uplift.  If you don’t like being micromanaged, better not consider this the place for you.  They do not value or respect their employees.  The corporate philosophy is “If you don’t like what we do, then leave.”  It is management by intimidation, which I was sure, went out in the 60’s.  As long as you can put up with this you will be okay.  A bit like being in prision.

They have corporate polices but only in writing.  Most of the managers are the biggest offenders of the very polices they should be upholding.  It is amazing that this company is still able to exist in this modern world.  Members are loyal because of the money they think they are saving."

Change is difficult, many policies seem to be in place ""because we've always done it that way"", rather than making the most sense.  This is changing, but change is coming slowly.

Costco tends to promote from within, which leads to a culture where high value is given to people who started out ""pushing carts"" or other long-time employees.  While a noble pursuit, some of the technical staff can have a very miopic view of the world.  Completing all of your technical training and experience within one company, particularly one not focused on technology, can be limiting."

10605,Costco Wholesale,"Favoritism, nepotism, unintelligent, untrained and unskilled management. Complaints are not taken seriously.",2012-01-03,2.0,Morning/Afternoon Stocking and Front End Assistant,"Decent starting pay.
Decent benefits package if you stay long enough to qualify.
You can make some great lifelong friends.",Management always favors friends or relatives. Nepotism and favoritism are solidly embedded in the system. It causes a deep wound to the morale of the hard working (non-related) hourly employees. Management has little or no training - it shows. They are keen to put on a good show for the public but when the doors close - look out. They do not practice safe working procedures. Being safety conscious is considered 'wimpy'. Pay raises take too long to get. 800 hours between raises when it used to be less than 300 only a few years ago. Don't air any grievances. You will suffer for your trouble. Don't offer suggestions for improvement. You will not be taken seriously.

Any upper positing such as a lead position or A skill positions are pointless when posted on the board because management has already picked who gets the job before even interviewing other employees. At times many employees get discouraged because they wont even receive  an interview when applied for these positions, because management has already decided to give it to there favourite employee even if that particular employee is not qualified for that position."
