Where does this make sense! Firstly, whomever did the assessment on how long it should take from start to finish to get a flight out in 25-35 minutes. Needs to reassess this process. This assessment must’ve been done when only a selected few were able to afford to fly because in this day and age everyone is flying and some flights have over 180 people getting on with children animals wheelchairs and this is to be done in 35 minutes for a flight to get out on time!!!! Who is this fair to, the customer service is suffering as there is a rush to get people on a flight so there is NO DELAY!!! Who in the world came up with this plan, RETHINK IT AND CHANGE IT, I guarantee you will have a happier staff, second, why are your agents allowed to ride to each other????? Not wanting to help new agents? Where has this ever worked for the greater good? Trust if they can be rude to someone they will see everyday and they don’t even know they are rude to your customers…..this is a fact, if you as delta management think this is what you need YOU DONT!!! align yourselves with agents who are genuine and desire to be customer service driven and value being a giver of happiness to others, granted you have given sky priority passengers carte Blanche to be just down right disgusting to your staff but that does not have to change the heart of a real customer service driven individual, I am able to over look this really bad behavior but some of your younger staff will not.

No career growth potential. To become a project engineer (the next step after engineer II) they require 10-15 years industry experience. They will try to tell you that experience outside of aircraft interiors does not count.
Raises? forget about it. Their literal policy is ""Praises not raises"". That is what has been heard from the executive team.

The flight benefits:
They are worthless. DFP (Delta Flight Products) is a subsidiary of Delta. Delta gives employees standby flight privileges. The most common ones are S3, given to Delta Employees. They also get 6 S2 standby tickets per year.
As a DFP employee, you fly S3C. The priority also is subject to your start date, the longer you've worked there, the higher your priority. But because you are the red headed step child, and fly S3C, no matter how long you work there, a fresh out of college hire at Delta will always have a higher priority than you.

It gets worse. Retirees and Delta employee dependents get S3B priority. So someone not working at Delta has better flight benefits than you farm league person (again words of Executive there). 
Co-ops (Paid interns) also get S3 so they will always beat you on a flight.

To summarize the flight benefits:

S2 - Delta Employees get 6 per year

S3 - Delta Employees and Co-ops/Interns, Delta Employee's Dependent Children and spouses/parents

S3A - Some subsidiary, NOT DFP.

S3B - Retired Delta Employee/Non Dependent Children of Delta Employees

*** S3C - This would be your priority as a DFP Employee ****

S4 - Buddy Pass

Hey at least you will beat people flying on a buddy pass...lol

Work From Home Policy:

Its a joke, basically doesn't exist. They require you work majority of your hours in the office for god knows why. You will be lucky to get every other Friday at home.

Bonuses:
Delta Employees have gotten 14% profit sharing equating to a 10-15k for engineers typically.
DFP payout was usually 2-3K."

Coming from someone that's done it, it's definitely refreshing. However, I will say Covid has affected the way I feel about this job. Overall, the aviation industry has taken a hit as a whole which the world has been able to see through the news and social media. With all of this being said, I used to look forward going to work and getting to explore a new city or country but now all I hope for when I step on a plane is to get home without being screamed at or a black eye. The benefits are great and the culture is a very family oriented one, the pay can use some work but it's still competitive to other airlines. Covid is slowly becoming something we're all learning to live with because it doesnt seem to be going away any time soon so I will say that I do have hope things will slowly normalize and passengers will have a less aggressive demeanor towards all staff. Once federal mandates get flexible and airfare rises back up again I would say its worth the shot on joining the team.

A handful of co workers who make the workplace great and make it feel like a family. I love Delta as a company but this department and new management has alot to change.","Management uses fear and lies alot to new employees. They also have a lot of favoritism especially to the ones theyre friends with. LAX has a small circle of friends within so if you complain or fight for something, they will turn on you and make your life miserable. No benefit of the doubt to employees. They will write you up for stupid reasons to make u stay and not able to transfer. Work drama and favoritism is at its best in the morning shifts. Co workers in this shift, talks alot behind other employees back. As co workers and managements are friends in this shift. Delta has a open door policy yet this management in this department will not listen or care. If you wanna complain, talk to Atlanta and not LAX HR."

247,Delta Air Lines,"Great Company, Great People, Great Travel Perks!",2022-02-08,5.0,Flight Attendant,"Love working at Delta! It's really nice when you tell people which airline you work for (because once you say you're a flight attendant that's always the next question!) and then have the response be: 
Omg, I love Delta! 
That's my favorite airline!
I only fly Delta! 

Coworkers are awesome, lots of internal job opportunities, great bases and you can transfer (based on operational need, usually a 1 or 2 times a year the company awards lots of transfers) if you want to experience life in another city. Really get the sense that company leadership cares, and although it is a corporate company, I would describe my experience of the company culture as being more friendly and encouraging rather than a formal ""cold"" business like environment. 

I hope this helps! Overall, I've had a great experience and am proud to be a Delta employee.","These are not necessarily cons, but just things to be aware of:

Delta does not have a flight attendant union. Do your research and if that is important to you, the other mainline airlines (UA, AA) are unionized. Opinions on this vary within the company, and while I've met many who are pro union, others are ""proud to be union free"".

If considering Delta or another airline I would say to look at the bases and consider if it is important to you to live ""in base"" or if you would be ok either moving or commuting. Schedules are flexible, you will have 6 on call days a month rather than a full reserve schedule (very rare for a new hire, most if not all other airlines put new flight attendants on straight reserve) but keep in mind you will have these 6 on call days for years before you have enough seniority.

Standards at Delta are very high. There is a reason so many ppl love flying on Delta-- but you will work hard during flights to keep customer satisfaction up and maintain that positive company brand. I have flight attendant friends who work for other airlines and sometimes I get the impression that I am working a lot harder than them for similar pay. Something to consider."

Their is an automatic 3% contribution, regardless is you contribute. So in reality, they match dollar per dollar up to 6%. Okay health benefits, I find that the deductibles are quite high to reach, if you're a fairly healthy individual. Some of the colleagues that you work with, will be very interesting. You'll have the possibility of making good personal and professional relationships, that could be life long. Overall, its a decent entry level job, for someone that would be in college, or a retiree living a second life, or someone just simply looking to make an extra income on the side.","!!! Now time for the elephant in the room !!!
In my professional opinion, the management structure seems to be quite complex, and very inefficient. Just like any other typical large corporation, their is plenty of unfair and unethical things, that takes place, that is way beyond our control. They lack the opportunities for their frontline employees, to progress professionally, which makes any form of upward mobility, seem like a far fetched dream. No training programs in place, no tuition reimbursement, only some small discounts on overpriced online colleges. Pretty much as frontline employee, I professionally feel that, management has been negligent on investing into their human capital. The culture has somewhat changed, in the last couple of years, with the departure of our previous CEO. I professionally feel, that morale is at an all time low, and with that being said, the turnover rate will start to increase if, management fails to address the issues as stated above. Their is too much of an emphasis on metrics, especially from lower level management. Not many corporate or merit positions, outside of Atlanta, which is the headquarters, and the lacking of remote opportunities. I feel that our customers, have better technology through their apps on their phone, than we do as an agent assisting customers. For example, we use computers that have Windows 7 OS, and currently, Windows OS is on its 11th edition. I don't even need to further explain the absurdity which I just mentioned. Keep in mind that this a multi billion dollar corporation. I could keep going on and on, but don't want to appear as a degenerate."

The company is large, so it's easy to fall through the cracks. This can be a pro or con depending on your personal situation.

Long working hours. My shift is 8 hours. However, because I work at a large airport, I have to park offsite and take a shuttle in. That entire process adds an extra 1.5 hours to my commute. As a part-time employee, I have sufficient time for personal pursuits. If I were a full-time employee, I think maintaining work-life balance would be difficult."

659,Delta Air Lines,Fired & Could NOT Defend Myself,2021-09-14,1.0,Flight Attendant,"You get to learn so many interesting things, see a lot of cool places and it can be a lot of fun.","My aunt died and they wouldn't let me make a phone call home until after training was over that day. It's cut throat. I saw a lady get in trouble for having a key chain that was not the right color! 

Unfortunately, I was fired for being associated with a bad egg. He apparently was exposing himself to other flight attendants. I didn't know that and we had just met on a flight and went out on the town because it's rare you meet a flight attendant that actually wants to have fun. Pretty sure he drugged me because I have no recollection of that night after dinner and I ONLY HAD 2 MARTINIS. I ended up missing our first leg the next day and got alcohol screened because of it. 
They fired me because I blew a .02 LOLLLLLL 
Anyway... what I didn't realize is that he was already in big trouble with the company for I guess ""exposing himself"" therefore, I didn't stand a chance. They wouldn't listen to me or hear me out. I was guilty of missing a flight, which is NOT GOOD bc of minimum crew rules. I'm sure that flight got delayed quite a bit, OOPS, and because I blew a measly .02 sooo maybe it was justified?! Lol They sent me home and made me wait a month before they told me I was fired. So I was home for a month without pay... just waiting. Like that's not punishment enough lolll. 
Moral of the story... Join an airline with a UNION. They will fight for you in situations like this and you actually have a chance to defend yourself."

Travel benefits are awesome when you're able to use them

Internal movement/career advancement is encouraged and supported

Recent focus on DE&I seems genuine and I appreciate how the company has been reporting out on their progress in improving equity for minority employee groups","Compensation is low compared to other industries - it's pretty widely known at Delta that most merit employees could leave and immediately start making significantly more money.

No/limited remote work options. CEO is very against remote or even hybrid work and has been pushing for in-office employees to be back in office 5 days per week since early 2021.

Short paid maternity leave, no paternity leave policy. No adoptive leave policy. No fertility planning benefits.

Gym onsite is great, but costs money to use. 

Flight benefits are great but can be challenging to use when flights are full.

Often long hours are expected, and almost everyone I know has a company phone they check regularly on nights/weekends. Last year, we all had to reduce our schedule (and pay) by 20% due to the pandemic but most employees were expected to continue working 40+ hours each week due to workload/staffing shortages.

Because it's a big company, there are a lot of processes/programs in place that make change very slow or non-existent and can make it hard for managers to do the right thing for their employees."

That’s what I like about Delta- you can kind of decide what your path looks like.",If you’ve never worked in the industry before the first couple years can be a lot of adjustment.

The setup of the business for employees is very poor.

That’s right, you have to apply as an external even though Delta HR processes your pay and knows your salary.

1024,Delta Air Lines,"Potentially great place to work, crippled by management",2021-05-19,2.0,CNC Programmer,"-Excellent machine shop equipment (if hindered by a reluctance to properly tool up for production runs)
-Good Safety Practices.
-Pay scales competitive with similar jobs in other industries in Atlanta.","-Support equipment not quite up to the task of running all CNC equipment at once.
-Vacuum systems cannot keep up with CNC router table vacuum requirements as well as the vacuum requirements for the layup chamber.
-Waterjet cleaning system doesn't have enough water flow capacity to keep the reservoir clean (employees had to manually shovel sediment out of waterjet basin when said sediment got too thick to run the machine properly, resulting in protracted downtime for that machine when I worked there). Things may be better now, but since I had to post a review to access Glassdoor I may as well be transparent with how things were at the time I worked there.

-Upper Management regularly required employees to violate workflow standard practice in order to ""get jobs done"" (in spite of the fact that any audit would expose this and result in fines against the company). those pushing for this would also find reasons to write up any employees that complained about this practice. 

-Version Control for CNC programs was broken because the PDM system would not allow CNC programmers to save CAM data with the original 3d models published by Engineering. This was a quirk of the CAM software being used (CAMWorks, which saves CAM data inside the Solidworks 3d models). The upshot is that every time a shipset came through the shop, CNC programmers would have to regenerate programs for every single component to verify that the GCode to be run in the shop matched the current drawing released by Engineering. Including Production CAM work with Engineering models was in process at the time I left, but there were rampant issues with Engineering's 3d models not adhering to ASME Y14.41 (read: 3d models did not accurately match the 2D drawing specifications, and CNC programmers had to make adjustments to models until they matched the prints, then generate CNC programs, etc.--this is why CNC programmers were having to constantly re-do the work on every shipset, this work could not be saved back into the system for future use/reference to have a clear evidence trail from Engineering to the programs posted for previous shipsets).

-Engineering had a terrible habit of referencing industry standards on their released prints that CNC programmers and other shop personnel did not have access to (because they did not have Engineering roles, so the system would not allow us to view those standards for reference). A detailed audit of time spent on various shop operations would reveal an astronomical waste of time spent asking Engineers to tell people at various stages of production what a specific standard meant for the feature in question in terms of dimension/finish/etc."

1057,Delta Air Lines,Management doesn't walk the walk,2021-05-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The check shows up twice a month,"Delta has a long history of operating by its core values - honesty, integrity, respect, perseverance, and servant leadership. That sounds great, until its actually time to live by them. Management frequently targets employees who they don't like. They will scour the internet trying to dig up dirt on employees, who have done nothing wrong, to bring disciplinary action against the unwanted. As proof, Delta recently lost a whistle blower case where a pilot reported safety concerns and management responded by requiring the pilot to submit to a medical review where they subsequently paid a doctor (who has since lost his license to practice) $73,000 who diagnosed the pilot with bipolar disorder, a diagnosis that would permanently ground a pilot. The pilot went to the Mayo Clinic to dispute the diagnosis and a board unanimously found the pilot did not have bipolar disorder. The diagnosis cost $3200. Delta lost the judgement and is ordered to pay the pilot $500,000. All of the managers and lawyers still work here expect for one. Most have been promoted and the one who doesn't work here is now the head of the FAA.

Still don't believe me. Google ""Labor Dept. rules Delta discriminated against whistleblower pilot"" and you will see the ruling for yourself

-benefits are terrible. You will pay thousands in premiums and deductibles before Delta pays a penny. Walmart of all places has better benefits.
-pay is subpar. Delta likes to talk about ""Total compensation"" which includes profit sharing. Well, a profit sharing of $0 doesn't pay many bills. This year for profit sharing day I was given a king sized Kit Kat candy bar
-management loves to put out propoganda about how much they appreciate everything employees are doing and then turns around and throws any agreements they have made out the window.
-flight benefits are great if you can find an open seat. Delta is in the business of filling airplanes which isnt helpful when you fly stand by.
-they will try to outsource your job to the lowest bidder. Heavy MX checks....outsourced to Mexico and China. Regional jets.....outsourced. Gate agents, ramp agents, ticket agents and catering all over the world.....outsourced. Delta even owns some of the companies they outsource work to so they can pay employees less

Overall, there is simply a lack of respect for employees. Management lacks the integrity and honesty to uphold their side of agreements. Like I said in the Pros.....the check shows up twice a month"

1243,Delta Air Lines,Horrible leadership during the crisis.,2021-03-18,2.0,Specialist,"Flexibility to work from home (for now)

Being able to travel places for free","The longer you stay, the worse your pay will be relative to new hires. There is a general unwillingness to advance your pay once they get you through the door. If you stay around for 5+ years, undergrads with no experience will get hired at a higher salary than you.

Highly political! Exhibiting a cultish mentality is required to advance your career. 

Two faced leadership. Empty promises of promotions. You will get strung along by your manager to do a ton of extra work then be “rewarded” by being pressured into a lateral move to a neighboring team.

Overworked individual contributors have not been rewarded for their sacrifices during the pandemic. A common theme: you and your coworkers do 150% of your normal work and get paid 75% of your normal salary. Meanwhile, US tax dollars are used to pay large bonuses to General Managers and above. 

Delta is more worried about looking ‘woke’ than actually paying minority front line workers a decent wage. Leaders over-index on talking about social issues because they see it as a marketing tool to win business."

1341,Delta Air Lines,"Great career, Great people, great destination",2021-02-18,3.0,Flight Attendant,The pay goes up as a sliding scale per years of service. Everything is based on seniority which dictates the route you work to the days you want off. It has a lot of perks and you will get to work international flights and visit places you always dreamed about. It is a rewarding career until something happens to you and then you are not being taken care of.,Pay per flight hours work in a 2 week period so you have to fly in order to get paid during a pay period. You only get paid per flight hour which means when the plane door closes and open back up. All the other hours on the job are not paid. If you are sitting “on call” it is 4.45 hours air port standby getting paid for 2 hours or sitting home on call standby getting paid 4 hours to sit at home on call at a 24 hour basis from 1-6 days depending on the schedule. Before the system change it was Bi weekly pay so you can get sick or take time off For a week or 2 and still will get a pay check. Now it’s not so much and you will need to fly and work every week in order to get a decent pay check. You basically can’t afford to get sick and they kind of discourage you from calling off from being sick. The sick policy is atrocious so you better hope you don’t get sick or else you will get penalized in your record or have a meeting with supervisor. If you are on a multiple day trip you get paid flight hours and time away from base (on layovers) depending On how many day trips you are working. (1-6). Also insurance plan sucks.

You get quality uniforms though. 

However, I knew it was a seasonal job and that I had some of the best flight benefits in the industry. As a college student the summer work and pay were totally worth it. And my family was able to make extensive use of the flying as well. We got our moneys worth, and you get a daily full body workout to boot. 
Additionally you get a yearly profit sharing bonus - unknown if theyre giving out anything for covid, I didnt even get called to work last summer (indefinite standby).","The volume of baggage. I was working international and wondering why i was always tired, so i did the math: 4.5 planes(off load is half, onload is half) each load is about 200 bags, and each bag is about ~30lbs. 

So, 30* 200*4.5 = 27,000lbs or in other words: I stacked, pushed, onload or offloaded 13.5 US Tons PER DAY. 
You are an ""industrial athlete"" and need to watch your health. Do not try to be a hero and bust your *butt for a company paying less than $15 an hour. View it as a decent summer job plus a gym membership and a chance to see the world ( I went to France, Argentina, and a few US places. Some in first class, neat experience)

Also, The elements. You get rained on alot and I worked the winter once > MISERABLE! I remember standing at a gate in full winter gear with the rain gear on top, watching the rain fall sideways in the super strong wind, shivering with soaked gloves near freezing my hands (it was sitting at like 35degrees so no snow) thinking that I had never wanted to quit so badly in my life. Wet, cold, tired and hungry. Great for morale, builds character I guess."

- off-days, holidays, & shift bids are awarded based on seniority, which takes a lot to build up. so you'll have pretty crappy shifts for a while.
- you are micromanaged about time, down to the minute. you get two 15 minute breaks, plus an 18 minute extra break. which isn't a lot when you have back-to-back calls.
- calls can get very stressful because you are dealing with real-time flight issues. people will demand a lot out of you

Work rules are decent for the most part.",Deadheading system is antiquated and you can still end up in a middle seat a fair amount. Scheduling system is also from when computers were first invented. Management will tell you how great you are when times are good but when things go south you are expendable.

2060,Delta Air Lines,"Amazing company, but limited remote work flexibility",2020-03-20,4.0,Business Analyst,"The company is very much like a family (for employees, much less so for contractors).  Many employees are happy to work as many hours as are needed to support the operation & their co-workers, but (manager-dependent) this isn't broadly expected of employees.  In most areas (again, manager-dependent), employees are frequently reminded that family & personal life come first.  The politics are sometimes difficult to fully ascertain and navigate (as with any company), but with proper coaching & mentoring it is navigable; coaching and mentoring is relatively easy to come by given how friendly & caring most employees are.

The benefits are overall very good.  Health insurance c. 2020 is relatively affordable and definitely provides comprehensive coverage options (including life, dental, eye, etc.).  Flight benefits are nice to have, but have limitations as the company continues to optimize load factor; however, HR has finally started to realign base salaries higher to reflect the flight benefits' decrease in value over time.  The 401k program includes a 6% match & 2% additional DL contribution (so you contribute 6% from your check and your account receives 14% total), as well as provides financial advising/planning opportunities, and many other benefits focused on the overall wellbeing of employees.","Delta's core operation is very much a 24/7 in-person operation (pilots, FAs, mtc, ops control, etc.).  Therefore, most of the divisions supporting Delta's operation do not look kindly upon remote work.  Most operations divisions only allow remote work when the employee cannot come into the office for a specified reason (illness, snow, etc.), and those days are few and far between, and must be arranged day-by-day with your manager.  IT is by far the most flexible with allowing ongoing work-from-home opportunities, but still only allows employees to work from home 2 days per week (these policies are as of March 2020, and before COVID-19 isolation mandated WFH for all nonessential employees).

Additionally, the bureaucracy surrounding any changes (especially technology-related) is highly burdensome (as with any very large company).  Some technology-related processes which should be smooth, automated, and/or quick (e.g. login requests, new hire laptop requests, etc.) take a very long time (when I first started with Delta as an analyst, i.e. needed a computer to do my job, I didn't have a laptop for the first 2 weeks, this was in 2010).

Again, as with any large company, middle/low management is a big problem in some divisions.  executive expectations are very high (as they should be); in some divisions, directors & managers absorb the stress well and direct their teams in a less stress-inducing way, but this is not the norm by-and-large.  Typically directors & managers directly pass the stress onto individual contributors (who don't have sufficient power or influence to fully solve the problems) without sufficiently helping/coaching them on what they can specifically do to help achieve a broader goal up to executive expectations.  This is compounded when divisional goals are not aligned; this is especially problematic with IT focused on project funding & system uptime whereas the rest of the operation is focused on sustainability, reliability, innovation & customer experience.

While the Delta family is great, the way Delta handles the releasing of contractors is abhorrent (in relation to how much we brag about the greatness of the ""Delta family"").  I have been a full time employee for my entire tenure, but have experienced many contractors who were great but may have needed coaching on one small thing who were unceremoniously fired (some over the phone, some just by notifying the contracting company that the person was no longer welcome at Delta, etc.) and escorted off campus immediately (with no advance warning and no opportunities to work on any performance issues they may have had).  This has also been demonstrated by (unfortunately necessary) the immediate laying off of *all* contractors not essential to the operation (about half of the IT division) in the wake of COVID-19 revenue impact.  Understand the need to cut, but I would think Delta would care a little bit more about the health & wellbeing of these people long-term (given that many of their contracting companies do not), especially given that some of these contractors are highly-productive, highly-contributing, members of our workforce, and many of them are SMEs for the work they do."

2082,Delta Air Lines,Great company unless you work in IT in Minneapolis,2020-02-23,3.0,,"Delta is an excellent company overall. They treat their employees very well. They are a good global citizen, Ed is a fantastic CEO. 
Benefits are great. 401k match is hard to beat. Flight benefits are, mostly, truly wonderful and impossible to put a value on.","If you are working in ATL at the GO - world class headquarters and you’ll have a lot of events around the campus. Not so much up in MSP. 
If by chance you end up finding a job posting for IT (rare as Delta relies HEAVILY on contractors) and one in MSP (even rarer) - welcome back to 1985! 
The work is interesting but you will end up carrying dead weight (people that should have retired 10 years ago) if you want to make your job tolerable. 
It will be interesting to see what happens to this office in 10 years’ time when just about the entire building has retired."

If you are a ready reserve agent you will not get health insurance, workman's compensation, paid sick days, and a lower pay cap than the benefited employees. Benefited employees are not exclusively leadership positions, most are working alongside the ready reserve employees. Delta is slowly getting rid of benefited employees, when a benefited employee is fired, or retires, or leaves the company Delta will not hire more benefited employees, they will hire ready reserve employees, for every 4 benefited employees that leaves, Delta will replace them with 4 ready reserve employees, or maybe 3 ready reserve and promote one ready reserve employee from within.  To move up quicker you will probably need to relocate. In 2015 on average it took 4 to 5 years to become benefited. It now might take 7 years. Delta gives the airport managers too much power with very little oversight. They have been incredibly hypocritical when it comes to firing an employee, or promotion. I will say that there were a a number of employees I loved working with."

I'd even say we get a little more because we have access to really nice hotels and travel partners that allows us to stay at their properties next to nothing or in some cases completely free. You add free or reduced lodging with Free flights and that's a perk that you just don't see every day. The culture is pretty solid, about what I would expect from an agency. My outlook may be rosier than some but considering where I cam from, I ca not complain about the position I am in now. I work with some fantastic people and we're doing some meaningful work for this brand and I enjoy that. We get two remote-work days a week, any day you choose. I could not be happier with my work-life balance. Also Benefits are the same as Delta employees as well, which are generally top notch. DLV is an underrated place to work!","The pay.

Newbies may have to work early mornings or closing shift."
2116,Delta Air Lines,World’s greatest airline,2020-01-19,4.0,,"Very fun company to work for if you are enthusiastic about airlines and aviation. 

While base compensation is not remarkable, Delta is rare in that it actually returns a meaningful portion of its earnings to its employees through profit sharing payments in February each year.  This creates incentive alignment with shareholders, who also are receiving generous dividends, which I think is brilliant.  Managerial employees also receive additional annual bonuses in February, which start at around one month’s base pay, so total bonus comp for a manager can easily exceed 2 months’ base pay in these recent years of profitability.

Other benefits are attractive - Including 9% total 401(k) employer contribution if employee is contributing at least 6%, and employer HSA contribution of $700+ annually if completing health tasks (checkups, screenings, etc.).","With high load factors on Delta flights (great for profit sharing), actually using standby travel benefits can be difficult. 

Significant middle management turnover is disruptive to developing and executing on multi-year plans and projects.

Budget process is dysfunctional and poorly understood, and money is sometimes wasted that could be returned to shareholders and employees.

Office environment has been undergoing remodeling to a high-density open floor plan.  Not sure who this is supposed to appeal to, but it has become much harder to focus on individual work.

Compensation methodology for managerial employees is opaque; management bonuses and raises, while not at all bad in recent years, seem to be drawn from a hat, and it’s hard to know where you stand and what to expect from year to year."

2207,Delta Air Lines,Contractors keeping secrets and used as pawns in power struggles...,2019-09-30,2.0,Senior User Experience Designer,Delta Airlines itself is a great company with great top-level leadership.,"The project I was working on:
There were two divisions within the company that wanted to own the project.  Their directors used the contractors as pawns as they tried to wrestle power away from each other.

Down to the Director and slightly below levels of management, there was no direction given.  They basically hired a bunch of different contractors from different contracting companies to work on the project.  They provided ZERO leadership to tie the groups together.  They left it up to the contractors to figure out all problems and resolve everything.  Some of us tried.  However, if other contractors essentially take the ""You're not the boss of me"" approach and won't listen to reason and refuse to implement processes that benefit everyone, it becomes a near impossible task.  UX was creating designs and conducting research, and development implemented their own designs, ignoring UX design and research, and even what some of the key stakeholders and users expressly told them they wanted.

When the project ultimately failed and led to one of the contractors getting scolded, everyone, from every contractor, started to take ""me vs everyone else"" approach to circling the wagons and cya, all while looking for scape goats.  And this was just between contractors.  It happened within contracting companies where they ate their own in attempts to point finger and say it was him, not me.

""Leadership"" was nowhere to be found.  

The entire environment was incredibly dysfunctional, to the extent that I have never seen before in decades of working in similarly sized companies."

2279,Delta Air Lines,Consider another company for part time.,2019-07-25,2.0,CSA Above Wing,"There aren't many pros for part time Ready Reserve employees.  It is sold as flexible hours, great flight benefits, ability to have another job (for insurance & living wage).  It is none of these now, though it used to be.  If you are aiming for a full time Delta career, then working as a ready reserve will start you down the path to full time.  But be aware- it could take YEARS (10 plus, at my station).  If you are willing to relocate, it might take less time.  Delta is good to their full time employees.  They get decent benefits, pay and vacations - time off to enjoy their flight benefits.  Unfortunately, much of the full time benefits are paid for by denying a huge part of the workforce any benefits at all.","Ready reserves, Delta's part time un-benefited workers, are the Cinderella's of Delta.  They work more days a year than the full time employees who have all the benefits.  They get 1 week of unpaid vacation a year, while full time employees get paid vacations starting at 2 weeks, after 1 year of employment, 3 weeks after 5 years, etc,....  A ready reserve with 15 years of service still only gets 1 week of un- paid vacation.  It is almost impossible to use the benefits.  Trading shifts is allowed, but it's difficult to cobble enough time to travel very far and stand-by flights are risky.  You have to be able to get back in time for work.  Planning a family vacation is impossible, because trading is only approved 30 days in advance at most, so you can't pay for a cruise, co-ordinate family members vacations, get a deal on a resort, because you won't know if you will get the time off until 30, or usually less days, before.  Full time employees don't have this problem.  Their generous paid vacation weeks allow them to plan up to a year in advance.  Ready reserves work the same schedule as full time 40 hours a week employees.  Their shifts are shorter.  But they work 5 days a week, with no flexibility.  Ready reserves used work 3 or 4 days a week and have some flexibility, which is why workers stayed with the job.  The flexibility made up for the lack of benefits and allowed people to have a second job or time for school or family.  Now that is impossible and most quit within the first year.  Delta has a very low retention rate for ready reserves, which is a disservice to the customers, because there are constantly high numbers of inexperienced employees training.  If you want a part time job and plan to use the flight benefits, go to Southwest or American.  You will get some benefits and be be treated more fairly.   For those wondering why I am still currently employed at Delta;  all airlines are seniority based, for scheduling shift times, etc...   I kept hoping things would get better, but the opposite has happened, except for a  pay scale change.   I have 8 years with Delta and don't want to start all over at the bottom again.  Hindsight is always better than foresight."

Given false information on flexibility, schedules, etc.  No real benefits, no loyalty, no one really cares about the good people who are going above and beyond as great, efficient workers and the only people to ever compliment employees on a job well done are customers; no one else.  But management will definitely be the first to criticize or complain about anything trivial instead of actually doing a good job in any managerial capacity.  To them you are not a good employee part of a Delta family, all you are is another body to break while getting overworked in understaffed departments  due to high turnaround from many of the above issues.  Sadly in all my years of employment this is by far one of the WORST companies I have ever worked for.

Free Food all the time but that leads to obesity. Great profit sharing but trust me...you will earn every penny of it. They do nice things for employees but if you asked most...they would rather have time with their families than a party where they will spend more time with co-workers,Worst and most archaic systems you have ever encountered.  How they manage to get planes in the air every day is beyond me. No strategic leadership at all everything is tactical. Work is pushing paper basically but high volumes in a frenzied non- stop chaotic environment. Air line industry is 24/7 and as a corporate employee you will be too.  Highly political environment as well all based on seniority and level. Your ideas do not matter.

The work is repetitive and does cause your body to ache. There are leads do not know how to treat other workers with respect and it was abusive. Not a friendly place for people who work part time here. They treat part time ready reserves like slaves. Limited benefits for ready reserve. If you get hurt, there is no coverage for you. It does not give you the balance you need from personal life. If you are just in it for travel and pay check then it is fine. But the pay is too low for what you have to endure each day or night that you work there. You do not get paid certain holidays which is only meant for full-time positions. There is no progression in this job for moving up. That means you will be stuck as a cargo agent to toil with your lower back hurting and arms feeling broken every night and will keep doing that forever. Delta is a good company. It is just this cargo warehouse. The culture within this location is just terrible. The older guys get to relax while the new crew does everything."

Flight Operations generally takes care of you. When your senior you can get a lot of time off and still make ends meet.","Training could be better. You will be gone 12-22 days. You'll work a lot of holidays.  Family life can suffer. Health Care could be way better.  Little flexibility with schedule when junior.

2400,Delta Air Lines,I love it,2019-03-21,5.0,Flight Attendant,The company has Great Benefits,Time away from Home
2401,Delta Air Lines,“Flexible” and flight benefits,2019-03-20,3.0,Flight Attendant,Flexibility does start to get better w time and for winter months you can work as little as 5 days a month bc people will pick up your shifts. But expect to work every holiday and many weekends for a longggg time. Pay is pretty good for how incredibly easy the job is. Flight benefits are amazing and literally the only reason I’m still here.,It’s nice if you want to fly under the radar but management is insanely difficult to get in touch with if you do need something. There are so many departments in the company that we as internal customers get treated like crap and no one seems to be on the same page. You will work weekends every single weekend. You will work every single holiday. The job is stressful in a way of never being in control and getting rerouted at the mercy of scheduling. But it’s so freaking easy and repetitive that you can feel yourself getting dumber by the minute. Same issues as any customer service job as far as dealing with passengers. Also it’s not glamorous and you will spent majority of your layovers in an airport hotel with about 12 hours to rest and that’s it. Also it will do weird things to your body and health. Also the sick policy is extremely old school and not flexible. We get 3 sick call outs in a rolling year. And they will threaten you if you have 2 and/ or are ever late.

No union
Pretty good trips

2407,Delta Air Lines,You’re a slave with smoke blown up your butt,2019-03-12,5.0,Gate Agent,You and your immediate family can fly almost at no cost.,You won’t have money to travel with because Delta doesn’t pay much to ready reserves.
2408,Delta Air Lines,I mean it’s ok!,2019-03-10,2.0,Gate Agent,"Yes you fly for free domestically (ON STANDBY), meet a lot of people. Plenty of opportunities in other states if you are looking to transfer. Benefits can be great if you are full time. (You don’t get any medical if you are ready reserve which is part time)","Your body will indeed break down if you work on the ramp. There’s no if ands or buts about it. Eventually you will get hurt. You can be as “safe” as you want but lifting heavy bags everyday will break you down. Working as a gate agent you have to be mentally strong to deal will time pressure in conjunction with attending to passengers needs. (And the rude and disrespectful ones will test you) especially  if there are cancellations,delays, etc...

Now I must say the biggest CON is that your flight privileges are only amazing when the flight isn’t full. 95% of the time the flights are full. No matter where you are. You are flying on standby which means you get whatever seats are left if any. So you’ll spend ALL day (6am -9pm at times) at the airport trying to catch a 3 hour flight somewhere. It’s kind of a joke...So take that into consideration of all you have to deal with and is it worth it. Because be honest we all want an airline job for the benefits. That’s as honest as I can be hope this helps. 

You will not be able to make a decent leaving off of the pay, Full time is hard to come by, I have a colleague that has been trying to become full time for 10 years!"

Getting on full time they only hired every couple years and it is only a few at at. I was getting pretty high up in sinoroty but it still would have taken years. Plus the full time agents make up to $30 will ready reserve make peanuts. This is there way of keeping from paying health insurance. They don’t hirer full time or partime as much to keep cost down. Plus they find ways of getting rid of you if you are part time or fulltime. Some of the supervisors are unethical and need to retire because they are dishonest.

I paid for what they called their “Cadillac Plan” and surprisingly on Jan 1st they cut my city’s only pharmacy (Walgreens, the most ubiquitous pharmacy in the country) out of the system. I now have to drive 45 minutes for RX, wait 7 days for mail RX and no longer have a 24 hour pharmacy at all. When they send me on the road for company business, finding a pharmacy is now significantly more difficult now too.  They did this without any consultation with the employees or our representatives in what feels like a money grab when they are already making 5 billion dollars in profits.

The only time they speak with you is when you've done something wrong or your numbers are hurting them with their own management. You might go days without even seeing your manager.

Everything you do is monitored. From how long your breaks and lunches are (and when you are allowed to take them) to your time spent handling each customer and the ratings they give you through surveys (which most of the time is based on the impression of the company as opposed to you as a worker). If any of those numbers deviate, it's noted on your record and will hurt any chances for promotion.

No work-life balance. You might be stuck working mandatory overtime announced on the day-of. And if it snows and you can't get to work? Still your fault. Someone in your family dies? Two days off, that's it. 

Pay is absolutely horrible based on work load. If they need workers for mid level jobs, they provide ""Temporary Duty"" assignments under the guise of ""development"". It's a great way to lower costs by having low level workers doing high paying jobs but maintaining low level pay. 

Honestly, no amount of travel is worth the stress and low pay. It feels AMAZING for the first year or so, but once you peak behind the curtains, it's really not a great place."

Everything is seniority driven which makes for lazy senior coworkers that are older than your grandparents and paid twice as much. (As a crew member under 10 years)

No union - no back up against corporate greed.

Travel perks all but gone with flights being booked to capacity all year makes standby travel irrelivant. If you can find the time off to even attempt to travel.

Brainwash you in training saying delta family and also scare you senseless that if you fight them on anything.. don’t follow the plan..support union you’ll lose your job.

The day to day is exhausting with little reward as a 1-20 year flight attendant you can look forward to 9-14 hour days that your paid less then half for. Gone for days at a time with minimum legal rest as low as 8 hours behind a hotel door before another 12 hour day.

2609,Delta Air Lines,Wild Wild West Work Place,2018-09-15,3.0,Customer Service Agent,"The flight benefits are good, you can easily fly a million miles. The company lets you swap shifts with co-workers - with extreme logistics you can have a week off every month. The Los Angeles World Airport authority has a separate ordinance for minimum wage for LAX employees found at lawa.org owing to the long commute everyday. Management never tells you what to do so long as the performance metrics are good. Mostly you can do almost whatever you want. Your individual performance is whatever is satisfactory to yourself. You are mostly on your own. You have the power to save passengers from the service of agents who stopped caring or become a service agent who stops caring working at a company too big to fail.","There is no reward for doing a good job and no punishment for doing anything unless someone complains. You can do a good job and receive complaints and be in trouble. Not because of the complaint, but because complaints need to be addressed and the supervisors hate the extra work you just gave them. The workplace is loud, and over-crowded. The maximum occupancy is often exceeded, nothing is up to code, and LAX knows they can get away with everything as an international airport will never be red-tagged. The only nice area will be the Tom Bradly Building if you are lucky enough to be there only because the private airport mall pays for building maintenance. Do not expect any help from supervisors nor management on any issues including safety.  You are mostly on your own. If management looks for you it is nearly 100% because someone reported you and you are in trouble. The management will not actively give you performance reviews; they will only react to reports from others and they will all hate you for giving them extra work. Management turnover is extremely high. You are almost guaranteed to last longer than any of your bosses."

For the most part, meeting many different people was fun and interesting. Staying busy was a plus for me.","For Ready Reserve overall, it takes quite a while to become full-time; especially if you are not willing to either transfer to a less desirable department within your station or to transfer to a different airport somewhere else in the country. 

At MSP, there were a lot of issues that we gate agents experienced. Many of these issues negatively affected our work performance. Sadly, management simply never put in much effort to fix many of the issues. Some issues were addressed and fixed but not very many. Trying to get a hold of managers was almost nearly impossible. On many occasions, if we were lucky, it took a couple weeks to get an email response. Some managers abuse their work authority, are unprofessional, and often harassed employees. A few were actually caring and helpful....even were experiencing the same issues as us gate agents because their managers were disorganized and unreliable. 

In the end, I put in my 4 weeks notice to pursue a full-time career elsewhere. About a week before I was scheduled to leave, a manager asked if there was any chance I could maybe stay at Delta as a ready reserve once I was settled into my new job. I ended up being placed on a company leave of absence with Delta, so this way I could easily come back to work part-time once I was comfortable with my new job. Well....Delta did not keep their word. MSP management ended up saying I was never put on a leave of absence, and that I was not allowed to return unless I reapplied. 

This right here is a great example of how Delta can be unreliable and disorganized."

Management has an enormous amount of power and use their power for complete control over employees. Clocking into work 1 minute late can result in ""write-up"", depending on Management's attitude that day. 1 write up will not allow you to be promoted for one year. 3 write-ups in one year for same offense result in automatic termination.

Also, have a cool/easy trip? It might get picked up by someone else who wants to work more and you just got a free day or two. 
- I liked the structured yearly pay scale where you're guaranteed consistent raises throughout the years, capping off at 15 years. 
-Profit Sharing in February was always a treat!
-I met countless celebrities, politicians, and just plain interesting people from all over the world in just a few years. 
-Only 6 days of being on call per month as opposed to many airlines that are full time reserve
- I was based in NYC for 2 years and SLC for 6 months. Western bases are by far less stressful.","-Flying standby is stressful even though it's a perk of the job. Every year flights seem to be more and more full which means it's harder to get on them, negating the very benefit of flying for fun 
-Trips seem to be declining in quality. My best year was my very first year when I was most junior in 2016.. 4 hour airport sits are common in between flights, long duty days of 12-15 hours, minimum hour layovers on domestic flights only leaving you enough time to sleep, etc
-Flight attendants seem to constantly be understaffed. My monthly schedule started getting more and more packed, leaving less room to move things around.
- It's such a big company that you feel like a number. Your supervisor never really gets to observe how well you work and performance reviews are solely based on unreliable reviews from passengers. Passenger reviews talking about gate agents or their poor experience with TSA brings down your rating as a flight attendant. You may form somewhat of a relationship with your supervisor, only to discover you've been transferred to someone else because the base size is increasing.
-Getting flown into off days, rotations changing mid-trip, and delays are always a risk with this type of job. Some might say these circumstances increased over time. I think it also depends where you're based as East Coast bases tend to have worse luck with that sort of thing. 
-Not necessarily home every night, so packing food for a 3 day trip can be a challenge, especially when you're trying to stay healthy. 
-My personal health started to decline only 4 months into the job. I have a history of autoimmune issues (which had been resolved before this job) and this lifestyle was not the best fit for me long-term. The first year I was periodically pulling 24 hour days, running on adrenaline, in order to see as much as I possibly could. The second year I slowed down substantially and tried to organize as much of a ""normal"" schedule as I could in  order to help my sleep cycle/health, but realized how difficult it was with time changes and/or short layovers. Even when trying to find ""easy"" trips with short duty days and plenty of rest time, it was taking me at least 3 days to recover when I'd get home.  It seemed as if all of my off days were taken up by trying to get as much rest as I could and I just couldn't catch up. I started to consistently feel like a zombie and the beauty of travel completely lost its glamour for me."

They will also match 3% of your 401k contribution for RR employees","You will only be hired as a ready reserve and then it will literally take years to get a full time position.  I have been with the company for 2 plus years and have applied for over 60 FT positions all over the country and haven’t gotten one face to face interview. As a ready reserve (RR) you do not get raises after your first year, you receive no medical or dental insurance, and no paid benefit time such as sick, vacation, or holiday. You are mandated to work no more than 1400 hours a year on a fixed schedule, which changes every 6 months. My station mandates that all RR agents work that 1400 hours a year so finding a FT job to work around the twice a year changing schedule is nearly impossible. Also, if flights are delayed and you work an afternoon shift, you are mandated to stay (sometimes many many hours) until your delayed flight takes off. This will interfere with any secondary job or obligations you have outside of your part time job with Delta. Delayed flights happen daily so YES, it will definitely happen to you and repeatedly.  I have seen FT positions be filled in a way which is not accordIng to policy or seniority. The culture and values that the company says they have are often quite different than what I see happening at my station with management. My station has a high management turnover. In my short 2.5 years of being there, there is not one general manager, nor operating service manager,  that was there when I started. Our current management seems to change the rules every 3 months to suit their needs. No consistency in enforcing rules/policies makes for disgruntled employees. I truly am beginning to feel that with Delta it is who you know, not what you know that will get you further."

Flexible hours as well if you happen to be a student.,"The air support department is lacking as far as training goes. It’s about a week and not enough time to really learn the ins and outs of ticketing. It’s also EXTREMELY cliquey, the seniors who’ve been working there for 10+ years are very mean and snarky to new hires. Even the trainer has a bad attitude whenever new people ask questions but then get upset when she has to fix your mistakes. The pay is ok but not enough in my opinion. Learn to have thick skin if you plan on working in this department because the senior employees have been known to make new hires cry/quit. Have talked with management about this issue and the response was their “trying” to work on it. In actuality the seniors have a wealth of knowledge in the airlines industry they are hard to replace so they pretty much just do whatever they want and treat others like garbage."

2910,Delta Air Lines,Management that sets employees up for failure.,2017-12-02,1.0,Gate Agent,Flight benefits that allow you travel on their airline and others for a reduced rate of purchase to fly standby,"Pay and the only option for incoming terminal employees is part time hourly with no benefits. You have to wait for a full time employee to transfer, quit or retire in order to get a full time position as they hardly add new ones. In Detroit the waiting list for ready reserves  (Delta’s version of part time) that want to become full time is 2 1/2 years long. 

Management doesn’t care for success of individuals and creates a culture of fear in its employees. 

Employees are afraid to speak out against injustice because they fear being targeted, singled out and terminated. This is the norm for other employees who has spoken out. 

Employees are bullied by middle management while upper management turns a blind eye and they don’t have adequate hr to protect and support them. In Detroit for the entire terminal there’s only one hr primary contact person. That’s hundreds of employees and only one person to represent them. Unacceptable for a Fortune 500 company that has over 80k employees. 

They bully their hourly employees who want union protection to fight on their behalf for better wages, work environment and benefits. 

The ability to transfer to another department ( ex: terminal or customer service to general Office or corporate) is non existent regardless of your education and background. I have a MBA and tried for 2 years before I left to get a better suited position but was stuck working part time. This is a common sentiment at Delta and I’ve seen them lose great employees because of this. We’re leaving (not fired) because we’re not being appreciated and treated like valued employees."

You for sure have to think outside the box and some of the aspect you have are very unique to this industry and then specifically the area where you work. When you do make the efforts and try to go the extra mile, in many cases for the most part, it seems to be appreciated.  It is a company that has had to work hard to pull out of bankruptcy and be profitable. In most cases you will work hard and it is about the bottom line.","There are people that started with the organization and have never worked anywhere else or seen anything else. It is interesting to work with a person like that. Pros and Cons. They certainly have great knowledge of the industry and company but somewhat of a limited view.

3077,Delta Air Lines,Disgraceful company,2017-08-22,1.0,Flight Attendant,You make good friends. That's about it.,"I can't say enough bad things about this company. I was here almost three years. I fell for the brainwashing and the ""family"" talk at the beginning. It wasn't until a year  in that I started to see through it all.  

Employee morale is at an all time low. You are used and abused every single day. You work 12-14 hour days with no breaks, constant abuse and bullying from passengers, and in horrible disgusting work conditions. When you are reaching the 15 hour duty limit, you are entitled to walking away but most of us were bullied and threatened into staying. Say goodbye to ANY holidays with family at home ever again. Even memorial day, labor day, etc. During the summer you are forced to be constantly away from home as you work 100+ hours. One months this summer, I was home only 5 days, and that was without picking up any extra trips. 

You are punished for being sick. The company literally says they ""expect"" you to only be sick twice a year. Is this a joke? We work on disgusting, never cleaned airplanes filled with bacteria while passengers are coughing, sneezing, vomiting, all day long. We hardly ever sleep, and when we do, it is often interrupted by phone calls from crew scheduling. The long days, lack of sleep deprivation, and no breaks are incredibly hard on our bodies and unhealthy. But we can never get sick?? Oh and good luck seeing a doctor when you ARE sick, as Delta proudly boasts the worst health insurance in the industry. Every single time I picked up prescriptions, the pharmacists were embarrassed to tell me the cost, or often whispered it to me. They have told me that they never see costs this high, and when they do, it is with someone who doesn't even HAVE insurance.  

The passenger behaviour has gotten OUT OF CONTROL. This behaviour and this entitlement was single handedly created by Delta!! I showed up to work every single day on time, in my three years there I  only called out sick four times. I came  to work, I was kind and respectful to passengers , and all I received in return was constant abuse and disrespect from the passengers and company. Passengers would write in making up stories about you that never happened, hoping they'd get some kind of compensation. You'd be called in to talk to your manager about the write up and then you'd be punished for something that never happened!! The company NEVER had your back. Welcome to the ""family"" !!! 

The company will lie to you day in and day out.  We are ""innovation, expanding, fixing, improving. "" Delta was never doing any of those thing. Its no wonder the staffing problems have gotten out of control, because all of the flight attendants are calling out sick. Why? Some of them are actually sick. Most of them just WANT TO BE HOME and do not want to work because of how horrible the conditions have become! The trips have gotten worse and worse. The duty days are longer and longer, and without a union and contract things will only continue to get worse!!

I left before I had to stand by and watch the company fall to pieces. You are nothing but a number here. All of us KNOW  what is happening, some are turning a blind eye, too afraid to speak up. If you speak up and ask for respect and fairness, you are punished. Many are finally opening their eyes and waking up to the constant abuse and disrespect from the company. Unfortunately only a few of us are brave enough to speak up, or to leave so this company can no longer abuse you."

So many people working those hours also advised me how your quality of life would be so poor, and it was so true.
Also, many people there who had been with the company for a long time told me to leave because it would kill my marriage as they had said how IT killed theirs.
I developed anxiety due to this job. If I had to miss work for something serious, I was so anxious at how it would be handled by management on the next day I showed up. They would pull you out of your station and give you this awful speech about how you would be fired or on a warning.

Moving up into lead or inspector position was easier at Delta whereas at other carriers, you're restricted by seniority and may never land a lead mechanic or inspector position. The peer selection process Delta uses to promote AMTs to lead mechanic spots is far superior to the seniority based system at the other airlines. There were some minor issues from time to time, but none so serious that they have caused me to quit. I'd still be there if they hadn't shut down the DFW maintenance base. At the time, moving to Atlanta was not an option due to family concerns, so I was forced to take the voluntary severance, which I did reluctantly and with great regret.","Delta sometimes tends to be an industry follower instead of industry leader.

To reiterate, as a ready reserve you will work along side other employees who are being paid twice as much as you and you will have little to no ability to advance to full time employment."

As it is difficult to manage flight attendants on a daily basis, there is zero consistency where punishments are concerned. You can never be late and you get penalized for being sick.

The pay starts off great and gets better the longer you stay, I've been working for almost 2 years and I've already received 3 company raises. EXTREMELY flexible. Benefits are great. You travel the world for a living, not much to complain about. Once you start they make it extremely difficult to leave. And if you choose to leave, you'll most likely regret it.","Sigh, I've contemplated leaving the company simply because I miss out on sooooo many big moments. Working holidays, family gatherings, birthdays, graduations etc. it can get discouraging at times. You can make as much or as little as you want with the company. But you'll either have a great work life or a great social life... one or the other will most likely suffer. Maintaining relationships can get difficult (I did it but it's tough). If you have small children or are really family oriented this probably isn't the right fit for you. If your single with no children and no spouse. This job is perfect. The other con is ironically the traveling. You can become jaded, and I find that traveling isn't that exciting if I don't have the people I love with me to share the moment or make the memory with."

Executive leaders based in Atlanta have good intentions to treat all employees great, but that message is not necessarily carried out through the station managers and lower level performance leaders (OSM's). Every airport is different, but expect to work odd hours (early mornings, late nights, and weekends). Additionally, pay is not great but the benefits make up for it."

Sometimes whole departments including employees who have worked there for 20 or more years.  During my time, salaries were bottom of the barrel.

Florida is a retirement state so most full time employees going there have a couple decades under their belt. They should ask if Florida is your home state and why you're trying to relocate as a pre screen question and take that into consideration. They should also look to see if someone holds a degree and that should be taken into consideration as well and if an applicant answers yes to both of these questions then that candidate should be put toward the top of the hiring pool.

-The vast majority of coworkers are proud to represent Delta and work hard
-Travel perks are very good, better than industry peers
-Profit sharing is very generous, thanks cheap oil
-The new CEO (Ed) appears to be a great choice
-Everyday is a little bit different, every flight is a little bit different","-If safety were truly #1, we would have mandatory group stretching like the Japanese, robotic loading in bag rooms like some European airports, and maybe weigh limits for carry on bags that employees have to handle. Some of them weigh over 50lbs and have to be lifted at odd angles by various agents and attendants. Charging for checked bags means more travelers packing super heavy carry-ons - An example of putting financial performance over safety in my opinion. Safety should extend to human workers as much as it does to keeping the aircraft and GSE safe.
-Many employees are not eager to report an OJI out of fear that Delta/the workers comp adjuster will fight it. Also out of fear that the employee will be blamed as there is always some CYA language somewhere that will work against the employee. Lower wage employees (many without medical benefits) are expendable in this industry and Delta is no exception.
-Most of us understand and internalize what the ""Rules of the Road"" are and don't want to hear lame corporate responses quoting it all the time. It rings a bit hollow when someone is quoting it all the time, as if that alone offers all the solutions. The reality is that things are sometimes more complicated, multiple variables affecting performance and competing interests at play. Also, I'll never understand why corporate tries to build this cult of personality with ""Richard"" - Good executive or not, corporate HQ uses such an odd tone of voice to talk about him as if he is some kind of sage. It's creepy. CE Woolman said it takes a team to build an airline so please let's stop sanctifying one individual. 
-You can work your tail off to get 500 flights out with no acknowledgment and on the 501st flight the safety auditor can write you up for some nonsense to justify their job and your record is flawed. This is the paradox of this industry. Somehow you were being ""safe"" when you contorted your back to manually stack 120 heavy suitcases in the beat-up belly of an MD-88, but you were being ""unsafe"" because you climbed the stairs of a belt loader instead of crawling onto the belt.

It may take you a couple days to get somewhere. 
Seeing the world and getting paid while doing it. They fly to almost every country in the world.","Minimum staff on all airplanes compared to other airlines with more staffing.  Very physically challenging job. Quite often 20+ Hour work days. 4-5 hours of sleep on layovers. Lifting passenger luggage into overhead bins and then closing them takes it toll on your back over the years. A lot of OJI's with this job working with very heavy equipment. They fight you every step of the way on OJI's and disability insurance you pay for. Only airline that FA's are non Union . Must work all holidays for first 5+ yrs. No appreciation from management on the job the FA's do. You are dealing with very angry passengers on a day to day basis and expected to solve many problems you have no control over. Such as cancelled or delayed flights, don't like the meal served, don't like their seats, no leg room, drunk and sometimes violent passengers. Things can change at a moments notice and you get home 1-3 days later then expected. Constantly told we are responsible for great customer service and not given the proper staffing to do it."

Other than that there is nothing good about working here, I'm a 20 year employee and the management and supervision are the worst I've seen since day one. They are incompitent at best and can't even reply to emails regarding company business. The time clock ordeal is pathetic and most supervisors (osm now) can't even give you reliable info on the process. Now if you like your lips permanently attached to the managers backside you'd probably love it here. Just keep in mind that management will rely on you to do everything since they are completely unable because of their head placement.","Almost everything is a con, managements incompetence is unbelievable.

-Management couldn't care less how long you've worked there unless it's been over 10 years, and still, even then, good luck with getting ANY promotions. The Ready Reserve program has to be the most abused position in their ranks. They do everything and more. The senior employees rub it in the faces of any new hires. I worked there for 4 years with zero respect or recognition and was told that I wouldn't have an opportunity for moving up until full-time positions opened up...which they said every single quarter. There have been guys there that have worked at Delta for over 18 years and still never got a position to move up in the company. It is basically legalized slavery."

You aren't getting paid the entire time that you are working, and the ""flexibility"" that they offer isn't really there.  You will be forced to give up all of your holidays for the first 20 years, birthdays, and almost any other thing you have going on.  The new hires that come in, cannot even afford a place to live in some of the cities that they are forced to go to.  And other flight attendants just looks the other way and says thats the ""culture"" of the job.  I know numerous people who are forced to only eat whats left over on the plane because they cannot afford food. You work very long hours and are constantly bullied into working even longer ones with little rest and every time you try to find an answer to why your response that you get from scheduling is ""are you denying the trip?""  The departments hardly talk to one another in my experience.  Not to make things worse or anything but the company just takes and takes and takes from it's employees and expects them to work 13 hours (half the time with no break or time to get food).

The flight benefits are good if you are single, but if you have a family they simply will not do much for you beyond once a year or so.   This job is highly repetitive and incredibly boring: agents take 20,000+ calls a year and most of them are exactly the same: people who can't figure out how to use the website and want you to assign their seats or change their flights.   Local management is a joke - they cannot do they jobs of frontline staff and have no decision making capability, they answer entirely to Atlanta.   Promotions are based on race and gender and not on merit - you will have many people above you who you would not trust to even mow your lawn.   Think twice if you are taking this job merely for flight benefits or as a second career you don't really need - you will not enjoy this work.    If this is the best job you can get because of a limited education and no other career prospects, this is a reliable paycheck with a decent company, but if you went to college or have talent in any other industry - go somewhere where promotions and advancement come regularly instead of at Delta where they come almost never.   Starting at the bottom in fast food or in a convenience store has a much better career potential than starting at Res in Delta.   Your hours will be terrible for the first 10-15 years = all nights and weekends and never a holiday off."

Flight benefits are completely overrated; be prepared to buy tickets almost exclusively if you work in corporate
In corporate, expect your job to change every 6 to 12 months; and not where you want it to go. 
No work-life balance in any of these departments (and probably more: Revenue Management, Marketing, SkyMiles, Finance
Some leaders have no people or team skills; expect to feel like you have no life and they will block your career moves internally. 
Healthcare is very expensive. Expect a family plan deductible of at least $2500 or much higher.
Promotions have slowed down considerably in the past two years for many. 
Don't expect any team building, orientation, or training if you are in corporate.
Overall the company has some good policies like work-life balance but most departments opt-out.

The culture is one of honesty and integrity and treating people with dignity and respect.  The front-line employees have taken advantage of this and the non-union culture and has taken the open door policy to the max.  Delta has to find the right balance of entertaining employees and taking a hard line for the good of the business.,Work life balance.  I'm a Senior Manager in Human Resources and I don't have much.

Delta designs a lot of the domestic trips to be 12 or 13 hour duty days, with 3 and 4 hour sits between each leg, allowing themselves free airport standby employees who are basically unpaid but required to be there. Stand by travel is not a good idea if you really have plans that you have committed to, I usually ended up buying tickets to make sure I got somewhere in time or if I had reservations made, so no money savings there.  Lowest pay in airline industry if you adjust for duty day period required per trip, and not just count flight hours. Some days are blocked so you cannot swap off of those days to improve your schedule, yet there is no  added incentive pay to make it worth your wile to work the shift. Airplanes have all been reconfigured so that there are additional passenger seats, but no where for flight attendants to sit or eat a meal in privacy for a few minutes. Ergonomically horrible work conditions and equipment. If you have a family or even one friend that you like to see regularly, this job is not for you.

Fairly strong camaraderie between fellow employees. That was then...,"When I worked for Delta, management seemed to be stuck in a severe time warp. It was the '80s,'90s and '00s, but their HR policies reflected the 1950s. Conservative to a fault.  Claimed a ""family atmosphere"", but used any excuse and method to mentally hammer employees into ""submission"". Unwise for any employee to utter a peep of discontent. Some family! Hypocrisy at its finest. Lazy workers never dealt with, leaving others to pick up their slack. Bad for morale. Maybe that's changed in the years since I left, but talking to friends still employed there...they say it's a living hell. The company is raking in the dough, but money can only buy so much happiness. Their first and utmost concern is their shareholders. While the flight benefits truly are (were) outstanding...as I've read in a few posts, and experienced personally, good luck finding an open seat these days. Delta (and many other airlines) finally got smart and learned that full aircraft make more money. Only took about forty years for them to figure that out. Final thought...don't fall for the sugar coated hype they spew.  If you do decide to work for them...you've been forewarned."

I met a lot of nice people working 5 years for the company.  If you are working in a large department, you can swap and get any days off you need. If you work in a small department like I had, it becomes rather difficult to get days off.","A lot of ghetto people work for Delta.  These people will be your colleagues.  Many people from my training class were suspended or terminated because of their attitudes and behaviors.  Again, it's the crowd you are working with in customer service.  Performance leaders are clueless and do not promote based on experience and education.  Delta claims that they care about helping those who are advancing themselves.  However, it is based on who you know.  I pursued my master's degree while at Delta and was given a hard time to even get a day off for my graduation in my department.  I was told I go to the university of Delta and my schoolwork comes second.  This was by a lead agent no less.  Once complaining to the manager,  nothing was resolved.  Lower management is very resentful over those who get advanced degrees and then leave Delta to pursue  a real career.  The pay is awful and they claim it's industry standard.  It is not. Southwest workers make more and Jet blue workers top out faster.  It will take you ten years to go from 12 dollars to 20 dollars as a csa.  Also,  holidays are hit or miss.  Either you get lucky and your bid coincides with the day off or you will not be seeing your family on the holidays until you accumulate 3 to 4 years seniority more years for closed departments.  All in all, Delta was what I needed to get through college. I loved Delta but the same was not reciprocated with the management they place in charge.  Don't get stuck as a csa for life,  move around a lot or use the position as a way to get through college and your advanced degree.  Also,  the CEO is on a board for united Healthcare. However,  your insurance that you get if you are full time is overpriced and not worth it."

I work a part-time shift which allows me the opportunity to keep a part-time shift at another company which pays substantially more.

I get to work around airplanes.","No real possibility for advancement, as the only ""step up"" - and it's a minor one - from my job is to work the ticket counter and I have no interest in working that position.

Also, some other Delta employees have listed flight benefits as perks. Because my work is through a contract company, we receive no flight benefits. Or insurance. Or vacation. And the pay is only slightly above minimum wage!"

Aside from that, there is that collective culture that everyone tries to help.","The 1300 hour limit for ready reserves makes it tricky to swap shifts when you need to, and is still counted against you when they freeze your schedule during irregular operations (i.e. severe weather). At the same time, doubling up seems to be easier to do in some of the hubs like Atlanta, Minneapolis, Detroit, etc despite some bases having high seniority, making it harder to work your way up. If you want to move up in the company, then you'd have to be open to relocating. Your shifts fluctuate about every six months when you bid again based on seniority, so over time it does provide more flexibility in your daily life if you choose to stick it out."

You don't have to live I base if you plan waaaaaay ahead, but it's possible. Free flights around the world and plenty of opportunity to go places paid on Special Assignment. Best uniforms among US carriers. Practically the only way to live out your life's travel fantasies as a normal person in the United States unless you are apoplectically wealthy.","No union protection for flight attendants which allows inept, inexperienced managers of flight attendants to act reactively and often punitively without any recourse or transparent review process. Seniority means way too much, especially considering crew won't retire but rather fly until they die, often with 40+ years of service! with some crew either embarrassingly overweight, lazy, poorly groomed and damaging to the brand compared to international competitor crew. Crew regularly are turning 70 years old and continue to hog the best trips or sell them to juniors. Terrible salary for first 5 years. Backstabbing employees write you up in an attempt to get ahead with management. Scheduling makes up the rules as they go along."

4186,Delta Air Lines,Don't look for this company to look out for employees,2014-11-08,2.0,Reservation Agent,"The bonuses were great at Delta ,my fiancé envied me because of those. We had a partnership with American Express that earned us prizes and money ($50) for every APPROVED Amex application we got. When you reach a certain tier you could choose from really great prizes like tvs -50 9n. flat screens(top brands, not junk), blueray players, ipods, ipads, $3000 Tiffany giftcards, Macy's giftcards, Rayban sunglasses, 5 piece luggage sets, and island vacations. I won most of the prizes mention except the vacay, ipad and TV's. The best part of the job was the free flights for employees and their families(children, mate, and parents-no siblings unles you gave the a buddypass to use)","The pay, the ridiculous methods to push Amex, hotel, and rental car transfers. At ! point, ""Leads"" walked through the call center yelling ""Power Hour"", 1 even rang a cowbell!  I mean what did they want you to do, show up at a passengers door and make them apply for a credit card???Yes!, they even gave out stacks of paper applications for us to help friends and family ruin their credit. There are a lot of people with bad credit trying still trying to keep their heads above water after the recession. The call center was a zoo on the weekends, with everything from people eating meals at their desks while on calls, to even violence. I've seen it with my own eyes and taken pictures of it as well. I knew no one would believe me if I told them! The blizzard in Atlanta a few yrs ago was a nightmare. Since most people couldn't get out of there  because of the roads, non-driving Atlantans and transients from other places where they weren't used to snowstorms we spent the night in the call center. No, they don't have showers, no they don't have beds,(what call center does???) YES we slept on chairs pushed together, floors, and I even saw someone on the treadmill sleeping. I was stuck there for 3 days because Atlanta didn't have snowplows or salt trucks! My son was a yr old I think and still nursing. It was rough on all of us. They got a few(yes a FEW) HOTEL ROOMS NEARBY BUT EVERYONE COULDN'T GO OF COURSE Delta's a 24 hr company. Oh and we got unlimited candybars and chips along with 2 meals a day(breakfast sandwiches from McDonald's across the street and pizza at night) I don't eat pork at all so of course I ate popcorn,and candy for those days. Oh and I did get Wafflehouse 1 day, it was across the street also. 

The monitoring was and still is unbearable. I have several associates that are still there that have had to go out on ""stress leave"". I had surgery while working there and had to go out on FMLA for a while because I contracted an illness while healing and still had to call EVERY SINGLE DAY to make sure I didn't lose the job I needed so much. Some of those days I couldn't talk and other days I was so out of it from the meds that my fiancé would take the phone and finish the calls for me. I've been physically assaulted while working there, verbally abused and threatened by passengers on the phones and the whole time I had to try and ""smile through my voice"" Crazy right? the last couple of years, a lot of great people I know have been fired due to whatever Delta deems ""unethical"" but physical violence and sex in the building gets a pass. Look, I held all this in for a long time so sorry if I'm rambling but glassdoor asked so I gave. At 1 time they were trying to bring in a union but I guess fear of the unknown prevented enough people from agreeing to it so it didn't happen. I'm from the northern part of the U.S so I know how beneficial a union can be for employees."

Delta Air Lines is the 3rd largest airline in the industry but  the comparisons for pay are with regional and start up airlines which lowers the industry average.

External hires are given higher starting pay that is more commensurate with market pay. Managers are all competing against each other for favor, so there is not a lot of real effort in collaborating. If anything, peers root for you to fail so they appear more competent. Due to extreme downsizing, managers were doing a lot more with a lot less, and post bankruptcy promises that the Leaders that stuck out the pay cuts and got the company through the hard times, would be the Leaders of the company.

There is a lot of micro-management by leads (sales, call-handling, post call survey, vendors, credit cards). You're required to know a great wealth of information and policies which seems to always be changing. The hours and days off go by seniority and there have been people there for over 35 years.

-Employees: My other favorite:) I love the energy they bring day in and day out. They are driven and will get the job done. The employees made my experience with Delta worth while. I have met some lifetime friends there. Love them.
-Early Out: On slow days or nights, a sign up sheet is posted in the break room for those who would like to volunteer to get out early from work.
-Diversity: Meeting, working and having the pleasure of getting to know people from different backgrounds.
-Employee Appreciation Day: It happens once or twice a year, but employees are ever so grateful for them.
-Holidays: If you're scheduled to work on Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year away from your family and loved ones, you can count on having your Delta family celebrating with you at work. Ongoing pot luck every holiday.
-Birthday cake every month: A huge cake is ordered every month for all birthday within that month.","-Management: Needs major improvement as some Performance Leaders have absolutely no sense of direction and would have to ask other management for help on daily operation issues. This has happened more than necessary. Also management will pick and choose who they want to promote regardless of your hard work.
-Pay: The pay as a Ready Reserve max out at $11.75 regardless of how many years you've been employed with Delta (I was employed with Delta for 6 years) This is because you max out after 2 years. My fellow co workers who were hired 2 years after me were making the same hourly wage I was making.
-Lack of hands on training: From time to time, you'll run into a co worker who has been scheduled to meet or work a flight whom has never been trained to drive a jet bridge or even open an aircraft door. I have been asked too many times for favors to swap schedules with a co worker as they have not been fully trained... mind you, my new friend and I are making the same amount of dough."

People don't work here to ""get paid""they work here to fly.

Also you have to""bid""for your work shift, if you are single and unattached with no obligations of school or children then it's not that big of an issue, you just have to readjust your sleep schedule...however if you are married and/or have children, this bidding of shifts, not knowing when you're going to work and not having a consistent shift can wreck major havoc in your family life, dealing with child care, time with your mate, etc.If you're in school trying to ""get ahead"" you better do online, independent study classes, because your work shift is subject to change in the course of a semester, and most definitely during the school year.

If you don't like working with the public, this is not the job for you, you have to have a lot of patience to deal with the different personalities, and demands of the customer, especially if they are irate.

Uniforms !, I personally don't have issue with them, you just put them on and go, saves a lot of trouble figuring out what to wear to work(lol), however if you're trying to express your ""inner diva""our your fashion sense, this is not the job for you !"

While I don't believe that unions are needed in every work setting I felt that Delta's extreme disdain for unions was a bad sign. I worked for Northwest Airlines previously and became part of Delta through the merger. What I found was that at Delta there was propaganda EVERYWHERE to indoctrinate employees into managements ideology. I feel that a company that respects the rights and intelligence of its workers doesn't try to manipulate how they think and feel. Other airlines, such as Southwest, have a long tradition of respect for their workers which is reflected in their willingness to work with unions. If you decide to work here, keeping a low profile is best."

I sense a much greater level of job security at Delta than at other companies, which is huge for me.  Benefit package is generally very good with flight benefits being astounding.","As the company's success and number of partnerships has grown, the overall workload on management analysts has skyrocketed with every assignment being urgent.  This can be draining and impact one's personal life, even if overall time at work is the same.  The number of interesting jobs at Delta is limited, so competition is huge.  The tightly-packed office environment is very Leave It to Beaver with little variation in personality.  For creative types, this can be alienating.  Almost all white-collar jobs are based in Atlanta, which is full of traffic and not that interesting."
4299,Delta Air Lines,"DAL was great for meeting new people and going places, but had low pay for the Ready Reserve Program",2014-06-07,3.0,Ramp Agent,"Flight Benefits, good pay if your a Flight Attendant or Pilot, they almost fly every major air port and are on time most of the time.","Too much training for just moving bags, low pay, ext. The time off is all based on how many years of service so you need to be there for 3-5 years + to be able to have shifts you want. They want people with a college degree if you don't have one makes it hard to move up the ladder."
4300,Delta Air Lines,Leaving for upward mobility,2014-06-05,2.0,Senior Revenue Management Analyst,"Good work/life balance in the corporate office which helped balance having a young child, flight benefits, personal time/vacation time is pretty good, airlines are fun and interesting places to work, they are doing better profitability-wise then the other airlines and are making smart customer/technology/profitability decisions for the future.","Delta promotes extremely slow and it is too seniority based instead of merit based.  If everyone would be on this slow track, it would be one thing, but I am mostly leaving because of their MBA associate program.  They give higher pay to MBA associates who come straight out of MBA programs. After a 2 year rotation, these MBA associates are given manager/supervisor roles. I graduated from a MBA program I did part time while working at Delta. I came to Delta with numerous years of previous airline experience including experience working in a  supervisory role. After I worked 2 years at Delta and graduated with my MBA, I was not given the same opportunity or pay as the MBA associate program and could not be in a similar program because I was not hired through this MBA program's process. I was told by other employees I would have to leave and come back to receive the same pay as they give external candidates. The MBA associates are favored and given big projects to present to higher level management.  Delta does not pay to retain. I felt chased away. 

As a working mother, I went to an upper-level woman manager for advice and she advised me that it is ok to stay in the same position in order to be a mom and not to worry about others that were moving up faster than I was. I ended up taking a job offer that had a better upward projection for me. If I had taken her advice, I would still be at an entry level position instead of having a successful career as a working mother.

Additionally, they had a forum for parents where one director told us how she made being a working mother work by having a nanny, something most of their employees could not afford. 

I felt that the upper-level management is manipulative. My mentors told me I was high-potential but did not take any actual action to show it or to retain me. They were just trying to string me along and do what was best for them. 
 
Also, their interview process is horrible. I went into an internal interview where they did not know who I was and said they didn't look at my resume before I came. They didn't notify me for months whether I got the job and I found out when it was announced that another coworker got the position in a meeting. I was asked not to talk about my previous airline experience before Delta in an internal interview."
4301,Delta Air Lines,"A career full of adventure, challenge, and a company that cares",2014-06-02,5.0,Tower Agent Operations,"Delta Air Lines looks out for their employees and promotes/demonstrates values and morals that keep it an excellent company to work for. There is literally something for everyone at Delta from employees clubs (skiing, tennis, scuba, etc), to volunteering (abroad and in local communities), to unlimited access to travel benefits that are unmatched by any other company. I've progressed through several different positions at Delta. At every position, Delta does an excellent job of making sure you feel like an asset to the entire operation. Additionally, Delta Air Lines does not micromanage their employees, and gives them the power to make decisions on their own. If you're interested in a career that is ever-changing and challenging, Delta is an excellent choice!","Delta Air Lines adheres to pay scales for all of their employees that do not account for regional cost of living differences. For example, employees in Atlanta make the same amount as employees in NYC. For this reason, starting out with Delta can be very difficult financially."

Many people have been at Delta for 20+ years and they bring with them a great understanding of the airline business. The company as a whole really takes care of its employees, but each department has its own culture. The flight benefits are really great,  if you love to travel you will likely be happy here.",Ridiculously long hours and expectations for WAY below average pay for the same job with less hours. Lots of change in direction so a lot of scrambling adds to the stress. So many changes in direction its almost like a consulting environment but without the cool office and casual dress code.

4314,Delta Air Lines,Under value for IT employees,2014-05-02,1.0,Senior Developer,"I'll have to admit, flight benefits along with the profit sharing bonuses and 401K are some of the best out there.  Other than that, there isn't really much pros about Delta.","First, there is little resource to help individuals grow their career.  You are pretty much stuck where your at especially if you are in the IT department.  Second, most employees you talk to agree that management needs major training and needs to be more in sync with their employees because they are so disconnected with what employees are doing as far as task/goals goes.  Third, the salary raises here is a joke.  Actually its not even a joke its an insult to employees.  Average salary raise is between 1.5 - 2.5 percent annually.  I thought I was the only one getting low raises until I started asking around and it seems like in the last 4 years I've been here, no one got higher than 2.5 percent raise.  This is a huge insult to its employees considering Delta had over 2.7 Billion in PROFITS for 2013.  Yes that's ""B"" in Billion and ""P"" as in Profits alone."

As a human being who wants to have work-life balance: 1) Delta leaders have family values thus long hours at work are an exception not an expectation 2) ATL campus has a new gym, a car wash, health clinic / pharmacy, credit union branch, cafeterias 3) all employees receive profit sharing $$$ when co. makes a profit 4) Delta Perks - an employee site with tons of discounts 5) Free travel and nearly free for family + buddy passes - I can't stress this one enough - it's the jealousy of my friends :) - I am able to come to the airport and go...anywhere...no advance planning required - think of it as a big bonus to an average pay 6)  online rewards tool to nominate a fellow employee for a job well done and for that employee to receive recognition and points exchanged for products/services, etc.","This is a big 80,000+ company - expect divisional miscommunications and some red tape. Not all managers are top talent, and it can take long for other leaders to realize and make organizational changes. It is also easy to feel like a needle in a haystack and question how much difference you really make - when this happens, it may be time to transition to another department - if a door is closed, there will always be a window."

Delta Air Lines is the best U.S. Carriers, but that is not really saying much. This is the general nature of the industry ""low margin"" and ""high frequency."" The amount of capital it takes (planes, fuel, general labor) makes it very difficult to generate a profit. Beware of this overarching theme when applying to any position in the company.

In smaller stations upgrades are very rare and typically in order to get one you have to move to another city. If you are not willing to relocate it may take up to 3-5 years before you have the opportunity to move up. This doesnt sound like that big of a problem until you consider that ready reserves are limited to 1300 hours/year or 25 hours per week at $11.75/hr.

Not sitting at a desk all day
Some great people to work with","Their stations are not at all consistent with each other regarding rules and regulations
The manager in the RI station is ignorant and also thinks she owns her employees (and the company)
They do not go by the Delta HR policies
HR is not local - it's in Atlanta, so they are not physically there if you need them or to be witness to issues that may arise.  
Free travel is sometimes very hard to get (standby travel) but that probably is the case with other airlines as well.  Although Delta oversells their flights much more than some others; leaving employees stuck for days sometimes in different cities. 
The pay is really not good at all, especially for all of the responsibilities expected of you.
Employees have to pay for their own Christmas party.  I've never worked for a company that did not have an employee holiday party and pay for it.  Delta is such a huge company they have no excuse not to."

It's a very well run company and management was very intuned to the needs of their staff (at least in my department).  Can't beat the opportunity to travel and see the world for free and the ability to get involved in volunteer work in the local and international communities.  Countless opportunities to swtich jobs and try something new. In my short period there, I held two completely different jobs and loved that it was even possible.","It's a voaltile industry and you really feel the impact of speculative oil prices...it trickels ALL the way down.

There were some outdate work practices and a manager in a position which required modern IT skills, she had none and it was a disaster yet she still had her job her befefits and the ability to scare off good company minded staff.  The salary scale and starting at the bottom regardless of past airline experience.

Many in my department get yelled and belittled at every day.  We are all so upset and too scared to do anything about it for fear of retaliation as the problem goes at least as high as the director of out department and if the VP is as bad as they say he is, then it runs deeper than that.  I cry almost every day for the last couple of years that I am trapped in this company and can not seem to get out due to job market and the failure of Delta to invest in developing you instead of having you play politics and games every day.  Unless you are a favorite...many have already posted on that.  They DO NOT value hard work.  They value brown nosing and promote them and then the rest of us have to deal with a poor manager that should have never been promoted in the first place.  Also,no ground rules for treating everyone fair and consistent.  Some are given a lot of leeway, opportunity even actual gifts for occasions and birthdays with a big to do.  Meanwhile, in the same department for another employee of the same title/rank, nothing is ever given or said.  Its actually kind of like emotional torture."

*A good job for a college student or individual who likes to travel and has another full time gig with a flexible schedule.","*Many people working as ready reserve regularly work 40+ hours a week. This position offers no medical benefits, 401k,ect. Delta saves labour costs by making half the work force ready reserves while half the work force are regular employees with medical, 401k.

*High risk of on the job injury with no medical insurance.
*I know its been said before but front line management is dangerously incompentent.
*Must move to another city to get full time status (the current wait is 4 years at my station)
*You only have 1300 hours to work a year which comes out to 24 hours a week. Once you hit 1300 hour mark you can't work untill January 1st of the next year so if you like to work 40+ hours a week your going to run out of work pretty quickly.
*Schedules/Time off/and promotions to full time are all senority driven which leaves little incentive to work hard (note: however this is industry standard).
*It takes 10 years to top out at $22 an hour (once your made full time. It can sometimes take a few years to get fulltime status) If someone really showed initiative they could learn how to do every single position on the ramp in about a year to a year and a half."
