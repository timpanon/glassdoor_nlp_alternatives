0,DocuSign,Not Exactly What I Thought,2022-04-06,3.0,Account Executive,"Great benefits, work from home, pretty fun environment, nice people, working for a company with a well-known name and strong reputation.","Unfortunately, the job was just not what I thought it was going to be or what I felt I was told in the interview. In the division I was in, we were mostly selling very small, transactional deals and there was a compliance feel to it as well. Customers were not thrilled with the conversation and very regularly were comfortable going to competition."

4,DocuSign,Horrid Culture Shift,2022-04-06,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- If you started a while ago, you might be above water with the stock RSUs
- Benefits are decent, especially if you are considered a remote employee",There has been a massive take over in management from much more corporate companies (namely Cisco). This has lead to a major downturn in the culture most of the old timer DocuSigners were used to. The company is heavily moving in the direction of: Do whatever it takes to make our quarterly numbers look good. This means cutting costs here and increasing them there so that they look better even if the employees have a worse working experience. Most large scale projects the company undertakes have failed or are delayed consistently due to poor planning and understanding of the problems being worked on. This is only going to continue to get worse as all the people with domain knowledge flee for better places.

6,DocuSign,Solid Company but Plenty of Opportunity,2022-04-05,3.0,Director,"DocuSign really cares about its employees and has done an amazing job supporting everyone through the pandemic. They afford flexible hours, remote work, decent benefits, and no shortage of opportunity to improve the organization or own skills.","All companies have issues and areas for improvement but I think DocuSign has struggled to make meaningful improvement.

* More organizational friction and egos than necessary. Need a 'be kind' company value.

* Rather in-grown with former Microsoft employees which has created a bit of an echo chamber. This can also stifle career growth.

* Reasonable amount of technical debt and toil.

* May not be as competitive on benefits in the current employee-driven market."

Options for promotion don’t have to be sales either.","It is so luck based. Meaning, if you have a good account team- they will tag you on opps, value it at best case scenario, and help you in right direction. If you have team members who don’t care or are unfilled, good luck. Management is constantly changing books. And people are quitting so you get teams changed often or just don’t have account team at all. Not an equal playing field- install is waaaay easier than newco. Same with smb vs enterprise. They adjusted quotas bc popularity during pandemic but haven’t readjusted now that almost all businesses have e sig. Going to burn through people real fast if they can’t get it together."

22,DocuSign,Correlation Report: Garbage Decisions=Stock Crash?,2022-03-29,2.0,Account Executive,"Disclaimer: My whole review comes from my own personal experience as a Sales Rep and has not been influenced by my peers. For context, I worked for 2 years in the role and achieved 120% in 2020 and 70% in 2021.

DocuSign is a wonderful company for most people and, objectively speaking, I cannot deny how great the company is treating staff; specially when compared to some of my friends who work in less 'tech savvy' companies.

Direct manager is awesome and of the best I have ever seen. Anyone with any sense should promote said person and give said person the value they deserve.
Team is funny, open and wonderful to engage with, regardless in remote times
Product is unparalleled and sells itself most of the time.

Salary is quite low and hasn't increased for 5 years. However, DocuSign does everything to make sure you are at comfort. Benefits are endless and sometimes even specific (such as different types of health insurances)","The sales organization used to be fascinating to join and there was so much opportunity to shine.

However, DocuSign has not accounted for how their unreasonable growth directly impacts loyal staff. Initially the target was comprised of 3 different categories: New Companies, your book of business (ie. Install Base) and Web Upgrades. From these different sources you could always priorities one or the other, which then makes out to be your target.

I understand that over time these three categories need to be split as the company grows. However, DocuSign decided to separate the 3 categories in one go. Simultaneously cutting geographic territory into “luck or no luck” territories and shamelessly increasing targets unilaterally to the same number for everyone. Depending on what market you work in, if you are left with a lackluster territory, your target is exactly the same as someone who still has all 3 funnels (newco, install, web). How can someone with 1 city and 1 funnel (newco.) have exactly the same target as someone with 4 countries and 3 funnels? No one can ever explain this. And if asked, it’s always the “God works in mysterious ways” answer.

To dig deeper into that; there was actually a full on All Hands that indicated that in order to be successful in our roles, we need to “believe” and “have faith”. World star sales advice to anyone out there. It’s not fair how we split up the markets, but just have faith and you will be fine (spoiler alert: no you won’t). Even after showing hard empirical evidence of what you have done to try and hit target, management will revert and say “well you could do this?”, but they would never ever say “well we could do this”. 

What is worse is that the people who have not been impacted by these drastic changes continuously receive shout outs and credits. They get invited to All Hands meetings to teach their amazing insightful way of hitting 200% of their number. Senior Managers smile and applaud the amazing work done by said colleague. They don’t mind what the repercussions are and therefore do not engage in any meaningful dialogue to change the disaster they have caused. It’s almost as if the stock crashing has a direct correlation of horrendous decision making? Shocker.

I personally also have been publicly shamed and often get compared to other peers in the workplace. I don’t know how comments such as “Sally did it this way, so why can’t you do the same?” can help motivate me? Well maybe Sally receives 3x my pipeline? If only I had a little more faith…
Finally, I have been eliminated out of an internal promotion round because of miscommunication in the hiring process. Basically, I was promised a chance to interview for a role, but that role got taken by an external candidate who was already in pipe; although I have been told there was an external hiring freeze. Recruitment giving false hope? Not fun.

I would never encourage someone to work at DocuSign sales. Please ignore the good reviews, those were forced down our throats when joining, luckily I used common sense and rated after being in the company 3+ years. Truth is, everyone I know is on the same boat; no wait they are jumping ship."
23,DocuSign,Absolute Disaster,2022-03-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A few good gems in an otherwise empty crater of a company,"There is zero company strategy from top to bottom. Leadership cannot articulate where the company is going or what the goals are. One week its ""partners"" the next week its ""acquire customers at all cost"" and then ""we need to be margin conscious"" and zero strategy on HOW to achieve those goals.

People who have been here 5+ years have climbed the ranks by managing up and taking credit for others work and pointing fingers when things go wrong, rather than actually supporting their teams and accomplishing anything. Hard work and execution are not rewarded.

The company under pays, does not provide good stock bonuses, and overworks the very few folks who are actually holding this place together with scotch tape."

30,DocuSign,"Decent place to work, but lacks clear strategy and stingy with pay",2022-03-24,3.0,Sales Engineer,"Generally, Docusign is a decent place to work. The benefits are pretty good, and I largely enjoy my coworkers and the general company culture. The e-sign product is best in class. Work from home policy is fairly flexible. Good amount of PTO by U.S. standards. My manager is fantastic. C-suite management makes a good faith, if not entirely effective, effort to understand and meet employee needs.","Earning ability is limited. Pay raises are small and infrequent for some employees, and non-existent for others. Turnover is very high due to a perceived inability to earn. 

Territory re-alignment occurs annually and takes 2-3 months per year, during which the selling motion is in chaos. Sales cycles are disrupted by seemingly arbitrary AE/SE realignments, about which customers complain. 

Management makes highly disruptive changes to product and GTM strategy suddenly and without explanation. These decisions are often then later reversed. Overall strategy seems vague and confused. Some of the non-esign products have a significant amount of technical debt.

Docusign regularly encourages employees to refer candidates for open positions, but then never follows up with said candidates. After referring six candidates and all but one being rejected by HR without so much as a phone screen, I am done referring anyone to work at Docusign. HR can find their own candidates I guess.... good luck with hiring people with the pay being offered."

I see promotions constantly and love seeing them utilize the talent we have internally. I've been at Docusgin for 16 months and just accepted my promotion to Regional Vice President. About 25 MDRs get promoted PER QUARTER, thats insane. 
The culture is great, everyone is so helpful and its just not a sleazy aggressive sales culture. We want to win but it's not cut throat where winning is put ahead of employee satisfaction.
I just love it. I've worked at a lot of tech companies, some really great ones too but this one by far is the most exciting in terms of career growth and just feeling good.","Coming off covid we do have some growing pains. We took off and trying to figure out quotas etc afterwards has been hard but we've adjusted if quotas were too high which is great to see.

This could not be more true at DocuSign. The boots on the ground or senior directors and below are all great people, but they are led by a cult-like, toxic, and politically motivated c suite.

My manager would mosey in to the office at 10am (after the rest of us got in at 7am) and when I asked him questions he would talk in circles and had no answers. And even when he admitted to not knowing the answer that I / the whole team was asking, he made zero effort to find the answer from other teams / departments...

Excellent work-life balance
Lots of room to grow your career","At times communication on certain areas could be handled better, but to expect in a fast-growing organisation"
86,DocuSign,Good place to work,2022-02-22,4.0,Senior Solutions Engineer,"Big vision, supportive management, good compensation",Too much pivoting and change of practice to meet aggressive goals
87,DocuSign,Incompetence,2022-02-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Decent money, at least before the stock price plummeted. Good benefits. ESPP, 401k, all that typical stuff.","Never have I worked with so many incompetent engineers. The CLM OPS team is incredibly understaffed and incompetent. No one attempts to improve the platform, they simply put in a band-aid or reboot a box and move on. Constant failures and no high-level architectural vision. Not enough time dedicated to improving the developer experience. Product team does not have an aligned vision on what we should be building, and it ends up changing multiple times throughout the year anyway, leading to decreased morale and confusion. DocuSign is basically a decade behind modern engineering practices. A true failure of an organization."
88,DocuSign,Great place to work with some drawbacks,2022-02-20,4.0,Software Engineer,"Amazing colleagues, great team environment",Extremely antiquated tech stack and slow moving ops team
89,DocuSign,Great company - highly recommend !,2022-02-20,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"-Straight forward interview process - from the first introductory call to the final interview/job offer took a total of 10 days.
-Positive attitude/culture within the company.
-Very friendly and supportive colleagues & managers.
-Quality training and onboarding process with lots of resources and a designated mentor.
-No micro-management - good autonomy within the role.",Nothing negative to say about the company.
90,DocuSign,The golden days are over,2022-02-20,4.0,Account Executive,"DocuSign is a great company. They treat their employees well, offer great benefits, stock options, mental health days, and are undoubtably the best product in the market.","Now is not the time to work in sales. Quotas are rising, territories are getting split in two year, seemingly year over year, and attainment is at an all-time low. DocuSign performed extremely well in the pandemic. However, continuing that growth at that rate was not realistic. Stock options are worth 40% of what they were due to management's inability to forecast our numbers.

The commercial org is really strugglingly across the board. OTEs are already incredibly low for market standards - and no one is hitting quota. 1/26 reps in the commercial FinServ org hit quota in Q4 (across all segments). People are unhappy and are really starting to look elsewhere. I worked at DocuSign for two years. Year one, virtually no turnover. In the past 6 months, there has been a ton (and many more are on the way out.)

There is no training program for sales. If this is your first sales job, it's sink or swim.

Our CEO told the company all-hands everyone would be getting raises. In the next call, our CRO specified - ""everyone but sales"". This really set the sales team off. The MDRS got raises, but the AEs and sales managers did not.

A relatively high performing MDR is out earning a commerical AE. Because of this, many MDRs don't even want to get promoted to AE - it's virtually a pay-cut if you're not an allstar AE."
91,DocuSign,It depends....,2022-02-18,2.0,Solutions Architect,Good Benefits and generally a good place to work.  Fair compensation and room for growth,"Too many silos and not enough synergy between cross-functional teams.  
Too much of a woke company.   Many wasteful hours and energy is spent on unnecessary woke courses when should be focused on working on technology that clients love.  
I recall one time we were forced to take a personality test, and an ""Ally"" course in which the instructor literally said white men take up more space in the room than any other rave.  welcome to inclusivity.  It was an awful experience and I'm not even white.

People are high quality, most of my friends i've met at DocuSign","I have been at DocuSign for a half decade and have never seen such a large exodus of talent. We missed hard H2 and management has decided to blame the salesforce instead of correcting their strategy. 

I have yet to talk to a single peer who is not actively looking for a new job. Our compensation was always a bit below market, now with teams averaging below 50% attainment and the market being red hot it no longer makes sense for people to stay.

We don't need more ""agreement cloud"" or sales training, we need an attainable quota and a salary that allows us to justify staying."

- CEO is untruthful in his promises to employees- makes us feel needy for asking to be heard
- People getting promoted only to make less money
- Upgrade from web department is a complete disaster
- AE's and MDR's having horrible relationship with each other due to the fact that management tells them completely different goals to focus on
- SEQUENCING EMAILS DOES NOTHING- just creates lazy reps who burn their books of business and have no idea how to actually build on their sales skills

129,DocuSign,Disastrously dysfunctional Legal Group,2022-02-06,1.0,Senior Legal Counsel,Most people are pretty good to work with.,"The Legal Department is an abject disaster. Other departments seemed to have a much healthier outlook, but I'm only commenting on Legal. Wow, where do I even begin?

1. The leadership at the top is the main cause. Fear pervades the entire department. The folks at the lower end of the org chart are ""fungible"". That's in quotes because that's what someone in leadership often said about her department. 
2. People are let go for no reason. People are let go because they refuse to work two jobs and only get paid for one. And when those people are let go, they are screwed over in multiple ways. I know someone who was let go mere weeks before stock vesting and bonuses. During COVID. Cruel.
3. People leave in droves. Mostly because of these reasons. They're always hiring NOT because the Legal department is growing -- it in fact shrunk slightly while the rest of the company was booming! -- but because they keep losing great people. This has continued into 2022. It's pathetic, really, the amount of turnover such a ""sexy"" company has in their legal department."

180,DocuSign,Working large accounts but selling SMB deals,2022-01-17,2.0,Sales Representative,DocuSign is the best of the best when it comes to eSignature. No one does it better with more integration points. Work from anywhere mentality. Uncapped commissions.,"They do not learn from their mistakes. Each year either the install teams or newco teams have a fantastic year, while the other suffers. Each new fiscal they change it up so the group that failed does better and the group that had success now fails. No one knows what they are doing when it comes to building out territories, verticals and quotas. They do not take into account any ideas from the frontline sales teams or their leadership. There are so many accounts with web plans and it's almost impossible to get them to spend more with a corporate plan when it's the exact same functionality. Deal sizes are very small and its impossible to hit quotas in newco. Very much a micromanagement style from leadership. There is no strategy put in place and there is far too much middle management. You will definitely not be ""doing the work of your life"" at DocuSign. If anything, you will be selling some of the smallest transactional deals in your career, with no possibility for promotion because goals are unattainable. It's all about the race to $5B in revenue and they do not care what they have to do to get there. Idea sharing is also frowned upon. It could be a great idea with a strategy to accomplish and you are told to get in line with the corporate vision or you are viewed as a ""complainer"". This goes for ways to improve sales, strategy to break into larger accounts, ideas on internal processes, leadership reviews, etc."

A lot of politics and alliances amongst senior leadership that is not good for the lower dogs.

194,DocuSign,"Good place to work, with caveats",2022-01-12,4.0,Product Manager,"- CEO is very open, candid, not aggressive (hard to find), and honest. He seems to be honestly listening to employees.
- Benefits are good, on par with or perhaps above what you'd expect from a SaaS company (even when the leadership thinks they are doing a lot). Shout out for providing the ability to put money on a post-tax 401k - this is huge, and very uncommon these days. At the end of day, we are just employees, living off a paycheck, who will need to save as much as we can to survive in the future.
- The main product (eSignature) works well, and solves real-life challenges, which is rewarding when speaking with customers.
- People are very nice in general.
- I acknowledge it must be hard to manage a company with thousands of employees. So, in any case, the effort is very much appreciated.","- Products other than eSignature do not work well, have a poor user experience, are hard to integrate, and take months to be ready to use. All of this makes selling those products very hard, and make a lot of people wonder if past acquisitions were a good move. 
- HR is very conservative and puts the company first (falls on the side of managers, does not look at cost of living (hot topic) from the perspective of employees, reduces salaries if employees moves to another state (hot hot topic), and more).
- Top commercial executives (COO, Sales) that took the company through IPO might not be the best suited to take the company to the next level. Last big quarterly miss, and lack of attention by those execs about it, might be an indication of it.
- There is a blatant lack of creativity/vision with regards to the future of the product(s). Lack of vision causes a very tactical product roadmap, which will come back biting the company in the next few years.
- Data mining is an incredible mess, providing data that one cannot trust, and I don't understand how the organization has not fixed this.
- The top product executive is uninspiring, and has been bringing a lot of middle-class, uninspiring executives. This concerns me as it is gonna affect the overall culture of the organization (too many Indian execs who lack, culturally, empathy and understanding of others - Note: just bringing more Indian executives does not make the company more ""inclusive"" or ""diverse"", and can have the opposite impact in the overall culture).
- Leaders leaving has taken away a lot of knowledge, which has not been replaced with equally talented and knowledgeable people.
- Top managers (Senior Director and above) becoming increasingly political."

- ""Enterprise Corporate Sales"" is an overlay roll supporting the Enterprise Field Rep's territory. As both a pro and con, I worked with a specific few amazing senior sales-folk who helped boost my sales acumen and professionalism. The role is really made or broken by WHO you work with directly in ECS. They are your pseudo-manager. 

- Great benefits and company-level employee care.","- This role specifically puts you in a position to face more internal than external friction. What do I mean? The adversity you face with tough customers and negotiations is superseded by the endless internal feedback loop you'll experience. Your manager will hawk over your sales calls and pick apart your weaknesses. That's semi-regular sales management practice, But it's accelerated with feedback from your pseudo-managers (the Enterprise Field Reps) who can literally control which deals you can and cannot close. There's little to no senior leadership level intervention. It is literally a game of personalities. 

- Internal CRM processes allow for Reps to be compensated then clawed back due to antiquated fields in their Salesforce. It's amazing how such a large global company can't manage to figure out a workflow in Salesforce to correctly compensate their overlay reps. 

- Expressed to HR that one low performing month and some anecdotal feedback from my ""superiors"" (the Enterprise Field Reps) suddenly put me on a performance plan trajectory. I was at 152% of my annual attainment, yet one month had my manager put me on thin ice. HR, as typical with big corporate, is out to protect the BUSINESS. They pretended to hear me out but passed the ball between different HR reps and never communicated important details, had to re-explain myself every time.

Too many silos between sales, order management/provisioning, customer success, and account management. This was being proactively address when I was employed but still had too many internal approvals holding up deals for days and days."

The first version was 1000 USD or equivalent in local currency. The second version was a clear act of discrimination against Latinos and Arab/Africans since the only operations that suffered this benefit cut were Brazil, Mexico and Egypt. All the rich and developed nations received the same amount as DS Cares 1. Those 3 countries received HALF of the value. DocuSign position itself, as mentioned in the career site, as : ""We will be fair and treat everyone equally. Equal pay, equal opportunity, EQUAL EVERYTHING"".

Several employees tried to argue with HR about this topic and no answer was provided by the HR until now. DocuSign has more than 8.000 employees and those 3 operation combined have less than 500 hundred employees. There is no reasonable explanation to cut half of the benefit of those 3 countries since the impact would be in 5% of the global workforce."

Many of the behaviors are contrary to the overall DocuSign culture and the one the IT group used to be like. Example: Much of the hiring circumvents typical norms like getting sufficient feedback prior to making an offer. Many of the hires in IT are friends or referrals but don't wait to get any feedback or discussion so the process is just a rubber stamp. To make matters worse, the new hire qualifications are questionable.

Another example is that some of the IT leaders ask employees to work weekends or holidays but do not show up to these additional meetings themselves."

238,DocuSign,DocuSign sold me a lie,2021-12-04,2.0,Market Development Representative,"Benefits, good culture (on the surface), great coworkers who are kind and helpful","I know these negative reviews get buried, but hopefully future sales employees (and management) will see this. Your success at DocuSign depends entirely on what team you wind up on. In my interview for my role, they told me over 90% of MDRs make quota. On some teams, absolutely. On MY team, about 40% of people make quota. It’s a big problem when you’re in the award meetings and some other teams are consistently hitting 200% of their team quota and your team is hitting 55% of your team quota. How is that fair? And now there will definitely not be a quota adjustment given last quarter’s abysmal earnings, so our team either has to suffer through and work harder to drive sales that just aren’t there or quit. 

Future sales employees at DocuSign please be warned. I wish I would’ve known the truth. This is an incredibly stressful environment and in order to try to get close to my impossible quota, I’m working 11-12 hour days plus one weekend day. The people who are hitting quota on my team are doing the same exact thing as I am. It is normalized on my team to be working these crazy hours (and we aren’t getting overtime pay for it because management says we are supposed to be able to do our job in our 8-hour work day). Also, nobody on my team is actually ever able to take lunch away from their desk, just something to note.

DocuSign has given us a week off in December. That is great, but how are we supposed to hit our quota losing 1/4 of the month plus all of our prospects being out of office for that week plus a few days too? No one on my team is planning on hitting quota in December because that quota is already too high + this week off will make it impossible. If they wanted to make us lose 25% of selling days in December, they should’ve adjusted quota down by 25% (not the measly 10% they did).

On the surface, everything is fine. The benefits are good, everyone is super nice, but management is ineffective and quotas for certain teams are impossible. The product is too expensive and that post Covid demand isn’t what it once was. I think employee discontentment on the sales teams will only rise in the coming months. Management, please do something."

It's a great feeling to know how the work we do at DocuSign directly impacts the company's direction/goals.","Fast pace of change can be challenging to keep up with.

246,DocuSign,Do not let the recognizable name fool you,2021-11-30,1.0,Market Development Representative,"Unfortunately there are far more cons than pros but if I were to have to think of some positives during my time at DocuSign i'd say the 401k match, stock plan, and overall benefits package were the best part. Otherwise, I wish I had never taken this job.","If you want to be a BDR/MDR/SDR go literally anywhere else. Their new business teams are struggling immensely meaning everyone on those teams are making a fraction of their OTE, there were some months where I wouldn't even have a commission check. Also in order to be promoted you have to meet a certain criteria and attainment so unless you're on a well performing team, there is nowhere for you to go. I watched people who started after me get promoted only because they were on a good team so it's strictly about numbers and luck. Also I would hardly consider the job inside sales.... sending mass email blasts and cold calling bad data teaches you nothing about actual sales and could probably be an automated job. 

In addition, they hire absolutely abysmal managers. I went through 3 managers during my time at DocuSign and only one of them was competent. The other two had no idea what they were doing or how to manage a team - I had never experienced such bad micromanaging. You hear from upper management maybe once a quarter and at the end of the day they will attempt to make your frustration feel heard but they could truly care less. 

Also they seem to be desperate for talent because a lot of the new hires seem to lack ambition and just accepted the job to have a job and not to learn and grow. But the interview process is the easiest interview process i've ever been through so I guess it makes sense how they're bringing in bad talent.

Maybe other roles/departments at DocuSign are better, but the MDR role and overall sales org in general is a trap and I would highly encourage anyone in sales to look elsewhere."

After leaving DS, I reached out to the CEO to share my negative experience. I had given the company Kudos in a LinkedIn post early on and he didn’t hesitate to jump on it with positive words. After being overworked, overlooked, and feeling I had no option but to resign, I expressed my disappointment with the experience, hoping to leave my department better than I found it, he began to give me previously undisclosed supposedly negative feedback. It was retaliatory, disingenuous and shocking behavior. I had received nothing but positive feedback during my tenure. Turns out the allyship Mr. Springer exhibits from one public platform to another is purely performative. He only wants to hear positive things about DocuSign from black women."

- The benefits are as good as the other two large companies where I have worked. Of course we don't have as big pockets as Big Tech however our compensation is very competitive; we have incentives and the company is performing very well right now!
- What I have stated year after year in my reviews here is that DocuSign hires the best people for each job in a thoughtful way - the people here are just plain nice - there aren't any a**holes here (well, nobody's perfect) - I continue to be very impressed at the quality of our hiring - even in a competitive market we continue to set the hiring bar very high and are bringing in excellent qualified talented people - it is such a pleasure to be surrounded by good people who are good at what they do - and good people who are kind, curious and motivated.
- I feel good about working here - our commitment to environmental sustainability - giving back - support for diversity and social justice - our adoption of Juneteenth as a corporate holiday says a lot about what we believe in

The company is making remote work as satisfying and as fulfilling and successful as possible - our company is well suited to remote work.","- we're not Amazon, Facebook or Google. But we don't chase after those things.

290,DocuSign,DocuSign isn’t a people first company,2021-10-25,1.0,Market Development Manager,-The product itself is good,"-Everybody is very underpaid compared to the market average

-They are NOT flexible with remote. They’re not giving us the choice to decide how often our teams need to be in office. This is the opposite of a people first approach. They’re calling it a ‘flex’ plan but it’s not flexible. It still requires everybody to commute each week, regardless of how the team is performing. 

-Recently they subtly sent an email saying even if you’re fully remote you need to be vaccinated or you’ll be terminated. They didn’t even host a town hall or address any questions. It was a very odd and sneaky way to approach a sensitive issue. 

-They don’t listen to feedback. Multiple surveys were sent out and the overwhelming response was that people didn’t want to return to office. Nobody misses their commutes. Yet they did nothing with this data. 

There’s plenty of other companies out there that will be flexible (actually flexible, so choosing when and how often you want to be in office, not forcing you to come in then calling it flexible) with remote work and will also pay you more money. 

I’d encourage  anybody looking for a job to check elsewhere first. This company used to be people first,  now they seem to smile and refer to themselves with this title, but it feels very empty."

However, with an ever growing business, things went downhill in the last years as management (upper level and direct managers) got more and more arrogant. Toxics managers that will make sure you shut up and only do your job (and will be celebrated for that).
People that are playing unfair will be favored. There is no conflict resolution but a “suck it up” mentality, not realizing they are playing with people’s income and mental health.
When trying to be vocal about it, they shut you down. I’ve seen a lot of great sales people joining the company and leaving a few months after. Don’t buy the hype."

So many complaints have been raised to HQ with no outcome. It’s a definite contributor to our disintegrated culture and incredibly sad how a single person can cause so much havoc during their short employment of less than a year."

That’s to be expected now that we are a large public company but salary needs to be increased so total compensation is still competitive in the market. All that said...DocuSign is still a great company and I’m hopeful quotas and/or salary will be adjusted next year to make it financially feasible to stay at the company.

I worked as an SDR for Zoom Info before coming to DocuSign and was making 80k/year. I came to DocuSign to ""level up"" into a higher sales position and it felt more like a marketing grunt roll. The whole MDR role is sending out mass marketing emails to different titles/industry-specific roles and then cold-calling prospects. The quotas are pretty hard to hit and seems like the executives are still on the pandemic high for sales targets which are now realistic. Sales territories keep getting broken up making it hard to hit quota and there is frustration amongst all of the SDRs and MDRs."

Most people here hold themselves accountable for excellence and hold others accountable too.,During this phase of growth there is a lot to be done and it’s hard for resources to keep up.
341,DocuSign,A company that care about their employees,2021-09-22,5.0,Receptionist,This is a great place to work. The people are friendly. The benefits are great! The company culture is great! There is company provided training if you want to advance or change your career.,They have some work to do in the area of Diversity & Inclusion. They are doing better and the CEO is taking the company in the right direction.
342,DocuSign,Growing Pains,2021-09-22,2.0,Account Executive,DocuSign hires well at the individual contributor level. They have plenty of money for additional resources in the tech stack. Our CEO is one of the best in the game. 100% employer paid benefits is awesome. We're a market leader and it's not hard to at least get meetings with customers / potential customers.,"Hyper growth has lead to plummeting eSat scores and rising attrition in the sales org. It's very hard to keep the magic in a company from pre-IPO to post. DocuSign managed to do this for about 2 years but has finally turned the corner to become just another tech company chasing $'s. It's no longer about the happiness of the employees let alone the individuals doing, ""the work of your life."" A mid-year change in go-to-market strategy has caused a huge rift between Renewal Management and Sales orgs. The main cause is that both teams are directly incentivized against one another. Depending upon which vertical you're in, you can expect around 15% of team to quota. Miserable numbers compared to years past. The DocuSign response has been throw as much change as possible, as quickly as possible to the problem (s) in hopes that something will stick. This 'fail fast' method works well at Amazon, it has not worked well at DocuSign. If you come in as an upmarket AE, expect to be doing your own account management and now your own pipeline generation. The MDR org is routinely turned over to either fill new AE roles because of the attrition or they get burnt out and move companies. The RM org will most likely not be around after this FY finishes. If you're interviewing upmarket, please ask as many questions as possible to the hiring manager. Ask the team % to quota, ask how many MDRs an AE has gone through the previous FY, ask how much pipeline is expected to be generated by the AEs, ask how many hours a week are spent on non-mrr generating activities, etc."

346,DocuSign,"Great company, bad position",2021-09-17,4.0,Market Development Representative,"Fantastic work culture, great training resources, very good products",Sales orgs are constantly going through changes that negatively affect reps.

360,DocuSign,Awesome company to work for,2021-09-13,5.0,Enterprise Market Development Representative,"I've been at DocuSign for just over 6 months now and can honestly say they are an incredible company. From the start, the training program was great (even the virtual version I attended) and they really set up their MDRs to succeed. The level of attention paid to putting their MDRs in the best possible position was refreshing - I haven't worked for anyone that cares as much about their employees. My manager is also amazing - best manager I've ever had. He has his employees' backs to the bitter end and will always go to bat for us. The company cares about health and wellbeing - mental health days and company shut down days are relatively frequent. Benefits are INCREDIBLE, pay is as good as you'd expect. The ethos of camaraderie and friendly competition allows great relationship building and lots of drive to be your best self. EVERYONE is open and willing to help at a moment's notice. 10/10","Since DocuSign is fairly well-established, there's limited room for flexibility in terms of running your own piece of the business - despite this, efforts are made to allow as much flexibility as possible. 

Promotions are time-based rather than solely merit-based, which can be frustrating if you're outperforming your peers and they're getting promoted ahead of you.

Commission cap at 300% is a pain, but allows more than enough room to make some good money."

Every company has its growing pains but they are at a bare minimum so not worth mentioning
376,DocuSign,From a good company to A Nightmare,2021-09-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"salary, benefits, learning programs, WFH","The work - life balance doesn't exist. It's 12h work a day or at least 10h. We are not paid for overtime so they should hire more people if they expect the work to be done instead of having 100 requests unresolved for months and people chasing continuously which was my case for about half a year until they finally though it was time to do something.

Team work? doesn't really exist either. For some reason I was asked to provide backup for my colleagues on one task or another but I wasn't provided with any in return when I went on holidays. Cannot take more than 2-3 days off at a time due to this issue. Also had really bad start with the team when they basically cornered me in a call and started shouting at me. I was shocked and when I told about it to my manager he started to manipulate the situation trying to make me feel guilty about being bullied at work. Retaliation at its best!

The managers will manipulate situations instead of providing solutions. So if under pressure I was told ""everyone is under pressure"". Yes, ok I get that, but there are conditions which can make someone's job less pressuring and making it a better environment, like good team work, back up when needed, change plans/tasks when someone is overloaded, let's figure out things to improve the overall ambiance.

Discriminatory behaviour within the team, biased behaviour, managers playing favourites etc. I found that on a team call there was a situation when one of my colleagues made an offensive insinuation to my address and the managers said nothing. This is only one of many examples that were just swept under the rug.

The managers want to be there only for the good times and jokes but when complaints happen they will only consider taking any action (if so) when more people in the team complain about the same thing. Since my work is separate for the most part from everyone else's my complaints are not taken into accountancy unless I've brought up the same problem about 60 times or more

Overall bad working environment if you care about your mental health and your life balance."

Growing Pains - It’s more obvious now than ever that DocuSign is trying to scale at the pace they were during COVID. Management feels the heat with large scale team changes and constant shifts in rules and teams. 

Linear Sales Path - Promotion is based off of time in seat and attainment. It doesn’t necessarily promote people who are great at their jobs and often times it can seem like there’s no progression in role past the first 5-6 months. Burnout is inevitable. It really depends on how you overcome it."

There is support at all levels of the organization for both personal and professional interests. The product is stable, intuitive, and innovative which makes it easy to sell, support, and drive. They do a great job hiring TRUE professionals that are also kind and collaborative.","As DocuSign continues to grow, it has taken on some of the traits of larger SaaS companies such as focusing on a number rather than the process. Overall, priorities still seem to be in a good place though."

2. Flexibility - I don't feel micro managed when I'm doing well and hitting quota.

3. Great company culture - In the 8 months that I've been at DocuSign, I've made some lifelong friends and mentors (including my Managers).

4. Ability to hit quota regularly as long as you put in the work (we have a great product, and customers are generally happy with our company's ability to improve their workflows).","Base Pay - If you are doing well, commissions help to make up for the slightly low base pay, but I'll be taking parental leave sometime next year, and will likely receive insufficient pay for however long I decide to stay home with the family. Seattle is an expensive place to live, and I'm not sure the base pay recognizes this harsh reality. 

Bottle Necks in getting promoted - It feels like there are so many XDRs being added to every team, I am a bit worried about promotion possibilities in the upcoming years.

- Teams need more accountability"
416,DocuSign,Amazing company to work for!,2021-08-10,5.0,Account Executive,"I love working for DocuSign! DocuSign is constantly growing and for a great reason. I work remotely and the flexibility of WFH is amazing.

I work for the Small to Medium Government (SMG) vertical, working with local government and K12 customers. SMG vertical is a very tight knit group and although all of my co-workers and teammates are in different parts across the country, I have grown very close with them. I always feel included.

The pay is on par with industry average and you are compensated for overtime with 1.5x pay, which is amazing. As an Account Executive, I put in additional time to make sure I can juggle all of my opportunities efficiently. Very happy that I am able to get compensation for my extra time I put in. It motivates me to work even harder, and I do not mind putting in the additional time.

The benefits are great as well. Health insurance is 100% covered.

Diversity & Inclusion is a strong motion in DocuSign, which is great to see.

Culture - Great culture, everyone is more than happy to help each other when needed. Amazing teamwork, which drives success.","Quota - DocuSign has experienced tremendous growth, accelerated by COVID in 2020. This led to very tough quotas for 2021, and only a select few Account Executives in SMG are achieving/over-attaining their quota. This is a big concern when only a small percentage of the reps in SMG are hitting their quota.

Customer/Technical Support team - Our customer/technical support team are terrible, for a lack of better words. DocuSign needs to hire more competent customer/technical support reps that actually know what they are doing. It is very frustrating as an Account Executive to have to step in and handle customer/technical support due to incompetency."
417,DocuSign,Caring Company,2021-08-10,4.0,Market Development Representative,DocuSign cares about their employees.,Difficult promotional track. Difficult to know what your options are.

Excellent team of motivated coworkers that are invested in each others' success. You will work a lot and the projects and customers tend to be very demanding, but that is balanced out by supportive management, fun coworkers and excellent benefits.

Growth-oriented with a well-defined growth path and success metrics make it clearer on how to progress in your career and the options available to you. 

Excellent, well-defined onboarding process with clear checkpoints.","You will work a lot and the projects and customers tend to be very demanding, which can be exhausting. I regularly work more than 40 hrs/week, and most other consultants seem to do so as well. Management is attempting to address this, but burnout is pervasive. 

As DocuSign grows, additional position levels and requirements have been added which have made career progression more cumbersome. There are a lot of requirements you have to meet in order to move the next ""level"".

PTO is 21 days, which is not very competitive considering the extensive hours worked by most employees."

My manager was also very invested in individuals growth on the team and it helps boost morale in a role that can be very stressful.,The way in which our quotas were made could be improved. I felt like sometimes my attainment wasn't fully able to be controlled by my output.

If you are looking for an amazing place to get started/continue your sales career, DocuSign is your place.",Only Con would be that they hire externally for positions that internal hires are looking to get promoted into.

There are always new benefits being rolled out.,Very fast moving and trying to bring their product suite together can be tedious. The company is growing at a fast rate which can sometimes lead to over work.
430,DocuSign,Narcissistic leadership,2021-08-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay was alright and there were a few paid days off during Covid,"I left a bad manager and unhealthy company culture.
Leaders at DocuSign focus most of their energy on blaming / shaming other teams for failed projects instead of developing strategies for collaboration and accountability to deliver value and reduce complexity. Managers here lack empathy and do not have the skills and capabilities to motivate every employee individually, nor to coach and develop their people by focusing on their strengths. Leaders here make decisions based on politics, not productivity. You will be excluded (or experience various forms of passive aggressive behavior) if you do not have a personality type like your manager or leadership team. Effectiveness in your role is not valued as much as likeability and fitting in. My manager had no interest in adding value to their team through empathy, mentorship and coaching. Their way of adding value was to force their team to have happy hours over Zoom, which the team participated in begrudgingly. My manager also actively prevented me from taking roles on other teams at DocuSign and never once discussed career growth opportunities or even asked me what I wanted to do in the future. Ironically the role I accepted at a different company is the same as the role my manager at DocuSign actively blocked me from pursuing. Leaders/managers here focus on protecting their own position and do not invest in retaining their most effective people. This is obvious through the consistently bad Pulse survey scores, and nearly every competent person on the team being a flight risk. Most top performing team members would leave if it weren't for the golden handcuffs. I would rather leave future money on the table so that this place is in the rear view mirror."
431,DocuSign,"Strong company, some technical debt",2021-07-31,4.0,Senior Product Marketing Manager,We've grown so quickly that we definitely have issues on the operations side. However these are good problems to have. I've felt well-supported in my time here.,Sometimes marketing can feel a little siloed here.

- 401k matching
- Employee stock plan
- Recognizable name on resume 
- Easy to get hired as an SDR, even if you don't have prior sales experience","- It's extremely hard to move up outside of the sales org, despite them making it seem easy to make lateral moves during interviews; feels like a bait-and-switch
- Unlivable base pay in pre-sales and closing roles, especially to be based in cities like Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, and Toronto
- Unattainable quotas that management refuses to reevaluate, even though they are clearly based on inflated COVID numbers
- Management is not realistic about quota, they tell you to keep dialing but fail to understand that we will never hit peak COVID numbers again 
- DocuSign claims to put ""employee's first,"" but refuses to listen to employees when we voice valid concerns about not being able to hit inflated quotas 
- Performative activism throughout the entire organization - carefully crafted email messages that go out detailing the amounts of money invested in organizations, yet DocuSign refuses to actually take a stance against injustice. Sometimes it's more harmful to try and stay ""neutral."" 
- Check their demographics online - the lack of black and brown representation throughout the company and in leadership is laughable 
- Majority of recent diversity and inclusion initiatives are led by white managers, mainly men - that should be enough said as to how problematic this is 
- Hires unethical people - when I say unethical I mean they hire people comfortable enough to rant about how BLM is a political issue in all company Slack channels,
- You will be surrounded by frat bros - enough said as to why this will be a detriment to your mental wellbeing 
- They are currently offering $4k a referral, which just feeds into the lasting issue of nepotism and invasion of the frat boys - having most of the people on the sales floor being siblings, in-laws, and frat/sorority connected should not be the norm in a major city. There will be no diversity if you only ever hire people who all pledged the same PWI organizations 
- Your success is based on your team, so good luck. Your manager may or may not be willing to advocate for you it is solely the luck of the draw 
- Management can be problematic at times, and by problematic I mean classist, prejudice, and won't bat an eyelash at blatant favoritism
- There are a lot of AE's here that are truly unprofessional; they no-show calls, don't communicate with SDR's, try and be shady (which is a problem because that is how we get paid), and some even have the nerve to be rude"

benefits. there's an array of benefits employees can enjoy - the usual medical stuff, pto, as well as other incentives like for gym memberships, or continuing education. i also particularly like the volunteer matching.

culture/management. so far, i am liking the open door policy and that the higher ups are getting the employees' pulse when making big decisions. there are a number of slack channels where employees exchange questions or opinions etc.

Most of the management on the SDR is senior and has great experience to help you become a better sales person. On the MDR side, a good portion of the management team has never closed a deal themselves and you are left to learn on your own. 

Pros:
Great benefits
Very welcoming culture
Great exposure for your resume
If you got in earlier great RSU package","Again with the growth there is a lot of hiring and in the sales roles this means almost no movement outside of a sales roles.

Today, it's a shell of what it means to hold that title. The culture is broken and politics have overrun everything. I was there long enough to see the political infighting spread like a virus. Unchecked by a management team that was disconnected while the employees create redundant functions to satisfy their ego's and personal agendas. Everyone is on some form of empire building contest with no regard for how it affects others. It really hurts me to see how far they've fallen. I've worked for companies 50x the size of DocuSign and never experienced so many peers going on medical leave to deal with the stress. The term ""stress and vest"" is a real thing at DocuSign."

It is exciting to be part of DocuSign which is growing so quickly and has a lot of potential ahead. I have confidence in our leadership to make the most of it.,If you're considering joining know that it is a lot of work. It is a busy and constantly changing organisation.

The perks for the employees are great and the product is loved by our customers.,"A lot of the systems are behind the growth goals of the company.

Sales Operations are clunky and ineffective, and the dirty account data often causes AE disputes and confusing account hierarchies. AEs often end up doing more administrative, billing and customer service work than selling."
503,DocuSign,Should have joined ages ago,2021-06-09,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"1. Perfect work environment: The reviews are not exaggerated, everyone (Managers, Seniors, Peers) is always willing to take time out to help you succeed, learn, and grow into the best version of yourself.

506,DocuSign,"Great benefits but...like others it's an echo chamber, and can't ask questions. Good launch pad into the next job.",2021-06-07,1.0,Software Engineer,"- The stock has been going up and it's been a great time to be at the company during a period like this
- The company has provided generous stipends during the pandemic
- Decent remote culture, but likely to change when things reopen
- There are times when there is a good work-life balance but when you're superior gets pressured into something or does not plan properly, which happens pretty often, then you're screwed","- The company promotes diversity but nearly everyone is from India or China on H1Bs...good luck if you're not part of that demographic.
- Because of the point above, it creates a status quo environment and a stay in your lane mentality. Innovation or new ideas? Forget about it.
- Recruiter does lowball you. Could have done a lot better after talking with other colleagues.
- Politics gets pretty heavy after you've been at the company for more than a year, so much that you don't really even code and are tasked with grunt work that no one else wants to do.
- Perhaps, the biggest con of all is the poor planning structure from management and then you have to comply to a deadline you had no hand in negotiating"

509,DocuSign,Don't believe the hype,2021-06-04,1.0,Account Executive,Our stock price continues to perform well but other than that I cannot think of any other positive aspects of working for this company,"Discriminatory promotional practices - Promotions are given based on popularity/ similarity to the hiring manager rather than merit. You can be a top performer with the longest tenure on a team and still never be promoted( Trust me I've seen it happen to multiple people) The worst part about this is the astounding amount of effort the company put into marketing to make it seem like diversity is an internal initiative. At the end of the day, it's all lip service and as a person of color, it's become borderline degrading to work for this company. 

No work-life balance - Many individuals on the sales team put in 10-12/hr days throughout covid to meet the demand. Our reward for our diligence was a 40% increase in our workload with a simultaneous decrease in compensation. They'll give you far more than 40 hours of work and then chastise you for not being able to get it all done. I've seen people cry, have full-on mental breakdowns and as of recently many are reporting health issues due to the sheer amount of stress they're under( Stomach ulcers, work nightmares, anxiety ect). 


Compensation - YoY you can expect a decrease in conpensation. Apparently, that's the DocuSign way."

550,DocuSign,Used to be great,2021-05-10,3.0,Market Development Representative,Was an incredible place to work a couple years ago. Still working alongside a lot of great people and appreciate the benefits,"Sales org is solely numbers based yet getting promoted requires you meet your number and bend over backwards for the greater team. Too much pressure on a “team” environment when my paycheck depends so heavily on how well I perform individually. Because of certain skills I possess, I’m constantly pulled into side projects to help the wider team but these projects heavily take away from me being able do what I need to do to hit my numbers. I notice this doesn’t apply to everyone, however. There are a few of us who take on these leadership roles while the rest of the team sits back and waits for the work to be done- plenty of time to focus on their quota attainment and get promoted to the next level. 

My distaste for the company began when Covid hit last year. Felt like our managers added in extra team zoom meetings because they didn’t trust we were doing what we should be. Over the months we’ve given feedback around zoom fatigue and wanting less meetings but this feedback was never put into action forcing me and others to fall into deeper burnout."

Dan Springer and C-level execs are actually really great people but are so high level I doubt they actually know what is going on at the individual office level...","I'll keep it short.. 

No room for growth in sales, unless you are already established -

I wouldn't recommend DocuSign to anyone in a junior or entry level position. Managers get hired exponentially so you won't have the same manager for more than a year. There is little to no promotions happening within the sales org for actual reps. Management loves hiring outside hires versus internal hires. An age old problem that typically tanks retention.

Toxic culture - 

If you're a ""yes man"" you will thrive here. You are expected to put your head down and not question anything being told to you, typical call center or recruiting firm behavior. Metrics are absurd and you were expected to do more even through the days of COVID with very little to work with. Additionally, DocuSign's sales org is an extremely siloed environment that has caused a hierarchical sales org which in turn, has manifested a ""bro-y"" culture. They rely heavily on external referrals so they keep hiring the same persona. In short, lack of diversity in some offices.

Outdated technology- 

One would think that coming to DocuSign means you will be well equipped with new technology. Nope, you are given a windows computer even if you have only worked off of Mac computers. Nicer apple products are only given to management; hence, the hierarchical environment. When we were actually in office, everything was pretty old from the building, to the desks, chairs, desktops etc. Truly was surprising because its well, DocuSign?!"

Aside from having a great product, they are continuing to grow and expand globally with no signs of letting up. Lots of career opportunities with positions opening and being created often. 

Great and attentive senior leadership.",None that I can think of at this time. Looking forward to going into the office.

Poor mapping between responsibilities and staff.

572,DocuSign,Be aware of the recruiters,2021-04-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"At first, it looks like a ""employee first"" company. Good work-life balance.","Once you sign the papers, you realize the recruiters low balled you big time (salary wise). Everything they say about ""This is the best we can do"" is a lie after you join and you hear how much other engineers in your band are making. Then you realize your manager is happy to ignore all the promises she made during the interview process. If you interview here, get the hiring manager to put everything in writing before you sign the offer. They're happy to ""forget"" about those promises made later."
573,DocuSign,Crazy time to work at DocuSign,2021-04-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,DocuSign is fantastic company. The company culture is great and it is committed to many causes outside the company. I am learning a lot and I am generally proud to work at DocuSign.,"Like any company experiencing rapid growth, there are growing pains with respect to the product offering. There is also a lot of turnover (or it feels like there is a lot of turnover - perhaps it's just my group), so that can be difficult. And then, of course, due to COVID, DocuSign is very busy right now so every day is hectic and chaotic."

577,DocuSign,The kind of culture where I could stay for the long-term,2021-04-16,5.0,Senior Manager,"DocuSign is at a great phase of growth, where there are tons of opportunities just waiting for someone to raise their hand and lead on the topic. If you do this, you will do well. I've been really happy with how I've been able to build relationships even having started remotely a year ago. At the same time, DocuSign is big enough that your basic support needs are covered, and there is capital available to be invested if you make a strong enough business case for your initiative.

Other pros: RSU packages are good (get them while you still can), many opportunities to get involved in social impact projects (3 days a year granted to Volunteer Time Off), generally good work-life balance","The only cons I can say are 1) there are some people just coasting, so if you're a go-getter you may need to follow-up with people frequently to stay on project timelines, and 2) Diversity in our leadership team is poor and inclusion/equity initiatives are nascent. Leaders are well-intentioned and stepping into uncomfortable spaces, but we are behind compared to some other tech companies."
578,DocuSign,Truly getting to do the work of my life,2021-04-16,5.0,Director,"DocuSign is fast, innovative and making an impact and I feel that each and every day I get to build something new that will outlast me and add value not just to tech but to the future workforce. I have worked in many industries and functional areas and have never had such a positive overall career experience. I joined DocuSign a mere six months prior to Covid and for another organization, this could have spelled disaster, however, at DocuSign...the need to partner, to build, to run fast, well that only led to deeper connections (friendships) and my awe at how a tech company could be at once humane and on point for product delivery and customer success. I know I work here so it may feel cliche, but I am also a fan.","Growing pains can create bumps, but also opportunities if you are so inclined. YOU need to decide who YOU are and what YOU want. DocuSign is pretty clear on who we are endeavoring to be."

- Company growth prospects are huge (lots of untapped market opportunity)
- Not a lot of politicking or red tape
- Good access to data that helps drive decision making
- Haven't run across any jerks - Good people to work with
- Recent product developments, both organic and inorganic, are very promising","- Some back office functions (payroll, accounting) are a mess. Lack of strong leadership in these key areas, although some recent leadership hires give me hope for improvement.
- Not always clear how decisions get made and who makes them
- Some management has been around for a long time and don't know anything else besides DocuSign"

584,DocuSign,"Company Doesn't Just Talk the Talk, but Walks the Walk",2021-04-14,5.0,Director,"Extremely caring about employee health and wellbeing, with COVID being only the latest example. A great support structure, very flexible when you are dealing with person issues, tremendous parental benefits, and very serious about employee feedback, with the goal of continual improvement. Working hard on diversity, from women to persons of color. Not just cheap talk, but action.",Can be bureaucratic at times. Might be a sign of the growth and size of the company.
585,DocuSign,The best company I have worked for.,2021-04-14,5.0,Subscription Management Support Expert,"I have been working here for 6 months now and I like it so far.
Everyone here is super nice and helpful.
Management is very caring about their employees, and upper management surprises us with Company days off every once in a while which I appreciate the most.

I also like the fact that there is a work life balance.","None so far, everything is up to standards"
586,DocuSign,Amazing Work Life Balance,2021-04-13,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"Incredible, intelligent and thoughtful people. Amazing culture with an emphasis on work life balance. The company truly wants you to be happy, successful and make an impact in your role.","The ONLY thing I could say is that they’re still trying to get internal information set for our continued growth, so it can be hard to find details to help you do your job. BUT the people are always so willing to help and point you in the right direction."
587,DocuSign,"High growth, high demands",2021-04-13,5.0,Account Executive,"DocuSign has huge growth potential and has invested heavily in a path $5B in revenue. Our customers rely upon us to support core components of their business in Sales and HR. Our customers also look to us to adapt and grow into the future by improving their systems of agreement. If you like to sell solutions, this is a good spot for you.

DocuSign's leadership suite is led by an empathetic and approachable CEO in Dan Springer, who is thoughtful, articulate, optimistic, and kind. DocuSign is a progressive company that values its employees, it's customers, and it ability to make an impact in the world by eliminating paper processes.","DocuSign is process heavy, and many of those processes are manual. As an AE, everything from data mining to customer support falls upon your shoulders, in addition to a monster quota and the burdens associated with inflated SaaS contracts. You'll spend a lot of time deflecting minuta in this role."
588,DocuSign,Best Company Ever,2021-04-13,5.0,Account Executive,Love working for DocuSign and having such a diverse and supportive team!,Unsure if we can stay remote
589,DocuSign,Toxic culture mostly from leadership,2021-04-13,2.0,Project Manager,The benefits are generally very good.,"Toxic culture where blaming people rather than healthy discussion is the mode of communication. If someone is upset with you, you will never hear it from them but instead through word of mouth all the way to the top when the most direct method would have been to open a dialogue. Change in a large organization is hard; it is harder when there is a complete lack of communication from the top to get buy in."

- Company wide allyship training and seminars offered throughout the year aimed to educate employees on social justice and other important current issues","While I agree that there are great benefits offered, I would like to see the Company remove the primary-caregiver requirement for parental leave and move past the idea that only one parent is more responsible for the care of a child."
592,DocuSign,A great company to work for,2021-04-13,5.0,Senior Manager-Product Information and Content,"Excellent at hiring - staff is uniformly smart, competent, kind, supportive, cooperative, understanding. Company is very committed to both the personal well-being and professional growth of the staff. Lots and lots of training available, both internal and externally - up to $5,000 per calendar year for degree/certification programs, other funds for conferences and other trainings. Clear values, clear expectations of managers that results in staff being well-supported and empowered to advance and grow. Excellent benefits - the range of benefits is extensive - for example, legal assistance, mental health benefits, wellness benefits, etc.","The company is a mix of startup and well-established. This has pros and cons - while they are willing to throw enough people at a problem, process issues can fester before being solved. Everyone wants to improve processes, and they do improve, but more slowly than anyone wants."
593,DocuSign,Great place to work but has it's issues,2021-04-13,4.0,Manager,"DocuSign actually trains their managers, Real product roadmap that you can believe in, great internal teams that help support you as an employee, collaboration between teams has improved vastly from 3 years ago.

3. Vary caring Company- have been provided a ton of support including financial support during the pandemic. The company does everything possible to take care of their employees, including free office shut down days so everyone can take break from meetings and rejuvinate
4. Diversity & Inclusion - as a minority, I feel included and appreciated. This is the best I have seen so far in Bay area Tech companies",None so far that I can think of

The company's focused on the employees and their satisfaction. Great culture - small company feel although not small. Great job with the virtual onboarding.,The operational processes and Executive Assistant laddering could be improved. Work in progress... Definitely not a deal-breaker by any means.
599,DocuSign,Great people first company,2021-04-13,5.0,Billing Specialist,DocuSign believes that the employees on the frontline drive the success of the company and it shows in the initiatives they have for employee well-being and happiness. This drives the underlying sense of community that otherwise might not be there due to the size.,DocuSign is a large company that can sometimes feel disconnected especially between the expectations for different departments. Sometimes it seems like their is lacking a top down call out foe the different expectations in different departments. This can be important where different departments overlap such as in sales and finance. A better understanding or at least a more committed understanding of the way your role overlaps with others would raise efficiency and employee happiness.

- Your experience will be largely dependent on the leadership competence of middle managers who are VERY variable. Mine was a sexist and a micromanager, others are great. 
- Your job may be misrepresented to you. My recruiter did an amazing job selling me on DocuSign, so much so that it was definitely oversold. The responsibilities of my role were completely over-stated and over-leveled. 
- Teams are averse to change, innovation, having a strategy, looking at data, or anything that resembles coherent planning. They make decisions based on what they “feel” will work."

Even-though I hit my numbers, did everything the jobs required she still found cause to kick me out. This person has a big ego with no substance behind it. It comes down to being exactly like she wants you to be, if not, you're out."

647,DocuSign,Compelling Work; Even better people,2021-02-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"I worked in the tech industry for many years and happily progressed on my career path when a recruiter from DocuSign reached out to me. I used their products over the years and was aware of their frequent high ranking on the 'best places to work' list but wasn't actively looking for new opportunities. The recruiter, her name is Priya, was very personable and affable in her 'cold call' email. Her initial email was so personal that I felt compelled to thank her for reaching out. In short succession, and without 'sales pressure,' she connected me with a hiring manager. Again, it was a great first impression meeting with the Hiring Manager, and we were able to find a role that makes good use of my strengths and offers plenty of personal and professional growth. 

I've been with DocuSign several months, enough for the honeymoon period to wane (and vague enough so I can't be fingerprinted for this review), and I still feel compelled to write this review. I've found a great role; it is industry-leading in its charter (i am keeping it vague here), I work hard (this is a good thing), and I am challenged daily.

DocuSign's corporate consciousness aligns strongly with my own values; environmentalism, social justice, prioritizing mental health among their employees, work-life balance.",have not found any cons really.

I love everything about working for DocuSign, except the lack of career growth opportunities.","Your success and promotional eligibility as an MDR is solely based on what team you are on. Some teams are at 120%, while other teams are at 50%. DocuSign hired too many MDRs and territories are decades old. As an incoming MDR, I would be hesitant to join this Org. The promotional path outside of sales is even more unattainable due to recruiting focusing on external hires, rather than promoting from within. Many talented MDRs are stuck and are forced to leave."

Since being remote management has become more micromanaging, less flexible/understanding and no matter how much you work or get done, how many contests you win, it's never enough. On top of the micromanaging, having management talk down to their employee's with a condescending tone during team meetings or 1-1s does not set the tone well for those meetings.

Not very diverse, everyone in upper management is white. This could be improved upon."

Amazing Coworkers","Our executive board are in the global top 1% and if you think they care about the other 99% you’re wrong and how this company has changed over the last four years completely backs me up on where their priorities really lay. (I’ll give you a hint it’s not their employees it’s their brokerages) 

Dan our CEOs salary is 60x what I make per year if I hit OTE.. I like Dan he’s a nice dude this just yells wealth inequality. Dan’s labor per year is not worth 60x mine. On top of that Dan got 1 million shares when starting at DocuSign 4 years ago which is 1000x what I got when I started at the same time..... 

Add in that our territories for FY22 have shrunk substantially while quotas have increased substantially while our profit and earnings per share has never been higher. To me this YELLS that DocuSigns executive board does not care about their employees rather they care about their shareholders first and foremost BECAUSE our executive board are the largest shareholders. As an employee I feel like there is this media blitz about employees first yet I see what is actually happening and how we’ve changed over the last 4 years and I would say we do not put employees first as shown by our CEOs ridiculous pay and share allocation and how they are making it harder and harder for their sales staff to make good money bc lower sales payout inherently helps our share price. This is representative across our entire C suite. To me when I found this out my view on Dan and our entire executive board has completely changed and I am frankly disgusted."

They push the progressive narrative through your throat in every company event. I came to the US from Latin America and have my own values. This company says it's all for diversity, but it's not true. They don't accept people who dare question their progressive dogmas.

On the other hand, management has a top-down approach, at least in the projects I've been involved in. I provide context for product decisions based on research, but they still won't listen, because they're driven by their assumptions.

The company has a clear strategy and path to growth, capable and inspiring leadership, and a product that people love. We are focused on actively discussing and improving D&I efforts, and there are a broad range of employee resource groups so you can find ""your people"" within the organization. Comp and benefits are excellent.  

Remote work note: DocuSign has committed to being employee-first after the pandemic subsides, and all of their actions during the pandemic point to them keeping their word. We already have team members who are remote full-time,  and the company is investing in processes and systems that will enable remote work in the future.",The company experienced dramatic growth in 2020 due to external circumstances and acquisitions. Some processes are still catching up to the new size and complexity of the organization.

694,DocuSign,Internal Promotion System is Broken,2021-01-25,2.0,Market Development Representative,"DocuSign's product is superb, and upper management's vision is forward-thinking. Company provides generous compensation, and has handled COVID-19 strategically with genuine thoughtfulness for their employees. The Sales Org sets up the Account Executives for success.","Major issues within the Sales Development org. SDRs are easily promoted to MDR positions - simply by picking up the phone, and following up on warm leads. 
 But DocuSign has over hired for the MDR role. With so many people trying to get to the AE level, promotion criteria is as stringent as ever. This is problematic because DS is at a point in their maturity where an MDRs sales abilities no longer matter - but their success, and thus chances to be promoted, is dependent on which team they land on. Some teams average over 160% attainment, while others are hovering around 55% attainment. Thus, top talent on poor-performing teams are being forced to leave the company. Morale in the MDR org is at an all-time low. Managers respond to complaints by saying ""we understand"" and ""we hear you"", but do not actually implement meaningful changes. If you are an incoming MDR, be warned that you could be getting set up for failure."

697,DocuSign,Baffling,2021-01-23,1.0,Software Development Engineer,"DocuSign is very empathetic and provides employees with work life balance emphasis. Releases are also very slow, so there isn't much stress in trying to deliver in a timely manner. DocuSign engineering is also very political - so it is also very easy to dodge work by playing politics. It's a great place if you are looking for a 10-5 job, don't care about technical growth, and make a career out of politicking with other B-player engineers and managers. The stock is also doing well, so you can expect something cushy if you do end up working there.","As I read through the 5 star reviews from engineering, I can't think of how DocuSign can seriously be a 5-star place from an engineering perspective. The tech stack is severely outdated and everything is monolithic. All the main services have different release cadences which makes it a nightmare to release new features and bug patches in a timely manner. There is also a very silly ""change request"" form and a ""release form"" that need to be filled out and ironically are done through the DocuSign product that gate the release process. I found this to be very ineffective, as these forms usually took a long time to be approved, and didn't stop the number of fires and rollbacks on a frequent basis. As another reviewer also has mentioned - DocuSign believes in reinventing the wheel when it comes to tooling. Everything from deployment tools, monitoring, test automation, feature flagging, and other infrastructure was done through poorly written home grown tools. It's a joke how any engineer can grow their technical skills here - personally speaking, I spent more time politicking in meetings than coding, which is why I regret having been at DocuSign for so long.

DocuSign engineering also has a culture of blame. Instead of solving problems together, people have this bunker mentality to blame other teams or individuals for fires rather than actually work together to prevent these things from happening. It goes to show how silly this place is. I recommend only coming here if you are looking for work life balance above everything else, if you want to do your engineering career a favor, look elsewhere."

We have a yearly survey and our CEO actually reads through all the comments and make action items based on what he reads. 
They invest a lot into our personal and professional growth.
We have an Education Assistance Program which is $5000 to further our education. 
My colleagues seem to actually care about their work and how it makes the company better.

743,DocuSign,Great Culture and Career Growth,2020-12-09,5.0,Compliance Manager,"Culture:
DocuSign has an extremely supportive culture that is generated from the top down. The executive leadership, like most companies, gives plenty of lip-service to a desire to have happy employees. DocuSign is one of the rare businesses where leadership follows through on that desire. In just the last year, during COVID, we've had a couple of impromptu employee appreciation holidays. We've had multiple rounds of funding for building out WFH infrastructure which has made the COVID experience a bit easier. 

During the summer, our leadership stood firmly with BLM. One example was giving employees Juneteenth off as a company holiday. This was an impressive acknowledgement of the duality of American history by celebrating the emancipation of slaves in the same way that we celebrate our independence from Britain. This, along with a number of different workshops and guest speakers centered around understanding bias and diversity demonstrate a firm commitment to creating an inclusive culture. It seems like every company-wide discussion has a section committed to our various diversity and inclusion initiatives. 

Career Growth:
DocuSign is growing quickly. Whether it is through new products / acquisitions or entering new markets, there are a lot of opportunities to develop new processes and learn new skills and compliance frameworks. 

Compensation:
Above average as is typical of the tech industry. Other benefits, such as the fitness equipment stipend, have made the COVID experience much more manageable. The key is that work-life balance is attainable in DocuSign. Leadership is committed to employee welfare, of which work-life balance is a key component.","There aren't many downsides specific to DocuSign. The rapid growth of products, acquisitions, and markets has certainly been challenging to keep up with. Despite the challenges, as stated above in the pros section, the rapid growth has created plenty of opportunities for professional growth."

I can’t speak to how hard they try to make me feel supported and grow my career. The product is not super exciting on the surface, but there are a lot of machinations under the hood. It’s also exciting that DocuSign as a whole is moving towards being a multi-product company, giving me as a designer a great deal of opportunity to work on a portfolio of almost 60 products.","The same as any company of this size—inefficiencies in processes, lots of meetings."

767,DocuSign,Do the Work of Your Life,2020-11-11,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),DocuSign is a company that genuinely cares about it's employees. They provide amazing benefits and the pay is pretty good for a recent college graduate in the position I currently hold. They provide a launchpad for sales people looking to get their feet wet and grow with an amazing company. Management is the best at DocuSign and transparency is never a problem. They provide a crazy amount of PTO and match any donations to non profit organizations. I can't get across how awesome the company culture is here and how great the people are within the organization. The executives make you feel like you're one door down even though we're virtually remote right now. DocuSign will keep growing and I am more than excited to be a part of this awesome organization.,"As we grow, opportunities for internal promotion are more competitive and less seats are open in the next positions. Not so much a con, as competition for positions is needed and pushes us all to be better in the XDR org."
768,DocuSign,Couldn't be happier,2020-11-09,5.0,Market Development Representative,"I joined DocuSign earlier this year, as the company transitioned to a remote environment. Since then, I have been blown away by the level of support and accommodation that everyone -- leadership to management to colleagues -- have shown. The onboarding was well-communicated and organized. I can't recall ever contacting a colleague about meeting to learn something new, and they weren't totally willing to help. One thing I love here is the transparency -- Dan and Joan answer every question in real time during all-company calls. We published our diversity numbers on our website a couple of months ago. We were recently given a personal day off to avoid burnout. The product itself is great and continues to evolve. The work can be fast-paced (probably a result of the growing demand of digital solutions), but work-life balance is phenomenal. Nothing but positive things to say.",None - keep supporting new hires and add to an already amazing product.

770,DocuSign,A+ for everything except recruiting,2020-11-05,5.0,Market Development Representative,"Amazing company with great culture, people and benefits","Recruiting department seems to go out of its way to bungle any attempt at properly doing its job. A recent round of promotional interviews was delayed one week. Then pushed out two additional weeks because it was EOQ. Meanwhile, external hires were interviewed and given offers, and internal hires were told there was not headcount for promotion. They made this announcement the day interviews finally began. To make matters worse, recruiting would not allow promotion eligible employees who were mislead about promotion availability to apply for any additional roles. So if someone only applied to a limited number of positions, they very well could have been shut out entirely and forced to remain in their current role for an additional 3 months - at minimum. 

To provide a little recap, I personally spent at least a full day's work preparing, talking to managers, and shadowing team members for roles that were rescinded. This was a giant waste of everyone's time. And because recruiting is inept, this prevented everyone else from doing their actual jobs."

Fun culture (when in the office), good benefits as far as health expense, commuter benefits, stock, etc.","You will not be able to move up in the company, management between each of the sales org tends to be disconnected from each other. Just because you perform well in your current role, you will be required to interview for the next position along with all of the other external applicants. Timlines on promotion are constantly being pushed back, HR can never get it together in time for your interview date so that tends to be postponed."

774,DocuSign,A truly customer and employee centric organization,2020-10-29,5.0,Customer Success,"I have worked for DocuSign for almost three years and have seen the transition and growth the company has experienced. In particular over the last six to eight months during the pandemic, the acceleration of DocuSign as a company but more importantly, how it has continued to invest in it's customers and it's employees. 

I feel truly fortunate to work for an organisation where they have placed their employees front and centre of everything they have done. DocuSign have provided things such as technology budgets to allow for remote working, company days off to help employee's unwind during such difficult climate. Confirmation of an extended holiday break to help employees recharge during the off season, all things which are invaluable to me as an employee.

Furthermore DocuSign continues to invest in hiring great talent and accelerating it's business to support our growing customer base to ensure the best business outcomes for everyone adopting our technology.","When looking at the broader climate, there really are no cons to share about DocuSign.

The company is performing really well and is rapidly growing. Plus, the executives have demonstrated a level of commitment to social and environmental responsibility, diversity, and inclusion that is unparalleled at any of the major brands that I've worked for--and they back that up by putting resources against it, making strategic investments, and tracking their impact to hold themselves accountable.","Honestly, there aren't many that I have experienced. If anything, I might say that the culture feels more indirect (perhaps even a bit passive at times) than I have experienced at other tech companies. That's not a bad thing, just something to be aware of if you're new to the company and your style is more direct."

802,DocuSign,Wonderful place,2020-10-06,5.0,Account Executive,"I started DocuSign at the beginning of the pandemic in March. I can honestly say it was the best choice I've ever made to join this company. I have not interacted with one person that isn't supportive and willing to drop everything to help you. There is a lot of training at the beginning, but I had to do a lot of self-learning to immediately hop onto calls and get the ball moving. Management and Execs have been making a huge effort to make sure everyone is supported and connected during WFH.","Days can be long because there's so much work to do, but it's not overwhelming. Really no cons."
803,DocuSign,Couldn't recommend enough,2020-10-06,5.0,Market Development Representative,"Great culture & people, extremely competitive salary with excellent benefits (allowance for gym/mobile/home office equipment health & dental insurance/pension etc.) management is excellent, teams are all friendly and willing to help each other, a very transparent organisation.","Company has been growing fast so there can be a lot of changes without much warning, not all teams are growing at the same pace which can limit chance for progression"
804,DocuSign,DocuSign experience,2020-10-06,5.0,Market Development Representative,"I have worked here for over a year now and have been so impressed with the company. The sales culture is competitive yet all of my teammates and my manager show that they genuinely care about my success. DocuSign has also done a great job during COVID-19 making sure that their employees are set up for success while working from home.
Great benefits from wellness stipends to full health, eye, and dental converage.",Hard to think of any here but the one that comes to mind is the track to promotion to become an Account Executive is very long.
805,DocuSign,This company really cares about their employees,2020-10-06,5.0,Senior Manager,"The benefits are amazing and they understand the challenges of working remotely during the COVID-19 crisis. 
They have lots of ways to connect with their employees through town halls, fireside chats, and quarterly updates.",We are growing rapidly and the work is never done (not really a con except that there could be the potential for burnout so take your PTO!).
806,DocuSign,A Company That Really Cares About Customers and Employees,2020-10-06,5.0,Senior Manager,"Generous benefits, a wonderful culture where customers and employees are put first, big enough to have structure and small enough to avoid excessive bureaucracy. 

What impresses me the most is that leadership supports its employees which is critically important in times like these.

This is, without a doubt, the best organization I've been a part of.",Constant change can be a con for some but for many it keeps things exciting.
807,DocuSign,"Great product, solid culture",2020-10-01,4.0,Account Executive,"Working for a well run, recognized, and respected company. Great product.","Comp plan was/ is below market, and if you are in the wrong territory, it can be a struggle. Account alignment is not equitable."

- Strong leadership during COVID pandemic and commitment to diversity

- Exciting problem space: no other company touches the individual consumer all the way to Fortune 500 businesses and governments across the world. 

- Also, becoming the future of agreement is so cool, especially in the context of how different cultures across the world agree and building products to service those needs.

- Rapidly growing stock price lol","- Could have stronger pay/benefits

- Sometimes can feel not as exciting as flashy tech startups

- Product culture could be stronger"
809,DocuSign,Good post grad job but still sales job,2020-09-27,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Generous benefits, good managers, other SDRs are very outgoing and fun, good work life balance, Docusign wants you to have a life and does not demand too much time","The AEs can be pretty hard to work with, which is hard because you rely on them to hit your quota, calling random people as you might expect is not always the most fun thing"
810,DocuSign,"Great company, great benefits",2020-09-25,5.0,Software Engineer,Docusign really cares about your professional growth and your personal life.,I can’t think of anything.

812,DocuSign,Decent during the pandemic,2020-09-22,4.0,Market Development Representative (MDR),"Steady work, able to work from home","Low pay compared to other tech, hard to get promoted"
813,DocuSign,"Great company, slightly antiquated in some ways for a tech company",2020-09-21,4.0,Account Executive,"Great product, awesome selling it. As a sales person you are definitely set up for success and have the potential to smash your targets. It feels great being part of a company that is already solid but still has a ton of market to go after.
The stock is great though, and ESPP worth setting up. Great benefits. 
SUPER switched on company culture when it comes to social issues. The CEO puts his money where his mouth is as well. Great speaker series on inclusivity and diversity, great to also see more women being promoted to key leadership positions.","The comp isn't as good as most other tech companies I've worked for, although the goals are more achievable.
When on ramp, you don't get paid your OTE during training. I started in mid-July and won't see my first commission check until the end of September, and they don't pay equivalent OTE for the interim - that was a bit of a shock and disappointing, especially as the comp package is lower than the industry average in my experience.
Also - decelerators after hitting quota on ramp makes it less motivating to push to overachieve."
814,DocuSign,Great Company to work for !,2020-09-21,5.0,Adoption Consultant,Care about Employees Well-being and a product that make a difference,No significant negative points so far
815,DocuSign,Excellent Company to work for.,2020-09-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Community, Growth, Senior leadership empowers the workforce",There are some silos for departments. More interdepartmental interaction would benefit the company.

* Work Life balance is highly valued and encouraged
* Benefits are really amazing
* Culture and Vibe in the office is super positive and lively
* Very diverse work-force with many Employee led groups for all types of interests and cultures",* IT is lacking. IT infrastructure is outdated and sometimes makes it a pain to work when the machines they provision are so slow and unresponsive.
819,DocuSign,"Great leadership, common purpose, interesting work, awesome coworkers",2020-09-17,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"Starting with the executive team and on down through the relatively flat management ranks, everyone I've worked with has been extremely talented, but humble and hard working too. Executives frequently join customer calls when asked, and give their time and effort to their teams. Our CEO Dan leads by example in many ways. This quote describes his style: 'Where there is humility, there is more success, and lasting success.' – Patrick Lencioni

DocuSign really does care about their employees. I'm continually surprised by their generosity, whether it's giving a surprise extra day off, or giving remote workers a significant extra expense fund to equip their home offices during the pandemic. Compensation is fair, bonus plans are excellent if you work hard, and benefits are better than I've ever had at prior companies. 

My manager built an amazing team and we have a real sense of common purpose, camaraderie, and willingness to help each other be successful. 

DocuSign clearly demonstrates that happy employees lead to happy customers, which results in happy shareholders. I'm thrilled to be part of DocuSign!",None that I can think of
820,DocuSign,Once-in-a-blue-moon opportunity to work for a true market maker,2020-09-17,5.0,Value Engineer,"Amazing vision, inspirational leadership. DocuSign is creating a new category: agreement clouds. Customers get it and so does Wall Street. It truly feels like we are the next Salesforce, and agreement clouds the next CRM.",DocuSign moves (very) fast and is ruthless about performance. Faces change quickly and often as leaders who don't make the number get pushed out with little warning or ceremony. Reporting lines are also subject to constant change. This can sometimes feel unnerving.
821,DocuSign,Excellent place to work,2020-09-17,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"The culture is fantastic, great perks, great work/life balance, great career progression.","No Cons as of yet, very happy to be working for this company."

I 100% made the right move. I went from good to great. I'm blown away by how people honestly want to just help you. Also, our senior staff is really accessible. Willing to jump on external and internal calls. Love the fact we are in growth mode and we continue to focus on talent. They truly treat employees as their biggest asset.","Overall DS has great benefits however, I wished they offered slightly better vision plan."

- earnings potential",- haven't been able to identify any cons yet
827,DocuSign,"Mediocre people and tooling, but good work life balance",2020-09-14,3.0,Software Engineer,"Speaking only for engineering: the compensation, time off, and parental leave are generous. People work between 30-40 hours a week on a lot of dev teams. The product itself is useful, automates drudge work, and is good for the environment, so it's something I'm proud to be helping deliver. We're also very proud of our sites' security and uptime.","Speaking only for engineering: the organization is under-invested in tooling (prefers to re-invent the wheel badly than bother learning how to use industry standard open source tools). Doing the simplest programming tasks turns into days-long misadventures due to no serious will to pay down tech debt and lack of docs. We have slow release cycles like an old company. ""Tenured"" engineers tend to have a bunker mentality and hate other engineering teams the farther removed they are from them. People generally feel too far behind to put any serious effort into helping their teammates (varies by team). Companies acquired by DocuSign are often not gracefully integrated in engineering processes, and are often asked to adopt inferior practices to their own. Some people in operations work 50-80 hour weeks and work in a toxic atmosphere. People talk about diversity a lot but mostly hire white and Asian dudes. Women in engineering generally don't like working here."
828,DocuSign,Are you doing the work of your life?  At DocuSign you are!,2020-09-14,5.0,Customer Success,"The company has a simple mission/vision statement, and that is to be the best Agreement Cloud in the market. Leading this vision is Dan Springer, the CEO of DocuSign. His Leadership and coupled with his strategic vision, make DocuSign a great company to be.

Folks at DocuSign are competitive, which in turn makes you want to be as competitive. But that doesn't mean that its cutthroat or every man for himself, far from it. DocuSign's culture of Empathy and compassion is its cornerstone of success. It allows employees to feel safe and focus on the work of their lives!

830,DocuSign,Most fun I have had in years...,2020-09-14,5.0,Sales Leader,"DocuSign is a great employer. The environment is fun, supportive, diverse, and focused on customer success.They have been very supportive to employees during COVID, providing us the tools to work remotely and conduct customer meetings remotely. They gave us a generous reimbursement to cover COVID costs including child care, which was a big help to me and the other working parents. Leadership is very supportive of the employees, providing us with a lot of virtual training opportunities to improve our professional skills. They also support our philanthropic efforts with generous matching funds and support for volunteer hours served.","It is a fast growing company, so some processes and support teams need maturity to support our growing enterprise business. We try to be lean, so we can keep costs down for customers, but sometimes that results in marketing opportunities missed."
831,DocuSign,Best place to work,2020-09-14,5.0,Senior Business Analyst,"I have been with Docusign for 3.5 years. It's the best place I've ever worked within the last 10 + years. 
- Love our CEO Dan who embraces servant leadership
- Enjoy working for my manager who is very caring, competence and understanding
- Work with very smart and talented people
- Stock has been doing REALLY well!!!
- The company listens to employee's feedback
- Great work life balance, sustainable place but still get things done","- Typical fast growing pains 
- Lack of sabbatical benefits (although we recently rolled out unpaid leave which is different)"
832,DocuSign,DocuSign Supports Learning and Development,2020-09-14,5.0,Data Analyst,"- There's a high level of trust amongst those I work with
- I've been given the opportunity and encouraged to explore and grow in my areas of interest
- I feel like my work truly has an impact on the team and the company

-coworkers who always have each others' backs 
-opportunities for professional development

836,DocuSign,Growing fast and a bit chaotically but still a good place to work,2020-09-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Good compensation plan - generous stock grant and bonus.
- Acceptable benefits.
- Humane expectations of people working during COVID: no one is being pushed to deliver more or keep certain work hours to deliver more just because they're at home. This is PRICELESS.
- Senior leadership is mostly transparent and is frequently in touch.
- There's a clear direction where the company is heading.
- Company has a really good outlook (financially).
- Fast paced environment
- You'll be working on new stuff almost all the time, no one will be getting bored.","- Fast paced environment (yes, this is a con too)
- Some teams have a straight-up disregard for documenting processes and rely on tribal knowledge.
- Health insurance only covers 50% of dependents :(
- It's definitely less relevant now but there's 0 parking options (and no promise that this will ever change) in the Dublin office so if you don't live in the city and it's not possible to be 100% remote, you're looking at creating a beefy parking fee budget or some serious commute if you're not close to DART or red Luas.
- Finally, there's quite a bit of work to do about promoting REAL diversity and inclusion. CAVEAT: It's not better or worse than any other tech company in Dublin to be fair and there's already a decent effort underway to improve this (coming all the way up from the CEO and most people are supportive of this too).
However, for the Dublin office in particular, I'd say 89% of the people in the office are young, single and white so there's some widespread naivety (or ignorance?) about the needs of people who are not like them (especially parents, anyone over 40 years old, LGBTQ folks, women, and people of colour). But again: improving D&I is a company priority and most people have open minds and hearts, they're collectively willing to change things so I'm optimistic about a positive change in this regard."
837,DocuSign,Excellent company,2020-09-10,5.0,Product Management,"Great product, nice people, stable tech company.","Like most companies, DocuSign has some poor managers who should be shown the door. If you end up with one of them, seek a new position!"

840,DocuSign,Doing good and enjoying it,2020-09-02,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* DocuSign provides a lot of great perks for their employees and regularly solicit feedback to raise the bar. 20 days PTO, 401k match, transportation, lawyers!? ( I don't know much about this), probably other cool stuff I'm forgetting.
* The positive impact on the environment from the software along with DocuSign's additional efforts in protecting the environment are inspiring.
* Employee Resource Groups and DocuSign's efforts to promote diversity in both leadership and non-leadership positions is great. I have a ton of respect for the way Tom Casey, our SVP of Engineering, dives into a lot of challenging conversations and is willing to change his thinking when challenged.
* DocuSign really does care a lot about trust, security, and respecting our user's privacy. I respect that I have not had to implement any features that are user-unfriendly/hostile. People actually care.","* I would not recommend DocuSign as a place to start one's career as a software engineer. Depending on your team, you might often work on code that is quite dated. While it is a good place to work, at some point, you'll probably want to move on, and the experience you'll have gained here might not be ideal for moving on to that next position.
* Engineering feels fragmented. Questions that feel like they should have a general, company-wide answer, sometimes require going from team to team to get an answer.
* Our process for planning and delivering new features is not agile at all. DocuSign is so focused on protecting its core business and maintaining its SLAs that new development can often be hindered as a result. I think there's potential to create more efficient paths forward for smaller products.
* Deadlines can be aggressive. I don't feel overworked, but I do feel a general sense of disappointment from often not measuring up to what DocuSign wants us to accomplish.
* Career advancement can depend on the visibility and success of your project."
841,DocuSign,"Respect, Growth and Money",2020-09-01,5.0,Account Executive,"- Incredibly inviting culture. I started in the midst of COVID-19 and my remote onboarding was smooth and seamless. I was worried about the learning curve with everyone being remote, but I actually think DocuSign has managed to master this transition and somehow make it even better. My bootcamp was incredible!
- Customers LOVE us! I have worked in SaaS for years and have never felt the love from customers they way I have at DocuSign. They love the product, understand the value and are excited to see how else we can help. It's amazing!
- Management respects your time and genuinely cares. They set realistic expectations and never impede on my personal time. It's exactly what I was hoping for and signed up for. I finally have balance again.
- Generous compensation plans that are stronger than ""top"" companies in the industry.
- Humble employees just trying to do their best
- Managers are not ""CRM DJs"" or ""Salesforce Zombies."" Unlike other companies I have been at, managers at DocuSign aren't just refreshing reports and dashboards. It's not about the end numbers, it's about the customer and their employees lives. It's probably why success seems to follow everything this company does - the priorities of the leaders are in the right place.","- Growing at a pace like DocuSign requires adaptability and the very scary word....""CHANGE."" Be prepared to roll with the punches but know that the company cares about it's employees and the customers first beyond anything else."
842,DocuSign,Really looks after it's staff.,2020-08-31,5.0,Operations,"The company really looks after it's staff, particularly during this period. It seems to always strive to do better. Every company has stuff to work on and it acknowledges it's areas of weakness and puts measures in place to get it to where it needs to be. Doesn't appear to be 'all talk' but takes ownership of it's incentives.","Honestly, nothing really stands out. I think all companies need to work on it's internal communication but feel we're doing it well."

Apart from what the company provided, I quickly learned that I was surrounded by people who cared that I had what I needed and would readily answer any questions I had.

Now, a couple years later, I'm still thankful that I get to work with some of the kindest, smartest, and caring people I've ever worked with. From product managers who distill down customer needs into workable user stories to developers who care that they are creating the right solution for the customers, to QA who work hard to ensure that the solutions work right for the customers, this is a fantastic place to learn and to grow.

I've had managers who have worked hard ensuring I had what I needed to do the work of my life. I enjoy my 1:1s; my manager is happy to have wide-ranging discussions with me, yet she will dive deep on an area if I ask her to.

Even in the midst of the lockdown and subsequent recovery from Covid-19, the company provided us a generous amount to help with unexpected changes to cope with the new working arrangements.

I believe feedback is taken seriously and changes/actions are taken based on the feedback provided. Good benefits (time off, insurance, etc). Pay is low.",Pay is low. Promotions or role change can be tricky if you don't want to be in sales. Leadership promotion is questionable as some managers go from individual contributor to manager in a short period of time (less than 8 months) and are very inexperienced.

There is ample evidence from the action executives take on the results of employee surveys, the free and reduced services given to customers and potential customers for COVID response, and the work we do for global forests and other initiatives. If that was all I knew about the company, it would be enough.

On top of that, there are reasonable expectations for product development and solid leadership that allows us to get work done, keep the existing customer base happy, and develop for the future. 

DocuSign is a uniting force in a divided world. That is true of our products as well as the culture of the company.","The entire company is working from home due to COVID.

910,DocuSign,Top place to work for a reason,2020-06-28,5.0,Product Designer,"DocuSign scores highly on the fundamental elements that constitute an ideal work environment:

→ Culture: There is a friendship first, open culture that emphasizes learning, promotes socializing, provides support, recognizes effort, celebrates accomplishments, compliments quality and induces inspiration.

→ Flexibility: The company and managers are very accommodating of schedules and worktime which shows their trust in employees. No need to clock-in and you can always leave the office to make your doctor's or vet's appointment. Not to mention you are more than welcome to work-from-home any day.

→ People: Co-workers at DocuSign are a pleasure to learn, work and grow with. Here, people accept you for who you are, value relationships, and genuinely care about each other.

→ Transparency:  Even though DocuSign is growing rapidly, the leadership is very approachable and provides opportunities to ask questions. They collect constant feedback, acknowledge problems and opportunities to improve and actively work to get better.

→ Reasonable and Focused: The company is prudent in spending it’s resources. It does not squander money on unnecessary lavish parties. Although there are many events, offsites and team-bonding hangouts which add to the culture, the spending is always balanced and kept in check

→ Business: The business, mission, and values of the company is something to be proud of. They are working to eliminate paper, which is great for the environment and transforming businesses, small and large, by helping them automate their contracting processes through the Agreement Cloud which is a great product the digital future.

→ Fun: Besides your day job, there are opportunities to volunteer for causes, join informal and formal clubs, and contribute to Employee Resource Groups.","Not many but there are some that the company can improve on:

→ Workplace amenities: The offices don't have great amenities and can definitely modernize the interiors. More, better co-working spaces, lounges, healthcare assistance on site, and areas to play would be a great addition.

→ Pay and Perks: Although benefits are great, the perks program doesn't offer much and has limited usable local options. Base pay is good but not great, it falls around the 80-85 percentile mark of the market but considering it's a top place to work, seeing it above the 90th percentile would be great.

→ Product and Resourcing: Resourcing is a concern sometimes as with any growing company and priorities are often assigned to product areas that add features which means that refining and modernizing the fundamentals has to take the back seat sometimes."

We have a product that delivers real value, improves the experience for customers and employees alike, and make an environmental impact. Working for a company where people routinely say ""I LOVE DocuSign"" really doesn't get old.

Equally important is the quality of the leadership team. When they say they want DocuSign to be a place for people to do the ""work of their lives,"" they back it up. There is a real investment in employees and their well-being. No company is perfect, and our leadership knows that; but, they walk the walk and consistently demonstrate their commitment to employees.

And, while the company is firing on all cylinders we're not resting on our laurels. Expanding from eSignature to a broader Agreement Cloud to address the entire agreement process is opening new opportunities for growth while delivering real value for customers.

Finally, the company's response to Covid19 has only served to reinforce how special this place is. The company has gone above and beyond to ensure employees are able to try to find normalcy while finding ways to make it easier to work from home productively. If there was ever a doubt about DocuSign, leadership's response to this cleared things up.

I feel very fortunate to work for a company like DocuSign. It's a special company.","No company is perfect and DocuSign is no exception. That said, the majority of the cons can be attributed to the company's success and rapid growth. 

For example, internal processes are not always right-sized as the company keeps pace with growth. Some processes are lacking, relics from when the company was smaller. Other processes are probably too much, as the company looks to future-proof for when we're larger. That said, even here improvements are being made.

Honestly, DocuSign is a really good place to work."

Since I started at DocuSign, I've always had the support I've needed and my teammates are always willing to go out of their way to give support.

Thus far, really enjoying the partnership with the business partners and even within my department, I feel I have the opportunity share my ideas and a platform to showcase my talents

Compensation is good, it's not going to be as high as FAANG, but you probably get more ownership of the product than in those megacorps.

It's an exciting time for docusign too, lots and lots of room to grow, and the product is growing in all these amazing ways to serve our customers. We have an agreement cloud suite of products, and the challenge will be to get all these components functioning in an integrated singular way, but that's a great problem to have, and the runway for the company is long and clear.","None really.

At first, I thought it sounded a little cheesy for us Europeans - but 6 months in, I get it. DocuSign endeavours to give you everything you need to feel fulfilled and excited to come to work each day. It's a fast-paced environment which means each day is different and exciting, and there is lots of opportunity to progress! Though its a relatively large company (5k employees around the world), I feel I am directly impacting the Global vision, rather than just being a cog in a wheel.

The team are great, management is supportive, and they genuinely care how you are doing. There is also a real sense of accountability and integrity that comes from Dan (CEO) all the way down.

There are plenty of opportunities to give feedback, whether it's within your team, about benefits, or onboarding. For instance, they recently increased the transit subsidy after receiving a lot of comments on it.  Our CEO  even makes the effort to visit non-West coast offices and talk to employees. 

I also appreciate that managers are required to go through training to ensure they are guiding and helping develop their team effectively. Benefits are excellent and the culture is welcoming and transparent. 

It's exciting to be here as the company grows in headcount and the product offering gets bigger and better. Personally my team is flexible about work hours and working from home. Managers trust their employees and value work life balance. Not to mention the array of snacks and stocked fridge is a good reason to come to the office!",Can be difficult to keep up with frequent product changes. Only some teams get catered lunch weekly
962,DocuSign,Really enjoyable place to work,2020-02-13,5.0,Senior Analyst,"The GOTS organization is fun and the culture is positive.  As the company succeeds the rewards are distributed throughout the organization, and it's evident in the perks, benefits, and fun events (like the holiday party).  I also like that the CTO is a woman, which is rare in the tech industry.  It really feels like the company cares about the employees and is open to input.  Even the review process is multi-directional, including reviews from your peers, and you get to review your manager.  The leadership is also very transparent about what the future plans are and why we are doing certain things.  Lastly, the ""give-back"" positive culture of the business makes you feel really good.  We get to volunteer a lot and the company matches charitable donations.  They also have a big focus on saving trees through the DocuSign Forests initiative and are heavily focused on reducing the carbon footprint for the company.","I wish they had fertility benefits in their health insurance plan.  It's a benefit that a lot of tech companies are adding to help attract top talent, and DocuSign wants to compete at that level.

They are apparently under the erroneous impression that being good with technical matters is equal to being a good leader. 

My role was downgraded from salaried to hourly with no notice or recourse.  Seems like an attempt to offset budgets through attrition (better to have people just quit on you, right?).

Developer culture is exactly what you'd expect it to be--toxic--the same as some other publicly criticized tech companies (like Facebook or Microsoft). They've actually brought in a number of people from Microsoft, so that company's infamously toxic culture is now taking solid root at DocuSign and is widely unchecked (any behavior towards colleagues is permitted as long as you make the company money!). Cronyism is amok; everyone is a ""Director"" at DocuSign--it's laughable. Diversity in engineering is a joke, apparently only white and Asian people can do the job.

Company pretends like it cares about employees but it's just PR-- they are constantly asking people to review them favorably here on Glassdoor, especially if the person has been with the company under a year.

2) The SDR role: As a young sales person learning the cycle effectively can be tedious and energy draining. At DocuSign, they don’t fire you if you’re underperforming or in a rut. They encourage you to make little improvements! Lead distribution, the Sandler method and potentially collaborating (see cons) with AE’s & fellow XDR’s are all huge benefits of being an SDR at DocuSign!

3) Benefits: Coming straight out of college a big fear of many young people today are the hidden cost of being an adult. Insurance, DocuSign has you covered! Commuting to work, DocuSign mitigates the cost! Wanting to make a healthy habit, DocuSign will pay for your gym membership!

DocuSign tends to promote managers that are consistently critiqued and disliked. It's almost as though the less you are liked, the more DocuSign wants to promote you. Culture is toxic, management feeds into this and has a blind kool-aid view as if we are the same company that we were in 2010. News flash - times have changed. Rip the bandaid off and get rid of poor leadership.

Literally no training. None. If you are not being promoted internally please do not waste your time interviewing here.

Great career starter for anyone under 30.","If you are a seasoned Account Manager, think twice before choosing DocuSign.

Poor sales leadership, no training for managers, very young, very inexperienced. Toxic work culture for Account Managers. Management has created a shadow culture of favoritism, nepotism, and hostility against the rest. Management has no longitudinal view of their business. Everything is a scramble, everything is due yesterday. 

Account Managers have to smile, have ""yes men"" mentality, and are worked night and day. No real recognition or career pathing. Career discussions are merely a charade designed to target AMs who have low job satisfaction. 

Many AMs are treated poorly by their AE ""partners"", and AM leadership will not have your back. AMs are a ""junk drawer"" for the activities that AEs don't want to do. AEs and RVPs have all the power. AMs are not empowered, have responsibility for accounts/renewals/growth quota, but no authority, as the AEs are the relationship ""owners"". This creates an intrinsic conflict, and there are no ROEs or swim lanes.

No deal desk, unrealistic quotas, book shuffle ever few months, which makes relationship development a challenge. I was told I would be managing 40 accounts when I started, at one point I had over 90.

If you need help internally, good luck. ""Everyone for themselves"" mentality, instilled and reinforced by leadership.

Fyi: employees are instructed and pushed to give Glassdoor reviews right out of the gate, before they've even really start the job."

Everyone is slightly nerdy which I absolutely love because that’s me too haha! It is software sales so it was what I was expecting. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to excel. The career path from SDR-MDR-AE looks tough but it’s definitely there. To be an AE you will have to work hard and become an actual professional which is how it should be. Everyone is super supportive and the CEO is funny and down to earth.,"The ramp up for the MDR role is craziness. I hate seeing other reviews on here of people complaining about unrealistic targets or whatever. It’s sales. Don’t be in sales if you can’t handle the heat! Besides, the targets were just lowered a bit for the MDRs and they’re definitely fair. You do have to work rly hard but you should already know  sales is like that. That’s not even a con because the commission is fair."

- Great team of people. Fun. Down to Earth. Helpful. Kind.

Alternatively, if you're in a good vertical (i.e. lucrative industry or wealthy/hi-tech city/state) you can make a lot of money. You have no control over this, so when it sucks it really sucks. When I worked here, quota wasn't adjusted for different verticals based on these factors , so it made for a very uneven playing field.

Executive-level politics and finger-pointing each other, rather than trying to do the right work, is somewhat pathetic. It's been >1 year since the company went on IPO and everyone still acts like a startup.

Accounting-Specific:
The great culture at DocuSign doesn't apply to the Accounting department. Accounting is still under the old-school ship who does not trust your professionalism.

If you like 90s management style, like micromanagement, no trust from your chief, and having your butt in the chair 9 am to 4 pm every day, this is the place."
1066,DocuSign,Couldn't be happier,2019-07-16,5.0,Enterprise Account Manager,"Culture. Pay. Leadership (top to bottom).  The product(s). Our Customers. My peers. Growth opportunities.  I honestly can't say enough about how amazing this company is to work for. Nothing is perfect, but if you're lucky enough to land here, you've found a home.","Not much downside... with growth comes change, sometimes adjusting to that change can be daunting, but dust settles and things aren't done here just to do something, there is a method. 100% 401K match would be nice!"

Employee perks are great (snacks, health, and dental insurance), education assistance program, e-learning as well as the new wellness benefit!","- There are not enough office events to bring everyone together
- Coffee Machines in the Dublin Office are a disgrace! 
- Management seems to be very focused on the US office that they are overlooking certain needs in EMEA offices

1072,DocuSign,"Decent people, good market opportunity, lots of red tape for such a small company",2019-07-15,3.0,Senior Manager,"Plenty of of both intelligent and nice colleagues. Not too many underachievers, and everyone does seem to strive to do their best work.  The market opportunity for the company is huge, and they're the leader in the space, just a matter of execution. Compensation is relatively competitive (but do negotiate).  Starting to get some better enterprise collaboration tools, but those are still relatively immature in their implementation.","Definitely feels more like a Seattle company than a SF Bay Area company. They'll tell you that they're HQ'd in SF, but a sizable chunk (maybe even half) are still in Seattle where they started, so don't expect to work face-to-face with a lot of colleagues. Video conferencing is in its infancy here, so it makes dealing with remote folks even more difficult, especially since the rooms aren't enabled for VC and nothing is integrated. Similarly, if you're expecting large, Silicon Valley company-like perks and benefits, look elsewhere. Healthcare is decent, but really for employee-only -- definitely gets more expensive if you try to add children or a spouse. Additionally, they don't provide any kind of meals so you'll be on your own for that. Likewise, they still use PTO instead of unlimited time off, and that includes your sick days. There are no company shutdowns either so expect to have to use all of your PTO and have a full inbox waiting for you when you return.  For a company as small as it is there's an incredible amount of red tape surrounding processes and technology -- to the point where it can make it very difficult to get actual business done. Definitely a squeaky wheel gets the grease/escalation culture, so be on the lookout for that."

I respect our leadership team's ability to align the company and execute on our visions. Our CEO is humble, kind and inspiring. 

Its great to see the company's transformation from an eSignature company to an Agreement Cloud Company, allowing tremendous opportunities for growth. 

People work hard here, but work life balance is real","The company is growing at a rapid rate, and we don't have the right resources in Real Estate planning to scale the growth. Work space challenges can be  a major pain point for employees"
1089,DocuSign,Taking it to the Next Level,2019-06-11,5.0,Director of Technology,"DocuSign is a company with a self-improvement culture.   We're always asking, how can we take things to the next level. For example, in the last couple years, we've advanced from being a primarily one-product company to a cloud suite of offerings. Engineering is focused on learning from every incident, making sure it doesn't happen again, and actively educating on best practices. We're looking for people who care about our customers and care about the people they work with and want to make things better.
1. The people. We hire people who are smart, good communicators, skilled, experienced and have good strong fits for their positions; and also friendly, collaborative and pleasant. 
2. The product. DocuSign builds its own infrastructure to the standards of Banks and Governments. Our Document Transaction Management service is extremely flexible and customizable. The breadth of our integrations provides a rich pipeline of capabilities.  DocuSign's technology is so visionary that it becomes a system of systems, able to integrate across multiple dimensions.
3. The leadership. Dan Springer and his leadership team bring talent and experience, but also a best-in-class mindset that shows in our strategy and initiatives. Last year's acquisition of SpringCM was brilliant and is such a strong fit for our vision.  DocuSign's leadership really gets it. At every All Hands we talk about how to make DocuSign the place where you do the work of your life.","They run out of Diet Coke's on my floor all the time.
One challenge in Engineering is that we don't have enough Senior Directors, that is upper-middle hands-on technical leadership. We have solid VP's, and we have solid Managers and Directors, but we need more of those strong organizational leaders who can lead mid to large size teams though technical transitions. It's hard to find and hire  truely excellent upper-middle leaders because that role is so competitive. 
I'd say that our technology stack is not as agile as we'd like to modernize and decouple and adopt new technologies and platforms. Our ultrahigh reliability bar has a downside in that any change to the system must go through so many checks and balances that code velocity is a little disappointing.  The flip side of playing in so many regulated markets is that the compliance demands make change difficult.  Basically, even stronger leadership through technical evolution of a 7-10 year old code base will enable us leverage greater technical innovation.
Stock price can be volatile  but we're in it to win it and not focused on the short term."

I am able to see my impact of my work each day  and truly have no complaints about this role, people, or company.  Clear job progression is evident as well, very few people leave the company after this role.  The CEO Dan Springer and upper management are leading this company to continue to do great things.",I am happy to say that I cannot find any fault with this company or role at this time.

It’s a great feeling to look back and know that we built something great together that still stands, still makes a positive impact. Benefits & compensation are very competitive & comprehensive.

LEADERSHIP
Our CEO, Dan Springer has been quoted a few times this year saying that he wants “DocuSign to be the best place anybody ever works.” He means it. His executive team has taken several steps this year in making that aspiration a reality by way of increasing benefits, developing new programs, making strategic investments in both our product suite and portfolio of companies that we’ve now acquired. In turn, DocuSigners that work here have bought into Dan's idea and the culture has shifted. As a company, we’ve had a lot of wins these past 12 months. Few highlights:
- The company IPO’d and has performed consistently quarter over quarter to beat Wall Street expectations - Come on! 
- We acquired SpringCM - a contract lifecycle management company - very cool
- We invested lots of moneys into SEAL Software - #winning
- We launched ""The DocuSign Agreement Cloud"" - New products to sell! Yay!
- Dan kickstarted ""DocuSign Forests"", our foundation DocuSign IMPACT's key initiative to restores the world's forests - naturally, we highly dislike paper here. 

If you’re wondering how a CEO’s approval rating could possibly reach above 90%, it’s pretty simple, say what you mean and do what you say, which Dan and his team fulfill on frequently. 

CAREER GROWTH
Joan Burke, our CHRO, made a comment in an all-hands meeting this past year, “People don’t leave companies, they leave managers.” To me, that comment was so simple yet holds so much power in the development of a career. Since then, Joan and her team have rolled out an entire training/development program for managers at DocuSign. And as far as I know, we’ve seen some great results! Our retention rate is one of the best across tech companies (a rarity in SF/SEA) and I’d be hard pressed to find an employee who doesn’t love what they do and love working here. With the company growing at the rate we are, there will be more and more opportunities for people here to grow as a professional. Fortunately for us, our leadership team makes that easy, with lots of resources and support.

COMPENSATION
DocuSign operates on quarterly quotas. From my understanding, compensation packages are competitive across SAAS sales companies. And the benefits are 2nd to none. 

INNOVATION
This is the part that really lights me up. DocuSign has been known for “Signing” documents electronically for the better part of the last 16 years. More or less, we had 1 product that we did really really really well. When Dan joined the company a little over two years ago, one of the main things he pointed out was that we as a company needed to focus on product innovation quarter by quarter. 

This year, DocuSign announced the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. We now have 12 products that salespeople can sell. Why is this important? As a salesperson, imagine that you’re a giant iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean, just doing your thing, chillin’. There’s a large vessel (aka a customer) coming upon you. The people on the vessel say to themselves, “Oh it’s a little iceberg. We’ve seen little icebergs like this before.” What the people on the vessel couldn’t see, was the sheer mass of product underneath the surface ready to disrupt their entire path. If only they could see it, they’d be saved. Fortunately for all the vessels out there, we’re not icebergs. We’re business operations experts. 

Obviously, this is a super silly example though it proves a point. Our customers gain so much value from DocuSign and they’re only just scratching the surface of how they could leverage all the Agreement Cloud products to impact their business. If you've been watching the company stock price and reading analyst reports like me (Sorry, nerd alert here), you'll get a sense of why people outside this company are excited about this company. Lots and lots of upside.  S/O to Ron H, Scott O, Tom C for giving us all the tools! 

BENEFITS 
We’ve got all the good ones (health, vision, dental) Cool benefits we added this year were:
- 401k Matching
- Ripe avocados
- Health/Well-being reimbursement
- $5k/year/employee Education Stipend, air conditioning at your desk, and plants. Lots of new foliage keeps popping up around the office in SF. Its just really great. 
- Panini maker (12th floor in SF only) - Sorry everybody else :P","My two big gripes are really not even that big of gripes and are more about benefits and/or lack thereof:

Our commuter stipend isn't large as some other SAAS companies ($40/month). Some people rely on public transportation to get to work each day - $40/month doesn't really cover that for 20 working days per month when transportation fees i.e. lyft, uber, Bart, Fastrak, parking etc continue to increase"

Never have I worked for a company that had such organization with such a consistent message.

Career Growth - You're always encouraged to keep learning and growing and the company is happy to invest in you to make sure that happens.

Feedback culture is strong and everyone I've worked with has been very accessible. Peers help with learning, managers are supportive.
With being a growth company, there's tremendous opportunity for career growth. Roles are being created and teams are growing to support the book of business.","They need more people. Many business units seem lean, supported by a few veterans with lots of experience doing everything they can to bring new faces up to speed. DocuSign is investing in people and hiring in droves, but we're just not quite there yet. Training has improved immensely but there's still a gap."
1116,DocuSign,Mixed results,2019-04-24,1.0,Anonymous,"- Recognizable brand and considered a market leader
- High-growth industry
- Ideal stepping stone to further your career elsewhere
- C-staff seem like they are saying and doing the right things","- Too much bureaucracy/politics in the middle layers, so managers aren't empowered to do the right thing for the company and their direct reports.  The competent go-getters who can deliver consistently aren't rewarded,  because promotions are popularity contests.  
- Lack of investment/resourcing and career development for high-potential people, who can make an impact to the organization.  If you want to be promoted, you have to leave DocuSign.
- Unclear roles and responsibilities
- Lack of accountability.... incompetent people can skate by and take credit for other people's work.  It's ok if incompetent people ignore the go-getters, but if the go-getters ignore them, they complain.  Two great examples are Product Marketing and INTL marketing teams, who have no measurable impact but complain the loudest and create more work for other teams."

1120,DocuSign,Great Place to Learn and Grow,2019-04-12,5.0,Compliance Analyst,"It is a great time to jump on board. DocuSign is a relatively young company (business process) having just gone public about a year ago. The company is moving beyond the ""startup culture"" and towards a more mature corporate structure. The benefit of this is that as business processes start to mature, there are a lot of opportunities to build something new and take ownership of what you create. I believe that my team has strong leadership that empowers its team members to have personal growth and remain challenged every day. 

As far as the benefits go, the work-life balance is great. If you are into volunteering, the company allows you to take a certain number of paid hours to go volunteer during work and has a ton of options available for you to choose from.","The product has been changing rapidly over the last few months with new features and services to learn.

When I started, we were pre-IPO and there were some concerns that as the dust settled from going public that opportunities would slow down and growth would be more stead.  NOT SO!  There is so much opportunity on the sales side and I imagine everywhere in the org for growth within your career, and to make moves that might have been harder to do previously. 

Great culture- team dynamics are great, events are fun and you truly want to be there,
Great resources- amazing amount of resources both in terms of training and just the ability to reach out to just about anyone about something and they really want to help","I think that with many tech companies you need to be able to handle a lot of ambiguity and fast changes but its not hectic and chaotic to the point where things dont work.

There are a lot of opportunities to grow within your career if you put the effort in. A lot of autonomy and little micromanaging so far. Benefits are really great (the only things that would make them better would be unlimited PTO and free lunch), salary is fair and equity is generous. If you have a good manager and team, the possibilities are huge with how you can grow your career and impact on the company!","Internal communication and collaboration is a challenge. With so many teams doing very similar work, sometimes you'll find that others are doing similar work to you and figuring out overlap can be difficult. Additionally, it's hard to move quickly because there are often many cooks in the kitchen. However, Leadership is aware of this and has communicated dedication to figuring it out this year."

- Company continues to improve on employee offerings such as paid leave, matching 401k, and other things
- Good product that customers know and love making this a safe and stable company to work for.","- Some ""Bad Apple"" leadership positions can ruin the experience for employees stuck under those individuals.
- ""Good ol Boy"" mentality is still present where a lot of recognition and benefits are given to people based on personal relationships vs merit or earned
- Diversity is so bad it's almost a joke?  While it's common for people to complain these days, you can't deny that the executive leadership is almost entirely white males.  Company wide events are also very heavily white.  This company is primarily west coast US, which limits options.
- Product teams seem a bit out-of-touch with the rest of the company, making it a frustrating place to work for customer-facing roles at times.
- Recognition is typically only given tot hose with outstanding ""lucky"" performance via large deals won and Presidents Club style events are awarded on a ""Good-ol-Boy"" basis vs strict rules for attainment."

2.  Work balance - hours are reasonable and flexible.  I am able to drop off the kids, get into the office a bit later, leave a bit early to pick up the kids, then get back online at night for an hour or two to catch up.

3.  Amenities - there's lots of snacks and food if you don't have time to go out to eat.  It's not a full on cafeteria, though they frequently have events with food, but you can easily make a sandwich if you have back to back meetings.

4.  Work tools - the laptops are decent quality and they have a variety of tools available to do your job.  I've worked at places where the tools are subpar and it's a pain to do the simplest tasks like submit an expense.","1.  Growing pains - there is some chaos but expected for a growing company.  Consistency is not there yet in terms of how things get done.  Some people are bothered by this but I happen to prefer it because it's an opportunity to do the work yourself.

So if you are a consistent B player seeking a place with job security - you've come to the right place!","Some serious house cleaning is needed in engineering - our organization is bureaucratic, ambiguous, process-heavy, and highly ineffective. This prevents us from being innovative, disruptive, and high performant - and we surely won't be able to attract or retain top talent.

Current positions could change with the drop of a hat and a career direction you were headed in may no longer be through the position you took.

Work life balance seems good.","They don't offer full meals like many other tech companies do, no gym membership incentives, I've heard its hard to get competitive pay raises for internal promotions, they are not big on working from home and prefer employees to work from the office, they need an office enviormental update as the spaces are very white, I wish we could brings dogs to work.

After the interview we took a tour and was told i would hear back in a few days. They let me know the next morning that i was hired. That whole process only took a week! 

Then came Discovering DocuSign, the week long on boarding training. Here, i met people from various offices and countries. In that week we took part in Sales Boot Camp where you are trained on the product, sales methodologies and the DocuSign way. This week was fun and educational, and the next week followed with more training.

In a customer facing role, you want a product you can lean on, DocuSign is that product.
I can't speak for all managers, but my manager is the best I've ever had and truly has my best interest at heart.
Great opportunities to grow your career if you are willing to put in the work and speak up to let your managers know your goals. Nothing will be handed to you but it is there if you want it.

1181,DocuSign,Great place to work,2019-02-13,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"DocuSign has been a great place to work! The overall culture/atmosphere is positive and makes coming to work each day not feel like a drag. Great coworkers, great perks to the job (health insurance, 401k, commuter benefits, cell phone reimbursement, gym subsidy - coming in the future) and snacks! Plus the ability to work from home when needed and a great work-life balance!",Customer Success Org has a bit of disorganization as the team is fairly new and still going through some growing pains but nothing terrible.
1182,DocuSign,Great Sales Culture,2019-02-13,5.0,EAE,"DocuSign brings all the benefits and value of working for a big company all the while maintaining the culture and nimbleness of a mid sized company.  Upper Management is committed to sales and the sales force. After working in a very large well respected sales organization, the ability to do whatever it takes to win business is a nice change","Still finding some growing pains as they move from a small  company to a large  company.  Some challenges with new product integration, but those are being addressed in the short term...."
1183,DocuSign,Excellent first impression from new hire,2019-02-13,5.0,Software Engineer,"I have never before worked with a company with such a clear vision of direction, including clarity on how they intend to get there.  It is hard not to be inspired by the outlook of the company and its fantastic employees.  Upper management is very accessible.  As a new hire about a month in, I have already had several casual (and comfortable) conversations with a few C-levels (including the CEO); they really are in touch with their employees at all levels of the organization.  No ivory tower syndrome that I have seen elsewhere.  Docusign treats employees very well, with great perks and flexibility (which might vary by department).  Every day I come to work, I'm eager and motivated to play my role in building excellent software that really makes a difference for our clients.","They are hiring a lot right now.  The onboarding process is a bit overburdened.  It took longer than expected to get up and running with hardware and software.  However, the format new hire orientations and bootcamps have been fantastic."
1184,DocuSign,Amazing brand backed by a legitimately amazing culture,2019-02-13,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"DocuSign has a great brand.  Whenever I talk with someone about where I work, inevitably they say something like, ""DocuSign?  Oh yeah, I love DocuSign, we just used it when we bought our house...."".  While this is indicative of a great product that solves a global need to reduce paper, improve processes, and make doing business easier, it doesn't stop there.  

The DocuSign brand is backed by a culture of transparency, collaboration, customer focus, inclusiveness, and dedication to employee success.  Beginning with the recruiting process all the way through on boarding, the experience was simply terrific.  Some key highlights:

- Responsiveness from the recruiter.  I was always informed of the process, next steps, timelines, etc.

- An on boarding process that is second to none.  From company processes all the way through continued training and education opportunities to keep pace with career development.

- A compassionate, super capable, and transparent leadership team.  From the C-Suite down to first line management, there is a coordinated effort to drive communication, direction, and strategy which keeps all employees focused on the right things.

- It's a culture of collaboration.  There are efficient, defined ways to share best practices, wins, lessons learned, and ways to ask questions and get quick guidance.  Everyone is always willing to help out - across all departments.

- Compensation and benefits are top notch and I feel well taken care of.

- Work life balance is very fair.  Depending on your role, there can be peaks and valleys with work levels, but there is always an expectation that you take care of yourself when needed.  Generous PTO helps here as well.  And if there are ""valleys"" in the work load, there are ample opportunities to join in on special projects that help the company improve or to develop new programs and/or content.","I honestly don't have anything to share in terms of Cons.  It is a growing, fast paced company with a clearly defined direction.  So, there is a lot to do and everyone is pulling together to meet the challenge.  So, it is not a sit back and coast environment if that is your thing."

Autonomy with workload,","I was made to sit completely by myself for almost a year and a half, away from my team, with days of no conversation. My manager only communicated via email and my boss actively blanked me. I was referred to as ""him"" in meetings, if acknowledged at all. 

For a week, the lighting above my desk area was broken and I ended up sat (alone) in darkness. When the light started making a clicking noise, I raised it only to be told: ""If we can't freeze you out, we'll just drive you insane."" 

After working on Momentum, the company's annual event, with my contribution actively supporting record attendance, the team went to drinks without me while I was in the bathroom without a word. 

When I asked for a raise in line with market rate and headhunters, I was told it was too late before my current contract expired. I had been given my new contract to sign only 2hrs before. (I got the money I asked for at my new job, needless to say.) 

The office is cliquey and I think it's fair to say there is a degree of latent homophobia.

He continues to make good on his promises and is leading DocuSign to even bigger and better things. 

The salary and benefits are competitive and the office environment has the perks you expect at a high-tech company in San Francisco.

The IMPACT program is a shining star at DocuSign. It encourages and supports employees to give back to their communities and charitable organizations.","Even the best companies hire managers who have their own agenda that is not consistent with the best interests of the company nor its employees.  Unfortunately this happened to my organization. What was once a highly functioning, collaborative and effective team, is slowly being dismantled by a new senior manager in a larger organization that relies on downward communication and offers no opportunity to communicate up in a safe way."
1199,DocuSign,Incredible First Job,2018-11-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"I worked as an intern last summer and came on full-time this year. Though I have less than a year of experience to go off of, I can say with no doubt in my mind that this was the right place for me to start my career. It's a great place to grow and learn.

Within engineering, I have had the privilege of being mentored and getting to work with some extremely bright people. Every conversation I have furthers my career and my ability to contribute as much as possible. On top of the incredible people the benefits are generous. DocuSign really cares about it's employees.","The compensation is on the lower end of the current market for engineers, especially in Seattle, but DoucSign is still growing and I think this is getting better from what I've heard. Other than that, no cons."

Benefits are comparable to other companies.  There are plenty of opportunities for growth and moving up.",It is difficult to find a con honestly.  I have worked at many places and this is the most enjoyable environment I have seen.  I really enjoy coming to work everyday.
1201,DocuSign,One of my Best Professional Experiences,2018-10-26,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I can't say enough about how great the people are whom I work with. When I was new, they reached out to make sure I had the help that I needed, and they made it explicit that you will not be made to feel bad asking questions.

The office is incredibly friendly and fun. Every day at lunch, there is usually a game or 2 going on that you can easily join in on. Regular lunches and office happy hours give you plenty of opportunity to get to know your co-workers in a more personal setting.

The work is challenging, but management sets entirely reasonable expectations. I have been given enough creative liberty to come up with solutions to the problems.

I hope this doesn't sound too cliched, but the leadership is truly inspiring. Talking with them about future plans for our office and for the company make me want to help bring them to fruition.","My chief complaint is that our office currently does not have an opening for me to refer a former co-worker to.

Other than that, I have no cons. I legitimately look forward to going to work every morning."

It makes for a fun atmosphere on the Market Development/Sales Development floor.  The team comes from super diverse types of work experience as well...which makes for interesting and engaging conversations with co-workers.  Some people come from sales roles at other companies...but it seems that managers are willing to take a risk on ""less traditional"" backgrounds (i.e. military, technical program management, service industry, education, etc.)

The Product- Should go without saying but it is much easier to sell a product you genuinely beleive can add value for your prospect.  A+ on that front.

Collaborative Sales Culture- Everyone has their own number to hit for sure-- but people are very willing to share best practices across the team, what has worked/not worked for them, etc.

Pay- Pay seems fair, uncapped commission

From the on-boarding process to departmental training, it has been a positive and professional experience through-and-through. At DocuSign, not only do I feel valued as an employee-- I also feel like the company trusts its employees. 

The company culture at DocuSign is positive and collaborative. Both peers and management are helpful and friendly. There is still a start-up feel to the company culture, and employees are encouraged to bring fresh ideas to the table in a safe and supportive environment. There is a great balance between a relaxed atmosphere and professional drive (and results!), which encourages work-life balance and true talent development.

The company is also focused on diversity and inclusiveness for LGBTQ, immigrants, women, and people of color, and they take efforts to make sure the employee population reflects that and feels comfortable to be themselves. As someone who fits several of those categories, it's been great to know that my company cares about what struggles I might face as a minority--and that they walk the walk.

Lastly, the benefits are spectacular. The company's benefits are truly indicative of company that is investing in its employees and truly cares about their well-being.

1238,DocuSign,"Great Company, Great People, Great Future",2018-10-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people at DocuSign are super smart, hyper focused, and super motivated. Everyone here is professional and nice to work with. Everyone is willing to go out of their way to help and ensure the continued success at DocuSign. We continue to grow as a company and with that growth there are plenty of opportunities for people to grow too, in their lives and careers.",With our continued growth comes continued work. Things move at light speed here and sometimes it can be difficult to move that quickly for extended periods of time.
1239,DocuSign,Pragmatists honest review,2018-10-08,5.0,Senior Software Engineering Manager,"The people here really try to live the values the company  espouses.  As a manager I can see the effort my peers in ""middle management"" try to be coaches, and really make an effort to address life balance, growth, diversity.   When there is conflict, it is healthy in that people have their hearts in what they think is best, vs a political agenda ( at least in Engineering ).  Life balance is great.  Folks have a focused 8 hour day and leave at reasonable times.  The realities of commuting and costs of living in the bay area is a reality we don't take for granted.  Working from home 1 to 2 days a week is not an exception, it's a norm.  If you are working late on a regular basis, then something has failed, it is not heroic.

we are in a high growth phase so with growth there is opportunity in many facets ( comp, career, learning )

I feel my most comfortable self here, which may be an artifact of my time in career as well, but for the most part I don't feel like I have to fit a certain persona to be accepted as compared to previous companies.","with growth can come some growing pains
we need to get better at not just doing things they way they were done before...for a relatively small company we have some slow legacy internal processes

As a recent college graduate I found that DocuSign has taken the time to teach me the product, the necessary technology tools, and sales methodologies to allow me to be successful in the role. The culture is terrific at creating work life balance while keeping a positive competitive environment.",Since DocuSign is still a relatively newer company there are constant adaptations and changes. Most are for the better but some have caused some unfair inequality between coworkers and opportunities. Most of these have been corrected but in the last year my career growth had been delayed due to some of the changes in the past.

Access to tools, training material, and info resources is unparalleled.",I feel like there is some data issues internally that probably stem from the company changing how things are approached and growing at the rate it did but its certainly on the radar.  I guess other than that - if you strive in a no stress environment this may be a big adjustment.  There are a LOT of pieces all moving independently and relatively autonomously and it can be kind of overwhelming at times.

The biggest thing I took away from Discovering DocuSign is that this company does a great job of hiring people that are friendly, caring, and motivate to help others and the company's clients succeed. That was backed up as I got to know my team and others, who all fit that mold completely. I couldn't be happier with the people that I work with, and the company that I work for.

There are, of course, many other pros to working here. The work is interesting, they recently went public and have a great RSU plan, 401k matching will start soon, and the benefits are better than I've received at other top notch companies.

Can work from home if needed.",After working with the team I noticed that they were friendly in front of your face but then they would talk behind your back. The team was divided into cliquish group. It was pretty childish. If you were not accepted into the any cliques then your life there was a hard one. You have one supervisor for a group of 3 people and not team leads.

It is notoriously difficult to get hired here, but once in, you see why: Teams that get along incredibly well, management that acknowledges their own struggles and works towards commonly set goals, and pay/benefits that truly lead the industry. And we work at a verb.

Pros:
-Benefits are top notch like Aetna health plans at 100% paid, time off starting at 4 weeks, paid parental leave (SIX MONTHS!), flexible scheduling, and more
-Managers who genuinely care. Almost no one leaves due to a DocuSign issue.
-Advancement is likely if desired.
-Flexibility in scheduling.
-Our CEO is seriously inspirational. He is direct, honest, and passionate.
-Regular town hall meetings with both CEO and departmental SVP's, whom you can ask very blunt/direct questions and get thoughtful responses. I've been at places where these meetings were mostly for show - not here. They care and it shows.","-Work from home is common in most departments except for Account Management, where it is limited to one day a week after one year. This needs to be expanded to 3-5 days/week to keep in line with other companies. 
-Interdepartmental communication is tough, however this is par for the course for rapidly growing companies. Also, this has been directly acknowledged by our CEO, and this is being worked on."

I feel like I haven't worked a day in my life since I started at DocuSign, because I truly love what I do.  I have worked for many of the heavy hitters here in the PNW, including large book sellers and mobile phone companies, and DocuSign is hands down the best place I have ever been.  In my mind, in many years I will retire from this company because it is just that good.  If you get the chance to work here, TAKE IT.",None that are worth complaining about
1314,DocuSign,Exactly what I was hoping for!,2018-07-17,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"DocuSign treats there employees like adults and I just love that.  Not every company in the Bay Area does this. They are super flexible with you, if you need to work remotely for whatever reason you can.  

The management level here has been awesome and that's not again always the case for big companies. Transparency is key and they know how to respectfully be transparent while also helping you as individuals get to your next career goals. 

 The benefits are amazing as you can see from the reviews. They pay 100%  of medical and dental and vision, that's not heard of in most companies in the Bay Area. They stock the fridges with tasty healthy snacks, although I wish they had oatmeal like they do in Seattle (hint hint). They offer generous Maternity leave, 6 months which is honestly needed, 3 months is too short for any new mother. 

The overall vibe is a collaborative space and most people truly want to be here and that is what contributes to the great cultural. 

Our CEO Dan Springer is such a breath of fresh air! He truly cares about the employees here and you can tell because he's so open and honest. He doesn't sugar coat anything and listens.  Bravo!","The commuter benefits (which they have) could be a little more, by an extra 20-30 dollars. The only benefit they are really missing is a gym allowance.  That would be great to have! Most companies offer anything between 70-100 dollars a gym to stay active and healthy. DocuSign is so committed to a balanced work life balance so I'm surprised they don't have this perk."

- the company has always been very top heavy (ie way too many Directors, VPs and higher compared to functional level etc) and as a result very few roll up theirs sleeves and actually get stuff done.  Def too many cooks in the kitchen on many projects.

The sense that this is an amazing company, that people still enjoyed coming to work here, that feeling that you are supported in your role, that there is growth, and opportunity.  Great benefits to boot. This is all consistent with my understanding today.

You inspired this one little runt in the workforce. Please keep it up!","As seen in other reviews that stated we were moving towards IPO. Those statements were well written and accurate. You did and do feel the belt tightening, but as was stated, that is expected at this stage.  It's hard to feel any negativity about that and I hesitate to even mention it here. It's been stated that the 401k matching will be brought in post-IPO, as long as that is made into reality as was promised, and we have no reason to believe that won't happen, it's really just being patient until the when comes to pass.

The only legitimate complaint I could speak to is:
The training I received at this job was the worst I've ever received. That being said, the colleagues I immediately found myself surround by thereafter, made it so that did not matter so much. They, as well as my manager, were a large part of the reasons I succeeded. The people at this company are, by and large, heads above the average employee at my previous companies. This failure also presented an opportunity and I have worked endlessly to provide quality & actionable feedback to our training team. My managers have assisted in getting that feedback heard within our Training department as well.

You can learn a lot from others if you know how to spot the good ones.","Awful culture - no respect for work/life balance at all. People will be emailing you any time, including when you are on PTO, expecting a response. 

Bureaucracy and office politics are key here. If you are into that stuff, you will thrive. For every mentor helping you on your path there are five colleagues with a knife, plotting your demise.

No one takes ownership of anything there. You can talk to ten different people before you get help if you need something from another department/team. 

The support department are treated like children by their managers and leadership, leading them to act the part. Pizza and ice cream are given out like training treats for dogs, when really everyone just wants an opportunity to do more than crunch tickets and be a call center robot. Good boy!

For every competent colleague interaction you will have ten with checked-out employees.

They internally promote primarily based on tenure, leading to a lot of people in roles they should not have. This also leads to talent walking out the door if they have any kind of sense of urgency for their career prospects.

DTM will be a commodity within a few years. Not sure long term this company will survive after going public.

1385,DocuSign,DocuSign is awesome.,2017-12-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"At DocuSign, you won't be micromanaged. assigned busywork, or get tangled in a bunch of red tape when you want to get something done - we're too busy growing and accommodating that growth. Management trusts that the employees it hires hit the bar - and that bar is a very high one - so you deal with a high amount of responsibility and you are truly responsible for taking ownership of your results.

We have awesome benefits, plentiful PTO days, an amazing new mat/pat leave policy, work\life balance is good.

For the department/role I'm in, no complaints on compensation at all... Management has an eye for talent + work ethic and will make sure to recognize that by taking an active interest in developing your career.

We are located in the middle of downtown Seattle so no matter where you're coming from, public transportation is generally an option and not that bad. We also get a small transportation stipend (it won't cover all monthly commute costs, but hey, it's still money).                

As an employee of DocuSign, I can really see how the company lives by the phrase ""happy workers are productive workers."" We have nice perks; snacks, company happy hours, private zen rooms, catered lunches, swag, etc...But the most valuable perk here is the culture.  Dan Springer sets a very honest and down to earth tone within the company and you can tell he really cares about the quality of his employees' lives in and outside of work. People are friendly but if you're not super extroverted you won't feel obligated to be social. We have an entire day dedicated to volunteering and people really get into it. There is a place for every type of person at DocuSign.

I truly feel valued as an employee here and am proud of the tangible impact I've made within my department and the company during my employment at DocuSign. I've been able to develop my career and learn a lot, and learn it quickly, so I can learn more.","401k matching still hasn't been introduced, but I can imagine there might be changes down the road in terms of that policy.

You know what I said about growth in the pros section? Growing pains here are also real, but that is to be expected within a fast growing company (duh?). Sometimes processes are not defined and I've heard people complain of reorgs, but I honestly don't mind the minor frustrations that come with a fast growing company like DocuSign. I'd rather work at a company where you have to problem solve a lot to get a satisfying and tangible result, than work somewhere where everything is defined for you and you just feel like a ""cog in the machine."""

1409,DocuSign,A vision that yields happy customers and employees,2017-10-09,5.0,Director,"In my role, I interview a lot of people who often ask the question, ""What makes DocuSign culture special?"" Short answer: the product and the people.

Long story: The problem that DocuSign resolves is one that everyone from a grandparent to the CEO of a large company understands, so whether you're talking to a customer who recently implemented the product or a person you've just met explaining what you do for a living, the response to DocuSign is a responding, ""Wow! I love your company and the product!"" Working for an organization that yields that emotional response is very validating. Our mission and our product change business culture, improve efficiencies, and truly make people's lives simpler and easier. Everyone can appreciate that, and I think that feeling extends into the second thing that makes DocuSign's culture special, the people. 

The people who work at DocuSign are smart, driven, and well-rounded. If you're looking for a place where you feel like a small fish in a big pond, surrounded by talent that will elevate your game, this is the spot. There are very few gaps in organizational effectiveness, and it's fun to interact with departments and orgs within the company, knowing that you're working with a truly best-in-class group.  But, the company is in no way done growing and evolving, so there are certainly problems that can be resolved and areas where smart people can make a meaningful impact.","With so many interdependent departments and processes, evolving some of the areas of inefficiency can be arduous.

There is a good work-life balance as well as great company values and culture that make even the work time pleasant. The job is challenging, but very interesting as well. The DocuSign solution is very easy to use, but gets complex when you dive into the details to find a perfect fit for the client and his use-cases. The Management ist supportive and there is an open culture, which I personally enjoy to be a part of. As DocuSign is still comparably small in EMEA, I think the growth just started and will continue and with that it will be an even greater company to work for in the future.","DocuSign needs more local teams to support growth in DACH, which are native speakers and have a deeper understanding of the clients and market environment to drive adoption and growth."

It comes and goes in waves. Not your typical desk job. Much more exciting.

It's about ""just right"" size where you have support and a full set of corporate services like IT, HR, facilities, etc but small enough that when you see a problem that needs addressed, you can very often become a champion to solve that issue without having to check with 20 people first.  You end up solving the problem at many or every level in which it needs to be addressed, which is incredibly rewarding.

DocuSign is also a fairly flexible work environment for engineers, coming up with creative schedules, processes and locations for you to achieve your goals.

Finally, DocuSign is very exciting right now because our new CEO has been on board for just long enough to really have a grasp of everything and is starting to make the big moves we hoped the company would make for it's future.  Will we IPO soon? Don't ask me, but it sure seems like we've been closer than ever in the 3+ years I have worked here.

Finally, it is a company that cares about it's employees and the communities in which we live.  They have a matching gifts IMPACT program for non profits, plus continually add better and better benefits to support all sorts of workers with different abilities and life constraints.  Recent changes to family leave, for example , were very generous.  Diversity and gender equity are more than just checkboxes on a list here. They really seem to mean it.","Split between Seattle and San Francisco headquarters still has some division in ways teams work, style, process and leadership.

We are working on bringing a more Diverse voice into this space and continue to expand on the best ideas to help our customers win. 

I love that we can take time to volunteer with our favorite charitable groups. That is important to me, to have an Impact outside of DocuSign.

There is an open door policy from everyone I have interacted with so far.  Everyone wants to help out and see you succeed.  As a new hire, this is invaluable and helps you get up to speed and become effective much quicker.  I definitely joined an amazing company and feel very positive about the future of DocuSign and my career trajectory.","No 401k match, but leadership is aware that this is the #1 employee request and it will be a top priority in 2018.  Differences in quotas among the various sales teams drives differing priorities and thus behavior.  However management seems to be open to working through discrepancies."

- Not always possible to be entrepreneurial and move quickly given need to socialize and convince big egos
- Poor performers often kept around too long, including managers who are better at managing up than managing their teams"
1443,DocuSign,Great place to work for a engineer,2017-09-29,5.0,Engineer,"The engineering culture is among the best I've ever worked in.  The people are smart, fun to work with and passionate about doing the right thing.  

There are many technical spaces to work in with lots of interesting challenges.  Leadership is good at aligning peoples interests and kills with problems and then letting them run with the solution and implementation.

The product management folks I work with are great at what they do.  They know the product, what we need to do next and how to help engineering get there.

Flex schedules are a real thing.  People work from home and/or work schedules that fit their life so long as they are available in the office or online during core hours for collaboration.  

Pay isn't as competitive as some other large tech companies, but the trade off is that you work with an engineering team where you know everyone.   There's a lot to be said for that, especially when it comes time to get things done quickly

Aside from being good at the core things that I value at an employer, there are are nice perks you would find at a startup.  Free food and beverages, donuts and bagels on Friday, beer on tap, very nice facilities with great collaboration spaces, scooters, team outings, etc.","Very high work tempo from time-to-time can get you a little burned out, but that's true for any companies doing great things.  

401K match would be nice

I love working for an organization where they provide ample opportunity (i.e. 2 VTO days) to get out in my community and volunteer and even provide an amazing employee match program for contributions to my favorite charities.  Their recent addition of 6 mo maternity leave is fantastic.  The leadership here is excellent and I feel like I am in wonderful hands with the direction of where we are going.  I also feel like they have a very strong work life balance culture here, which is very important to me.  It makes me WANT to give back to the company even more -works out very well.",No 401K match.

They offer a great work life balance, good growth opportunities, strong benefits, and awesome team members to collaborate with.  

Also, I find great satisfaction working a company that changes the way people interact and do business.  It's hard to go back to thinking about printing loads of paper to throw a signature on it.",One of the downsides to date is there is no 401k match which is a benefit that I've come to expect.

1454,DocuSign,"Another year, another review!",2017-09-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Let's see, it's been a bit over two years for me. A lot has changed in that time, and I'd easily say most of it for the better. 

The company continues to grow, but the neck-breaking pace of my first 1-2 years has slowed. It feels more sustainable (we're definitely still growing) and that the focus is on maturity. 

We have a new CEO that seems to know what he's doing, or at least what he wants to do. He's been very consistent, very open, and prioritizes communication and answers the hard questions. 

The goals for the company are well outlined and the future is in sight. There are still more changes to be made for all the orgs within the company to align, but those changes are well on their way and so far they seem well thought out and appropriate.

There continues to be an abundance of opportunity to serve in our local communities through IMPACT events. And while the internal socializing (happy hour) has been cut back, when we do have them, they seem to be higher quality and worth while. 

Personally, I've been given a lot of opportunity to grow and succeed here. I am proud of what we do as a company, and blessed to be apart of it with. I look forward to many more years of learning, being challenged, and ultimately, growing.","With our IPO around the corner, you feel the belt tightening. More scrutiny for travel and money expenditure in general, but I'd say it's both a good thing and to be expected. 

Our benefits are slowly, but surely, expanding with the most recent being 6 months of leave for a new child, which is incredible. But, this is the con section, so I'll say that I hope our benefits in the area of 401k matching materialize after our IPO. 

There's still some inter-org struggles in terms of communication and usage of resources, but the silver lining is that our leadership is aware and directly working on it now. I feel it will be addressed by the end of this year and we'll be able to move forward better united."
1455,DocuSign,Honest review,2017-09-27,4.0,AM Vertical,"Solid product
Training on product is fantastic.
They hire the right people.  Makes it easy to work here
Culture is by far the most positive without being corny
Direct supervisors give:
 constructive feedback , 
decisions that shape us positively, 
fight hard to keep the culture positive
They have done the job before and are directly impacted by our performance, they have  a huge stake","More independence- don't treat everyone the same if we are performing well with early stand ups and working from home should be a more open option as often as we'd like.
Training needs to be more specific, organized and with intent for AM's.  
Better spiffs for over stretching goals, not gifts but maybe days off, parking pass,"

Love the 3 days VTO (volunteer time off) as well. Incredibly generous with food/snacks and lunches from time to time. Wonderful job for a great work-life balance.","Opportunities in advancement and work load is highly reliant on who your manager is. Seems promotions are not a direct result of skill-set and ability, more of who you know which can be deflating. Still fall back on a ""start-up"" culture, but have had enough years to get more structure in place already."

The pay, benefits and work life balance are all better than at most companies.  What I like best is the people and the culture.  Its great to work for a company that has so much potential, and with people who share a common goal.","The pace of change can be challenging.

2. Managers aren't micro-micromanaging.  Employees are friendly 
4. office is in a great location - right down the street from Bart/Muni/ Transbay Terminal 
5. Interviewing here was good, because it felt more like they were trying to get to know you rather than judge you based only on your skills","1. They don't offer a great deal of perks such as gym reimbursement, parking, educational class allowance. Their transportation allowance barely makes a dent. 
2. Administrative professionals are under-appreciated and lack fair pay
3. Teams/ departments feel separated. (if you go to a company event you'll feel like everyone is a stranger besides the few people you work with)
4. Their payables, purchasing teams and processes can use a great deal of improvement - simple tasks can take months/weeks. lack of response and unclear procedures are rampant. 
5. on-boarding new employees process should be more professional. (i.e. give a tour of the office, encourage managers to setup a lunch with their new employee on the first day instead of making them sit through orientation, introduce them to key people, and make them feel more  welcomed) 
6. better pay raises and career grown for any administrative professional"

What I've found over my four years at DocuSign is they care about making the world a better place and care for their employees.  This includes giving back to the community, to matching donations to charities, and for me (and most importantly) are the employee benefits.  I was diagnosed with Cancer this past year and I've had very little out of pocket expenses.   Which has allowed me to focus on getting better vs worrying about how to pay medical expenses.  Again, DocuSign CARES and I feel fortunate to work for such a great company!","DocuSign is continually evolving, which is fun to be a part of."

Management is very supportive as well as fellow team mates. We have a very collaborative team and as we are all in the same building it is easy to walk to someone when we need help with something. 

Office location is the best as it's in the city and close to Circular Quay. Sometimes I'll go for a walk on my lunch break and soak up the sun. 

The Kitchen is well stocked and supplied. And there's always a drink on hand come Friday afternoons.","Probably the long commute to the city. But that's because I live so far away.

Management constantly shows appreciation of their team's hard work, which is key to keeping people moving in an upwards projection. There is catering all the time, a kitchen stocked with snacks, and comfortable working environments. We do team events around Seattle all the time which are great as well.","They took away the ramp period when you are internally promoted from SDR to MDR, meaning you are on full quota from day 1 in your new position. This will severely affect my annual attainment number, and my income took a dip for the first 2 months which was extremely discouraging. I think this was a poor choice on the company."

I was sent to Discovering DocuSign in Seattle and fully on-boarded with dashboards/tools/training within 4 weeks.

- Recurring company-wide, large team, and small team meetings/happy hours and lunches.  Strong sense of connection to the larger organization.

- Communication and open dialogue with employees about future visions and planning for the company.  CEO, CMO, Head of Sales, and Chief Product Officer host town hall meetings and open Q&A for employees worldwide to ask about the proposed direction for the product.

- Periodic rewards and call-outs for high performers on teams

- Great offices!  Fun places to work in convenient, beautiful locations.","- As the company grows larger, teams struggle to define roles and responsibilities clearly as well as understand who to work with cross-functionally.

I've been blow away by the continual career growth opportunities I've been given and leadership's continued willingness and flexibility to work me to ensure a long and fruitful relationship.

The work/life balance is great. The people I work with are great. Compensation is highly competitive and the company is on a fantastic trajectory.

DocuSign's also recently approved an employee-match program for charitable donations which I think is a very cool illustration of senior leadership's commitment to social impact and supporting employee's personal and professional passions.",Very high expectations and a lot of pressure/stress in the sales org. It is a very quarterly-driven environment and the last 2 weeks of every quarter are intense. This is something I personally appreciate -- but would not be ideal for all personality types.

Great product! It’s been years since I’ve worked at a company with such positive brand recognition.

Excellent location for commuting on public transit.

Generous time off  policy. We get 20 days plus an extra PTO day for our birthday.

Terrific people who are smart, dedicated and very capable. Great leadership.

Competitive benefits - medical, dental, vision, commuter subsidy, 401k, and a free personal DocuSign account.

Socially conscious with matching gifts for non-profit donations and other opportunities to make a difference through the Impact program. Paid volunteer time off.

Very nice working conditions - comfortable office building in SOMA, up to date hardware and software, a well-stock kitchens on every floor.

Wonderful orientation program that really makes you feel a part of the DocuFamily.","I can find very few Cons:

I dislike the PTO policy that includes sick days. I would like to have a set amount of sick days separate from PTO. It’s a drag to use PTO when you’re sick and it encourages people to come to work sick to conserve PTO.

There are some politics but I feel this is unavoidable in any company - even those who claim to have no politics. It’s just the nature of business."

Culture
There is a real sense of 'we', 'us' and togetherness at DocuSign that I've never experienced at other SaaS companies, and likely never will again. Sure, we have our branded t-shirts, beer on a Friday, quiz nights but culture means so much more here. 

From the outset at the interview, you sense you are working with a company who carefully considers their Employee experience. Timely, well planned updates and sincere communication, show you how much DocuSign genuinely cares.

Structured on-boarding, coupled with clear objectives at Company and team level ensure everyone is pulling in the same direction. I'm in no doubt of what my team are here to achieve and personally never felt so empowered to drive change - it builds palpable confidence which ultimately benefits our customers in the long run. 

Effective Execution
We own problems. We are accountable. We execute. Every. Single. Damn. Time.  Kind of sums it up.

Born Problem Solvers & Creative People
Solutions, solutions, solutions. It is all you hear in the: canteen, hallways, kitchen, desks, water cooler. Very refreshing to be part of a company that has found their 'why' and sense of identity.

Civil disagreement is welcomed, however, admiring the problem, is not. What kind of work environment does this create? Well rounded, humble human beings who leave their egos at the door and genuinely want to solve real world problems.","Rapid growth and scale. We are growing rapidly and this creates challenges with regards process.

Colleagues are generally very supportive of each other (management is not).  Everyone I see works hard - there are no slackers here. Snacks are pretty good. 20 days of vacation time is not bad either.,"Sales operations and finance in San Francisco are understaffed and overworked. Management hears complaints, makes promises to change, but does not actually act. There is no room for career advancement and there is no time for professional development. There are too many managers for a company this size. Sometimes managers do not even have direct reports. Management rarely promotes from within. They would rather hire someone from the outside with more experience than develop their existing employees. A path to promotion is extremely unclear- criteria seems to be based on tenure and office politics rather than merit. Accounting does not believe in promotions and raises outside of the annual focal cycle, so if you may have to wait almost 2 years to be considered for promotion if you time it wrong. This policy is grossly unfair since other departments do not enforce this rule and many people in other departments get promoted outside of the annual focal. DocuSign claims to pay at the 50th percentile, but it's low for San Francisco. Since salary is so low, everyone is counting on a successful IPO to make it worth it to stay."

We hire unusually excellent people who are great fits for the DocuSign culture. We have a virtuous cycle here - experienced, mature, nice people refer more experienced, intelligent, nice people.

i have never worked somewhere where so many people genuinely seem to want you to succeed and are helpful, from fellow account managers to AE's to technical teams- i really do feel supported and all i have to do is take everything in, give it my all and ramp up fast.  its truly an amazing culture that i had not seen before.","nothing out of the ordinary for a sales role, sometimes things can be stressful but thats the nature of the beast."

- Focused on performance.  I appreciate DocuSign's focus on consistently over-performing. As a sales organization, there's a powerful focus on becoming a predictable revenue generating SAAS machine. If you like performing at a high level in a sales organization, you'll do well here.
- Opportunity. DocuSign's mission is to rid the world of paper. A tall stand for sure. Yet, I've noticed an innate confidence that the company will reach that objective.

The best thing about the company is the product which is obviously very recognizable and well liked but that doesn't make the workload or office environment worth it.,"Senior management (VPs and above) are not allocating resources appropriately which is resulting in obscene amounts of work for many teams. Workload can be offset, to an extent, with compensation, but even on that front, Docusign falls well short of similarly sized companies. On top of that, lower level employees are borderline disrespected in how they are treated and communicated to. Rather than address any of the structural issues, many senior leaders simply plug their ears and tell their employees to work more. As if 10-12 hours days aren't enough. HR doesn't help matters as I witnessed numerous occasions where employee confidentiality was not respected."

The Company atmosphere, culture and people are amazing.   They hire young, energetic, fun, talented and generally awesome people so making friends will come easily.  In addition, the Seattle Office is beautiful, sleek and modern with a view of the Puget Sound and Mt. Rainier.   There’s always a company event happening or group you can join.  It’s an exciting and fun company to work for.","Being an MDR is a grind
Be prepared “to be caffeinated, in seat and ready to rock-n-roll” at 8 am sharp!
This is a high energy, telemarketing job.  Your day will be spent making cold calls and responding to emails all day.   It’s pretty mindless. 
It’s an entry level, high stress, high pressure, low paying job.
Do not take this job unless you are fresh out of college or have very little work experience.  

Micromanaged
It’s a Big Brother type of atmosphere on the MDR Team. By that I mean the Director and Managers watch things like your time in office and out, when you went to lunch, how many calls and emails you make, etc.  I think this is due to a couple different factors. The first being the team has tripled within a year and micromanaging is the only way they feel they have control over results.  The second being, we’re pre-IPO with a new CEO on the “path to profitability” and there’s more pressure coming down on the Director/Managers to produce said results.
Your day is planned for you.  There are call blocks in the mornings and afternoons which are mandatory.  There is also a call minimum of 30+ calls a day which the Director and Managers check daily.  You will get praised or reprimanded on your call volume.
So if you like being an autonomous worker, this job is not for you.

Competition - “Building your Brand”
The competition to move up and get promoted is fierce.
Your reputation and likability are more important than your results.
To get promoted you need to make the right connections and ""play the game” to move up. 
Do not rock the boat or speak up about things you do not agree with.  Dissent is not allowed, will be remembered and not tolerated.
More men are promoted than women.  (This may be due to an imbalance in the gender makeup of the sales force but still, it’s noticeable.)"

1618,DocuSign,Trust = Growth,2016-12-07,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"As someone who has been a career Sales Engineer, I figured going to DocuSign would be a great experience due to the momentum of the product and the strength of their sales org.  I wasn't wrong on those assumptions, but that's not really why this has been such an amazing experience.  

The real deal is far simpler: this is a company that only hires people it believes in.  When you get started here, there isn't a lot of hand-holding in the on-boarding process, not because they're lacking the resources, but because they trust that you're going to ask questions, be a part of the team, and involve others in your work.  This is a company culture that is built around growing a happy customer base by first developing happy, successful, and confident employees.

What that means for SEs is that you're going to be handed responsibilities off the bat that will immediately take you to another level.  This is the kind of trust that is usually developed over months or even years of repetitive discos and demos at other companies (paying dues), but here they hire on trust, and then allow you to grow into a role that might initially be bigger than what you anticipated.  So if what you're looking for is something that can help you grow out of a role that is starting to become routine, and allow you to start tackling real problems that test your ingenuity and resourcefulness, and do it at a place that doesn't make you feel small or dirty when you speak with customers, then start reaching out to people here and learn more.  It's not a fit for everyone, but, if it is, it's going to feel right in a way that I've never felt before in my career, and that's a tremendous feeling.","There's not much to complain about with the job, I just wish we had 401k matching.  I've heard rumors it's in the works, possibly around the time or after we IPO, but there's nothing set in stone.  I also wish we had a gym stipend, but that might also come down the pike in the future.

I also hope we continue to partner up fast with emerging technologies.  I can't complain about this because we have a very well-documented API, but we should be top of the list for other emerging and growth companies when they think of integration partners, and sometimes we don't advertise enough and the end result requires revisions.  Be proactive, trust the channels, and this won't be a problem down the line."

The company has stayed true to its roots and core values. As an employee, there are always new challenges and opportunities to grow, work on new projects, meet new people, etc.

I've been in the software/technology industry for 30+ years, and DocuSign is my favorite company to be a part of and experience.","As we have grown, processes and resources have not always kept up.

1632,DocuSign,Sales Intern,2016-10-08,5.0,,"This internship not only provides you with an immense amount of foundational sales knowledge, through initial on-boarding and continual training, but it also gives you a chance to contribute meaningful work. The projects we worked on mirrored what the actual sales team was doing and we were able to see actual monetary contribution to the company by the end of the program. While there was structure, after a task was given there was autonomy to figure out and work on the task in our own manner. The full time employees were also very helpful and welcoming. The recruiters in charge of the program also do an above and beyond job of setting up fun activities inside and outside of the office and are very easy to communicate with about the intern roles. DocuSign also provided opportunities to meet with C level executives within the company to gain more insight about all parts of the organization.","Because DocuSign is still a growing company you have to be comfortable with a somewhat shifting program, shifting roles, and sometimes being the first to ever attempt to tackle a task."
1633,DocuSign,Heavy workload - Weak compensation package,2016-10-05,3.0,Account Manager,Super fun people.  Kitchen stocked with free food.  Nice office space and amenities.  Great holiday parties.  Get to work with a lot of big name companies.,Most processes are a mess...nothing seemed to be streamlined.  Constant change with little or no notice.  Very high expectations with little assistance from Management.  Pay is considerably less than comparable companies/positions.  Zero flexibility to work from home and actually require you to be in the office at 7am even if you cover an East Coast territory.
1634,DocuSign,Fantastic,2016-10-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Docusign has the benefits of top tech companies as well as the benefits of a smaller companies.

There is the challenging and stimulating nature of the work that comes with a strong technical company. There is also very good compensation, with high base salary, all medical/dental/vision premiums paid, 4 weeks vacation, RSUs, free stocked kitchens, and more.

But why work for Docusign over one of the larger tech giants like Google or Facebook? The answer is that Docusign is still a young company. There's room for much more impact on the growth of the company. There's more freedom, and quite simply a fantastic work-life balance that seems to have escaped tech giants.","Docusigns future is not necessarily as stable, considering how there is currently no CEO, and there is a desire to go public. The company could be bought out and changed, which can be scary to some. However, since most of the current investors seem to be quite reputable companies like Google and Apple, I would argue that Docusign is still quite a safe bet."

1639,DocuSign,"An innovative, engaging company with very talented engineers",2016-09-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"DocuSign provides very innovative products that improve business and personal transactions substantially by enabling electronic signatures and providing a vast assortment of associated electronic document management options. The growth of the company provides a delightful array of technical challenges and opportunities, allowing engineers to grow in many directions and remain versatile and leverage multiple stacks (.NET, Node.js, etc.) in interesting combinations.

The company is poised for a great deal of continued growth and employs a number of very intelligent engineers, making it a delight to work here as a software engineer. The benefits offered to employees are also quite substantial.","While DocuSign is growing quickly, it is also working through normal growing pains, including how to organize and manage teams and priorities. There is also a tendency within the Engineering organization to form cliques amongst employees that worked together in other large companies; while not an outright problem, it does complicate making clear evaluations of software / technology as they apply to DocuSign, rather than the company at which that clique previously worked (e.g. ""we tried this at X and it didn't work out so well, so we will avoid that here."").

There are also limited opportunities for advancement as the company is still growing and has not yet established a clear track for career growth. Additionally, compensation - while the overall package is quite substantial - is lower in terms of raw salary than others. These issues are not uncommon for a growing company, but are still present."

The company was great to grow with however that ended a few years ago with a change in management. Any advancement means moving to San Francisco, there is no opportunities for career growth in Seattle office, it is viewed as a ""shared services"" group now.

Not enough customer contact in engineering on some projects."
1656,DocuSign,Exciting Future!,2016-08-09,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"First and foremost, DocuSign's work life balance is hard to beat. Flexibility in working schedules allows employees to accommodate their outside-of-work needs accordingly and remain productive and focused. This is all based on trust relationships between employees and supervisors, and those who were not able to accommodate to this culture and value set have been managed out of the company.
Work is usually very interesting and challenging, I have never felt bored with the tasks at hand and there is always a ton of work in many other areas waiting for somebody to take on, in case you ever feel in need of a change. 
DocuSign also supports employee's mobility in order to retain good talent and foster employees growth. I have witnessed many people moving between offices, roles and teams without much of an issue.
There is also a wealth of opportunities to bond and interact with your team and people in other roles by participating in many of the social activities being organized throughout the year, including Friday Happy Hours, team off-sites, picnics, sporting events, etc.
Overall, DocuSign is a great place to work.","It is very well known that DocuSign's compensation is lower than other companies in the area of the same size and maturity leve, but for many of us a good work/life balance kind of evens it out. Also, although DocuSign offers a good amount of PTO and 100% paid premiums in health coverage for employees, the company is falling behind in other benefits like 401K matching, reasonably priced health premiums for family members and their parental leave is very sub par compared to the rest of the companies in the Bay Area.
Finally, our hiring processes are all over the place and range very widely between teams, so we are in desperate need of more standardized and purified processes."

Leadership is approachable and shares strategy and direction - also very open to ideas and improvements. Employees genuinely enjoy hanging out together - in and out of the office. Market leader. People truly love our product - have people share their ""DocuStories"" all the time when you share where you work and what you do.

As for sales - we're often dealing with status quo - can be a little harder to sell into, but that changes monthly as we only continue to grow and get recognition."
1661,DocuSign,"Team focused, empowering to employees",2016-08-08,5.0,Account Manager,"I've worked for a lot of companies, but DocuSign is the first place that I've felt like they actually WANT people to stay here for a long time. They aren't trying to burn you out and then toss you aside like many tech startups. There is a proven track-record of promoting from within, investing in employees (For example - just started a masters level leadership program through the University of Washington as a free benefit to leaders within the company).
Leadership is thoughtful, caring, and respectful of their employees and truly committed to seeing them succeed, and not only succeed, but be happy and fulfilled. 
The pay is fair and they do what they can to add perks throughout the quarter, but they're not throwing money into stupid things like bean bags and razor scooters just to make it seem like this is a cool place to work. It's just a good place to work and people want to come and give their best.
Plus, it's a pre-IPO company that is poised to have a great public launch.","There is getting to be a bit more corporate feel (more levels of approval to get a deal done). Comes with the territory as a company gets bigger and more successful, but it does slow things down a bit."

People here are fun and friendly. Lots of food. Good office locations and nice working environment.","As mentioned in  other reviews, DocuSign's internal processes are in dire need of improvement. Although ""process"" comes up a lot in the hallway in frustration laced conversations but upper management is taking no action to improve them. This inaction is evidence of either a general apathy on management's part, ignorance regarding how nimble companies manage process, or a lack of executive leadership which should be clearing barriers to enable sales and administrative execution opposed to spinning around in an attempt to get through internal processes."
1663,DocuSign,Just getting started,2016-08-08,4.0,Business Development,"- Amazing market opportunity.  eSignatures are inevitable.  This is the future of signing documents, coming to agreement, etc
- Strong market lead.  Solving eSignature problems around the world - legality, compliance, local cultural preference etc - is not easy.  We are making the investments to stay ahead of the smaller players
- Experienced management team.  Our leaders have created and run successful public companies before.  No first-timers here.","- Commoditization.  We are working day and night to avoid being perceived as a Feature (versus being a Platform / Product).  So far we are doing a great job
- Competition.  The market is hot, so competition is fierce (and growing).  That's largely a positive, but we need to continue selling value to fend off the low-end market pressure we get from vendors giving away low-value eSignature offerings at low prices.  This is a solve-able problem.  
- Change.  Growing a company at this pace, with this type of unique product offering (Consumer, Enterprise, Global, etc), is tricky.  Getting the right people in at the right time is a very nuanced exercise.  We have had leadership changes - positive ones - but they still take time to process and adjust to.  The current leadership team is settling in and doing a great job."

The CEO and the leaders genuinely care about the employees.
Work/life balance.  My experience here is that I have the flexibility I want as long as I deliver.  I think this is true across the company.  It is not a culture of ""butt in seat"" 14 hours a day. You can feel comfortable leaving early if you need to catch your child's play or sporting event and it's encouraged.","Hyper growth is not easy.  We have offices in SF, SEA, Dublin, London, Tokyo, Sydney, Paris, Tel Aviv and Sao Paulo. Systems, process and training are all playing catch up to the growth of the company.

Company focused on longevity (13+ years already!) and really digging into vertical markets. 

Sales is a great group of people, mostly referrals from other employees. Lots of ex- Salesforce & Oracle people looking for a change of pace but not too startup-like... SMB group is younger (mostly <30) and growing quickly, with excellent management.","There is a bit of competition between the Sales team and the Website / Self Service team, which is kind of unheard of -- almost a bit of cannibalization competition internally. Just something to be aware of for the Sales team. Also, the team isn't nearly as drinking-heavy happy hour all the time as a lot of other companies, which honestly can be a good thing.

It's transformational and we're saving them millions along the way. That's powerful.

We have amazing leadership. Extremely experienced people that are taking this company to new heights. 

The company is growing and there's a feeling of excitement - we're creating a category and racing to claim global leadership in the space. which also means there's a ton of growth ahead an an opportunity to grow with the company.

People here are smart and excited to come to work and crush it. which makes for a great environment. It's a very collaborative environment and I feel I can speak my mind and will be taken seriously.

Our product is both consumer facing and enterprise facing, so you get to learn both sides of this business, which is great. 

We're still private. That means some upside as well as more flexibility in how we go to market.","While we're still private, we're not really a ""startup"" anymore. The company is growing at a rapid pace and we just crossed the 2,000 employee mark. That means we have some pains as we look to bring structure without loosing nimbleness.
One area that needs to catch up with our growth is Development. I work in a pretty unique part of the company, so can only speak from my own experience, but I feel the company needs to do a better job at making the career path clear, and offer training to help people be ready for their next step in their career in the company."

As a result, the finer details of personnel management isn't always of highest priority.  Once the investors exit, often times companies begin to mature into a cadence that focuses on making each team member successful, with more investments on personnel.

Not only that, but managemenr at various levels (manager, director, VP) interact with the team regularly. They're open to our ideas, suggestions, and concerns. Our teammates are an amazing group of people. Each person adds their own flavor and we each care deeply about the success of one another. Yes, you are in charge of your own quota, but everyone wants to see you get there too. The company has invested SIGNIFICANTLY into our growth as sellers. As someone near the very beginning of my career, being invested in ways other than monetary (believe me, that happens too) was hugely important. I wanted to be taught good habits early, so 10 years down the line I don't have to spend time fixing bad habits. DocuSign was the best decision I made for that. I'm mentored by individuals in house and hired 3rd parties. My account executive helps me to learn, besides management, and in conjunction with my peers. I'm learning 'sales' from a number of angles, styles, and personalities and I couldn't be happier.","Our team is exploding. That's a great thing! But it also can make it hard on new members because it can be challenging to understand where and who your resources are. The 'veterans' help as much as possible, but many of us have only been around 6-9 months longer than the new hires so we also have a lot we're still learning. The company is exploding - also a great thing! People are moving up quickly and often! But, with that growth, our company and team have to adjust to help keep this big ship movin' in the right direction and sometimes that adjustment is challenging initially."

1744,DocuSign,Just shy of two years - my perspective,2016-05-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing main office location and work environment in San Francisco
Great social and art team
Lots of partners and integration with the product
Developer marketing and evangelizing of APIs is strong
Good reputation and established customer base","Blindsides happen - if things aren't going well for you (even though you may think they are) be warned, there is no formal process for termination or performance plan to turn things around.  I received an exit note in my email one day without warning with no recourse or reason in writing.
Slowing down - new security review processes have been put in place to reduce risk over the past year - most without prior warning.  The problem is that simple things like a simple read-only partner integration between cloud apps has to go through a multi-part and prolonged process to be approved and implemented.  If you like to move fast and get things done quickly in the environment anticipate long wait times and due process.
One dimensional - The product is focused on e-signature and the workflow associated with it.  While the best in the industry, the challenge is that since its not a multi-product company or platform you will be doing your work around the signing event.  
Product innovation slow - Since I was hired nearly two years ago the product was being transitioned to the ""new experience"".  Nearly two years later the product is still in transition and a lot of core things still need to be done on aged classic platform.
Budget cuts - the road to profitability has led to a lot more scrutiny of budgets and sometimes employee perks.
Leadership stagnant - leadership showing its age for a pre-ipo company"

They are a very top heavy company with too much management and people with poor social skills are put into management positions.

Management also works hard to provide campaigns for the team to supplement your own prospecting efforts.","You only learn from your peers and personal experience. Management does very little to provide training and development. The xDR teams are growing so fast that it extinguishes the culture that once was. Rapid growth looks great from the top, but really hurts morale when you're down at the bottom fighting to hit your monthly goals in a shrinking territory.

Additionally, there are incredibly successful email sales tools out there for teams like this, yet they don't exist at DocuSign. At least one person complained about the email tool every day for six months. Nothing changed, so we were forced to continue down a path ridden with resistance. What's funny is that almost every day, we heard from management suggestions on how to be more efficient."

The actual product and technical side of the house is amazing. Not afraid to spend money to achieve their goals.,"I usually do not bother writing reviews, but after reading the two (fake?) reviews raving about the great opportunity in Enterprise Sales, I had to weigh in.

If cons of the sort described below don't bother you, you can have a very successful, stable, stress-free 9-5 job.","Management (in San Francisco at least) has a systemic inability to recognize and correct bad decisions. It seems like they spend most of their time in meetings making excuses so they don't have to take a perceived political hit for making a bad choice, instead of owning it and doing something better.

This influence from the top has made its way into individual hiring decisions, where hiring managers make excuses for candidates and look down on anyone who gives negative interview feedback. This has created an engineering culture where people either blindly do what they're told and code exactly to spec (even if it's the wrong thing for customers and the company), or get frozen out, badmouthed, and belittled for speaking their minds and raising valid concerns.

Add to this a total lack of technical mentorship or career growth opportunities, and I guess what I'm saying is that it's definitely not an engineering-driven culture."

1761,DocuSign,Good first corporate job,2016-03-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The people are great! Lots of great social events to network.,Management picks favorites. Hiring so many new people makes it a lot more competitive and harder to succeed.

1763,DocuSign,Docusign is growing but still immature in many ways,2016-03-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The company is growing and there is a lot of excitement around an eventual IPO. They have snacks that are decent and started offering lunches a couple days a week. Can't beat the location.,"The management and processes at Docusign are behind the industry standard. The managers appear to make hiring decisions on a whim, technical interviews are haphazard, and the middle management spends most of their day on politics and don't even know how to code. Also, although most tech companies lack diversity, Docusign hasn't released numbers because they are probably much worse than most--I have yet to see a woman speak at an all hands, for example. At the holiday party this year, they chose to have dancers in see through lace lingerie and thongs--how is this supposed to help women feel more included as equals in tech roles at this company?"
1764,DocuSign,"Good place to work, room for improvement",2016-03-20,4.0,,"- My work-life balance is very good here, probably better than any other tech company I've worked at in the Bay Area. 
- I have been given the opportunity to move around within the engineering organization when I've asked to do so, even to roles in which I had little prior experience. I have found DocuSign to be very willing to invest in my growth and success; the company seems to really see it as investing in its own success, which is rare and refreshing. 
- I get to work on and help build software that facilitates commerce, and positively impacts the lives of many people. This is a big deal to me personally; there are plenty of companies looking to make a quick buck by building trivial, derivative garbage and then getting acquired; Docusign is not one of those companies in my view. 
- When I tell people where I work, the reaction is almost always positive toward the product. I take pride in that.","- From where I sit, it is a very top-heavy organization. There are executives who were added in the last 2-3 years whose actual roles and contributions I couldn't even hazard a guess at. Their titles seem to be a handful of important-sounding business words randomly thrown together, and I presume their actual contributions to be of similar depth and necessity. 
- I still feel that DocuSign is more a sales-focused organization than an engineering-focused one. Some may not see this as a negative, but I certainly do.
- The anticipated IPO was used as a carrot to entice potential employees as long as three and a half years ago, and still is not imminent, AFAIK. Lots of pre-IPO companies do this, especially in tech, but that doesn't make it any less distasteful. Additionally, there is a fair amount of secrecy and even duplicity around it, which I find to be both unnecessary and counterproductive."

New leadership from the last few years has brought proven discipline and process and the overall deal support is better than anywhere I've been.  Talent exists in every department and they are all eager to help.   

The market is maturing  to the point where enterprise wide deployments are becoming the norm.  F500 is increasingly aware of our impact and we are quickly becoming a ""must-have"".  Chief Digital Officers starting to pop up everywhere.   

Still very early innings.  Huge upside for the right Enterprise Execs.  If you've done your homework and know your territory, you will be successful.","Not a con but an observation.....DocuSign is a rocket ship.  Not many companies have our YoY growth the last 5 to 10 years.   Expect turbulence.  In fact, embrace it.    Stay focused and prioritize your time wisely.   Adaptability and focus are fundamental to any sales job...perhaps a bit more here than others."

Sales leadership is very experienced and is executing on a playbook that has a strong track record for success.  80% YoY growth after 10 years in business is pretty amazing.  The culture is very supportive and positive.  The ROI is insane.  By far the best place I have ever worked!,"There is a lot of change with a company that is growing this fast.  This is not a negative, but it does require adaptability and focus.

The atmosphere at DocuSign is very fun and motivating. People not only care about the company and job that they have, but they also share a lot of compassion for one another. I literally wake up excited to come to work every day… As an MDR, I am able to continue to build my foundation of sales skills, join an encouraging team, grow as a leader, and have a variety of promotional paths available. The MDR management is also SUPER supportive, and helpful with ensuring that you are successful and happy within your role.","With such a successful and fast-growing company, one can occasionally feel overwhelmed.

Less than 5% of enterprise reps are at or over quota in any given year of the last 5.  The compensation plan is the worst in the industry, both in structure (incomprehensible) and earnings.  It has continued to decline each and every year.  DocuSign has had to raise base salaries to $150k and at-plan to $300k + non-recoverable draw for 6 months and 15k-20k stock options just to get anyone to work here during the past year after the previous mass quittings.  As you can see by the replies of DocuSign to every slightly critical review on this site, DocuSign cares more about arguing with people than fixing their own problems.  This is a churn-and-burn shop.  Work-life balance is nonexistent for any rep who gets past 50% of their quota, and in 2015, that was fewer than 1/4 of all reps.  Run, run, run to you next interview...DocuSign's executives are.  DocuSign has lost their CEO, founder, and Chief Legal officer in just the past few months.  The much-advertised IPO is further away than ever with our executives and sales managers (3 gone in 2015) leaving this sinking ship.  DocuSign enterprise sales resumes are flooding the market right now."
1779,DocuSign,Just joined the ride...,2016-02-18,5.0,Member Of Technical Staff,Great team. great products and wonderful future ahead of us...,"Sometimes the company seems to be growing too fast, creating some confusion and shifts of responsibilities."
1780,DocuSign,Thoughts from a new MDR,2016-02-17,5.0,Market Development Representative,"After working at DocuSign for just over a month, it is clear that the market development team is a great place to start your career within the organization. The team, full of high-energy, motivated, and helpful co-workers, is growing rapidly and the role provides a tangible, and high-visibility, way to impact the company. As a whole, DocuSign has a great training/onboarding program and seems truly committed to ensuring the success of their new hires. On the practical side, DocuSign offers great benefits and a fair compensation package for the role. Pros: peers, team mentality, growth opportunities, ability to function autonomously, leadership.","The MDR team is growing so quickly, leadership is still figuring out how to get all the new hires assimilated and up to speed. They have taken great strides towards creating more structure both within the team and the training program, but those who are not willing to advocate for themselves when they need help may find this challenging."
1781,DocuSign,Unicorn of the decade,2016-02-17,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"I have been at the company a little over 5 months and my personal development continues on a daily basis.

- Management is phenomenal - they truly care about your personal development and provide the tools for you to develop your own success.
- Your input counts! Changes are implemented quickly, effectively, and most importantly in a positive environment.
- Exposure to decision makers, processes, and different verticals (healthcare, tech, etc.)
- Learning is done with peers rather than data bases full of information.",- Processes change frequently and you must be adaptable to change
1782,DocuSign,"Finally, progress. New CFO rocks!!!",2016-02-17,3.0,,"Still feeling the burn... rate. But a lot more optimistic that reality is making a comeback to DocuSign. Nothing personal, but you can't have a 10:1 deadwood ratio among execs without killing the tree.","Much dysfunction and deadwood remains. You can trim 2/3 of the execs, especially the ""tired old legacies"" without anyone noticing or drop in revenues. Go back and read Lean Startup."
1783,DocuSign,Couldn't be more excited to be along for the ride,2016-02-16,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Docusign is one of the most promising and exciting tech companies in the northwest, It is full of opportunities for advancement, management that is dedicated to your success, constantly new initiatives and plenty of perks","As the company grows and evolves, policy must change along with it, as long you are open to growing and changing though you won't have any problems keeping up."
1784,DocuSign,Sales Development Representative,2016-02-12,4.0,Sales Development Representative,"The SDR pits are always so full of life. I love being a part of such a fantastic atmosphere where I look forward to seeing my coworkers every day. The culture is absolutely incredible filled with young individuals who like to have fun, but also know when to buckle down and work extremely hard. So happy to be part of such a great company as it is growing so quickly.",Only con would be slight growing pains. With the company expanding so rapidly things are constantly changing. But the constant change is exciting because of the direction the company is going.
1785,DocuSign,What is design?,2016-02-12,1.0,Art Director,Lets see....cafe on the 8th floor offers a wide selection of coffee and snacks for free. The office also provides some beautiful views of the Bay.,"Not a design centric company at all. Speed is always valued over quality, which is ultimately at the cost of the user. I got out of there as soon as I realized what was going on!"
1786,DocuSign,SDR,2016-02-11,5.0,SDR,"DocuSign is an incredible company to work for.  I could not be happier here and could say endless good things about this company.  The best part of working at DocuSign is the culture and the people.  There is a work-hard play-hard mentality, and the energy here is contagious.  The people are kind and fun, and also hardworking and incredibly motivated.  DocuSign provides a very good work/life balance and gives you more vacation time than any other company I have heard of.  The hours are somewhat flexible and they make it easy to do whatever you need to do outside of work while maintaining a full time, demanding, career.  You cannot go wrong with working at a company like DocuSign!","Only con would be that since it is a newer company, things are constantly getting modified and changed.  This is a good thing, but only if you are adaptable to change."
1787,DocuSign,Sales Development Representative,2016-02-11,5.0,SDR,"I have been working as a Sales Development Representative for over a year. Management is great, sales training is top notch. I have grown tremendously since I first started working here, and plan to be here for a long time. There is still a lot of room to grow within the organization to grow, and learn. All around, employees are treated great. The Break room has great snacks, and beverages ranging from tea to many types of juices and Sodas. DocuSign has a great product and is a leader in the market. Its an exciting place to be.","Growing as quick as it has, there are changes that come along and you have to be adaptable."
1788,DocuSign,Sales Development Representative (SDR),2016-02-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The SDR role is definitely the best place to start your sales career.  I moved from the east coast all the way to Seattle, WA just to work for this company and my experience here has been nothing short of amazing. Everyone is always willing to extend a helping hand and you are constantly rewarded for your success & accomplishments. I am beyond proud to be apart of this DocuSign family.",I do not have any negatives to talk about working here at DocuSign. Sales in general will always have its ups and downs but it is important to stay positive in order to be successful.
1789,DocuSign,Awesome Company and Culture,2016-02-11,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Overall DocuSign is an amazing company. I was at Amazon before this and the environment here actually makes me passionate about coming to work every day. Management is insanely receptive and helpful. Work is challenging yet very rewarding. There are happy hours, superb benefits, rewards for blowing your quota out (i.e. dinner at Daniels Broiler) etc. etc. Also all of my coworkers are great. It is very hard to think of anything negative about this job.","-With high growth/expansion there is a lot of hiring and this may create fewer opportunities in the future for promotion
-Pay could be a little bit more competiive"
1790,DocuSign,Sales Development Representative,2016-02-11,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Honestly everything about this company and role is phenomenal. Hence the the title, it is a sales role but don't let that scare anybody looking to jump into a role at a tech company that is absolutely on top. on top of the market and on top of tech ""start ups"". Sales Development is a great introductory role to selling and to DocuSign. Start as an SDR and you can go anywhere in the company, and yes, it is a sales role, but selling for this company is unlike any sales role out there as the product and technology basically sells itself.

Aside from the work being fun, the company culture is that of a mature startup. Its full of energy, games, beers, and employees who are very smart and into the tech industry. I would HIGHLY recommend this role and this company to anyone who is reading this review.",I have been with the company for about 9 months and honestly ask anybody who works at DocuSign and they will tell you there are no cons to consider when looking at this SDR role or the company as a whole.
1791,DocuSign,Best Company I Can Ever Imagine,2016-02-10,5.0,Sales Director,"Incredible work environment with happy, friendly, and smart people. People are at DocuSign for the long-haul, and everyone here knows that we are at the beginning of something very special. Because of that, building long-lasting relationships with incredible people is easy and happens fast. 

Beyond that, the company hires smart, motivated, big-thinkers, so processes are constantly improving and results growing. The VPs are accessible for feedback and coaching, and they make changes as a result of that feedback. The infrastructure for growth is in place and now we all get to experience the rocket ship taking off. 

Lastly, the product is changing the world. A lot of companies claim that their product is a gamechanger, but DocuSign is truly changing a process that hasn't evolved more than a ballpoint pen for over a millennium. As part of sales, I love how easy and translatable the value proposition is to everyone with whom you speak. Whether you are explaining the company to one of your grandparents or speaking with a C-suite prospect, everyone knows that the world is only becoming more digital, and DocuSign is the way most people will get there.","If only the Seattle office had avocados in the breakroom like the SF office does, this company would be perfect. Guacamole every day!"
1792,DocuSign,Time to jump onboard!!,2016-02-10,5.0,Sales AE,"New leadership is pathing the way to new growth heights! More sales (internal) support, better marketing initiatives, more events. etc. If you are a sales person looking to blow out your number, my advice is to jump onboard now!",Some pieces of operations are still ramping up to support the growth pace.
1793,DocuSign,Unbelievable company and Fantastic Product!! DocuSign EMEA.,2016-02-09,5.0,Sales,"Experienced management team running the show in EMEA that are dedicated to the company s and employees success, combined with a team of peers that are super friendly, motivated and dedicated.  Fantastic product to sell that really helps companies and touches ever industry. Perks and training are excellent, the opportunity that is in front of this company is extremely exciting. Super happy to be along for the ride.","This is not a con for me but others may think different. DocuSign is a hyper growth company and growing at this speed is not for everyone, be prepared to roll up our sleeves if you are lucky enough to be offered a position."

1799,DocuSign,5 stars,2016-01-17,5.0,,"Great people to work with. Nice mix of talented experienced people who will take some time out of their day to help you out. Requires a drive to be a self-starter, don't just look and point out bottlenecks. Have the balls to fix them yourself. Find your responsibilities within the bigger picture and own them, no matter how junior you are. The company provides the tools to succeed, go out yourself to make it happen. Failing is allowed, not trying is frowned upon of course. 

Amazing platform. Great future prospects. Good benefits.","Can be a bit chaotic, with a rapid expanding office and ever increasing responsibilities.

Not very well known in continental Europe, a general awareness campaign would be helpful. mostly from a legal stand-point.   

No relocation package offered. (at this point of expansion is expected though)"
1800,DocuSign,Docusign - Growing fast and feeling the growing pains,2016-01-15,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Docusign is a fast growing company, and they will very likely become a multi-national powerhouse despite all the problems engineering has. They have a good work life balance. Even this late in the companies growth cycle, stock options are likely to be fairly valuable.","Despite the pros, DocuSign is a terrible place to work, with  very little management involvement until something goes wrong. Parts of engineering are allowed to be abusive and offensive simply because they deliver quality work, and 'brogrammers' are everywhere. Office politics is present, and there is a very real 'old boys network' in place. If you want to succeed, you better hitch your boat to one of the established cliques, and be very careful how you tread. Upper management is sometimes completely clueless about what is actually going on at an operational level. (Or perhaps they have a little of the 'Steve Jobs reality distortion field' in effect, it can be hard to tell the difference)

Ultimately, stay away from Docusign, because your career there will be like a trip through a mine field: You wont know if you made a misstep until its too late."
1801,DocuSign,Starting a career in Sales,2016-01-15,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"I am convinced that in the Sales Development Rep role in Docusign, I am getting far more responsibility and exposure than I would be receiving in another company for the same role.

Typically, the scope of this role is tightly defined and restricted, giving limited exposure and learning opportunities. In Docusign however, I am regularly dealing with companies and stakeholders of all sizes, and given a real opportunity to learn and carve out my own role in the organisation

Everyone has been so supportive, and happy to share their knowledge, allowing me to better understand how each role ties into the other roles in the organisation, and how I can contribute.

So far I have been receiving direct recognition for the work I have been doing, and people are genuinely interested in our development

So far I've been flown out to Seattle twice and also brought over to London - this demonstrates the company's commitment to getting everyone involved in the culture and development of the organisation 

Every other day we have different members of the larger executive team passing by the Dublin office to share their wisdom and get to know the new people joining the organisation. It's a great opportunity to rub shoulders with the VPs and C-level staff, which is very rare for most global companies","The sweets and chocolate are too tempting - I'm getting fat : (
All the free beer on Friday isn't helping with that either"
1802,DocuSign,Brilliant future-oriented company with great people,2016-01-15,5.0,Account Executive,"If you love to build something up - countries, markets, new business - you'll really love it here.

With freedom comes responsibility.",For people with the character settings mentioned above - none.
1803,DocuSign,Big aspirations...lack luster execution,2016-01-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Easily the best product I've sold with some of the brightest people making it happen from a product perspective. Some decent perks and not a ton of red tape you see at other larger organizations. Still pre-IPO and equity is still pretty generous.,Pay and benefits aren't competitive. Almost zero process followed by lack of communication across different departments make it feel the right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. The sales organization is cut-throat..you either produce or you're gone. And don't expect anyone to help you as there is a lack of good training and mentoring. And the company direction is misguided as all the money goes to sales instead of infrastructure and support. Product isn't able to keep up demand as a result of very little investment to create new SKUs.
1804,DocuSign,"Employee, Dublin",2015-12-15,5.0,Employee,"- Product: life changing product that streamlines everyone's workflow in everu business
- People: Genuine leaders with great experience, great peers who are full of energy and ideas
- Personal Touch: constant contact throughout recruitment process with updates and important information

There are some great people in the organization who are very talented. The technical team is very strong.,"Way too top heavy and turn over is very high for a company with this much promise.  They haven't been able to crack the enterprise sales model which has resulted in a revolving door of enterprise sales leadership and go to market approaches.  Only a few reps make their number and everyone else is sucking wind.  Product, while really good, has not evolved too much.  A lot of the best people have left already."

The company is solving a problem that makes people's lives easier.  Culture is fun, yet professional.  Business and technical problems are extremely interesting and intellectually challenging.","The company is growing exceptionally fast, and processes and priorities change rapidly to accommodate that growth."
1814,DocuSign,Account Executive,2015-10-16,4.0,Account Executive,Great people and culture. Everyone has a works hard and play hard attitude. Commission structure is competitive nice you get into kickers.,Base salary is low. Commission are paid quarterly rather than monthly. Expected to work 10 or more hours at the end of each quarter.
1815,DocuSign,Concern,2015-10-08,1.0,Support Staff,Marketing machine has done well but is running out of gas.,Company has never made a profit - a startup who missed their chance and the technology has become available from other vendors everywhere.  Meantime top-heavy executives have multi-million expense accounts while employees barely make a marketable wage. Uncomfortable internal sexual relationship by executive with employee continues to exist as marriages and friendships were ruined.
1816,DocuSign,Growing Fast!,2015-10-07,4.0,Product Development Manager,"This is a company with huge opportunity in the marketplace and exponential growth.  There's plenty of opportunity to take on new roles and grow your skills as the company scales and has a larger global footprint. Hang on for the ride!

Other - great office location, amenities and good people",The enormous opportunities without adequate resources results in lack of clear direction.  The politics and constant pivoting to maximize the few people who are available to execute can be frustrating at times.  This is all part of growing pains and the balance of keeping our numbers looking good for an IPO and hopefully will be sorted out in the next year.
1817,DocuSign,Fantastic place to work,2015-10-03,5.0,Software Engineering,"I love working at DocuSign - the company has been growing fast and there's always new and interesting engineering projects!     The technical team is filled with exceptionally smart people who are scaling a high volume system really quickly - it's just never boring.   From what I've seen, people who are passionate about tech, no BS and love to ship do great here...those big talker, time waster types don't last long.","Sometimes a few too many projects happening at once, but i think that's pretty normal for a fast growing company..."
1818,DocuSign,"A promising product, but incompetent, top-heavy leadership and office politics ruin it",2015-10-01,1.0,Engineer,Smart people on the ground. A nice view from the office. Reasonably good life balance for some. A decent stop along the way if you're not looking for career growth.,"I would not recommend DocuSign for anyone not already friendly with the leadership (Director or above), unless you are ready to play some very cutthroat office politics to get into that position. Delivering value for the company and making awesome contributions are straight up not valued (or, often, even noticed) here. The company currently has far too many Director. C-level and VP employees soaking up all the credit and rewards, but either contributing very little or (in many cases) negative value to the company. You will be fed some line about loading up the top of the company so it can be built downwards, but none of that has happened in the last 2+ years. The people on the ground actually creating value are kept down (with below-market compensation and benefits) so friends can be brought in to reap the rewards at the top.

If you can navigate a treacherous political landscape to get yourself into the buddy circle, or are there already, Docusign is great. But if you want to do actual work and be valued for it, look somewhere else. If you do decide to come in (the business outlook would stay positive for the near future regardless of what the leadership does due to the market position and lack of serious competition), make sure at least 50% of your time and effort is spent playing politics. Any time spent on other work will be wasted otherwise."

Oddly, Keith Krach seems unable to fire executives.  He merely moves them into new C-level spots that they appear to create on a whim.  This has shifted the culture in a negative direction, and it now feels more big-company.  That was not what I wanted when I joined, and made it easy to leave for another company this year."

1824,DocuSign,Hold on Tight...,2015-09-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"DocuSign is a company that is changing the way people work. Many tech companies define themselves as disruptive, but few are. DocuSign is one of the few.

Change is a constant. Self motivation, focus and responsibility are rewarded, but to be clear, success here will be determined by an individual's ability to make success happen for themselves. 

Though DocuSign as a whole is moving towards becoming a large organisation, the EMEA and APAC markets represent huge opportunities for those who want to take ownership of their role and build a business.

The commitment to social impact programmes, allowing team members to engage in charitable work on company time is very welcome.","It's a bumpy ride. Any fast-growing company experiences pain, and as the company develops, employees may not have the support structures they're used to or feel that they need. It really is a question of sink or swim.

This isn't the place for individuals needing close management or supervision.

The work life balance can suffer occasionally, but this is par for the course in any organisation that is defining and building a market."
1825,DocuSign,Unrealistic Quotas,2015-09-14,2.0,Sales Executive,Great product and the leader in the market.,"Expect not to make quota.  DocuSign pays under market value for sales roles and unless you get that one big ""whale"" of a sale every year, you will be living mostly off of your base salary.

There is focus in many of the right places in terms of how we extend our products globally. Teams have positive attitudes and peers are collaborative.","Leadership is far too VP, SVP, and C-title heavy.

Many full time employees have been here for a few years and have yet to be promoted. Other contractors who work hard and would like to become a full time employee are not offered the position or opportunity because of a ""lack of budget"" in their particular department."

Perfect location in Downtown Seattle, steps from the market, SAM and other city highlights.","So many to list, but I'll stick to the ones that are most relevant to Salespeople, I have many friends and acquaintances in the field and would not recommend DocuSign to any of them because:

Base salaries are comically low and non-negotiable, if you are a good sales person with a solid track record you will be taking a pay cut of seriously undervaluing your skills.

Quotas are (seemingly) made-up and not based on either actual market projects or past performance.  They are also exceedingly unrealistic in most departments but also wildly inconsistent, in terms of ability to exceed quota and resources available, from team to team. Don't bet on making up your lost salary with commissions, it's highly unlikely at DocuSign.

Management/Leadership: Lots of managers, very few quality leaders or managers that even display competent leadership qualities.  

Sr. Leaderships: Keith Krach is an inspirational guy and, from what I've seen, has done great things for the company, he will likely continue to do so as the business grows globally.  Beneath him are a multitude of C-level exec's, SVP's and VP's, many of whom have dubious roles and are, seemingly, redundant.  They are weighing down the company and creating a bureaucratic mess."

Product is prolific and can be introduced to lots of buyer personas in a prospect account.","I did a lot of due diligence before going to DocuSign, but I was not given access to a variety of sales people to ask about deal size. In the interview process they gave me 2 ""poster children"" who'd earned a ton of money in sales.  But like kings and peasants, a small few were making any money and EVERYONE else starved. When I first arrived I was shocked by how little my installed customers were paying us. I was concerned about hitting quota, let alone surpassing it.  It was important to me that I surpass quota b/c the DocuSign comp plan (OTE) is below market. For the first 6 months I kept wondering how we sold bigger deals. But they were all very small and tactical.  I set out to ask a smattering of other Account Executives how they were doing, and the 10 other people I spoke to that had been there for a while confirmed my fears. While some did indeed close a large deal for the year, it still barely put them at quota and the OTE was sub-market. People who had been there for 3 years were still not doing well compared to how they had done in the past. I gave it my best effort to see if I could overcome the small deal size by increasing volume. And although the deal volume was there I was working on transactions that were smaller than I did in my twenties. I don't recommend this job to anyone in Enterprise sales who is looking to sustain their earnings track record. There is a new SVP of Sales who knows what he's doing, however, I would give it a full year of him fixing things before even entertaining a sales job there. I'd be concerned that if he was not successful he may not stay either. The root of the problem is the DocuSign although the best product in this class, is a point solution that is not considered to solve a broad series of business processes, and it's just hard to yield the kind of deal size that true enterprise applications can."

I was not disappointed to find that the company is full of like-minded people.  

There's really no need to point out that people are sharp - every self respecting SV/SF/Seattle/hot-bed-of-technology tech darling is full of sharp people - but it's the hunger and excitement people exude because they know we're on the brink of doing something truly transformative.  Cliches like 'changing the game' and 'transformative' was common among recruiting pitches I heard during last job hunt, and I'm sure some companies do mean it, but I'm satisfied with how DocuSign walks the walk.","Some would rate lower stars because of the lack of structure, and it is a challenge, but anyone that did their homework knows DocuSign is going through hyper growth and a lot of process and structure is being defined as a work in progress.  I'd like to think the company makes up for this by hiring very individually strong people.  At the mid level (Senior Manager/Directors/Sr. Directors), I see a lot of peers who has been here done that and can adapt fast to changing priorities that is somewhat expected at this pace.

The work-life balance and hours isn't great almost by definition of being a tech start-up.  But again, to expect otherwise would be odd.  Besides, people that track stock options in secondary markets knows the work is worth it."

1884,DocuSign,"Great technology, awful sales org",2014-09-03,2.0,Sales,"The product is amazing and the people, sans management, are great.","I can only speak for the sales department but within that group, the company failed miserably. In less than a year on the job, I had 3 management changes, 2 changes in vertical and 4 changes to my geo. Top that off with an INCREASE in quota and you have an extremely disgruntled worker. While the rest of the company seems to coast by with a good product and competent management (albeit grossly underpaid), the sales department is as dysfunctional as they come. 

Don't take my word on it - do a bit of digging yourself and it's plain to see that there are the old guards (4+ years there) and then there's the new (>2 years). Reason? The ""senior"" sales guys have literally plucked all the business into their funnels and have sat themselves in verticals that pay extremely well. Health care, finance, insurance - all of those reps kill it. Leads pour in, marketing dollars get spent, the entire staff there is jubilant. The rest? Well, if you've started in the last 2 years, the likelihood is that you'll get shoved into a geo and fail miserably. 

But let's ignore the fact that you're set up to fail as a geo rep. Let's couple that with a micro management strategy to top all micro management strategies. It's seems as though every sales manager in the company has been trained to treat their team the same exact way: dissect and grill each and every deal you don't close. I had 2 managers there - one which was socially a terrible fit and the other who initially started off as a very nice guy. Even the nice guy manager was molded into the slacks-wearing, button down frat boy that is seen only on Wall St, minus the 6-figure salary. Had enough? Not so fast. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that regardless of moving to a hourly compensation model, you are still ""required"" to be in before 7 and out no earlier than 4.

It's honestly extremely difficult to get beyond the first year at this place, at least in sales. You get paid a measly base salary, won't make any commissions worth noting until year 2 (at the earliest) and by that time, you're so burnt out at the lack of work/life balance that your personal life will suffer. While there are some great people that work there, the majority of people I know have either moved departments (if you can imagine taking a salary cut), or left before their year is done. Not that it means anything but they like to keep you there with the notion of this big payout WHEN the company goes public. We all know that this is no guarantee and in full disclosure, they've been ""planning"" this massive IPO for 2+ years now. The idea that people are agonizing at their job over the slim likelihood that their stock options will make them millionaires is sad and quite frankly false hope.

Also, the pay could be a lot more competitive."
1890,DocuSign,Hyper Growth is a unique opportunity,2014-05-27,5.0,Sales Leadership,Team is working together to build a company to last.  Customers love what we do and it feels great to assist them in changing their businesses.  Very exciting to be part of the team now as we continue to grow our organization with some of the best talent in the world,The company is growing fast and it wasn't that long ago we were a small company.  We are still developing the processes we need to scale the company while we ensure our customers are being successful.  The work-life balance is a challenge - but as we grow it seems less taxing
1891,DocuSign,Great entry level sales training,2014-05-27,4.0,Market Development Representative,"- Fantastic quality of entry level sales training
- excellent location/office space
- work with motivated, intelligent, friendly people
- DocuSign is a HOT company to work for so it's great on a resume when it's time to move on","- relatively low pay
- relatively slow promotion timeline for entry level position"
1892,DocuSign,"Super awesome people, great product, a few rough edges",2014-05-22,5.0,Product Development,"DocuSign has done well to hire lots of smart, passionate people. There are zero ROJs (""retired on the job"") and a general desire to collaborate, share, and grow together. Sure, the company doesn't always know the best way to do that but they care enough to want to figure it out. 

Plus, you get to contribute to a pretty interesting product with an enormous road ahead of it.",A little bit too much bureaucracy for a company of this size and stage. A little more sharing of vision past the near term would help the folks on the ground understand where we're going.
1893,DocuSign,"Disorganized, and dishonest",2014-05-15,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The technology stacks and problem space are very enjoyable.  The work hours are good, though that is often due to the lack of passion in the engineering department.  Many engineers are very very smart, though their hard work and input is rarely recognized.","The whole organization is top heavy.  Despite having around 650 salaried workers (a few more contractors and temps), there are over 40 VPs and over 100 Senior managers or Directors.  This doesn't stop DocuSign from continuing to hire an additional VP every month, though, at the cost of withholding compensation from any employee under director level. 
It seems like the shift towards an IPO plan has really been a move to get all of the current executives friends in on the cheap-stock-option action before the official public offering - Just another way for rich friends to get richer.

Promotions within the company are avoided (by regular employees) at all cost, as they come with 0% compensation change, a shiny new title, and a 300% increase in workload.  That's it.  No additional influence in architecture or product decisions, no added stock options.  Just another move to see how much can be piled on an engineer before they burn out.

The employees who work the hardest and the ones who do just enough not to get fired are recognized as equals from the eyes of the executives, with hard work often being rewarded with nothing other than MORE hard work.

There are a lot of managers and directors who try to do right by their engineers, but they are completely powerless against the growing executive boys club."
1894,DocuSign,Senior Software Engineer,2014-05-06,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"very fun culture. work environment is lay back. work-life balance is good. compensation is alright, i'd expect either a little more considering this space is very competitive right now.","compensation can be improved to stay competitive or the company will lose the competitiveness on hiring talent people and lose existing talent engineers.

1896,DocuSign,Worst company I have ever worked for,2014-03-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There are honestly some good people who work here and they make it worth it.,"Read the early reviews, they are true.  I feel like the most recent and current reviews are written by the HR department.  This company only cares about themselves and not the employees that work for it.  The people who care will be jaded fast.  Every two days you will see a new VP email of the usual demographic and never of any diversity or a woman.  It is a 650+ company that is ran like a 10 person start up.  No room for growth, hard to move around within the company...all about politics."

I'd recommend DocuSign to a friend, but not if they are applying for a sales role.","I agree with the review from another Corporate Account Executive on Dec 6, 2013 - the sales quotas are very unreasonable (talented sales reps are only getting 60% to quota), it's a very bad comp plan, and nobody making any money except for the lucky few who sell to Banks and Credit Unions and to Wealth Management. You are told you will make $60,000 in base (which you do) and $60 in commission, but in reality, you will make 1/3 of that commission. And from what I can tell, despite the majority of reps (and there are many talented Account Executives) not hitting quota, it won't be lowered anytime soon."
1902,DocuSign,"Lots of wasted talent, and lots of over rated talent, lot of infighting and politics, adds up to lots of dysfunction",2013-12-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,eSignature is a great viral market,"Those who have been in the trenches for years at DocuSign are left behind with every new VP hire. Honesty is a bad word. When it came time to pay or to admit mistakes, it became time to present a new comp plan, or shown the door. The sales management of the company is poor at best, the old line sales team and a few new commers are keeping the place going."
1903,DocuSign,Not bad,2013-12-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The compensation is good. Most of the people I worked with are great. The office has a good environment, provides plenty of snacks and drinks with a nice view of the bay bridge.",There was no work/life balance for me personally. It's what you can expect from a startup. I usually work till 11pm before I had to leave to catch my ride home. The company had suck the life out of me.

DocuSign has More VPs than a Banana Republic,2013-12-15,1.0,,Great coworkers and technology in a fun space.,"Glassdoor has jumped the skark, naming this a best company to work. CEO is killing company with his hubris. He keeps hiring VPs, count is over 60. For a company this size? Nobody knows what the VPs do, everyone thinks its a big, sad joke. 

All VP hires are men, by the way. Dude does not have a clue, think he's the Master of the Universe. His VPs keep him from reality, not one has any balls. Employees are underpaid and overworked. Entire dept quit together last month. Never seen that before. And so have many long time employees and top sales performers. 

Never worked at a place where everyone is so miserable, waiting for their exit. This is not how the company was a few years ago. CEO is trying to blend old school management at say GE, IBM, with Valley culture, and copying only the worst aspects of each one. He expects employees to work around the clock like other startups. But without a stake in the company or the benefits and perks that are standard here in the Valley.

Too stupid to realize that happy employees make great companies. Too much misery can take a company down, however great your technology."

The product is very hot but the company is very poorly managed and poorly run. They are way overstaffed in marketing especially when they outsource so much. Product development is wasting its time on connectors that are pretty useless (Sugar, MS CRM, etc). If you join this company as an Account Executive, you're making a big mistake. 70% of the AEs are not making their numbers. The only ones that are in the financial services vertical and those ""guys"" have been protected for years. Look on the salaries tab on glassdoor...I assure it's very accurate. Seattle and San Francisco are not cheap cities and making that in a market where other companies will pay you much better seems stupid to go here. I was sold on how much money I was going to make a DocuSign and now realize it was a lie. 

Sales Management is immature and inexperienced. Everyone in Marketing is either a Director or a Manager and most of them have no direct reports.

 DocuSign is a hot company and is growing fast. The company invests in the sales team with trainings, weekly webinars, speakers and other resources. Sales personnel get to travel all over the country, on the company dime, to attend the elite conferences. DocuSign also rewards success handsomely with exotic trips and expensive SPIFFs.

They are very controlling and management does not work together well.   There are too many chiefs and not enough indians in the company.   Most employees are dissatisfied with their management.  Although, the employees do get along well with each other."

Not a culture that most people would thrive in for very long."
