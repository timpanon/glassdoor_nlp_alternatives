490,Estée Lauder Companies,TERRIBLE! Please do not work for these people,2021-07-12,1.0,Customer Advisor,"There are definitely not many pros. If you could upsell some of the online products you could maybe get a congratulations from the management, and sometimes based on your performance you could receive a free gift.","God I don't even know where to begin. First of all, the management will micromanage you to an extent of exhaustion. You get constantly guilt tripped about your performance. The management literally does not care if you're having a bad day or some personal issues. They will push you to burnout.
An example, was a colleague who had a dying mother in the hospital and she asked for a day or two off, but she was not allowed because her duty was to take calls and emails.

The salaries are terrible.
They constantly talk about their work-life balance and how it is a great place to work is you for example have disability or a family with children. 

This is simply not true. 
To conclude, if you ever get a job offer from this place, please for the sake of your mental health reject the offer."

- The company prioritizes leadership / executives, instead of cultivating young talent
- Teams are overburdened since open positions never seem to be back-filled, before you know it you will be working two jobs
- The job description rarely matches up with the day to day expectations and what you will ultimately be doing in the role

Estée Lauder Companies expect you to wear a face full of makeup but aren’t prepared to give you an allocation to aid fulfilling this expectation. They do offer a discount for products under the Estée Lauder Companies umbrella which is a perk...but the staff website requires you to pay upfront and doesn’t deliver the items for upto 6 weeks!

As someone who suffers with mental illness, when I reached out for “help”, instead of receiving the help I had asked for many times, I instead was told that I was not fit for work anymore. Absolutely disgusting way to treat someone.

The company enforce how it’s a “great place to work” but I do not believe this to be the case.

I worked for the company for just over a year, in that time I had 3 different area managers, the last being the worst. The high street is on a decline but yet expectations are increasing. Targets are so unrealistic, and of course if you can’t hit them, then you’re area manager breathes down your neck and expects a minute by minute account of what your doing. You are expected to traffic stop constantly, connect with local businesses all the time to drive business to the counter. You have a target of how many customers must purchase from you an hour, etc etc, the list goes on. If you’re a one person counter this is interesting! There is no work life balance, you are expected to work every weekend unless you take it as holiday or declare a commitment at interview - like you need one weekend off a month for a specific reason. 
Unless you are a top 5 store for your area you will never be able to get hold of your area manager if you need help with anything, even if you suffer a bereavement! The lack of communication in all aspects is atrocious really. The wages are shocking, as many others have said, they are not competitive, and for such a huge company this is unacceptable. You are expected to do a lot outside of work as well- independent training online and weekly paperwork, which is fine, but you are not paid enough to reflect these expectations.

There is also a race issue here in which people of colour are mistreated and saw it happen until it was finally my turn to go. Nothing is based on performance only favouritism by management who are grossly unqualified to run any team. And speaking to higher ups or even HR doesn’t do anything. The environment will never change as the people in power will shut it down. There has been such a high turn over rate and even if you get stuck, someone has to die, get fired, or get pregnant for you to move up in a position, let alone if you are considered. They may just hire temps instead to avoid paying for full salary and benefits like they always do. For such a small office I’ve never experienced such a toxic environment in my entire life."

Dont expect to get promoted through hard work. Unless you are willing to flatter the right people, you will be stuck in one position for years to come (or you quit). The manadgement is full with people who are in fact incapable of doing a great job but still they are the ‘big guys’ and they expect everyone to treat them with respect and they expect too much compared to what help they provide in return (nothing let me say, they have absolutely no clue of the processes, they just there to boss around). They look through you, dont really care about their employees, only care about the products they can buy with their discount and their status in the company hierarchy. Also they will make you work 12hour shifts during the Black Friday period with almost no compensation. And in any case, you are not compensated rightly at all. ‘Most important asset of the company’? HaHa what a joke. No home office opportunity as they wanna keep a close eye on everyone like you are children incapable of working alone. Basically it is a toxic environment. Our manager for instance abuses the team emotionally. Should you question anything she says or does, you will get punished and you’ll regret that you have raised your voice at all.  They give us tasks that should not even be our task to do and rush us to finish them. Like we work in 5 different positions but only get the salary for 1. There is absolutely no company culture either, the company does not spend a penny on their employees, no team building events whatsoever. A christmas party per year at most. And the environment? Currently we are in a small office building that we share with multiple companies, there is 1 cleaning lady for 10 floors, not only does the kitchen, but also the toilet stink throughout the whole time and we have to clean during our 10min breaks/hour just to make the environment a little more bearable.

- Travel Retail - nice and friendly team, most importantly they are rich due to excellent sales. Great leaders in the team too. Money is king, it speaks louder than words. When you are rich, you can do anything and everything which makes you grow richer.
- Regional Supply Chain - experienced, professional and good culture in the team. Among the few companies I was in, SIOP process is among the strongest in ELC supply chain where the regional Asia office is located.","- Affiliate team in comparison is weaker and it really depend which brand you join
- Lack of strong leaders (in both affiliate and regional brands), as a result, most middle and lower tier employees need to work extremely long hours yet fail to deliver desired results. most people work hard but not working smart. 
- lack of a really strong regional brand team (only 1 or 2 brands are better) who is able to manage and treat all markets fairly. Most regional brand only manage 1 market and somewhat sacrifice the rest.

Summer Fridays.,"A toxic working environment, where one risks getting fired just for voicing her/his opinion. The management structure is entrenched from what it looks like older days of Estee. It is full with ego driven individuals with contempt for anyone challenging their views. I guess this depends on the team, but this negative corporate culture seems to be pervasive in the company. I've witnessed many senseless firings of intelligent people for voicing their opinions. Needless to say such manifestations of power kill the moral among employees. Another glaring issue is lack of diversity in management and they tend to hire clones of themselves resulting in a cliquey sorority club. If you are not part of such groups you are treated as an outcast without a voice., and expected to blindly follow their directives. One outcome of such an approach is the effect on the quality of the work. The deep pockets of Estee allows mediocre individuals with influence among the management to impose their (lack of) vision, which translates in lots of inefficiencies and wasted money and opportunities. Estee Lauder Companies is probably good to start one's career but not a place for experienced and ambitious individuals. Or it would probably be better to work within one of their many brands rather than the corporate entity.  It even seems that leadership in the brands and across the affiliates are frustrated with how badly things are run from the Corporate Entity."

I had to teach myself a lot (which I didn't mind, it was mainly learning the product) but as a makeup artist I felt like I was strictly hired to give free and timely makeovers to customers who never bought anything.

I refused to believe them and thought I was different and I'd make it work. I am proud to say I didn't and that they were all correct. 

If you're in a position lower on the totem pole, you are thrown, better yet, hurled, under the bus in any instance that would perhaps damage any relationship with the brand. 

Everyone was out for themselves and their ""buddies"". Of course they all pretended to love you to your face, but speak terrible things behind your back and take great pride. Black balling those who aren't in their click. 

Unprofessional, dishonest and not qualified, my boss was a nightmare. She is extremely good at manipulating, finding talent, stealing their ideas and then letting them go.  Her ability to brownnose and manipulate higher ups does deserve recognition and an award in itself. 

It was like working in a ""grown-up"" sorority and if you didn't play their games, you're out. Turnover is insane and the reputation is even worse. The executives farm from other ""sister"" failing brands which explains why the business for ELC is what it is."

There is little to no constructive feedback on performance until you are looking to move to another role. EL is working to strengthen their Performance and Development Process, The PDP is only 3 years old, thus, much of development depends on who likes you, with little emphasis on results or how the results were delivered.

It seems like you are in constant fire drill mode with no end. While most of the employees are nice and mean well, they don't know where to do and therefore are often frustrated with human resources. The transformation efforts that launched in 2015 seems to not be working and it seems like it was planned based on numbers and not the reality of the high touch business.  While there is a lot of talk about strategy, the execution is lacking providing a constant sense of discontent amongst employees.

1843,Estée Lauder Companies,Upper Management... Enough Said.,2016-10-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work/Life Balance
-The work demands are about as much as you are willing to give it.  As long as you don't take on more responsibilities than you want to, you can enjoy a comfortable career doing as little or as much as you want.  

Culture & Values
-The employees are overwhelmingly great to work with.  Some employees even give 150%, meaning that they work unpaid overtime to get things done.","Career Opportunities
-You must either play the political game or get brought in from the outside to get ahead.  And by the political game, I mean that the company plays this absurd game of hot potato where when projects fail, someone high up in management will be blamed for it.  Those actually responsible will pass the hot potato to whomever is most willing to take initiative, and then blame them when the project collapses.  The best people increasingly get fired, the most insidious (and often most inept) employees get promoted, and the cycle repeats with increasing frequency.  Usually this happens via a sponsor from senior management, meaning that employees that don't know what they are doing are promoted to high positions and are kept there as long as they do what they are told from their sponsor.  

Compensation & Benefits
-Unless you get ahead, your compensation will stagnate.  Moreover, compensation is often 10K-20K less than the competition.  Benefits are good and reasonable, but I'd advise against the vision plan.  

Culture & Values
-Take the values they post publicly and flip them around completely.  It is nothing on the inside as it is on the outside.  They talk of uncompromising respect for the individual, ethics and integrity, but they don't do any of that.  Human Resources is a gestapo.  Those surveys they ask you to fill out?  Don't even think about being honest with them.  They will track you down and fire you or worse.  Same with the Employee Assistance Program.  HR is the reason why you will find enough problems for a book but absolutely zero employees known for raising concerns, as well as stories of employees that disappear.  As far as ethics and integrity go, it is as if those two ideas are a nuisance to be stomped out, rather than celebrated.  

Work/Life Balance
-For those that are actively engaged at their jobs, this place is a nightmare.  For example, one of my main projects relied upon one person doing a few simple things for me, but he wouldn't answer any of my emails for weeks.  Sometimes, he simply failed to do what I asked because he was completely unqualified for his job and wouldn't move over to let me handle things.  If you let yourself take on too much, the company will expect that plus 20% of you next time.  

Senior Management
-Upper management will never figure out the cause of the problems at this company, because upper management is the problem.  This group of individuals is eerily reminiscent of feudal medieval city states rather than heads of departments.  When problems come up, they cannibalize each other and put their own interests ahead of the company's in a climate of intense political intrigue.  

No job security
-When things go bad, usually meaning that things aren't as good as predicted, there are massive, public layoffs.  HR will even tell you outright that if you don't like it, you can leave.  

Tech Infrastructure
-GIS.  Avoid them.  The technical infrastructure they 'maintain' either doesn't exist or is two decades old and crumbling."

They are looking for what is wrong in order to yell and scream at people. This must make them feel powerful. They create a culture of people that are told what to do and cannot have an opinion of their own. Because they are so connected to the family they get away with this behavior. The biggest bully is impressively smart but his treatment of people is horrible. He also gets stuck on stupid issues and loses focus of the big picture. The lady bully is not even smart. She makes decisions without thinking them through and is fiscally irresponsible. The other lady does not make any decisions and the International guy never speaks so hard to know if he is any good. The R&D guy is a politician. Which is the best way to survive in this company. Just telling everyone what they want to hear. So if you are someone with great capabilities and a point of view, I would stay away from this place."

1928,Estée Lauder Companies,Dead Weight,2016-06-02,3.0,Business Person,"There are no rules.  Senior managers are either so self-absorbed or distracted by the maneuverings of their peers, that if you’re even slightly savvy at writing annual goals, you can essentially do what you want around here.  Therefore, if you have a particular interest within your field, there’s usually an artful way of emphasizing activities related to that interest as part of your reward structure.
Benefits are quite good, including gratis, summer Fridays, bonus, equity, etc.  But base pay tends to be all over the spectrum.  There are junior people who have (significantly) higher salaries than more senior people, even within the same work groups.  This is often the result of pay curves for long-time employees being rather stunted compared to outsiders who are frequently offered higher salaries in order to recruit them. 
Also, if you are an outsider with consulting experience and Ivy League pedigree, this place will be your playground.  People will assume you’re full of rainbows and brilliance.  And if you have mastery of PowerPoint, you’re well on your way to the C-suite.
Overall, the people here are pleasant to work with.  Problems with personalities usually only arise in the context of defining turf, hoarding credit for successes, and deflecting blame – so it’s typical stuff.  But most folks are fine over drinks.
This is the kind of job where you can set fairly simple goals to achieve an average rating year-on-year and bide your time towards retirement.","This is not a great place to learn.  There are rare gems within the organization that have particular areas of expertise.  But if you’re looking for a challenging career where you’ll have a manager who can really develop you, this ain’t that gig.  Most managers don’t know much about management, and there are few tools available to help them to improve.  And even if a manager has strong managerial skills, the organization is so dysfunctional that such skills are not of much value.  
For example, if a manager in a particular brand or function creates a process improvement, there is no infrastructure to institutionalize the process improvement.  Every manager operates within his or her domain independently.  Incentives across groups appear to entirely diverge.  And junior employees frequently report to managers who don’t understand the jobs of their subordinates.  While this does enable relative freedom and autonomy on the part of the junior person, it corrupts the rewards system and eliminates opportunities to learn and grow.
As a company, we create strategy documents with painstaking time and effort.  But after they are presented, they simply go in a drawer and are occasionally mentioned in passing throughout the year.  Furthermore, we call the documents “strategies”, but they’re not.  If you pointed your finger at random at any employee, and asked them what the top 3 priorities are for the company or department, they would either freeze or spit out a slew of inactionable corporate jargon.  We simply don’t know what we’re doing."

Career pathing has also become less of a focus in recent years, most of the management team has become much more honed in on delivering financial results. If you want to move ahead, it is also about who you know. Most hiring managers have candidates in mind for roles coming up way ahead of general knowledge and often times won't even consider other internal applicants, nevermind external candidates. If you are the few who are capable, but do not always know the right people or potential positions which may be opening up, the mobility process within the company can be frustrating to navigate - it is complicated, demotivating, and the process can be dragged out for a long time.

That generally applied to treatment only. They gave very nice gifts and plenty of training and books to expand my knowledge to the extent I wanted in order to be a successful sales associate for the company. I have worked for several other lines and have found Estee Lauder to be more generous than other cosmetic companies. I love all Estee Lauder products and have wore her fragrances even when in Jr high school. The company also gave me the opportunity to understand the ability of products with my gratus and new promational items that were given to me as they came out and they were free. I loved the idea of wearing only her line and why not its all wonderful when working at her counter and only her fragrances as well. The company is very professional. I loved every minute of my experience while a counter manager. Just wish I could find a job in management in a store anywhere with all my experience that I have but not a chance in that happening. Believe me I have tried.","If there was ever a problem with the amount of money you were receiving most of the time Estee Lauder always paid us directly as far as I knew and it had nothing to do with the store I was in that had any say so over that.
Hoeever, if that was a problem then I would say that you need to discuss this with HR department of the store your working for and they are the ones who are doing that to you. Estee Lauder is not a cheap woman by no means. She treats her beauty advisors and all that work for her with respect and pays them a salary that would allow them to live and look accordingly to her standards. Now, maybe you already fit that standard well that says alot for the under paid and over worked and have to have a sperate wardrobe for work while your pay does not compensate this. Most other companies do not supply uniforms for you as Estee Lauder certainly does. When you have as many years experience as I do and you apply and apply for work and you never seem to get hired and you dont know why well it has to do with the store your applying to and its all about money and what that will or not willing to pay you. And if they think you have an increadiable amount of high end experience as I do then they will make up some lame excuse why they dont hire you to make you feel bad. Dont buy into this trap of theirs. Its not true. Unfortuneately you have to move into the cities that pay more to make more and there they will treat you as someone with experience. Bottom line...Its all about the area in which you are applying and the manager of the store that your applying at. so very true. The truth is out know go girls and be happy and dont settle if you do one time you will always firnd yourself settling... Dont start is the key..."

Chances are you're reading this in search of insight into the culture, values and overall impressions you can glean about a company.  Smart one, keep reading.
Consider asking yourself the questions below:

- Am I looking for opportunities to grow as I continue to learn and demonstrate my skills, experience and aptitude?
If you are, the optimistic answer is ""it depends"".  The realistic answer is the odds are quite stacked against you if you are looking for fast paced professional growth.  While opportunities exist, see other glassdoor reviews that indicate a heavy majority of talented individuals who experienced this.

- Do I pride myself on being moral, respectful and honest?
Of course you are.  How do you feel about standing out?

- Am I highly motivated and capable of delivering results without micromanagement?
Congrats.  You would be fabulous anywhere, just not here.

- Do I want to retire in the next 10-15 yrs?
Excellent, this is one of the big pluses.  While no one can guarantee any position, as long as you're fine with counting down the years until you can finally golf full-time, this your spot.  Should you want to learn a ton, expand your horizons and all that great stuff before then, please re-read above.","The key ones are embedded above and here is another worth considering.

Goals always rise,of course, but the hours to accomplish decrease.  Its' like working any other retail position nowadays.  Once upon a time it was considered a slightly, prestigious job with decent hours, benefits and longevity.  Makeup girls used to aspire to Estee Lauder. Not anymore. Now it seems like all positions have been cut to part time and no benefits to boot.  Account Executives are lacking in work ethic these days are more pencil pushers checking on numbers/sales.  Used to be, they would get down and dirty with you in the selling field. Very ""cliquish"" now.  Training used to be something to look forward to, a perk of sorts,  as it would be in a nice hotel with a great lunch, great training and new product to try.  Although the company makes great profits, their training program has taken a direct hit. It seems like they'll hire any cute, young thing, then poof they're gone!

Note that your benefits/perks may depend on the department you are in, i.e. employees of a brand are more likely to receive free product and employees in HR are more likely to have opportunities to volunteer on the regular.","Depending on which department you are in, your experience as an employee at ELC will differ. Again, each department has their own pros and cons but I'll share mine. Overall, career progression at the company for junior staff is very stagnant. Directors and above keep getting promoted while assistants and managers have to wait a minimum of 1 year to get promoted - certain rules are bent for certain employees depending on who you know at the company. ELC promotes itself as a family company but there is much bureaucracy and your experience at the company really depends on who you know. Highly matrixed organization where you have to go through several layers of approval to get anything done.

A prestigious brand with a great reputation for quality products.,"Upper executive management has a lot of divas you have to deal with. Talented people are very frustrated and want to leave for a more supportive atmosphere. I've read reviews about how the company ""takes care of its people.""

He is such an impressive example of what a manager ought to be that I actually used him as an example in some of my management coursework in a section called,  'What would Terence Do?' in a reading journal.

Besides he and the other consummate professionals I got to work with, I was assigned a very serious project which I had full control over.

Lastly, and oddly, the company seems to have invented its own corporate language that even after 4 months I had not deciphered--- literally, I would get off a 30 minute long phone call with NO IDEA about what the person was talking about. Instead of saying ""ok, I am going to send you the file"", at EL they would say ""We are aligned, I will bounce back that asset."" WHAT? 

I left after only a few months, but not before my boss, her boss, and my ""dotted line boss"" back in NY headquarters had all left (either quit or fired). So much for the stability of a big multinational."

The company promote from within and transfer rather than exhaust.  A very successful intranet where any associate can read in on what is going on with the company as a whole.

The work-life balance feels to have gone off due to the leadership being very successful and into their work loads the culture shift is an all work attitude.  Many leaders come in while they are sick.  The hours of operation are well into the evening hours - past 615p or so.  However I can only speak for the specific floor I am on.  No ""break room"" - no cafeteria to sit down and have your lunch away from your desk.  Many, associates eat their lunch at the desk and it is normal to have your lunch interrupted.  A break room is needed as not all people want to go out and eat their lunch, especially during the winter time - however, taking a full lunch break is frowned upon and almost impossible as many meetings are scheduled during lunch, too."

The particular department I worked for was exceptionally toxic, if you did not conform to the group or did not become who the head of the department wanted you to be, there were major consequences.

For example- if you are a coordinator, work late hours and make overtime you could make an extra $20-30K a year!

In particular, there are constantly ""newly created roles"" for senior people who aren't particularly talented.  So it leads to an environment where many senior people, as pleasant as they may be, are not respected for their business/technical acumen.  The implicit communication is that your image and relationships are more important than substantive work quality.  In fact, many senior people lack the necessary competencies to effectively evaluate their direct reports at all.

For 7 months of work, I have not had basic training, to learn about the products, appearance, etc. However, I picked up a book by products and stupidly had taught her at home.
2. I have not been paid their salaries by 1.5 months + cost No Charge. By the way, I wonder who to go into the pocket of my money? 
3. In MAC encouraged snitching - on the so-called ""meetings"" where they bones wash up for makeup artists, any detail reported to Mrs. Retail Manager. By the way, the ""solutions"" (for permanent make-up transfer from place to place or to dismiss him) it takes spontaneously - on the grounds that it was reported.
4. For 7 months of work, I have not had a vacation.
5. In MAC do not appreciate people who love their work and who give themselves entirely to her.
6. In MAC also do not appreciate the excellent sellers - they do not care what you do to 160% of the sales for the month of his plan, and you love the clients. Why? 
7. They gave me brushes in terrible condition. Scruffy, shabby, more or less decent was very little. I did not like work with them and ashamed to show to clients. And because of this I had to bring my own brushes.
8. Salary, for example, for the entire 1st month paid only at the end of the 2nd. Works contract - too tricky - a little something that was not registered at test time, so still written in the contract are not true (""An employee works on its own materials and cosmetics"" - and what about corner with cosmetics?). By the way, there were cases when was a conflict with management and employees with test time just did not receive bonus.
9. When I asked for the calculation of 1.5 months, they first told me that they need to make an inventory (check out I was stealing or not) in the stores, and it will affect my salary. A week later manager reported that ""at the highest level, it was decided not to pay me anything."" Showed no theft, just decided not to pay!!!"

I worked for the company for nearly 10 years and EVERY year they sent me the Male gendered Christmas gift!  I am a woman! After 10 years you would of thought they'd get it right!  Needless to say I have EL ties & cuff links out the wazoo!  When I worked as an ABA- we did not get reimbursed for our mileage until after 1 hour of drive time!  That's absurd! Not only that- but we were not reimbursed our time spent going to pick up spa equipment from the storage unit or other ABA's to take to events.  I felt like an abundant amount of Account Coordinator & Account Executive duties were delegated down to a select group of ABA's in our territory (myself included).  Unfortunately the compensation did not match the extra responsibilities.  I was one of the top 3 producing ABA's in our market with the highest AUS & IPT - and never once received a raise.  Don't get me wrong- the perks are nice and the products are wonderful- but I think Corporate & Upper Management are missing the boat.  The beauty advisors, ABA's, and Counter Managers out in the field are the active ambassadors to the brand- their translation of the product directly determines the consumer's decision to buy- and I feel that they are undervalued for the amount of revenue they generate."

Seminars are fun to go to.  Laid back atmosphere.  Pretty good incentives.,"Estee Lauder is very unrealistic of goals.  They strive for goals that are 8% above last year, but when the economy keeps going down how do you get 8% above.  They do not recognize you on achievement but tell you to up your sales and that the month is terrible and you need to work harder, even though you have.  There is no training, you are just put in the job and are expected to know what to do.  There is no communication between Younkers Managers and Estee Lauder Managers, so when you are supposed to be working and have a counter manager phone meeting you are not scheduled and miss it and get yelled at by Estee Lauder and Younkers even though it’s not your fault.  
If you are have struggles they fail to come to the store and help even if you request it because you are a small store so they just don’t care.  I quit the job and went to fragrance and my store manager never even told Estee Lauder! So when they called and yelled at me for the monthly numbers being down and I told them I didn’t work for Estee Lauder for two weeks it was a surprise to them!  
I loved what I did as a beauty advisor but hated being disrespected.  

What is 3% commission!!!!!!! For all the work that I did I'd expect to get more than that!
Calling customers, follow up calls, doing three appoitments a day (make-up and skin care consultations), persuading people to buy products, and working my tail end off to meet unrealistic goals!"

-Absolutely zero regard for their employees as human beings. You are simply someone to make them money and bring in more customers to the counters. If a counter isn't doing well, or an event doesn't go well, you are garbage, no matter how fantastic your track record is. 
-Slave labor. Working behind the counter with these poor women is just that. Slave labor. Long hours, on your feet and some days I didn't even get lunches or breaks if business wasn't good. 
-Stress. I can't tell you how many times my cell phone rang throughout the day with my Account Executive calling me ripping me a new one because business was down at a store I wasn't even at that particular day. 
-No advancement. They bait you during your interview, promising dreams of becoming an Account Executive or Territory Manager if you work hard. Forget about it.

2389,Estée Lauder Companies,Meh,2012-03-19,4.0,,"*Most of the customers are so much nicer than my previous cosmetic employer.  I would imagine    that counters that participate in Gift With Purchase can say otherwise.  I have heard horror stories from employees.  Prepared to deal with the worst side of people during this time.  Do not take it personal. 

* Quality product
* Gratis is alright 
*Benefits for full time employees
* It can be a satisfying job. You help women feel great, it's not back breaking work (other than standing on your feet all day).","* Uniform...ugh.  It's hot, frumpy, just ugh.  And you have to wear gold or pearls...which works if you actually like gold and pearls. 
* Pay is not that great.  It's OK, but still. There are other cosmetic brands that pay more.  
* It's retail...nights, weekends...kiss them goodbye.  Holidays too. 
*Sales pressure,  GWP 
* Possible drama...makeup departments all seem to have drama."
2390,Estée Lauder Companies,Wonderful to work for!,2012-03-04,5.0,Stylist Key Holder,Always educated on new product. All managers were so nice! Everyone was always easy to talk to. Great work environment that supports education. They even do tuition reimbursement which promotes lifelong learning.,Not enough advanced job openings. Many of the upper management jobs are in New York. There  are some very long days on your feet. Wear flats and enjoy having an easy dress of all black.
2391,Estée Lauder Companies,FUN PLACE TO WORK WITH LOTS OF FUN PERKS,2012-02-26,4.0,Event Coordinator,"I love doing the facials and connecting with clients way beyond their skincare needs. Its about building great customer loyalty through recommending the best skincare from that client based on their primary concerns. Once the clients feels how the products make them look and feel the close becomes the easiest part. Origins is growing rapidly and the bar is always being raised.The coaching each month and also constantly on the sales floor, always lets you know how you're doing so there are no suprises come raise or promotion time.Trainiings are alot of fun with engaging contects and usually end in your walking away with the featured product.","You have to jump through so many hurdles before you can get to corporate. First a key holder, then an assistant, then store , then corporate. What if your calling is not to be a store manager? Shouldnt you have a choice without leaving the brand? Also partimers are only required to have 12 hours."

2398,Estée Lauder Companies,Bullies and Incompetence Galore,2011-12-15,1.0,Marketing Administrator,Looks good on a resume; decent health benefits/corporate discounts; reasonable work/life balance.,"Estee Lauder--once considered to be the ""gold standard"" of places to work in the beauty industry--is swiftly on its way to becoming the laughing-stock of the business world.  Due to severe mis-management, politics, and overall incompetence, this company is on a swift decline. 

To start: Most of senior management has been with the company for 20+ years. Although on paper this sounds good, these people were obviously hired at a time when being ""street smart"" and ""scrappy"" was enough to get you to the top of the beauty industry.  As a result, Senior management is filled with nasty, unprofessional, spendthrift, poorly-educated women who think nothing of bullying their employees into submission. Every day at the office is like an episode of ""Real Housewives of New Jersey."" Seriously.

And God help an employee that might actually want to pursue higher education.  When a former colleague informed her manager that she was going to attend business school, she was actually informed that, ""It was fine if she wanted to do that for herself personally, but it wouldn't help her advance [at Estee Lauder]"". Said employee was then informed that she was so ""lucky"" to have the opportunity to work at Estee Lauder, that she should be happy fetching coffee indefinitely.

There are zero career growth opportunities (once again, due to the jealousy of the fore-mentioned bully sorority), and the employee turnover is extremely high.  Not to mention the fact that the salaries are only about %75 percent of industry standard pay. 

I started working at Estee Lauder with high hopes, but unfortunately, this place is a real-life version of ""The Devil Wears Prada."""
