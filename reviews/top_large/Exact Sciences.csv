22,Exact Sciences,They use some interesting social tactics,2022-03-01,1.0,Anonymous,There was a point where I believed they cared about us. That was a fun time.,Okay I’m not sure if they realize the kind of emotionally abusive tactics they use. Mainly toxic positivity and love bombing. Toxic positivity is dismissing negative emotions and responding to distress with false reassurances rather than empathy. It comes from feeling uncomfortable with negative emotions. It is often well-intentioned but can cause alienation and a feeling of disconnection. Love bombing is an attempt to influence a person by demonstrations of attention and affection. It can be used in different ways and for either positive or negative purposes. Psychologists have identified love bombing as a possible part of a cycle of abuse and have warned against it.

Making screening for colorectal cancer more accessible to all appropriate patients is an important mission.,The sales numbers that the company uses to pay bonuses on are always questionable.

Company messages are always inspirational and the company tries to do their best to be people first. Great benefits,  great company mission, good growth (job stability), and great people to work with.","Exact Sciences is growing faster than employees can handle. Everyone in the company is overworked and has too much on their plate. Roles don’t have clear career paths, leaving a lot of employees who want to progress in the dark. Some managers have 10-15 direct reports and so they are too busy to really focus on you and your growth. Exact is not a pay for performance company, so for annual reviews, everyone gets the same merit increase regardless of performance. Too many approvals needed for things and changes are slow to implement because everyone is just so busy. Projects that should take a couple of months will take a year or longer."

62,Exact Sciences,"Even with the downsides, this is probably one of the best places to work in Madison WI",2022-01-12,4.0,Business Analyst,"Pay is decent and all employees get yearly bonuses, pay increases, and stocks. It's not any wild amount of money, but most companies barely provide anything. Additional stock options are provided and benefits are better than every other place I've worked. There is room for growth if you are lucky and have managers who care about you. The culture is pretty good and the company takes care of most of its employees considering it is still a large business. The CEO is a pretty nice and personable guy.","The company is relatively new and rapidly expanding, which means that policies and workflows are constantly evolving to the point where even management is struggling to keep up. With salaried positions, work life balance is compromised because the rapid growth of the business without the hiring of more people means an average of 50 hour work weeks. The CEO, despite being nice/personable, is still ultimately a very wealthy person who cannot truly connect with the lower level employees."

69,Exact Sciences,Work here if you want to be forgotten about,2021-12-30,1.0,Clinical Laboratory Scientist,Stock options are good. But times where we are allowed to sell them are limited and always when it is low.,"Expect if you work in the lab (Tech Lab or Specimen Processing) that the rest of the company will forget about you as if you never exist. Perks that corporate workers get are exclusive to them. So many people are leaving and not being replaced that those still here are pushed to do OT. ""Thank you's"" from the company are half-a**ed. They might order food to incentivize us, but there isn't enough food for everyone to even get some. Holiday gifts? Just leftovers. Food that is given is expired and just the stuff they need to get rid of from vending machines. Things given to the lab are table scraps compared to what other departments get."
70,Exact Sciences,Amazing company,2021-12-30,5.0,Workforce Specialist,Exact Sciences is the first job i really enjoy coming to. They are about work life balance and compensation is awesome.,Cons would be nothing at this time
71,Exact Sciences,Be careful,2021-12-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A couple of good coworkers.,"Leadership knows nothing. Trainers know nothing. Vast majority of associates know nothing. Apparently it's more important to know meaningless ""fun facts"" and get to know each other instead of knowing your job. Leadership doesn't tackle real issues. Even when given examples over and over again of how people are making careless errors, nothing is addressed, nothing changes. It's always ""we'll reach out to them..."" Do you really reach out? Because I never see any improvements. Any time you speak up, the target on you grows. Very much an authoritative leadership who thrives on bullying and intimidation."
72,Exact Sciences,"Would recommend, but know that there is no work/life balance",2021-12-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Higher than average compensation
- Work alongside highly educated, motivated, talented team members
- Great amenities and benefits (although health insurance is not so great)","- LOTS of change, particularly if you are in an enabling function. Team structure, leadership, and positions are constantly in flux which can get old.
- Health insurance is not widely accepted in Madison area
- Work/life balance is something all leaders preach, but no one actually lives by this and if you do (say, commit to not working in the evenings), you will fall far behind in the work (this is true for the corporate office; uncertain about other areas of Exact)"
73,Exact Sciences,Where hopes and dreams go to die,2021-12-22,1.0,Scientist,"Time off, they really should have zero stars as an option.","If you apply for this company be sure it is not in the lab. The lab seems to be treated less than the other departments. 

Work is very repetitive, and even with ergonomics assessments your body will fall apart after about 6 months. Multiple scientists have to wear wrist braces, or go to physical therapy. Even with submitting work injuries, the company does not seem to care at all about the health of their employees. They consider hanging up stretching exercise for people who work at desks helpful. Expect to feel like a glorified factory worker with a degree and treated as a child who cannot make decisions. You are better off working in an actual factory- they most likely pay better. 

Work life balance is a joke. They dropped all rules regarding over time about having to wait 12 hours between clocking in and clocking out, and made it sound like they were doing us a favor. Over time is not commonly required for tech lab (but have heard of forced OT for specimen processing) though they will guilt trip you into helping your teammates, and how much patients need their results. 

Some lab shifts have been cut down in half due to people leaving, but higher ups still expect the same amount of work to be done. Even when trying to explain this basic concept of 15 people cannot do the work of 30 they still do not understand, nor care. 

It is next to impossible to advance your career here. People have to apply for the same job 2-4 times to get the job, as well as doing projects for the department, and for lack of a better term- kiss a** to their possible new team. It almost seems like the best way to get a promotion is to sexually harass your co workers. 2 men in the lab have had accusations, but they both seemed to move to a different part of the lab with a raise. They worry about losing talent so it is easy to get into a position as an external candidate, but difficult to move around once hired. Some positions will have 20-30 internal people apply and have only one opening available. 

All in all, apply to work in cooperate, and do not even think about applying to Exact Sciences Laboratories."
74,Exact Sciences,Good Luck to Exact Sciences,2021-12-22,1.0,Scientist,Great teammates and Good Benefits,"If you work in the labs you are worked like a robot and forgotten about by the rest of the company.

Company is growing too fast and the company is losing touch with it's employees. 

Leadership within the labs is lacking and employees run things themselves.

Really high turnaround time for employees and they will be losing more and more lab employees by the day."

98,Exact Sciences,Soul-Sucking Place to Work,2021-10-31,1.0,Clinical Laboratory Scientist,"Stock options are available. A large quantity is given to new hires, which vest over the course of four years.","Said stocks are the only reason for many of us staying here for as long as we have. After four years and those stocks have fully vested, many of us want to get out.

The work is unfulfilling and highly repetitive. During Covid in particular, (I have experienced working here both pre-Covid and throughout the pandemic) ergonomic strain has been a major issue. Scientists across shifts have developed carpal tunnel, now preventing them from certain tasks and further limiting what little variation there is in day-to-day work. A number of these scientists have permanent damage so severe that therapy or braces have been needed.

While advertised as a lab, working here actually feels more like a factory or assembly line job. Workers aren’t really valued, but just pushed to do as much as they can constantly. Morale has been extremely low due to this and people feel overworked. On just the shift I work on, our team size has been reduced to half of what it was a year ago. The amount of work has only increased, but team size has decreased, with none of these workers being replaced.

For over 9 months, the Tech Lab has been mandatorily sent over to Specimen Processing in order to do their work and catch them up due to their understaffing. While assisting another department is a kind thing to do, it gets exhausting. It is not what scientists were hired for, and we have been doing another department’s work on top of our own. The company for some reason has dragged their feet to hire more for both Specimen Processing or Technical Lab. We have been falling behind and overtime is being pushed on to people.

There's also micromanagement. Management also wants you to log every minute of your day into a timecard, including the exact time you take a break, use the bathroom, check emails, etc. If you work for the corp, people expect to see immediate results and impacts of your work. Depending on your role, you may have tons of meetings from eight to five. Exact is not a place where you can just do easy work in a laid back environment.

I most of the coworkers seem to be decent genuine people but not all.,"-Inept and feckless supervisors.
-no accountability when representatives are trying to convey their concerns.
-The overall effort that they put in to absolve themselves of any responsibility of wrongdoing.

When I had my interview this September I was immediately struck by how little I was asked about my qualifications. I am a call-center veteran I have worked in several and I know what to expect from the environment. On day one we went to HQ to pick up our computers to work from home due to Covid. They gave us two hours to set up at home, which our PTO was used so we were paid, but that meant we were out our allotted PTO which we never elected to use. It was automatically decided for us.

Training was two weeks. We did have more experienced representative shadowing us but that was only for a day or two before we were expected to be able to take calls on our own. Virtual training was a joke. I took notes the best I could but putting everything into practice was a lot more difficult than met the eye.
The policies and navigation through epic were very difficult at first because of the monotony. After training if we had questions we were expected to just Skype the other more experienced representatives.
This doesn’t work very well when the call has ended and trying to convey what exactly went wrong is difficult, especially if you had a doctor or nurse completely tear you apart.

Mental health is at an all time low among agents and representatives. Some of my coworkers put on quite the front. I myself was struggling so bad I took advantage of the EAP program. A provider in Florida completely ripped me apart after a fax she sent in for an order was not completed and the requisition was not built. In such instances there are protocols in place with reference numbers so agents can look and see what the problem was. After asking three times for the information I told her I couldn’t help her. She finally (miraculously) found the information in an email after she had worked herself up into a frenzy and took it out on me.

After she hung up on me she called back and escalated the call to upper management. Both my supervisors had decided I was at fault from the very beginning, regardless of how hard I tried to help her. It only got worse from there.

If you don’t have any experience working in a call center please stay away from this place at all costs!! Your supervisors don’t care about helping you be better they only want to point out your mistakes and wear you down as much as possible. The company itself thanks that placating their employees with gifts and gift certificates of money are enough to keep them in line. They think it’s enough to turn people into mindless robots and yes men. If you have any shred of self-respect and can think for yourself this is not the job for you."

Weekend overnights is a completely forgotten shift with no heat, lights, or fresh food like every other shift. The compensation is not nearly as good as it sounds. Figuring out what you'll get paid is confusing due to the way they itemize it. Overall it ends up being only about $15 dollars a week more than if you work a regular 40hr day shift. HR is rarely available and almost never has answers. Leadership is always temporary and limited to only one person because the shift is so awful and undercompensated when compared to every other shift that no one wants to stay on it."

I read reviews about it being ""cliquey"" and ""high schooly"" and I thought well those people are obviously just really immature scorned ex employees. It's the whole place. Then the only adults that are there don't seem to understand how to be professional and positive but still be honest. (honesty is notably lacking from there core values) They pretty much just lie straight to your face so no one ever really knows whats going on or who to believe. Then throw in coronavirus testing and everyones mental health seems to be suffering severely. We go in day after day on-site and they constantly brag about the company wide infection rate but never mention the on-site rate. Of course we have a great rate you are paying most of the company to sit at home. They don't care about their lab people its just awful."

263,Exact Sciences,Ruining the sales culture again - micromanagement,2020-09-14,1.0,Sales Representative,I feel good about the impact I make.,"Middle management is at it again. They are ruining the inside sales culture by 1) Not giving us a sales spiff incentive like they do the outside sales reps and 2) Are implementing a phone software system that micromanages us.

1) They give the outside reps a bonus but don't give the inside reps a bonus for doing the exact same thing. Not only that but the inside reps directly help the outside reps earn this bonus but don't get compensated for it. The reason the director level gives us is that they didn't want any confusion with our job responsibility changes so that's why we are not getting extra money. So not only are they not giving us money but they insult our intelligence by saying we would be confused by any job changes and the extra compensation. Basically a slap in the face to the inside team. Nobody in any industry or company would be happy with doing hard work another team also does but all the compensations goes to just one team.  

2) They are implementing a new software system that is the definition of micromanagement. And they gave us the excuse that people were complaining about using their cell phones from home. Which is complete nonsense. There is no twenty-something year old reps complaining about using a cell phone and instead would want a software system that not only records our dials and conversations but also records our computer screens. This system will have a direct negative impact on the inside team. Even the mention of it several weeks ago brought the morale down across the inside team. If some reps aren't doing their jobs then deal with them and don't punish the entire team. Because implementing this software system is punishment. And if you think it is not and are trying to spin it as positive and a better way to make our calls better then you are clearly delusional. But I guess you would have to be to think this would be a good idea in the first place. Guess what, we all used this system on the patient outreach we did and it was awful. People hated it. They were looking to get back to their normal ISR roles. And now you ruined that by implementing this system. Just by having this system you will insure that productivity/morale/quality of calls takes a nosedive. Clearly lower level supervisors up to higher middle managers to director level can't see this and that is the main problem right there."

Management in my experience was very hands-off, and wasn't at all proactive in addressing issues.  Construction at the main campus has been very disruptive.

Employees act like they respect each other at all levels. Management tries hard to aim for transparency. Great salary and benefits.","Work environment is uncomfortable. Cubicles/desks are small and close together, no personal space. Sounds and smells carry and conversations are heard everywhere, distracting work environment. Conference rooms not available when you need them.
Often too much to do and not enough people (resources) to get it done. Not a steady balance  - frequent shifts from comfortable/content workload to extremely stressful."
406,Exact Sciences,Okay. Not hard to leave.,2016-04-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Many company functions and unique experiences offered. Seem to genuinely care about saving lives from Colo-rectal cancer. A lot of friendly people work there and there are often smiles and conversations in the hall ways.,"Horrible management-changed almost every six months. Each boss had their own expectations so some people in the company had to work weekends and were expected to be in at a certain times while others came at 9 and left at 4 and hardly worked at all (usually these people were being paid higher just because they had more ""experience""). There was virtually no expectation that the management knew anything about being a manager and there was insane micromanaging by some bosses for the professional work you were doing. Scientists and engineers DO NOT know how to manage people. I knew some who sat in an office with a manager everyday telling them what they were doing wrong...Saw MANY people crying at their desks due to these meetings and the over-working of some employees. Horrible non-competitive starting salary. Lack luster HR (was zero to one person for about 4 years). Everything was always rush rush rush. Corners were cut to get things out ""on time""."

They do have a sensitive temperature on company moral. Working to attract good talent (see below).,Pay is far too low for the amount of work that the field actually does. Infrastructure is not in place to handle the ordering of CG. Faxes aren't received and there is no way to know as a rep or the office when tests aren't ordered. The field is held accountable for a quota but when inside processing doesn't do their job or infrastructure is inadequate field is the one who suffers.
410,Exact Sciences,Employer,2016-02-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"You will get excellent pay and benefits for working at Exact Sciences. Due to the nature of the product the company sells, it can be a very rewarding feeling to work there. The company is striving to make its name in the healthcare field with an excellent product.","The company struggles with communication changes to procedures and processes. Many of the managers and supervisors are ill experienced and struggle with implementing direction of the company and maintain a happy, positive atmosphere. While everyone wants to work in a place like Google, culture and atmosphere come from experienced, good managers and supervisors. Simply because someone fit the position in the beginning doesn't mean they can continue to meet the demands of the job nor are they a good fit for the company."

419,Exact Sciences,mass chaos,2014-10-13,2.0,,Great product and future pipeline if all goes well,The company has no idea what they are doing and how to launch a product.  They don't know what the needs of the customers are-internal or external-and they don't seem to care.  The training was pathetic and it showed when the product was launched
