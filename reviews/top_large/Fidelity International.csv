0,Fidelity International,If you like micro-management then work here,2022-04-11,1.0,Client Service Associate,Overtime hours (a con when understaffed),The managers watch everything you do. Literally got four messages at once asking why I was not on a call - I was out of code for about 4 minutes to compose myself for the next call. The mangers who messaged me were at all levels.Do not work here - if you need a short term job then this is ok but this is not a career. I am surpised by the number of positive reviews because I have not spoke with a single member of staff that thinks this is a good place to work. Very toxic. Management pretend to support mental health but how is this demonstrated by the above situation?
