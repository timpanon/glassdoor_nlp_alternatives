0,Fidelity Investments,Great culture,2022-04-24,5.0,Senior Data Analyst,The company is big but is very close knit and supportive culture.,Growth prospects can be sometimes limited.

3,Fidelity Investments,Work place,2022-04-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great work place to work,Nothing like that to say
4,Fidelity Investments,WPC,2022-04-22,3.0,Workplace Planning Consultant I,"- Decent pay
- Good benefits (very long vesting schedule for some)
- Pay for training/licensing, although Fidelity does have a big problem of reps leaving after being paid to obtain the licenses
- They are currently promoting reps very quickly through the WPA department","- Taking phone calls all day long (the majority I had would message you within 5 minutes of not being on the phone, but that could help obviously vary with locations/managers)

- Very high turnover. My team had 5 different managers within 6 months. Reps also leave very quickly to get off the phones. The company really has a plan in place to make their reps stay in the call center as long as possible. Bonus payments are structured to make you feel like it is just close enough to stay for a little while longer. Also a year requirement of work after you obtain your licenses before you can move to a branch role (which are very competitive, and typically are outside hires anyways)

- Extremely sales oriented, but a lot of the clients think we are service. Be prepared for awkward calls where you and the client have completely separate agendas. Instead of servicing the clients need and moving on to help the next, the company would rather you run them through their retirement tools. These tools can be beneficial in some instances, but they are extremely general and many of these clients have recognized that they don’t help much. Seems the department is only here to promote these tools. Only goal on every single call is to take the clients need, acknowledge it while basically ignoring it, run them through the retirement tools so we can gather outside assets, and then set an appointment with a branch so they can move those to Fidelity.

I understand there are plenty of roles similar to this, the only difference is that a lot of the hiring managers at Fidelity do not warn you of this. Multiple reps on my team and I had this same experience.

Overall, this role and the constant phone calls will exhaust you. I would recommend looking elsewhere first if your goal is to get into financial advising. If necessary, this can be a decent role in the short-term."

There needs to be an internal investigation in Fidelity to see what their interview/hiring process is regarding minorities. After multiple phone interviews they seemed to be ready to move forward with me until they met with me in person and saw I didn't look like them. I could tell by their face they didn't expect me to be a person of color. I knocked the interview out of the park despite their obvious discomfort. Later found out they didn't want to move forward with me. Something tells me there will be a class action lawsuit coming soon in that firm.

- some of the people you meet and community events etc
- good resume builder if you need to help build it
- diversity","- Once you are out of the training program you are 12pm-8pm ET. This seems okay at first and if you’re a night owl, but it wears on you. You can advance ur way to a better time slot but if you start a new role that’s the same sort of field, you go back to 12-8pm and have to work your way back up.
- Stats; you have to meet call criteria which some is understandable but then you have situations that they don’t train you on and your stuck ruining your stats. 
- You feel like a robot and are really just a number. Saying the same things over and over to every customer can get tiring especially some of them are super rude and impatient.
- a good manager and a bad one here affects ur motivation to do the same exact thing over and over again
- hourly salary; they tell you and send you an offer that it’s a salary position but are paid by the hour"

- Depending on the role, work from home is an option. But the FR role doesn’t allow for that.
- There are so many resources and learning opportunities.
- Your coworkers will always be eager to help you at any capacity.","- Management is more concerned on how well their profitable employees are doing, and taking care of them. They are more flexible and willing to bend for those employees.
- Micromanagement is an understatement.
- With all those learning opportunities, it’s still really hard to promote. You won’t promote unless the other people in your role are able to handle it themselves. Lots of people quit in this role because they can’t get licensed or the workload is a lot, so you’ll find yourself stuck in the role for 3-4 years (though they say 1-2 is average).

They will also lure you into new roles and lock you down without being honest about what the role really is.  You get “used” as a vessel to push upper leadership personal motivations and accolades, while slowly being quieted down and eventually silenced.  .  It’s just a bunch of senior leaders trying to outshine each other and get their name on something even if it’s not best for the employees.  Will get overwhelming associate feedback in surveys about wanting to work remote and will only tell you about the one comment from someone who wants to be in the office and then try to gaslight you into believing it’s the majority opinion.  Leadership will “threaten” that you’re luck the President is giving you any flexibility because she would prefer not to and force you to give up all of your flexibility if you don’t agree to work in the office sometimes.  Kind of like “ you’re lucky to get anything.  Don’t push your luck or she will take all your toys away.  The culture was going in an amazing direction the past couple of years.

We take calls back to back and follow a strict schedule. If we don’t follow the schedule, then we get yelled at by our managers. I was in a post grad rotation program and our managers basically treat us like kids. It’s pretty cringey and not professional. I felt like I was still in high school going through this program and I don’t really feel much growth. I didn’t go through college just to be stuck in a call center role, getting berated by customers on the daily. I felt like I was lied to during the interview process, because they market this opportunity in such a different way. Just tell us straight up that this is a call center and not waste anyone’s time. Majority of the roles within the company are call center positions, so there’s no way getting off the phones. The one thing I don’t understand about this company, is that the pay is so bad, but people are still so enthusiastic about their job, getting yelled at by customers and being “customer obsessed.”It gives off cultish vibes. Anyways, it takes a certain personality to really like being on the phones and following a strict schedule with a timed 30 minute lunch."
