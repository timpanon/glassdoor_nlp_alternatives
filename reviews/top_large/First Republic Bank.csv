7,First Republic Bank,Leadership Crisis at First Republic Bank,2022-03-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits. Solid credit philosophy leading to stability for company and existing employees.,"If the recent developments within Lending Services are any indication, the evolution of leadership and culture at First Republic Bank is heading in a very concerning direction.  This company claims to value its employees but there has been a huge organizational shake up within Lending Services and no clear reasons have been given, other than a vague reference to ""growth."" 

As of two weeks ago, the department has been split in two, with the previous head of the department demoted to managing one half. The leadership they have brought in to manage the other half of the department was here in a leadership role about 3 years ago and oversaw the complete removal of overtime approval in that department. The result of this was a Department of Labor investigation, in which complaints of employees being forced to work overtime without being properly compensated were found to be accurate. The culture of fear and retribution created during this time is very well remembered, and many are anxious and afraid about the return to the department.

Additionally, this organizational change resulted in the sudden position elimination of someone who had served FRB for 21 years. They were not even given the opportunity to say farewell to the department. The fact that this person was given the unpleasant task of investigating the allegations made against the leader mentioned above during the period of overtime abuse has raised more than a few eyebrows given the current situation. 

The announcement of these changes came through a Town Hall meeting held for the department two weeks ago. Aside from vague mentions of growth as a justification for this re-org/position elimination, no other answers have been provided, other than ""we are figuring that out."" At best, this was a poorly thought-through, poorly managed organization shift initiated by so-called leaders with no concept of empathy or change management. At worst, this development highlights an extremely worrying cultural shift for First Republic Leadership - to care more about their own accumulation of power and control than to invest in sustainable business growth and the safety and engagement of its employees. 

Ethical leadership is on its way out at First Republic."

I feel so fortunate to be part of an organization that truly wants to do the right thing in every aspect of the business. They're also big on promoting from within and encouraging transfers if you're not quite in the right fit in your current role/department.","I've heard that the speed at which we operate can be a little too fast paced for some. But coming from the legal world where it can be like pulling teeth to move the needle on initiatives/projects, the pace here is refreshing to me."

Stock has performed well for those in the ESPP.","This is not a traditional relaxed banking environment, more like a frenzied start-up. 

Turnover rate is high in the first 30 days (the Bank offers a financial incentive of an additional 1 months salary for those who choose to leave or are asked to leave within 30 days of hire). The termination process for all is immediate, and there are no probation plans. 

The Kool-Aid factor is high, so you either buy in or you don't. If you don't you need to be really good to stay in your job. 

The Bank currently has a hybrid work model, but some/many employees feel compelled to come into the office most days.

Some employees find their niche and stay long-term, but others find themselves in high burnout roles that are not sustainable for more than a few years.

Customers and customer service is the top priority of the Bank, with regulators coming next, then investors and employees.

The tone from the top differs greatly by department, so ratings for the firm as a whole may not be especially relevant.

Has weird cultural traits, like no org chart for a company with 6000+ employees."

Our team had grown double its size in the past 2 years during COVID, they did everything they could to onboard, welcome, and train all new colleagues to do the best job they could.

In my case I was having performance related issues due to personal matters outside of work and a recent diagnosis of major depression. Management met with me to discuss and referred me to HR to take advantage of the ESP but during the process of completing the suggested steps of having a provider complete FMLA paperwork and request for accommodation I was fired. Clearly they were not interested in assisting an employee they claimed they had concern for and an interest in retaining as they said. 

Also, I was a remote employee and sat for 1 month after I was hired before training for my role even started. When training did start it was poorly organized and my suggestions were basically in one ear and out the other. The home office is based in SF, CA and I was in Boston, MA.

There is no respect, support nor appreciation for the production teams within this group. Closing and servicing teams have been mistreated, understaffed and overworked for a decade. The two senior authoritarian “leaders” that have been managing this department for over 10 years work in a vacuum and have zero compassion or respect for their operations teams. The level of their politics, favoritism, bias, control, gossip, lack of transparency and communication is unacceptable and shouldn’t be tolerated. Despite numerous complaints to HR, high turnover, especially amongst the managers who tried to make changes, nothing is being done by HR and executive management."

Many in my department have worked for the bank for over 5 years. Other departments have much more attrition, as mentioned in other reviews. Luckily, my team's management keeps communication as transparent as possible. We are given opportunities to grow, but sometimes the onus is on us to really let it be known we are interested in more opportunities. 

Pay is above industry average for a bank, and the benefits package is well rounded too. With everything going on, the return to office date has been pushed back further into mid 2022 which is great because I love having the hybrid schedule of wfh and going in to the office twice a week.

I appreciate the bank providing opportunities to focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity now by creating and funding several community groups. Learning and Development has a mentorship program.","Sometimes the kool-aid about our special culture comes off as a bit too strong.

Great place to both start and continue a career.","The fact they want people to be back in the office most if not full-time beginning September is a slap in the face to all of those that took the time to submit the exec team feedback over the last year and a half. If people wanted to be back in office, there would be MUCH larger numbers already returning as it is already optional. So why aren't there people in office now then (June/July), outside of the depts that are required to be in office? There'd be no need to bribe people (offering free lunches, etc.) that departments are trying to do. It's appalling after all of this past year and a half the exec team is still turning their heads to the fact people -- especially the millennial employees -- have expressed not wanting to go back, or at least having a say in how much they return. Taking the choice away from employees will only continue to make them leave. Is it really worth losing amazing employees? The bank will become much less attractive when recruiting and being unable to offer the flexibility that other companies across the nation will offer. There has to be tradeoff and incentive for our employees to stay. Just trying to express how many many many people feel they cannot voice to our exec team."

I worked for the Enterprise Risk Management team for a year and a half, and the Chief Risk Officer was a real life Cruella Deville. I should have known things would be bad when the EA who’d originally hired me, quit and left the company the week I started. Stephanie the CRO degraded not only myself, but most of the members of the team behind their backs. And had several meltdowns during my time at the bank. Another risk officer “outed” a member of the team behind their back, which I overheard and brought up to HR. There have been probably 7-10 EAs that have been churned out of the ERM team within 5-6 years due to mistreatment and the toxic environment, yet there aren’t ever any consequences for the executives who are the true cause of this attrition.

The technology stack is really forward looking and you can directly influence that.  That's not something you can say at most companies of this size.  Working here is a chance to really affect outcomes at the ground floor.    The building blocks are there for this to be the absolute best place to work period.","Highly siloed teams.   Working cross team is more akin to working between unrelated companies.     Decisions are made by managers many levels above and there are no thoughts for how it affects those below.   The decision is made and the decree is sent.    The banking lines of business (clients, money, investments) and lines of the business that are not directly client connected work very differently.   Consider that when reading reviews.     

Your success here is highly dependent on your silo and your managers political pull.   If you have the wrong manager you're not going anywhere.   All titles are not equal.  Just because they appear to be peers doesn't mean they have similar influence.   Appearance matters over everything.  You have to be a cheerleader at all times or your career is done.   No one wants feedback that isn't how great they are doing."

Bonuses and pay are pretty good, as well as some generous quality of life benefits(fitness stipend, commute stipend, onsite cafe, etc)","All the pros about budgets for infrastructure are weighed down heavily by a bureacracy that is so focused on it's own tree it can't even conceive of a forest. Silos are impenetrable, with each team having it's own unique ecosystem. 

Career advancement is a unicorn. Those who put their blood, sweat and tears into the environment are overlooked and considered disposable, while their peers and managers who take credit for their work are promoted. 

In order to get any meaningful work done, one has to sit through a day full of pointless and redundant meetings and complete tasks after hours and on weekends, making work/life balance a sick joke."

Work Life  
Executives/management are disconnected from the day to day work and treat employees poorly. There is no flexibility with working remotely which is unusual these days. People often spend 2-3 hours commuting in the Bay Area which is the norm. My spouse and children would rarely see me on weekdays.  

Low Pay
One of the reasons of the turnover is the below market compensation. Morale is low and most of my colleagues only think of this place as a short-term gig.  

Lack of Infrastructure  
Technology in this organization is a good 10+ years old and poorly implemented. This leads to layers of workarounds and there is a high margin of error in which employees are held responsible for. If you are an individual contributor you will be working long hours."

Tuition reimbursement.","Other than my team (IT) I found most other people distasteful to be around.  There’s a lot of people talking nice to your face and then spreading lies the next minute.  These were petty, shallow people who made me distrustful of nearly anyone else.  

This is an antiquated company in many ways.  This is in downtown San Francisco in 2019 and they have a very strict outdated dress code, a laughably poor work from home policy and outdated slow technology.  

Managers keep things siloed and seemingly spend all their time in multiple redundant meetings all day.  The level of distrust is here too as managers are paranoid of each other.  

Everything is slowed down-nothing is resolved quickly here due to the expectation of the above.  A simple change request may take months due to Infosec and IT scratching their heads about if they should proceed.  

Finally I’d like to say that while my own manager was a wonderful person I saw so many toxic managers in charge of groups that brought in money so they were able to throw their weight around and generally just be unpleasant to work with.  These people have earned their reputation that preceded them. 

All I can say is that I’m glad I’m gone.  I sleep better at night and I feel a great weight lifted off my shoulders."

I worked there for almost a year, and the longer I was there the more and more I realized how toxic the leadership was in this company. The situations that occur here are worthy of HR complaints, but HR cannot and will not save you. They all support the toxic system that exists in this bank.

If you are not  meeting expectations, it as easy as them writing you up and not taking the time to work through it. You would think after many many interviews later, you would want to spend some extra time to work with that employee to succeed since it wasn't a easy process for them to get hired. 

Executives- They are oblivious to what is going on with employees, such as why they are leaving or why they are not happy. You think with all the ""Surveys"" we have taken you would  think some employees needs/concerns would be heard. They say they want to be there and they care, but really they don't have the time of day to do anything. They rely on their prospective managers who report to them to deal with it. 

No work life balance, your job is your life, working many many over time hours, and no acknowledgement in the work you do. 

Communication- There is ZERO communication. 

 My time there I've seen so many people fail at their job because they were not trained well, and managers just don't know how to be a manager. Managers expect too much out of someone who is new and also there is no training in place how is that person going to succeed at their job.  It's sad to see why people come and go so often because a manager could not take some time to actually teach someone how to do their job. You cannot go into any job and expect someone to be perfect and know what to do. Its like throwing a new born in water expecting them to know how to swim."

- Favoritism at its finest, if you are not well liked then I wouldn't bother working as hard as you do. You will not get acknowledge, even if your team thinks your doing a wonderful job your manager will not acknowledge it.  
- Managers will do anything to cover up the bad and make it sound like their suffering on a employee's performance when in reality there was no training or good foundation for any employee to do their job. 
- If you have a problem, you are wasting your time reaching out to higher executives because you wont be heard. They don't have the ""time"" to deal with that, and they rely on the people who report to them to give them at update (which sucks but true). 
- Lack of communication. It was hard to work when your're not informed and then your manager tries to enforce you to get it done as soon as possible without any type of warning.

Stay in your lane, do exactly as you are told, and nothing else.. not a great place for innovators. Don't try to change the system. Very outdated technology. Though few and far between, certain people and teams are extremely oppressive and even demeaning. I had some very heated ""discussions"" with certain individuals where I was lampooned for things that were outside of my control. Some teams are ruled with an iron fist by bosses who are extremely harsh behind closed doors.. I heard of more than one instance where certain superiors made their employees cry with demeaning, unnecessary comments, which I find extremely inappropriate, especially for a brand that tries so hard to appear friendly and accessible to clients. The high stress put on certain teams takes its toll and drains the life from those individuals, who are, sadly, some of the highest performing employees in the company. I saw and heard of many quitting, being fired, or moving away from these toxic environments as quickly as they could. In these few teams, people feel that they have to take lunch at their desk every day, they cannot take part in social activities, and basically appeared to have terrible work environments.

There is always opportunity to set yourself apart and take initiative, management will never stop you from doing good work just because its not part of your responsibility. Also, knowledgealbe co-workers and great team that always support you.

In addition, employees are extremely grateful that lunches are subsidized at the Eagle Cafe.","I been with the bank for 10 years plus and there is not really a set career path for most employees. For example, for someone who is looking for a career progression or to climb a career ladder will not be satisfied to work here. You are responsible to always create your own opportunities and pave your own way to not care about titles in your department. 

Also, adjusting to growth and maintaining the desired culture fit can be a struggle. For example, if you are someone that is willing to put on a mask at work on a daily basis and spend the time in office politics and complaining, this isn't a culture fit for you. Micro-management is very strict in this department which makes you wonder why there are so many turnovers this year. Hours are not as flexible because being on time at work is strictly enforced. Exempt employees have to meet the 8 hours shift on time on a daily basis and sometimes you have stayed over time depending on the workload."

Decent health and retirement benefits
Excellent vacation and sick time","Middle managers are incompetent, and senior managers are in denial or choose to ignore the incompetence.
Senior managers do not communicate with staff to get feedback on middle managers.
Even though there are many complaints about an employee, the incompetence is tolerated and staff members suffer.
There is always power struggles between middle managers between departments. As a result, staff operations are very chaotic.
Org charts are not publicized per the CEO's mandate because he believes everyone should have an open door policy. Unfortunately, the organization has grown too much, and this policy is not realistic. Every department has an org chart anyway, and as mentioned, there is no open door policy. Senior Managers are not approachable to staff members.
Sales people are king! Support staff (IT, operations, etc.) are not valued. There's always cost cutting efforts every 6 months to a year, and the support staff is always the focus of these efforts. In the meantime, sales people get ridiculous sales incentives on top of their already huge bonuses. The sales retreat is allotted hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, normally at a posh hotel for at least 2-3 days. Support staff retreat is a dinner and a show. Support staff bonuses are about half a percent at best. Not based on performance, but who the middle managers favor.
Morale is very low among staff members, and nothing is being done."

I personally feel like this is a place where you can get out of it what you put into it. If you come here and work hard and show effort and focus on your own work and not what other people are doing you can fit in and be noticed. 

In the 3 years I've been here I've felt that my efforts were noticed and rewarded. Do what it takes to get the job done. 

I've worked with staff at all levels of the organization and at every level there are people that believe in the culture they preach and sincerely care about living it. 

I love it here and hope that I can stay here a long time. I have plenty of opinions on things, but that being said below, what I've gotten and received with First Republic is a result of my own efforts and work ethic.","If you are someone that likes to fake their way through the work day, or spend time in office politics and complaining, this isn't the place for you. The reality is that low producing people will be replaced and that should motivate you to try harder. This his how it is at any company trying to improve and grow. 

No company on the planet has all if its ducks in a perfect row. This company has gone through a lot and is working out the kinks and working through the growing pains. But the future is solid and the organization is as stable as they come. 

Adjusting to the growth and maintaining the desired culture can be a struggle. Possibly a few misfires on the hiring side at a variety of levels. A bit of a disconnect between upper management and staff. Hopefully things to improve. 

The positive spin on these cons is that they are trying to become more self-aware of these issues and working to hopefully improve on them. I've seen some of these already happen and hopefully it will continue."

During this time a lot of effort was put into preserving the culture that Jim developed. Unfortunately so much attention was paid to this task that a few areas of the bank were taken over by leadership that to date only play lip service to Jim's vision and values.  This is most pronounced in the IT and operations areas of the bank, although certainly not limited to just these two areas.  Interacting with both areas has become a painful experience and turnover is such that you never know who you will be speaking to next to try to get issues resolved.  It's clear that both areas have taken on a ""big bank"" view of how things should be and are no longer being led by people who are experts in their respective areas of control.  There almost seems to be contempt for anyone that has subject matter expertise, as when you find someone knowledgable to help you they are either punished for actually helping or are fired (jealousy or making sure high level incompetence remains hidden?).
