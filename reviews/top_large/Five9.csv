0,Five9,Not Bad,2022-04-06,3.0,Sales,"Good product, great supporting teams and teammates. upward mobility when available and when you exceed goal. CEO is fantastic along with other C level executives.",bad sales leadership and strategy. saturated space and saturated teams with high turnover. increased competition in space.
1,Five9,So-so but my team mates are cool,2022-04-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- retirement plan
- Restricted stocks, Stocks purchase plan
- salary loan through Security bank
- wellness plan (over the phone consultation with Lawyers or Psychologist)
- Quarterly bonus","- pay is not competitive compared with other markets
- HMO is not good (up to 2 dependents only and only during regularization)
- PTO for only 20 days (convertible to cash only for regular employees and grant is per quarter NOT per year) 
- management in our department seems micro-managed, always telling you to work hard and have trust issues
- bonus is just so so but at least its something you can look forward to (below basic salary)
- it seems we are an extension of the support team instead of being under the same umbrella as account managers in the US, so account ownership is messed up, US folks can go on Holidays for a long time knowing the PH team are there to assume their role and account."
2,Five9,Avoid WFO Roles in EMEA. I wish I knew this before I joined.,2022-04-01,1.0,WFO Consultant,"I think the salary was at market rate, although I get the impression that the salary is inconsistent across employees in the same role.","Think twice if you’re thinking of joining the WFO team at Five9 EMEA. Ignore all the hype and “great place to work” awards as you won’t experience a great culture, you will be left alone and dropped into projects as they’re desperate for resource. The UK WFO team is a silo and it’s going to take massive changes including a restructure, and a re-work of most processes to solve this.

Expect to work weekends to deploy customer solutions, but no TOIL or overtime.

Don’t expect any onboarding or training, if you get some it will be a bonus.

You will get told it’s a family, it’s a start-up. Work is not a family (unless you run your own family business), and the start-up comments are just excuses for it being a mess.

If you’re joining the sales team, I think you will be fine as they seem to have a great experience."

Leadership treats you as a seasoned professional, trusting you to take care of your business, and is more than willing to jump in and help, regardless of their seniority. You're provided with all the tools (lots of them) and resources in order to maximize your sales efforts. And the team resources provided to support you are extensive.","My biggest con thus far is the amount of internal processes needed in order to complete a sale. Seemingly small tasks oftentimes need to go through an approval process in order to get done. However, I've come to learn that these processes are in place in order to ensure that we're confident and able to deliver for our customers."

90,Five9,Special Culture and Exciting Growth At Five9,2021-09-30,5.0,"Director, Customer Success","From the top down, culture is sacred and carefully preserved.
Five9 leadership makes decisions founded in integrity and doing the right thing. CEO Rowan is extremely in-tune with how employees are feeling as a whole and responds to that very directly and effectively.
The CSM team is a group of top tier professionals with a spirit of service, helping one another and focusing on the customer.
The growth since going public in 2014 has been staggering, with every quarter being a record over the year prior. The trajectory continues along this path with a huge available market and a continuing shift to cloud with a focus on the contact center.
Five9 is very understanding and fosters work life balance, encouraging time off to really disconnect by having an ""out of office buddy"" to care for your accounts while you are away.
Pre-Pandemic, events like Sales Kick-off and President's Club at the beach were an all-out blast. Hoping to return to these in-person gatherings very soon.
Sales onboarding and Boot Camps are the best in the industry.","There are no unique cons at Five9 that one wouldn't find at any contact center / CCaaS provider anywhere else around the globe. Growing pains, emerging markets with challenging regulatory landscapes, and the occasional tech hiccups can feel like major setbacks when they are occurring. However Five9 takes all of these situations as lessons, truly internalizes them, and uses them to drive continuous improvement."

- Even though it can be a high stress environment their is not much infighting or back room deal making between the departments and teams.
- Good benefits, great employee perks

- Internal communications need to be more open too many silos between different teams leads to poor messaging to the customer"

351,Five9,Five9 Phils. Inc.,2015-11-16,3.0,Implementation Manager,"I was able to learn and grow with this company. I was able to exercise and use my skills and talents in project management. If not for Five9, I will not be where I am going now. However, there is very minimal to no career growth at all.","The management team is getting hard to work with. They don't have one goal, one mission. It's all over the place. The accounting department and human resource people are not doing their job well enough to protect employee's interest."
352,Five9,Great Company,2015-10-16,5.0,,"Great company to work at, a lot of opportunities to learn!",None company is great!

355,Five9,High ambition low execution,2015-06-13,2.0,Managing Architect,The company was willing to try new and innovative things.,They didn't have the staff to execute on what they wanted to do. They are split across geographical regions and have no hiring bar. It makes for a rough place to work.

357,Five9,Fun ride,2015-04-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,good insurance and overall benefits,lack of accountability and knowledge on non-technical positions
358,Five9,Hit or miss,2015-02-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"With Five9, it's a hit-or-miss situation. Depending on the team you join and your professional goals, you may love or hate it. If you are not extremely ambitious and just want an okay place that earns you some cash, Five9 is a decent option. Bishop Ranch location is awesome, nice environment, whole foods nearby, food trucks a few times a week. Also, company has some nice events, like the annual ski day held at Kirkwood.","The company doesn't seem to do all that well on the market, that's a concern for the future and it also reflects potential internal issues that are not being resolved. Lack of competence and proper leadership in some teams and areas is a source of frustration. Also, the company is not very generous when it comes to promotions and yearly salary adjustments. The overall attitude towards employees sometimes falls short, especially in tough situations when someone has to leave the company."
359,Five9,Fun place to work!,2015-02-02,5.0,,"Five9 is a super fun place to work. It has great perks and benefits, awesome management, great product, free lunches, ski trips, wellness months, regular company outings, and really fun and energetic people!",The customers can sometimes be difficult but thats any company really.
360,Five9,"Not the best, not the worst",2015-01-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Friendly people that love small talk, easygoing. Company hosts fun events, people seem very work oriented, compensated very well.","Not proper training for people new to the business world. Must seek help outside work to get better at job. Departments are not cohesive. Things take forever to get done internally, and are not communicated well at all."
361,Five9,It's like an extended family,2015-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Five9 going on five years.  I have never been so  happy.  I feel extremely comfortable with everyone on my team.  We all seem to pull together to make it happen and help each other succeed. VP of SMB is awesome.  He will push you if he think your slipping, but you know he wants you to succeed.  My director is great,  always ready to help me close a deal and take care of the fires when needed.  I come from the dotcom era where it was not uncommon to change jobs every couple of years.  I do not plan on leaving Five9 anytime soon.",It is far from my home.  I travel almost 100 miles a day just to get back and forth to work.  It would be great if they had better work from home options.
362,Five9,Five9,2015-01-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good Leadership team.  Company is growing fast.  Good, dedicated, hard-working people.  Nice benefits and company activities",Processes are slow coming around to the growth and efficiencies needed.  Some people are slow to accept new processes and become team players.  Makes it difficult to get decisions made sometimes.
363,Five9,Compared to the competitors I've worked for in the Contact Center Industry....Five9 ROCKS!,2015-01-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Five9 is Agile, Nimble, Quick, Forward-Thinking, and Fast-Paced.  The general atmosphere is very comfortable and supportive.  Because Five9 is smaller and on the growth up-swing, there is a lot of flexibility to influence changes and make a difference, whereas with larger companies, that's not possible.  The Executive Management Team is very focused and engaged. When they say they are going to do something....it happens. They are also VERY forthcoming with the entire organization as to challenges, goals, plans ,etc. WAY more-so than any other company I've worked for. It's refreshing because you feel as though you are part of the Vision and the Operational Agenda.","The biggest challenges are the usual challenges any company who is growing faces. As we bring on a ton of new customers, we need to scale."
364,Five9,"Good company, normal growing pains",2014-12-08,5.0,Sales,"The company has a great product and roadmap, and is poised to be a serious competitor. IMO, we are an underdog that is still climbing our way up, based on our strong market potential. To me, this is a great time to be here and watch the success unfold. The company and management team values work-life balance, and does a lot to foster that culture through activities, free friday lunches, etc.","As with any fast growing company, we do have growing pains. Processes need optimizing, and we could use some training and development plans for the existing teams."
365,Five9,Great place to work!,2014-11-25,5.0,Senior Director,"Started at Five9 a few months ago and love it so far.  IMO, company has a great work environment, capable executive team, and is at the cusp of the next growth stage.","The only con I would say is lack of some of the large company benefits, for e.g., 401k match.  However, that is to be expected from a company this size (and at this stage of growth).  Good news though is that new benefits are being added regularly."
366,Five9,"Great Executive Staff, Company, Culture, and People!",2014-11-18,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"A great company starts with great leadership and Mike is an amazing CEO that cares about his people and ensuring we have a great culture and all else follows when this foundation is set for people to do amazing things. I am a product manager and work with every group and team throughout the company. The one common trait I have discovered is that everybody cares and wants Five9 to succeed because they believe in the leadership and the people in the company.
Company events are amazing and fun. The catered lunches are always fantastic!","Just wish they would bring the catered lunch to the 5th floor since the lines get long on the 4th floor for Friday catered lunches. Other than that, I love it here!"
367,Five9,Lack of Process Hurts Long-Term Viability,2014-09-16,2.0,,"* Compensation and benefits package were fantastic

370,Five9,"OK Work Enviornment, Company Has Potential",2014-02-28,3.0,,Good company that is going places. Promotes work life balance. Nice people. Great CEO.,Some management encourages unethical practices. One sales manager is very inexperienced and does not provide useful training. The manager lacks actual sales experience and pushes for high numbers even when quality is bad.
371,Five9,Depressing work environment for Tech guys,2014-01-14,2.0,Engineering Technology Specialist,"Business is still good, there are some great people to work with",Communication skills is the only thing you need to be successful at any role in this company. Core technical people don't survive in this kind of environment. Other departments try to close this gap and bring aboard people who have no idea what moving parts this product have.
372,Five9,Infrastructure unable to meet customer demands,2014-01-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great company that fosters input and creativity. Huge growth in all areas. Very competitive product.,"Growing pains are causing the company to buckle internally.  Support lacks depth and accountability.
Engineering and development are mostly Russian and are reluctant to break away from build projects to for support issues. customer facing roles are vulnerable to clients outbursts with little infrastructure support with heavy escalations and delays."

All of the departments work together and the CEO is a fantastic leader who conveys his vision effectively.","San Ramon is in the inner east bay, far from San Francisco.  The facilities are lacking in basic services like laundry as well as interesting food options, so employees have to drive to take advantage of those things.  But the community in San Ramon has plenty to offer."
374,Five9,"Five9 has the energy of a start-up, the expertise of a legacy, and the growth potential of Starbucks circa 1990.",2013-12-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Five9 is growing at an extremely quick pace, and employment is growing with it to a very corollary degree. Everyone here is attempting to increase productivity and improve the product and company. Management recognizes that sheer manpower is necessary to do so. Upper management is also extremely involved and concerned with lower level work capabilities and strives to create a seamless environment (ie ensuring projects do not bottleneck at the top).","There are some standard growing pains with Five9. As a rapidly growing company, it is difficult to ensure that every voice is heard, and that the total company culture truly exemplifies what individual departments are putting forward."
375,Five9,"Fast growth, great market- A really great place to work!!",2013-11-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"dynamic, talented team-some of the best professionals i've ever worked with. Incredibly fast growth company, with a great market opportunity.","Some incompetent people were kept in leadership positions too long, has resulted in some quality issues. Company is growing very fast, focus is on the top line growth, and not morale or culture at this point. So many new people make it difficult without clear direction and strategic focus from the top."
376,Five9,If you like cold calling and head bashing go Five9,2013-11-16,1.0,Account Executive,"CEO, Mike, tries his best to make this seem like it's a real company.",Management hired/promoted in the last 6 months is inept and simply put in place to expand in order for the company to go public.  Five9 isn't ready to go public.  We can't keep our solution on-line daily much less support more customers.

-unfriendly work environment. Type where you say Hi to many people and they just look at you
-Not my job mentality - heavy - Trying to engage departments to handle issues with product
-tier 1 to 3 tech support does no troubleshooting
-Tier 1 to 3 tech support can engage All Execs and Engineers in Service alerts, for problems as small as accepting an invalid certificate on a webpage.... basic stuff that should be screened prior to engaging such high levels.
- All the original Engineers are gone, leaving only those stumbling to figure out what is in place.

-execs try to micromanage everyone when they're clueless and just panic.... not good"
