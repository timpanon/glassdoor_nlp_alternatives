“Possibility” of promotion and/or international experiences","I have been at Hilti for over 5 years. To sum it up: This organization hardly resembles what it used to be, and it’s truly sad. I had the intention of staying for life, but it feels that the current environment is just like every other corporate culture, if not worse. 

I’ve made repeated attempts at promotion, but lost to an external candidate or because I wasn’t good enough, even though I met and exceeded the criteria. Folks have been blocked by managers who are bad apples and have been lied to about promotions.

Compensation has gotten lower over time, and it’s not competitive to the market. They seem to disregard their seasoned employees, and instead have a focus on bringing in new talent who they can pay less.

Ideas will sometimes be accepted, but often times brushed off. Too many meetings that are causing paralysis, instead of streamlined decision making in order to define processes.

Their software investments are not going well, and our Global counterparts are difficult to work with, and the customer is the one bearing the weight. They’re essentially paying for beta software.

Hilti has grown out of touch with its own people, and customers.

Favoritism is real here. Promotion by merit sometimes happens, but it’s not the rule."

Good benefits and better if you have a young family. Hilti allows paid time off to volunteer for charity 2 days a year and has good vacation and holiday schedule.,Company doesn't pay for overnight parking of company vehicle due to neighborhood HOA restrictions on commercial vehicle.

The support shown during COVID-19 really shows what kind of company it is. No layoffs were made, communication increased (and has remained that way) and additional benefits supported employees and continues to do so.

Since the previous region moved on morale his lifted, decisions have been made that are clearly for the employees and not just for the bottom line, micromanagement has gone down and the general sense of positivity has gone up

Seems to be more development opportunities, Moment (new system for career paths and feedback and stuff) has given better transparency on possible career paths and despite seeing the effects of COVID-19 as a business, all bonuses are to be paid to employees this year as a thank you for working during covid.

In the past a lot of what Hilti advertised about themselves as an employer seemed to be just talk, but 2020 really showed how close to the people they are and since the arrival of the new region head North America have never been so successful.

There approach to managing employees is good, your doing a great job.","Large number of people within North America so it can be difficult to get things done as various approval are needed. Still a few managers that do things the 'old' way cause that's they way they've always done it - but they are starting to stand out now compared to the new younger management making there way through.

Some senior manangers in the corporate departments still think they're super important and look down there noses at you. The region head takes time to talk to people personally so why can't the head of a dept.. your not that important....."

Layoffs are seen as a last resort and the company is very stable financially. Great culture from top down. Fully transparent in their strategy and leading brand in construction. Excellent products.,Base pay could be better but the total benefits package offsets this somewhat. High volume and fast paced environment can be hard if you’re not used to it.

273,Hilti North America,Poor local management,2021-01-06,3.0,Account Manager,"• Fantastic training and opportunities to develop which is continuous throughout your career there.
•High quality, cutting edge products you can be proud to sell. Fantastic brand recognition helps you earn creditability and get your foot in the door.
• Trust in global leadership.","• Very aggressive growth targets
• Sub segmenting means over 50 reps in the GTA alone (they just keep carving up the pie).
• Better pray you get a historically strong territory. Not all territories and roles are equal. Management will tell you otherwise but those in the field are well aware which territories repeatedly produce star performers and which continually struggle.
• The company places a high priority on employees diversifying their experience within the company. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the consequence is a revolving door of managers who often aren't experienced enough to support their teams, nor invested in long-term thinking. Local managers (for the most part) are essentially biding their time until their team produces results which can help them get promoted. On occasion this means that certain individuals are promoted despite clear shortcomings in terms of work ethic, experience and knowledge."
274,Hilti North America,A Lot More Good than Bad,2021-01-05,4.0,Field Engineer,"Flexibility, upward mobility, and most coworkers are helpful. Hilti is privately owned by the family trust.

They are open to new ideas and provide the flexibility with time and scheduling to allow you to execute your development in the direction you would like. 
The team makes an effort to cross train all team members so all team members can fill as back-up in case of vacations/sick days.
The PTO and benefits are great at Hilti! 
I never feel I am drowning in work and work 40-45 hours a week, out of choice to work extra because I love my job!","Advancement can be difficult if you can’t relocate because of the global attitude of the company. In hand with that, favor is definitely given to those from European countries for advancement before anyone else. 
Many people sit in their positions for 5+ YEARS with their outdated processes. It hinders the advancement of technology and efficiency at Hilti and many large processes are still handled with excel which is a major disappointment.
Opportunity in Finance is very limited by what finance team you are on (given to feeder positions) and if you are lucky enough to have visibility with the leaders. Many people are looked over for projects and find It hard to get development opportunities in areas they want to learn."

There is a negative effect of a hiring surge going on where so many lower level people are pursuing promotions that are very limited in numbers, so advancement opportunities lie on whether or not customers in area can afford Hilti or if they buy from someone cheaper.

The tuition reimbursement was also good.,"The company culture is absolutely horrendous. The management being the worst! They operate based on clicks and who they like the most, not based on who is doing their job and doing it well. Management has favorites, so if you're not one of those favorites too bad for you. You will usually end up with the short end of the stick every time,  you'll get no promotional opportunities or no additional benefits, and they might try to ice you out of your role. My manager in particular was absolutely awful! She had no idea what she was doing, the only way to get around her behavioral narcissistic disorder it's the kiss her butt on a daily basis, none stop, which I was unwilling to do! Keep in mind that most of them are old as well, including my manager, so they have a really hard time knowing how to get along with and manage the younger generation. They're borderline discriminatory based on age and gender.

They are extremely old school in their mentality, and very inflexible. Hence, they set out the path that you will go, as opposed to you as the employee setting out your own path as to where you would like to grow into. If you try to set up your own path and it does not align with what they have set up for you, they will block you and stop you at every step of the way and might even try to get you fired. You also can't even THINK of exploring  other opportunities internally without your current managers consent, otherwise they will blacklist you and you will never be able to advance and no one will ever be honest to you about why that is.

The politics is horrible! And the HR department is a hot mess! They don't have anything that is set, so the gray area is a lot wider than it should be. Hence, they can make the rules whatever they want it to be depending on how they feel on any given day and who the manager is. This makes it so difficult and almost impossible to get anything done, because there's no clear path and everyone in management (including thier parents) wants to be unnecessarily included in the approval process to every little thing.

They also don't pay! They are so stingy, and do not and will not pay you for your experience. they will not give you the title that you might deserve if you didn't grow to that title from within the company. It's truly is exactly like a cult in there, absolutely horrible.

I've literally did my time, graduated with my graduate degree, and then ran away from there as quickly and efficiently as I could!"

408,Hilti North America,Great Benefits and Opportunities,2019-10-11,4.0,Account Manager,"Overall, working for Hilti has been great. The PTO and benefits are awesome, and that’s a priority for me. Hilti is all over the country and the world, so they will do what they can do get you where you want to be geographically. However, if you don’t want to be in sales, your options are pretty much limited to Tulsa or Plano, so keep that in mind.

It’s truly great selling a product that is exceptional. Nothing is worse than trying to get people to buy something that doesn’t perform! I’m thankful to be confident in the Hilti product. It isn’t necessarily easy to sell, but they give you many tools to be an effective salesperson. Training is very intensive (4 weeks in Tulsa, home for the weekend halfway through), and while some of it goes in one ear and out the other when you’re brand new to the industry, if you’re a quick learner, you’ll catch on. 

Hilti also promotes gender and racial equality. Even though we work in a predominantly male industry, my team of nine people is comprised of six women and a female regional manager, as well as some women of color. Many women also hold upper management positions. At the level of GM and global executives, however, it is still mostly dominated by men. 

I find it is hard to leave Hilti primarily due to the benefits as so few companies offer more than 2 weeks vacation and one week sick leave. But take Hilti’s amazing PTO of 3 weeks vacation, 2 weeks health and wellness, 4 personal days, and two community service days, and add to that family leave, student loan compensation, educational assistance, medical and financial advice services, coverage for infertility treatments and acupuncture (new in 2020), dependent daycare FSA, $5000 for adoption assistance, and on top of that, we get discounts to concert tickets, hotels, theme parks, even movie tickets! The list goes on and on.","One of my major issues with the company is their unwillingness to NOT go by the book. They like to stick to their hard and fast rules without looking at the entire situation sometimes. While Hilti really does value promotion from within, they often do not show that they value those promoting from inside to outside sales. If you start as a Level One employee, for example, they are adamant that you can only advance one level, even though you are transferring to a far more expensive region of the country, AND, outside hires automatically get hired at a Level Three. It is extremely unfair to those that have a commitment to the company and who cost the company very little to promote. As they say, it costs much less to retain an employee than to hire a new one. Hilti REALLY needs to work on valuing their internal transfers and promotions. I will always have a problem with the way this is handled.

Additionally, and perhaps this is limited to certain situations and not a Hilti exclusive problem, their is a certain level of buddy-buddiness when it comes to management that makes it difficult to solve conflicts and problems when you feel there is no one above who truly has your back in a situation. If the people causing the problem are friends with the higher ups, why would they? At least this has sometimes been my experience. I hope it is simply limited to my situation and not a cultural problem. 

Lastly, Hilti isn’t particularly comfortable when you want to change your path for growth outside of what is typically laid out for you. If you want to completely change departments, they often are confused and thrown off by such a “dramatic” change. They literally document the typical path options for growth depending on where you start, and they get thrown if you don’t want to go that direction. Not to say it can’t be done, I’ve done it, but there should be no reason the company shouldn’t be open minded to something that to them seems out of the ordinary or off their path."
409,Hilti North America,Plano Software Team (Global Application Software),2019-10-11,1.0,Software,"Hilti is the best company to work for. amazing culture and values, stable no matter what is the market status, respected brand all across the world and they strive to take care of their employees.

With that being said, I have to say that none of this applies to the software team, if you are considering any opportunity with the software team in PLANO then continue reading this review.","Please note that this is my opinion in the Global Application Software team only  after working more than 5 years with different teams in Hilti:

1-Stabiltiy: it is rare to see someone who survived in Plano for more than 2 years.
2-The blame game: for me, some of the managers tend to throw their employees under the bus and blame them for everything wrong in the team.
3-Public shaming:  Some of the PSM meetings turned into an ugly arena of managers throwing their employees under the bus to save themselves.
4-Politics:basically there is a group of old Hilti Veterans in Schaan that even the head of Global Application Software can't touch them, it is their way or the highway.
5-Bullying: in 2016 or 2017 the management decided to fire the entire team of one project and announced that in a vicious way in an all hands meeting. Some managers use this incident to threaten employees of the same fate, I started to look for a new job right after I witnessed one case by myself.
6-HR: it is appalling that HR doesn't investigate why almost 90% of employees whom where hired in the last 4 years in Plano have left Hilti while the group ""of the same team""  in Schaan is almost intact.
7-Nepotism: if the old German veterans in Schann like you then you are safe no matter what you do, otherwise, your chances of staying more than two years are little to none.
8-Work load: I believe some employees has 3-4 projects while others are just sitting there. it is funny that one SME said to everyone days before retiring that no one knew what he is doing in Hilti.
9-Budget: it seemed to me that the last all hands meeting of the yearused to be  centered about budget concerns and the need to defer some projects while excessive travelling and lavish events continued to happen.
10-Bad reputation: Hilti's Global Application Software failed to deliver in several occasions and dragged Hilti into various problems with some customers, the confidence in this team is decreasing which puts its existence in jeopardy if you ask me."
410,Hilti North America,Talks the talk but doesn’t walk the walk,2019-10-10,1.0,Warehouse Worker III,They have decent pay and benefits.,"Hours, micromanaging, you’re just a nobody. They have all these great buzzwords they use like integrity, teamwork, courage, and commitment and it sounds really good. Until you find out that all they are are just words. Their is no teamwork if you’re not a management favorite or you fall out of favor with them. Your ideas are never good enough to be used or if they are they are stolen and brought back later by management as if they were their own. A lot of disrespectful talk to and about employees. There is no set schedule. You basically start your shift and you’re there until whenever, usually about 12-13 hours. There is no work life balance. If your not all company all the time you’re look at as if you don’t care. In the beginning everything was great and then the cracks in their shiny veneer started to show. You are micromanaged to death by an inconsiderate and abusive manager. And god forbid you can’t stay for 13 hours and have a family problem or commitments outside of work you’d think the world was going to end. I’ve heard people referred to as stupid, useless, worthless by management on quite a few occasions in front of other employees. I’ve seen people cry because of the way they were talked to or flat out ignored when they were trying to discuss an issue or present an idea that was immediately deemed not worthy within 5 seconds of hearing it. If you’re not in the inner circle forget about trying to advance. No training programs in place to help people advance. You are expected to know your job perfectly without training or coaching if you make a mistake. You’ll be promised all the help and training in the world but don’t expect it to happen even when you ask for it repeatedly. I saw a lot of good people forced out or leave because of management destroying their spirit. If you can handle being treated like a second class citizen then by all means apply. I would stay far away."

Autonomy is great and my team is amazing!,"If you want to move up you most likely have to move or wait for something to come open in your region. Sometimes I would like a little more challenge.

422,Hilti North America,Good Place to start,2019-08-01,2.0,Account Manager III,Good Benefits- health and 401K. The maternity leave is great if you are in corporate or in management though very hard if you are in sales. If you are young 22-28 the money is not bad but you need to be in a good territory to take advantage.  If you are senior or have a family you will not make the money for the hours you work.,"There is a very Corporate vs Sales Staff mentality. If you are in corporate you can take advantage of the great benefits but out in the field you are punished to take time off. You take a week off for vacation the next week they want you to see twice as many customers. Hilti is also losing a lot of great upper management and experience sales personnel, hence why I said it was great for a person who is young. The constantly rising quotas and the objective promotion criteria is crippling. You can hit your sale goal by 200%.(don’t because they cap your bonus) but if you don’t sell one product that a marketing manager think is important you get a below expectation rating. You have to sell what your customer want, not what Hilti thinks they should use."

Salaries are  average, but the benefits are pretty good. The company has consistently grown over it's lifetime and will probably continue to do so.","A struggle between the global headquarters and the local north america team is often present. 

There seems to be privileged classes of employees at the company. If they identify someone as a potential leader, that person gets preferential treatment, therefore, if you're not identified as such, you are left feeling like a second class citizen. 

When I started with the company several years ago, I felt appreciated and enjoyed working here. In the past year, however, I have had a continually heavier work load placed upon me and I have been passed up for promotions I deserved. I'm not feeling the love so much anymore."

Hilti has some benefits that go far beyond the normal benefits package.  An example is their Student Loan repayment benefit.  Hilti pays $1000 a year towards your student loan.  They will do this for their employees for 5 years.  I don't know of another company that does this.,Unable to wear sneakers on Fridays.  This is the only con I could think of.

When I started my position, there was no regional manager for my region. I essentially was handed a cell phone/laptop/car keys and was told GOOD LUCK! It took 7 months for a manager to be hired and in that 7 months I received no help or assistance from upper management other than maybe 1 or 2 phone calls asking ""how is everything going?"". I was pretty much forced to learn everything on my own, then once my manger was hired, they assumed that I was fully trained and set up in my territory (which I wasn't because nobody took the time to help me get started). This lead to poor performance on my part and they didn't seem to understand why. They do send you to training for a few weeks when you get started but its very generalized and they don't really consider that fact that many territories function differently than large cities like New York or Atlanta."

The culture has significantly changed, this is no longer a family-oriented company. Hilti offers a lot of benefits but they rarely allow you to take advantage of them. Management is out of touch with what goes on day-to-day, don't value employees and tenure is no longer appreciated.  Work-life balance is poor and you are given no flexibility for family commitments. You must relocate in order to get promoted, there are very rare exceptions to this rule.  Be prepared to sacrifice a lot and get little in return."

Training is very good but not as detailed as it could be due to trade segmentation. Management, on the whole, is good but your career will depend on how lucky you get with management. 

If you’re a “yes man” (emphasis on MAN) this is the place for you. Hilti doesn’t care for creativity, lateral thinking, or independent thought. This is a place for people who drink the red Cool-aid and don’t ask hard questions. It’s a dictatorship with no wiggle room. Very cut and dry and very process driven.","Hilti was once an incredible place for a young person to start their career. That is no longer the case. Hilti North America has become a facade: a great culture and bells and whistles hide an insecure foundation of poor product development, agism, and cutthroat sales. 

The first three months are fun. You are paid to train and learn but after that the job becomes just another sales job. Don’t buy into their work/life balance or “culture” sales pitch, you’re being sold an idea that simply isn’t real. Management can be an absolute nightmare and micromanaging is persistent.

I was relocated and scared to death— I met new people, learned construction and sales, and felt like I was working for a wonderful company with brand recognition.","Felt stuck in a fledgling territory. The amount of development they tell you about only exists for the certain few.  You never know what upper management is thinking because as an AM you are not in the know, yet you make the company a lot of money and should be in the know.  Performance is based on spreadsheets — and large opportunity territories will do well irregardless of the person in the territory which results in promotions of people who are fortunate enough to hold down those territories.  Construction performance is largely based on the market which does not exist year after year typically ( considering the forecast ). The company began taking a turn downward and competitors started to and continued to take back market share with no ability to compete on price."
461,Hilti North America,Yikes,2019-04-10,2.0,Account Manager,Bonus is great when you make it.,"Your experience as an account manage will mostly be related to the territory that you inherit as well as the skill of your boss. Hilti is a great company but you should ask what the outlook of your territory is and if your coming from outside the industry find out how your manager trains his team. You will go through a month of training in Tulsa OK with a group of people whom you will find out either walked into territories with a lot of projects and do amazing or people who have to work incredibly hard to just barely hit their number. The salary is very low so if you don’t hit your number whether you are awful at your job or if you just get a territory where there are no jobs happening you will feel it quickly. Every year they as 15% to your yearly goal if you hit your number.

My manager was a joke of a boss and as a human being, he complained constantly and would rather be on the golf course collecting a pay check than doing anything that resembled leadership or even resembled being employed. He would not be able to get a job anywhere else and luckily for him he probably will never have to. Glaring incompetence and lack of intelligence as well as any skills seems to go unnoticed as long as you have been with the company long enough.

Question what your territory looks like and how your manager will support you. Hilti is not an industry leader in any category so you’ll have your work cut out for you."

487,Hilti North America,Follow up Review,2018-12-29,4.0,Senior Account Manager,The work life balance was the best after you learned the processes. Great relationships with a number of other account managers developed over a lengthy tenure. The products are great and fun to demonstrate.,Integrity is absent. Three core values remain. I read the responses about the tenured employment and the lack of turnover.  The last team that I was part of lost 4 members out of 8 within a year's time. Only 1 of the 4 left to follow his spouse's job. Perhaps the tenure statistic is manipulated by posting global numbers. Maybe an employee's departure is not recorded properly if that position is filled internally...IDK. What I do know is that the DM position for a certain division has been vacated by 3 different people within the last 5 years. All 3 DM's left for different companies. This is undeniable regardless of the response that this post will solicit. The turnover at the DM level should be as concerning as the account manager turnover. Obviously the Culture isn't working for everyone.

Advancement opportunities – Hilti has seen double digit growth for several years in a row. To accommodate we are continually hiring and then aggressively developing from within.   
Great management – I have had 5 different managers in my time here at Hilti, and all of them have been incredible.
They really care – Having worked at several other companies throughout my career, one the first things I noticed about the leadership group is that they are not only approachable they care about your personal life as well as your professional development. I have had the pleasure of having dinner twice with the VP of Sales and both times he has asked primarily about how my family is doing.
Compensation – Hilti takes care of its sales force. Your base salary as well as bonus will vary depending on your level of experience. Generally, as a new account manager you can expect a base of mid 40’s to mid 50’s with a bonus potential of around $20K. There are other incentives year-to-year but those are the basics.
With that said we have some tenured account managers who make low six figures.","If you want to promote quickly Hilti is the place to be. However, you will be given sometime extensive projects and will have to move every 2-4 year. Depending on how quickly you want to move up. 
For me this is not a con, but for some it can be. We have a very positive, strong company culture and for some the “cool-aid” can be a little too strong.

Also, the bonus structure every year is getting more complicated and difficult to hit all your metrics to have a positive review with your manager.

Regional Managers are pawns in the system.  100% implementers and 10% creators of policy.
Upper management is pretty fake (directors and up) and says what you want to hear and doesn't listen to foot soldiers.

-Heavy investment in employee development and training, but be warned the knowledge is inherently useless outside of Hilti.","-Intense but close minded culture which is more of a cult than anything else, new ideas are often rejected out right and any changes are accepted only if they come down from the European HQ, luckily they have a brilliant set of engineers and a canny management team that keeps the firm on a steady path.

-Circle jerk culture means that it is hard to come in from outside and have any sort of impact

-The HR likes to paint a glossy picture about career opportunities and a caring organisation but the job is base level sales which requires zero qualification but serious motivation

-Politics and constant customer poaching by senior team members across trade divisions means that unless you have the support of your Regional manager, your career is heading down a dead end.

Which is great for the company - except they disregard their sales employees as a result.    Core values of Teamwork and Integrity seem to be just words now.  You can now step on others, swindle sales from others and still have opportunities to grow. There is a great deal of nepotism in this company, which has become more apparent over the years.

They do promote well from within and it's one of the more diverse workforces I've had opportunity to work with.","It's not a consistent experience from manager to manager. Some managers are definitely better than others at developing their people.

They do take feedback from everyone annually, but a lot of changes seem to be short lived. This could be an outlying response in my region.

They have very aggressive targets as a company, so sometimes variable income or performance metrics may seem tough to achieve for most people.

Depending on direct management, you may have a harder time moving within the company. Being ""blocked"" is a common term throughout the organization. 

If you don't drink the ""koolaid"" and accept the culture, you don't last long.

If you're not mobile you will be extremely limited on your promotions and passed up."

You must try to maintain a work-life balance as the flexible schedule makes it hard to understand when you should stop working.

I was not fond of the travel locations and how hectic the travel schedules were (meetings start early, finish around 5pm, and then there are team dinners).

Company grows year after year despite unrealistic sales plans and phony growth strategies. Why? Because 95% of the guys working here are great guys and they pull this growth through. You will read about Hilti culture on this board time after time and you may ask what is it? It's simple - it's a culture of outperformance and innovation. If you consistently overachieve, you are golden (making money) and everybody seems to praise you. If you just achieve (100%) you are not really well off and you feel like it's not enough. Your 100% can easily be 130% over last year and... this won't be easy to achieve on the mature market. You know this, management knows this too but corporate culture dictates not to care much :)","Your base salary will be often below industry standards, but you can double it if you overachieve or add around 30% to base if you achieve 100%. Overall bonus structure is very good, however it is revised each year. Other companies pay more or much more in base salary but less in bonus, however it can be the same number at the end of the year (I'm speaking about positions in sales). This is true for experienced sales reps. If you are just in the beginning of your career, Hilti will be a better bet for you, because of experience you can gain and... because company grew to love students after university as they can easily start drinking corporate Koolaid without questioning the essentials. Women also have a great chance as managers are looking to hire women to fill their diversity quota. It's sad to tell this, but it's true."

Hilti recently expanded their scope beyond products and service to software, applications, and other digital efforts. I liked that the company didn’t just tip-toe into this endeavor. The company invested heavily by opening a third floor at their Plano North American headquarters solely dedicated just to software and other digital departments. 

The “9th floor” has some features I have not seen at any other company I have worked for. Meeting rooms can be reserved for months at a time for long projects. These meeting rooms have expo boards around the whole meeting room with temporary desks.

825,Hilti North America,Account Manager III,2015-05-29,1.0,Account Manager III,"One of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the construction industry. Selling Hilti can be fun with a good manager and a good team. A true sales organization. Lots of resources to help. Most tools are higher quality than the competitive brands but differentiation gap is narrowing, commoditization has arrived. Average medical benefits. Long term strategy of customer engagement and segmentation is causing steady growth but there are no true innovative products or product lines on the horizon. Sales planning is hyper-process oriented that benefits new salespeople but clearly creates daily “speedbumps” that slows down otherwise productive salespeople to a crawl.","Market share has always been historically very low and will not improve with a 20th century distribution model and a centralized customer service department. I left Hilti for several reasons. At the top of the list was they could not understand a very basic concept that in the construction business time is money. One, two, and often three day shipping will never allow customers to truly bond to the outside sales reps. Hilti products are too far away from the projects and that is causing the costs to buy from Hilti to rise. Customers will buy what they must but customers will establish better relationships with other distributors that don’t charge as much for freight or will drive within a few miles and buy comparable quality off a shelf. After an order is sold, the sales rep has to beg the customer to wait for up to 3 days for the product. That’s ok for shoes and other commodities but contractors’ livelihood depends on their supplies. Shipping charges and sur-charges added to an already higher price product is a major obstacle to growing the account base. Salaries were well below average and the potential to earn bonus never materialized. It was clear early that Hilti doesn’t like to pay bonus or promote salespeople (AM 2-5) because it’s practically impossible to hit targets. The way sales targets and forecasts are established needs a major overhaul. This is an excellent company to start in a career but then leave for a much better company."

Good benefits, decent 401k, company car (if you’re ok driving a rolling advertisement), exceptional onboard training and continuous field sales training, and strong core values. Because of their best in class consultative sales training and their commitment to continually develop and hone their sales force’s skills, Hilti is a great company to start your career, gain experience and use as springboard to find a company that will pay much better!","Compensation is poor, difficult to advance if you're unwilling to relocate,and they have a bonus structure cap.

872,Hilti North America,A great place... if you are in sales,2014-05-22,4.0,Manager (Finance),"Sales is, by far, the most important function that anyone can play in Hilti US. Both recurring and one-time incentives, specialized training, personal development opportunities and recognition are all targeted to the sales force. Sales leaders come from different professional backgrounds, which makes this process richer. Also, a great place to work if you are looking for opportunities abroad, especially if you are multilingual (multicultural, ideally). Willingness and capacity/ skills to try new functional roles (from Sales to Technical Support, then to Marketing, and back to Sales, for example), may be a plus, since employees who understand the business from different angles are appreciated. On a positive note, in the last years, Hilti US has made a stronger effort to show employee appreciation in different ways as well as increase the non-cash rewards offered.","If you are not interested/ willing to go into Sales, your career path at Hilti US could be somewhat limited. Training and development opportunities are clearly not as abundant (or supported) for other functional roles. Also, opportunities may be somewhat limited for those who are not willing/ able to relocate, at some point in their careers, to the corporate headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In a nutshell, if you are not in Sales and/or willing/ able to relocate, this is probably an ""average"" place to work for."
873,Hilti North America,The grass can be a lot greener!,2014-05-06,2.0,Account Manager III,I met some great friends.  Product is well respected.  Training above average.,Disrespected a lot of great salespeople.  PMP process is a joke.  If the field needs to train all the new RM's maybe there not qualified. More focused on processes than growing sales and profits. Willing to let high performers go due to personal conflict.  Micromanaging does not begin to describe the last few years.  No direction for their distributor partners.
874,Hilti North America,Culture is a joke. So is CEO.,2014-05-06,1.0,Corporate,Great place to start out as a young professional–opportunities to gain applicable experience for later when you realize it's time to aim for higher work/life goals and get the heck out.,"Current CEO has little integrity, seems very insecure and requires yes-men. He was like that back when he ran Hilti Latin America, so thought it was a surprisingly bad judgment call on part of the board to put him as head of HNA. Morale results speak for themselves.
With OCJ, Hilti puts the ""cult"" in culture. Spiritual sherpas. Stuffed toys. People dancing in animal costumes. Going to ""camps"" and experiencing some of that stuff was just CREEPY.
If you specialize in a certain area of expertise and not interested in moving to a different area, your chances for advancement are low. You will eventually hit a fork in the road: A) Look for something more challenging or (B) wait to be laid off (I took choice A). 
R&D (located at HQ in Europe) doesn't always focus their resources on fulfilling needs of the market, rather falling into a trap of making something cool that customers don't necessary want or need."

Hilti hires good sales people and customer service representatives.","Hilti’s problems are due to bad managers at every level. They change territories and managers often so you hope you get a good manager that knows the construction business and the Hilti politics.
When my manager gives me a target he can’t explain how targets were set and can’t tell me how to achieve them because he doesn’t know himself. And targets are mostly unreachable keeping me from earning bonus."

Most regional managers preach what executives want them to but privately say and do something else. Regional, division, and executive management is young, unskilled, inexperienced and confused. Hilti is a large bureaucratic and top heavy European company that treats employees as overhead. Consistently pays below other sales jobs.

Employees do not have a say on their targets. Targets and quotas magically appear with no qualitative or quantitative explanation or getting buy-in. You are told to just accept them and then they use them against you when you don’t achieve them. Senior management is arrogant and egotistical and never address the morale problem. Meetings and conference calls are quiet. Regional managers and sales people are frightened to speak up. It’s unnerving. What’s worse is that the division and regional managers I had knew very little about construction or Hilti products to be helpful to there salesmen.

I had a strange set up where I was hired without an opening so they had me help out in whatever territories had a need for some extra sales help. This meant I would be the one making cold calls and trying to bring in new customers while the main account manager did the customer service and managed large accounts.  The person who I directly reported to wasn't really involved with my day to day activities because the territory I mainly worked in was managed by a different regional manager. On a day to day basis I reported to this regional sales manager who was thrilled with my work however he was new to the company and when the manager I reported to directly decided to let me go, he did not put up a fight for me. After bringing in several new accounts and busting my ass to prove myself, I was let go. I had countless positive emails about my performance which I kept and sent to HR. They simply told me they would be having a talk with the manager about the mixed feedback. The truth is the manager who I reported to on paper didn't like me because I am very professional and clean cut, he had told me one day that If I was to make it in this industry I was going to have to fit in better.

I had a terrible mentorship and did not get properly trained to do my job.. Management did not train my manger and it went down from there. There is lots of responsibility put on lower level workers to jump when asked to. 

I found my leadership was very harsh, making it hard to ask any questions. In fear of doing something wrong. It claims to be a different company that brags about how good its to work there. It is very out of line of reality. Every AM in my position all complained about the same thing and wanted to quit at some point. 

Every time I asked for my manager to help about training, I was told about self responsibility. This was because my manager at the time did not know himself. When I made a mistake and told them why, it was never a good answer. Management is not concerned about what is actually wrong. 

There is favouritism amongst employees and it shows through the community. I was transferred and was never consulted. I went along with it and told very little.  This made work difficult because you could not make arrangements to make this rather large adjustment.

They expect you to work, travel after work, including flying and then wake up for 6 am the next morning for a meeting. After the meeting is done, which can be a full day, you have to make the travel back to work the very next morning."

-Very micromanaged - managers are constantly nit-picking about every little detail instead of worrying about the long-term growth of accounts and achievement of sales and key wins in key product lines with key customers - these are the things that actually create long-term growth and sustainability.  This is the huge drawback of a company that likes to manage its people and promote based on spreadsheets.
-Drastic changes to Go-To-Market strategy throughout each year. One year its a huge focus on chasing new customer, next year its focus on top 20% in sales customers.
-Constant changes in territories and customer baskets - this is rather ironic because all the HILTI managers constantly say, ""its the relationships that will earn you those sales and long term growth in accounts""  But they change the territories ever 2-3 years...this is very counter-productive.
-Constant changes in comp plan - sometimes even mid-year
-Tons of ride-alongs from Managers, Product Managers, Marketing, HR, potential new-hires, etc. - I can see the value in these, but the majority of the time these folks riding along do not bring any value to the conversation in each sales call with each customer.  Waste of time.  And there are tons of customers / market surveys that Marketing and Product Managers push onto the field reps
-Constant changes in processes - so, I realize that the only constant in business is constant change, but sometimes I feel that HILTI management and the directives that they come up with are totally contradictory and counterproductive
-Managers have condoned / turned a blind eye on reps stealing sales credits from other reps.
-Culture and values - HILTI touts this as one of their biggest things and reasons to work for HILTI, but I've found that the management teams rarely practice what they are preaching about their values of commitment, teamwork, integrity, courage"

Great product, best in the industry.  Very nice work, life balance.",Pay is average.  Sales plans can be unrealistic at times.  The company tends to have a lot of change in its structure and compensation plans.  You have to be willing to change if you work for the company
930,Hilti North America,OK,2012-09-05,1.0,Account Manager,Great sales training and industry knowledge,Pay is below par. They promote younger MBA types that are grandfathered in before top performers.
931,Hilti North America,Good company with some challenges,2012-08-28,4.0,Account Manager,"Decent salary, great people, awesome products, flexible schedule.  Some great managers.  You have the opportunity to really build your territiory and help out some great customers.  Most account managers (peers) are amazing people I would proudly call friends.",Upper management does not always communicate openly.  The bonus  plan changes frequently in cryptic ways.  The promotion criteria does not put everyone on the same playing field holding some team members at lower levels despite their talent and high sales results.  This inconsistency leads to a reduction in team morale.
932,Hilti North America,"Once a great comapny, now just a revolving door for middle management",2012-08-26,2.0,Account Manager,"Excellent products, brand recognition and good people to work with","Poor pay, poor bonus, poor management. How do you have a slaes manager that has never really sold?"

If you work in the Corp office in Tulsa you will have access to a free gym.","Management are all liars, employees are terminated with no warning even if their past reviews have been good and salary increases are very rare.  The managers will lie to the employees telling them their positions have been eliminated and hire someone else to fill the position less than 6 months later.  The legal department either has no idea this is happening or they do not care.  Employees are always in fear of losing their job because of lack of job security.  This is a very cut-throat company. Think twice about moving your family to relocate for them because if you don't do well you will be let go in no time."

940,Hilti North America,Where did Hilti North America get off track?,2012-05-24,1.0,Regional Manager,"Almost all construction workers have heard of Hilti.
Usually hire good, dedicated professionals.
Change is attempted at breakneck speed, mostly with bonus plans.
A unique business model with a direct sales force.
TE Hammer Drills and DX Powder Activated Tools-A pleasure to sell.
Hilti employees are desparately looking for a credible leadership team to follow. When a better executive management team (President, GMs, and Division Managers) gets in place, working for Hilti will be a honor again.","CEO and General Managers have lost the respect of the sales people and low level managers. The current DMs are just trying to hang onto their jobs. 
Prices are rising much faster than competitors' which makes it more difficult to sell against, especially every-day common items.
Pay is substantially lower than that of similar size companies.
No real innovation and technology introduced in years.
The most rules based and process oriented business in the world.
Many customer complaints on paying freight
Many good managers and employees are leaving."

The bond among the people in the field remains strong - that is the glue for so many who remain amidst the comp changes and the variable initiatives
Hilti opens a variety of divers doors, from jobsites, projects, and offices to manufacturing facilities etc.  It sure beats being a desk jockey on even the worst day
It's a tremendous training ground for other opportunitiies - the skills and qualifications you can acquire at Hilti can be applied anywhere, just have the courage to do so...","R&I's are a hated part of the job at any level.  There is little to no coaching during the process, only berating and belittling.  It's easy to be an armchair quarterback and find the negative among the good; it takes much more courage and true leadership to coach, direct and lead.  Something I didn't witness from the EMT in over a 2 dozen R&I's.  
Distrusting management team who runs the business from a reporting engine...that's weak.  
Reward and Recognition - it's poor at best.  Increase your recognition and morale will improve.  If the morale in the field improves, you might just stop losing market share because your people will actually give a darn."

Hilti has always impressed me with it's high ethics and wanting to do what's right. Also Hilti has always been concerned with the welfare of it's it's employees and being fair.The have a great company culture. I know my mostly positive experience is certainly based on having been blessed with having good managers (for the most part) and that can make or break your experience with Hilti (or any company for that matter). I do believe Hilti is truly interested in seeing it's field sales force be successful and also in cultivating customers and making them raving fans.  It's not a ""perfect company"" by any means and there is always room for improvement but it is by far the best company I have ever been associated with and I am proud as well as fortunate to work for them. I would recommend this company as a great place to work to anyone.","Like any sales job, there is pressure to perform (or make forecast), but that is the nature of most sales jobs and it comes with the territory. There is not a lot of flexibility in pricing products and there is always a push to get more premium for items, even if they are ""me too"" products, which can be difficult in a slow economy. For upward mobility in career progression, 99% of the time it will require uprooting and moving to a new location somewhere else or at the corporate headquarters. I don't know if that is something that can be avoided at other companies either unless you are based in their corporate HQ location, so I really don't see that as a real ""ding""."
