341,Houston Methodist,"Employee's overworked, only patient perspective and money matters",2021-06-10,3.0,Patient Care Assistant (PCA),"Good benefits
Decent pay
Co-workers generally good to work with","Employee's are just a number, we're used and abused. You're often set up for failure and then they get mad at you when you don't produce a miracle.
Ex: Snowpocalypse in Feb 2021 Methodist waited till 4pm to tell us we were on lockdown. Every other hospital in the area called in their disaster team the day before and were well prepared. Houston Methodist however...... We were not allowed to stay at the hotel across the street, nor go to the store for necessities. We were not allowed to leave for anything, we could not even go to our car to get supplies from it without a security escort. The ""beds"" they provided were cots (many broke during night, or were already broken when received (and you were packed shoulder to shoulder in conference rooms with other employees)), or exam tables that were about as comfortable as sleeping on the hard floor. The ""food"" was worse than prison food. Spaghetti with a tsp of red sauce for dinner, decent breakfast, lunch white bread w/tiny spoonful of pb&j with Oreos or chips. People who could not eat that food went without eating. Many people did not even get an opportunity to shower. If we did not have someone available to bring us supplies, we were SOL. Me along with many others slept in the scrubs we had worn all day, and had to continue to wear them the next day for our shift.
All they care about is money, patient perspective, and their HCAP scores.
They take away patient rights and try to convince them that their way is helping them. Ex: Completely alert and oriented patient not on any altering meds, stable vitals, ambulatory, and not a fall risk still MUST have a bed alarm on. If they refuse, it gets escalated to management who then comes and attempts to either brainwash or break them down into allowing the bed alarm. I have had patients from prison say that staying in this hospital is worse than prison. They boast about having a ""patient centric"" culture, but don't actually care what the patient wants or needs. Patients are often discharged too early so they can make room for another patient, only to have the previous patient come back a couple days to weeks later for the same issue that was not fully resolved in the first place.
Methodist wants things their way, and only their way with no regard for what others think or feel.
We're overworked with little reward.
If you get injured on the job, they will find every reason not to support you or handle it. They somehow turn the blame to you so that it is not their responsibility.
No support from upper management, they're honestly just a bunch of snakes. They truly follow the ""customer is always right"" so you get abused on the daily from patients with little support. Management just askes ""What could you have done better?""
They don't actually want diversity and inclusion, or follow their values. It's all for show to draw people in and make themselves look good so they can make more money. If you don't fit in their little box, they will find a reason to fire you.
Any research or discoveries you make while working there, Houston Methodist owns and will take credit for. They legit make you sign a contract for that."

Give quarterly bonus","1. When injured on the job, will find every reason not to take responsibility 
2. Rather than adequately staff units with fully employed personnel, or have a float pool for times of unplanned shortages, nursing staff are floated to any, an every unit in the hospital, to do any and every job, including PCAs and unit secretaries. Like, what does a NICU nurse know about handling the workload of a medsurg PCA? But you are floated all the same, to units where you aren’t appreciated. It would be okay if it was once in a while, but every 2 weeks, to the point where we don’t even want to come to work anymore. 

Also, when you are on call, you are on call for the whole hospital (not just your unit), so you can be called in at anytime to go be a sitter for a. newly arrived patient ,for example, at ungodly hours of day or night. This does nothing for morale, and is the reason many of us have/ are planning to exit."

452,Houston Methodist,Job,2021-03-09,3.0,"Registered Nurse, BSN",People you work with are nice and professional. Hospital seems to care about employees. Bonuses for hand hygiene.,"Hospital culture seems to be kind of cult like.

Sometimes patients get left behind. 
For example ER MDs only have to see a certain number of patients during their shift so if a patient comes in at end of their quota with a long tedious work up the doctor will put them off until relief comes in. Most of the time it’s not during an emergency but I’ve seen it during times in which the patient may have cauda equina and that is a medical emergency that can have serious implications on a patient’s ability to void long term. It’s not as serious as a heart attack or stroke but still has long lasting effects on the patient if not dealt with quickly. Methodist also has a special program for big donors so they treat some people better than others in medical care, which is definitely not right. They even have special customer service individuals that meet with these high paying donors during their stay and are alerted to this fact when they enter the hospital which seems like it may be a violation of HIPA.
Management doesn’t understand mandatory overtime laws in Texas and hold over against their will with meetings after their shift but before report can be given."

459,Houston Methodist,Unprofessional HR,2021-03-06,2.0,Prefer Not to Say,"Great organization, hard work is being rewarded, amazing teammates, good work life balance.","This review is about HR function of our otherwise great organization. HR may be doing a satisfactory job with the technical side (FMLA, STD). However, the disaster comes when HR generalists try to do everything: from the job codes cleaning to trying to be a middle man in conflict resolution. The latter is a farce and “dog and pony” show. Even if middle management is 100% wrong, and it’s obvious as day and night to many, HM generalists will side with the management and will not stop management’s obnoxious, insulting behavior. They will not follow up, they will not provide strategies for the parties as promised. They need education and training on conflict resolution. But most of all, they need to have integrity and accountability that they lack. People who work for HM for 30+ years are wise to note that the role of HM HR is only to protect HR.

Fairly easy to communicate with management
Bonuses a couple times per year (If you don't make any mistakes, EX: you accidentally miss label a lab and you don't get the bonus)
Flexible schedule","Patient care is less important than the HCAPS scores
Business minded, they are all about saving money and don't want to share with employees,
Often have broken equipment that they won't fix (But they can buy iPads for every patient room)
They make promises but don't follow through. (Ex: They say they value your opinion and door is always open but when you go to talk to them, if they don't agree they immediately shut you down and don't listen to you. They claim raises are merit based, but in reality everyone across the board just gets a 2% raise which is like 30 cents.)
Patients have very little freedom of choice during their stay.
One person does something wrong and a patient complains, everyone gets punished.
Instead of correcting the problematic employee, they implement procedures that go across the board for everyone. This makes the good employees job more difficult sometimes, and is also a moral killer."

The main mantra of HM is the pillars of the ICARE values (Integrity, Compassion, Accountability, Respect, Excellence).  It is apparent that this only goes for employees.  Over the past 3 years it has been apparent that there will need to be a change in management and leadership.  Management of our department has gotten away with all sorts of retaliation  when it comes to reporting issues to HR.  HR is only out to cover for the company and the leadership of the institution.  HR are a bunch of lazy do-nothings when it comes to helping employees resolves issues within their departments.  They talk a big game during the orientations that the employee will always be taken serious on issues but it is funny that the only group that is ever right is your manager even when they are caught in a lie.  There is no such thing as anonymity when it comes to reporting issues.  You can report an issue and they will turn it around on the employee and either write them up or try and terminate them based on these actions.  After our annual employee survey came back with horrendous results they came in and interviewed everyone and gave the feedback to the manager and director.  There was not change in behavior or action in our department.  There have been over 4 people leave or transfer out in the last 8 months.  But for some reason this is not a red flag for this group.  One of the things that is very apparent is the experience that the leadership has in RI, and that is basically none.  If this was the leadership of a corporation that needed to see results they would have been gone 4 years ago.  I understand working for the hospital is a different story and is a great place to work,  but steer clear the RI.  I am currently looking for something else"

One physician kept insisting that I should be a nurse (I'm a girl?) when I was there to see how being a doctor is. Medical interns are nice and gave some advice on whim. Nobody smiles back. Rude. This is Texas people. I was a volunteer a smaller burn hospital in Galveston, it was disorganized but 100% better.

However, I think Houston Methodist takes advantage of their kind hearted nature.","- Insurance. RIDICULOUS! They just changed our insurance to one of the worst in the nation via a self funded UMR organization. Our dental went from the highly regarded met life to Delta. We have to pay 10% of our costs ON TOP of our biweekly costs, deductible, etc. This IS NOT in line with other hospitals. MD Anderson pays 0% biweekly, and their insurance is much better! We are seriously becoming the laughing stock of the med center by nurses. Most intelligent nurses and staff will not work at Methodist. That is why they are constantly having career fairs.
- Low pay. Again, laughing stock of the medical center. Everyone is raising wages right now, even Walmart, but Methodist still lags behind. No weekend shift diff either when almost all medical hospitals have weekend shift diff. 
-No room for growth. Management never leaves because they make bank money, because they started back when Methodist was under another CEO who gave really good raises. No room for growth at all.
- Constant construction and expanding, but not dealing with the problems they currently have. You can tell employee sentiment is low when employees are suing left and right. You don't sue a company if you feel your valued. People are suing because Methodist makes you feel unvalued and unappreciated with ridiculous pay and worsening insurance. 
-Name no longer means a thing. It used to make you feel good to say I work at Methodist. Now, if you tell someone you work there, they laugh and say they would never work there."

My experience with this organization both as a patient and as an employee can be summed up in one word – DISSAPOINTING. 

Nepotism, racism and gender preference are visible at leadership and staff level. Bullying, insubordination and inappropriate comments to peers and leaders are ignored and almost encouraged. HR is fully aware and unresponsive to the situation. Annual survey comes out and employees become optimistic for change but are quickly disappointed by the lack of follow through or any action to rectify the situation. Several new projects are launched every quarter to distract from the real issue – bad business practices. The clinical advances the hospital accomplishes are almost forgettable when compared against the internal issues plaguing the organization. Executive leadership and management constantly bypass and violate HR hiring policies. Interviews are conducted just as a formality when hires are preselected for certain positions.  

Dr. Boom shared how he was going to give up his parking space for patients. Such a shame, as employees, we continue to do this every single day and it goes unacknowledged. 

Do something about circumstances or people that are not advancing the hospital. Act. HR, needs to accomplish its role of serving employees. Right now they are non-existent and do not resolve known issues."

My salary is competitive for the area, but when distributed over the hours I work, calculates out to less than minimum wage. I was mocked when I brought it up. Pushing employees to work senselessly long hours is common. 
* Little to no diversity in my department, which only hires and retains chinese men.

However....if you're in a non-healthcare position, that's a different story.

Other departments rarely respond to emails or phone calls.","ICARE values aren't practiced internally - there is a lack of respect shown by physicians and others to any non-healthcare department.  Unparralled is just a buzzword when it comes to looking at how some departments are run.  Some are so filled with legacy people, there's no hope of change.

The pay is not competitive. If you want to grow here, good luck. You can apply for years and contact HR for an update, network, etc. but none of that will help. You really need to have a good relationship (be friends) with a manager or director to be promoted or even transfer. Someone from the outside will get hired before a tenured employee. What is the point of having several positions if you can’t transfer? Having work experience and a degree means absolutely nothing. The irony in many positions is that all you need is an undergraduate degree with no experience, but you still will not be able to transfer. They stress the ICARE values but none of these values are executed towards employees. The mediocre responses made on Glassdoor from a rep are consistent on bad reviews, which should tell you how the company is all talk.

Several bonuses per year for an array of things, including basic hand-hygiene. 
When I was there, there was a program in place for extra bonuses and incentives for those employees that logged the most ""steps"" on their FitBit per quarter.","Perhaps my experience was specific to my research department, but it was (in the end) handled by HR. The regular procedures for employee discipline were not followed in my department, my requests and complaints were repeatedly ignored, and I was never granted an exit interview. Even after I raised serious concerns about the operations in my department, I was encouraged to quit my position, and was black-mailed by my manager.

1144,Houston Methodist,"No room for growth, subpar retirement, cost cutting everywhere",2016-09-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"*Most people here are friendly (the actual workers - not management, not the CEO, or higher ups).
*Bonuses (small - but there nonetheless)
*Job Security
*EPIC was a good decision, even if the OLDER employees hate it. They only hate it because they hate change, but it was a good move.","* ""New"" CEO is cutting costs at the expense of good employees. The first thing Marc Boom did when he came in was lower pay, I kid you not. I have never heard of a GOOD company ""lowering pay"", but Marc Boom has done that. He has gone through and actually lowered the evening and overnight shift difference for some departments. He says its to ""make it fair"", which is the biggest cop-out ever. To make it fair, he supposedly gave people raises to compensate for it, but raises were given out in sporadic fashion, and many people were not given the proper raise to compensate, and others who didn't even work evening or days were given bigger raises. What a mess. What a way to bring up morale. Also, the old CEO gave out Kroger gift cards periodically to employees, and it was always such a nice surprise. It was more about the compassion behind the cards, not about the amount. The new CEO has never given a single extra bonus out, except the usual small ones they give to keep us on our toes. The new CEO Marc Boom does not seem compassionate, he seems like a cost cutting maniac. They continue to build new buildings, but they can't seem to keep decent staff (which is why they are always having hiring fairs for nurses).

*The pay is OK, but not up to par for a ""best place to work"". That is one of the reasons they no longer win best place to work - it started under Marc Boom - once he came in, we stopped winning best place to work. Compensation always says they are trying to make us ""even"" to other places, but it takes them years to give the raises to do it - and you would think if you want to be the best in the nation you would actually pay MORE not that same as other places. If you just want to ""keep up"" with other places, then you can't expect to be the best. 

*Retirement is mediocre. They only match to 4%, and no pension. 6% should be the minimum.

*They make really unintelligent decisions sometimes. They raised parking rates in garages because they said too many employees were parking there. Well, there are a lot of employees with certain disabilities (especially employees with transplants) that cannot park in Smithlands, because the light rail is literally covered in urine and homeless people. Methodist does NOT offer contract parking for these employees, they leave them to their own devices, so they have to park there. Also, there are loads of construction people parking there. Your building a new building after all. Stop blaming employees, and actually do your research please.

*You have to jump through hoops to get health insurance. They make you take a yearly biometric, which I'm actually ok with. I hate it, but I understand it. However, even if your healthy, they make you take a class throughout the year to keep your rate low. It's ridiculous. If you have kids, and have to work a second job like me because Methodist doesn't pay enough, you don't have time to take a class. Especially if your working out already, you don't have time to jump through their hoops. It makes no sense. If your healthy, theres no reason to do a class. Its annoying, and no one else does this. They have one online class throughout the year, but if you miss a time, your screwed. I don't understand why they don't just leave the online classes up all year, so we can do it on our own time. We HAVE LIVES and FAMILIES and SECOND JOBS...we don't have time to go online checking to see if this class is up or not. Have some compassion for your employees."

Their management  style is archaic. Employee retention is shockingly low. Expect to get thrown under the bus a couple of times. Absolutely the worst HR. Mgmt will blame HR to scapegoat why they won't give you a promotion. You'll meet your goals and they thank the team for their help and how it took a team to reach the goals but only the higher positions will get a bonus at the end of the year. Raises don't even account for cost of living. Basically this is how you move up. Someone will leave. It will take two years to replace them. They will ask you to do their job until then. If you don't do it, they'll make life miserable for you. If you do do it, they'll make you do it for years until you max out the raises you can get and then they might give you a promotion-then mgmt instead of looking at themselves will point fingers and blame at the people who leave."

I specifically work in the ICU and CVCU and both of the units work as teams, helping each other, and never allowing a fellow nurse to ""drown"". We are a Magnet designated hospital, the first of the community hospitals to achieve this and a huge source of pride for us. 
Any place can offer you a job; Houston Methodist Willowbrook will offer you a career, and a fulfilling professional journey.","I used to believe I was missing out on the ""action"" by working in a community hospital and not in the medical center.
