46,HubSpot,10/10 - would highly recommend,2022-03-06,5.0,,"HubSpot takes it's culture and values very seriously and it shows up in the way they treat their employees, customers and partners. I feel trusted, appreciated and valued as an employee.

 I believe that leadership at HubSpot from the top down believe that they get the best work from employees who are empowered, encouraged and well-rested. It's tough to battle burnout in a world as wild as ours this past two years, but they do a wonderful job of walking the walk and ensuring employees are able to fill our own cup so that we can show up for others. Work-life balance is highly respected and theres a focus on asynchronous communication to help protect and maintain that balance.  The unlimited PTO supports this and gives me the ability to manage my time in a way that allows me to be at my best.

All employees are asked to use good judgment and are then trusted to do so. I can't speak for anyone else, but this trust is sacred to me and pushes me to do my very best and to operate in a way that is deserving of so much autonomy.  I feel energized to make a positive impact and do remarkable things.

The people I work with are communicative, warm, and people-centric. I feel a strong sense of belonging despite being relatively new and a fully remote employee.","We are growing FAST! As a result, we are shifting from a start up to scale up approach and feeling some of the growing pains associated to making that switch. 

 This shows up in little ways, like not knowing if someone will contact you via  document comment tag, Asana tag, email, slack DM, slack tag, etc. and sometimes duplicating comms as a result.

It also shows up in bigger ways like not always having a clear idea of what success looks like in your role as we tend to prioritize responsiveness and agility over clear, defined swim lanes and expectations.

These are less ""cons"" and more of an acknowledgement that we are a work in progress."

OK Benefits
Can work fully remote
CEO is great","Overall, HubSpot has failed to treat their current employees with respect. There is no internal growth aside from 'lifers' who have been with HubSpot for over 4 years. The turnover is extremely high with 1/5 of the companies current employees open to new opportunities (majority of these people women and POC). 

They promote people based on personal relationships with leaders instead of qualifications. You have to 'drink the koolaid' and continuously post inflated reviews of the company culture on LinkedIn to even start getting recognition.

Compensation is no where near comparable to other companies in the market. They hire new employees doing the same work as current employees at significantly higher rates (~25-50k above in some cases).

They have people taking on responsibilities which go far outside of original role responsibilities and refuse to promote or increase comp. This is something I specifically went through, more information below.

For sourcing specifically, there is a lack of clarity around career growth plans. While management was building this out I was 'kept in the loop' and was given the opportunity to give suggestions and feedback on these plans. However, when the already finalized plans were shared with me, I noticed that it was copied word for word from the recruiting career path. I set up time with my manager to discuss feedback. I had built out a document highlighting similarities and offered suggestions which would be more aligned with the role of a sourcer vs. a recruiter and was told they would take it into consideration. No changes were made. Given I was their most tenured Sourcer on the team and had even been recognized by higher leadership as the reason they decided to build out the sourcing role at HubSpot, I hoped they would be more open to ideas around making this career path reflect the duties and expectations of this role more accurately. This led to many sourcers joining and quickly realizing the role itself was not what they had expected during the interview process. 

**Additional Context**

I started at HubSpot as a contract worker on a one month contract which was extended out month by month for about 5 months. Through this time I was the only one out of 7 other sourcers that came and went who, consistently performing above the bar. I frequently expressed interest in being a full time employee and was told every time that it would happen the next month. It never did. I began interviewing and was finally offered a FT position when I brought this offer to leaders. 

Following this, they hired 4 new FT sourcers which was great given we were able to build out stronger sourcing capacity. When these sourcers joined, I was responsible for training and onboarding them all, getting them set up for success around internal tooling, best practices and metrics. In addition, I had taken on two New Hire Trainings which I gave weekly, if not more, to incoming employees on the recruiting team as a whole. Then we added another sourcer coming from a non recruitment background and was given the task to mentor them 3x a week on top of general onboarding and training. I had no problem with these tasks as I am always open to help our team grow and continued to maintain above average metrics. 

My issue comes in when I attempted to have growth conversations with my manager. I felt as though I was taking on the responsibilities of a sourcing team lead. I was told we could discuss promotions but then was met with my manager continuously canceling our 1:1s and shortening them to 15 minutes. I gave my manager feedback on this and while I know she was busy with many new new hires, I think this is unacceptable behavior from a direct manager. 

I finally decided to cut my losses with HubSpot. While it saddened me because I had been there for 2.5 years and would have preferred to stay, I felt undervalued and overworked."

Company culture expects you to be constantly eager to go the extra mile for every little thing and that plus the ""always-on"" expectations from being remote/flexible can have you consistently working long hours and having to be available on weekends, in the evenings, middle of the night, etc.

I got stuck working on something I really didn't enjoy, but I didn't feel comfortable expressing that I hated that work due to aforementioned points about company culture and that made it miserable to show up to work and be productive.

Compensation is definitely a lot lower than what the market rate is and it is no equitable across the board. Leadership has a plan to be more transparent around compensation but there doesn't seem to be clear expectations on the improvements they are making. Work life balance is ok for some roles but for some departments teams are understaffed and overworking is indirectly encouraged. As much as I believe diversity and inclusion is prioritized, there is definitely a TON of nepotism and favoritism in terms of who gets promoted at the management and director level, and bad managers are not held accountable since many of them have been at the company for 5+ years. This has led to very bad and problematic outcomes. I am also deeply concerned about attrition of BIPOC employees.

81,HubSpot,"Awful WLB, low pay. Diverse execs, Good Macbook",2022-02-21,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* Good tools (new top of line macbook, slack, etc)
* Company will mail you sweatpants
* Occasional fun event every three months or so (trivia, etc), I usually skip these due to workload but your experience may be different
* Top level executives seem approachable, lots of AMA's. Unfortunately I usually have to skip these too
* Diversity in senior leadership including lots of women which is refreshing in the tech industry","* Ratings are inflated by sending out review requests to employees shortly after the initial fun one month bootcamp
* Really Bad WLB, frequently stack ranking you against your coworkers. Comparable WLB to MAANG but at 1/3 the comp 
* Deep prior Java expertise (with Google guice and lots of inheritance) is required. Learning from a different language background will be challenging in the limited allowed ramp up time (approx 1 month) 
* Tasks are not sized beforehand per usual agile methods but rather lines of code are counted afterward by Team Lead to gauge productivity. This tradeoff lets you move faster in the average case but can be easily biased or even unfair (harder problem, favoritism, etc) in the worst case
* Tech stack is about a decade old and primarily Mesos based with complicated java inheritance and messy heap dumps"

85,HubSpot,The HEART has disappeared,2022-02-17,2.0,Tech Lead,"* Genuine focus on diversity, inclusion & belonging (DI&B) at all levels.
* Solid platform infrastructure; most teams can focus on delivering customer value, not writing k8s manifests or how to deploy JVMs.
* Generally friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful engineering community.
* Solid growth opportunities for early career engineers.","* The culture has taken a nose dive since the pandemic started. This is less about events (product experience has done a good job here) and more that people seem to forget there's a human being on the other side of the zoom call. Every interaction is transactional and cold. HEART has disappeared at HubSpot. 
* The company is growing fast and failing to scale. Leadership pushes complex initiatives onto teams without considering all the implications. It feels like they're just trying to pump up the stock price which obviously isn't sustainable in the long term.
* Burnout continues to be a problem. There's more discussion about it but very little concrete action beyond no meeting Fridays and the extra week of rest. Executive leadership encourages us to talk about burnout openly with our managers but since doing so I've started receiving critical feedback. 
* Pockets of middle management in engineering lack management and people skills, but are exceptionally skilled at gaslighting.
* There's been an exodus of senior talent in engineering, leadership doesn't appear to want to retain them (even dismissing the idea that we're seeing increased attrition).
* The hiring bar in product and engineering has been lowered. In an attempt to get more people in the door, we're not assessing technical ability as closely or screening as thoroughly for culture-add. We've hired some toxic people recently simply because they had impressive company names on their resume.
* Politics runs rampant: the best ideas don't win anymore and promotions are handed out to the most visible and connected individuals, not the ones who are most qualified.
* The Tech Lead role is a trap. On paper there is upward mobility to Engineering Lead, but the fact is you'll be so overworked that you'll never develop skills and meet the bar for promotion. There is no mentorship available for Tech Leads."

There are simply not enough qualified managers to oversee these new teams, and existing ones are overburdened and burnt out. 

We are still waiting to see what changes the company makes to compensation in March, but the lack of communication and transparency throughout the process has shown a lack of concern for employees who are on the fence about whether this is all worth it.

I felt a very strong sense of belonging and that much of what HubSpot says about itself was true.

I worked with many incredibly smart and kind people that pushed me to be better and bring my best every day.","As HubSpot grew, and went remote, it could not keep up with the pace of growth. 

It became expected that because you were home and had your laptop you would be online. This ""always on"" culture led to many repeated slack messages and emails all hours of the day. 

The product team especially suffered from severe burnout and bloat. The entire product org scaled at an incredible rate in the last few years while ambitious and aggressive initiatives were placed across teams with little direction or management. I often found myself tasked with a new massive initiative while in the middle of the current one at the time. This led to teams constantly rushing out work to keep up with the pace of what was expected for Inbound.

It often felt like middle management did nothing but rubber stamp these initiatives putting the teams below them in the uncomfortable position of sprinting through deadline after deadline barely keeping up with demand.

Compensation outside of engineering was not great. 401k match was not great either. HubSpot relied heavily on the in-office benefits, but with those all gone thanks to being remote the (very) small remote stipend was not enough to replace them."

I am also grateful for the opportunities HubSpot has given me and for the amazing mentors I had there.,"Based on my experience with management in my most recent position, I felt like I was censored and I do not feel the proper channels were activated. I did not feel like it was safe for me to speak up or even voice what I thought in that environment. I was also afraid of retaliation from leadership if I said anything about this situation, preventing me from doing my best work and leading to multiple instances of burnout and unnecessary stress.

Addressing inappropriate behavior: in the office when we worked in-person, a line was crossed and I felt uncomfortable. Whether this person had good intentions or not, it was an inappropriate action that was taken and I didn't feel safe enough to speak up. What made this situation worse was that I didn't have the resources, tools, or sense of safety to know what to do with this, so I suffered in silence. I know that I am not alone in going through a situation like this."

I get to work in technology.
There is tuition reimbursement up to a certain amount.","I have to ask, does the walk match the talk (re: HEART)? I'd say not.

-Diversity and inclusion regarding religion, medical status, race/ethnicity, and age is severely lacking.

-Customer Support Specialists are responsible for every single part of the product, including all the hundreds of product updates put out in a short period of time.

-The product changes overnight, during the day, with little to no notice or training. Yes this causes backend issues that CSSs then have to deal with and communicate to angry customers. Bugs are often complained about in NPS surveys, which hurts CSSs are their ability to be promoted. 

-There are metrics for everything. It feels like one is being micro-managed. I've heard that being off by a few points in NPS can prevent one from being promoted. Cue feeling like you're walking on egg shells all day long. Even an NPS 8 (out of 10) can lower the score below the goal for promotion.

-Customer Support Specialists are expected to troubleshoot design/code/javascript/HTML/CSS/JASON on live support channels, but the salary is not commensurate with this responsibility.

-Customer Support Specialists are expected to be able to troubleshoot every single third-party application that connects to HubSpot, even if we- the CSS- have not ever downloaded or used the app and can't test it if it's behind a paywall."

For example, one of the best things I ever heard from my manager, ""slack should be treated as a voicemail, you shouldn't expect an immediate response"" -- THAT WAS LIFE CHANGING. To know we all support each other and we know we're all working hard but give each other the space to breathe. It's just different here, in the best way. I'm so glad I had the courage to apply and hope to be with HubSpot for a very long time.","In Recruiting we have a outreach/prospecting number we have to hit monthly - which I am totally okay with - but the tools in place to measure this number are buggy and inaccurate. It's a bit frustrating/time consuming that I constantly have to be putting in tickets and double checking my numbers instead of just focusing on my work.

156,HubSpot,Amazing Culture & People with some Temporary Downsides,2022-01-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- The best people I’ve worked with. Especially for those who strive on friendly competition. 
- Wonderful growth opportunities. They really encourage (and expect) you to get better which is amazing for those looking to grow. 
- I feel connected to the executive team. I may not agree with everything they do, but I00% believe they’ll listen to and act on my feedback.","- The company growth pace is crazy. Designing and maintaining systems that are already enormous and expected to double in traffic every 2-4 years is a challenging problem. This is also a pro if you like the challenge! But no doubt it can get exhausting. 
- Pay & benefits are mediocre compared to the expectations of performance. Engineers are expected to perform very near to those at FAANG companies while receiving significantly less total comp. The work-life-balance does help. At least we’re not expected to work 60 hour weeks. This is the only reason I’d consider leaving. If I’m going to be working crazy hard, why not get paid more for it. To be clear though, I’m still not currently considering leaving but this weighs on the back of my mind."

158,HubSpot,Great place to work but some flaws,2022-01-12,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Very fun office (pre-covid), great culture with great people, interesting and challenging work, flexible work schedule, unlimited vacation","Could use more transparency around salary bands and criteria for promotion, uncertainty about career growth once you hit senior, switched to remote-first mindset after I started (which to some is a plus but I personally very much value an in-office experience and that has since been put on the back burner, not even just because of covid), teams own too many features and don’t have enough capacity to do it all. Grass is always greener on the other side though and I think these are problems other tech companies face as well"
159,HubSpot,Best place I've ever worked!,2022-01-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- HubSpot's mission to help companies grow better shines throughout the org and is something people keep coming back to when making decisions.
- The software itself is really good. It's powerful yet easy to use, and companies can really get a lot of value out of using it.
- Theres significant investment in really smart people at all levels, and in particular at the executive leadership / strategy roles which means we have a lot of really sensible structures / resources / ways of working today and a clear and exciting vision for the future.
- The people I work with are smart and motivated, bring the best out of me and make me want to go to work every day.
- The compensation and benefits feels fair and has enabled me to meet lots of my personal goals outside of work.","- Sometimes the pace of change internally can mean some operational details get overlooked which can mean bumpy rides when rolling out new processes. The good thing is people ultimately come together to do the right thing if a change is needed.
- It can feel like there aren't always obvious career growth opportunities, especially in regions outside the US. Some roles have multiple levels without meaningful differentiation across levels. That said, HubSpot is super supportive of internal movement tries to create new growth / development opportunities."
160,HubSpot,The best of the best,2022-01-12,5.0,Customer Support Representative,"HubSpot literally is the best place to work. Freedom to grow in your role and explore via internal mobility. Encouragement and leadership is 6/5. I feel empowered to do my work well, but also praised for going above and beyond. When you fall behind, the whole team helps pick you back up and it is hard to ask for a better manager.
Work/life balance might be a 7/5, its impressive the support they give their people. Everything you read on their site is true, even after having been here more than a year.","It can be hard to connect in a remote world.

I really hope I can stay here for a long time, and that says something coming from a Millennial ;)","No company is perfect, let's not set unrealistic expectations. But cons are subjective - for someone who likes office culture, the remote-only option in some locations may not be ideal; someone who's not comfortable in a fast-paced environment may not do their best work in an ever-changing, ever-growing organization; for someone who wants to move up the ranks quickly, the many layers of leadership may be discouraging. I, personally, accept that nothing will ever be perfect. But if you find something that makes sense for your situation, then the pros will typically outweigh the cons."

178,HubSpot,Believe the Hype,2022-01-09,5.0,Solutions Engineer,HubSpot has been by far the best and most inclusive and diverse place I have ever worked. The people are incredible and the truly want you to bring your whole self to work. I can't say enough good things about the culture and the onboarding. I have worked so many places where they just drop you in the ocean and say good luck. HubSpot really has thought out the onboarding and trains its employees well from the beginning imo. The perks and benefits are great and I think my favorite part is feeling like they actually treat me like an adult. No looking over my shoulder and micromanaging.,There are no perfect companies and HubSpot acknowledges this well I think by constantly soliciting feedback. I think that because of how fast the company is growing and with how many remote employees have been added sometimes it can be hard to find answers to questions you have. You can't walk down the hall and ask someone. But I think they are actively working on this and it is getting better.
179,HubSpot,The culture is fabulous!,2022-01-07,5.0,Training Facilitator,"HubSpot’s somehow even BETTER than I thought it was going to be. No company is perfect, but I must say that HubSpot comes pretty darn close (based on my own personal experience).

The autonomy and work-life balance are honestly the best I’ve seen as well.

181,HubSpot,"Good company, but beware",2022-01-06,2.0,Channel Account Manager,"-best product on the market
-solid leadership team
-culture is a pro and a con. It's a pro because everyone is extremely helpful and management genuinely wants you to succeed. I'll explain why it's a con below
-pay is decent","-Culture is also a con because it's extremely ""cult-like"". If you work here, be prepared to not question anything and mindlessly chant the company catchphrases in unison with your coworkers. If you're not 100% bought in to the idea that hubspot is the best thing since sliced bread, you won't fit in. Hubspot also makes it clear that they strongly value diversity, but certainly not of thought.. Even in regards to politics, which they intertwine into the workplace too much for comfort.
There is still something of a ""boy's club"" here, but to hubspot's credit, they are trying to change that.

-Because of the CAM comp structure (and direct seller collaboration system), your success entirely depends on the book of partners you're given. You can be the greatest sales rep in the world, channel or otherwise, but if you don't have partners who are motivated, know how to collaborate with the direct sellers, and know how to sell the software itself, you are SOL. And if this is the case, hubspot simply tells you to do better instead of looking inward at the structural problems within the CAM org. Monthly quota exacerbates this

TL;DR: hubspot is a fast-growing, innovative company with an amazing product and leadership team. I'm sure other roles have less (or different) problems, but if you are considering the CAM role, I'd recommend proceeding with caution and preparing yourself for a lot of work/effort that may not pay off."

184,HubSpot,Absolutely the best interview & onboarding experience,2022-01-05,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"I've never felt so respected and valued throughout the interviewing process - the recruiters I worked with (I applied for a handful of roles and interviewed for two) were kind, responsive, and provided lots of helpful context. With each stage of the interview process, they provided information on the people I'd be meeting with, advice on the types of questions to prepare for, and any feedback from interviewers from the previous round. The salary range was also shared in the very first interview, without any awkward back-and-forth. 

I'm still new to the organization, but from day one I've felt supported by my supervisor and colleagues, and have been warmly welcomed onto the team. There are systems and practices in place that prioritize engagement, team bonding, and providing feedback in all directions.","Health insurance options for employees on the West Coast of the US. Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only primary care provider (though there are of course separate programs for dental, mental health, etc), and it just doesn't compare to the ease of use and access that I had with Kaiser, through my previous employer. When I shared this concern with the benefits team, however, they replied quickly and thoughtfully, sharing that they revisit options each year and would consider Kaiser again as West Coast employee numbers grow.

I've heard that sometimes employees struggle with toxic positivity, since there's such a strong culture of celebrating wins and encouraging colleagues, but I much prefer this to the dysfunctional, negative work environments I've experienced in the past."

- fun work environment (more applicable to the in-office experience)
- everyone I work with is amazing and super helpful
- good work has never gone unnoticed
- I truly believe in this product
- work feels like is has an actual impact","- compensation is a huge issue that gets “addressed” every time we have a company meeting but nothing seems to be done about it and is the primary reason of writing my review. Wages, from my view in customer success, are consistently below market. Our maximum Annual raises every year are just on par with the threshold for general annual inflation, meaning the annual bonuses doesn’t really improve the standard of living of employees year after year. The max annual Raise is also only attainable if you are a super top performer who has contributed much to your team. No other bonuses or raises other than promotions (which isn’t much more). But what you’re already in a senior level of your dream job at HubSpot? Best bet would be to change roles. This is part of the culture here now. This should be changed. HubSpot is joining the billion dollar club and companies at this level do their employees better. If you want to retain us, start here. It’s a conversation I have with my manager often and I’m often assured change is coming; but when?
- no annual bonuses
- remote culture has kind of dragged and the culture of the company lost its spark for me
- my position is often referred to as a stepping stone to enable people on my team to grow their careers in HubSpot but I like this position. If it were more sustainable, I’d like to work it for the long haul. This compensation thing is making me thing lots of things. The whole vibe I’m getting here right now is “you want more money? Change jobs but internally. Growth!”"
201,HubSpot,Not all it's cracked up to be,2021-12-22,1.0,Customer Support Specialist,Good health and dental insurance. People I worked with all seemed genuinely lovely.,"They're keen to take on people with few technical skills and no hands-on troubleshooting experience yet they don't give them the extra support they need before being left to their own devices with customers. I would not recommend this role for anyone stepping in from a non-technical background or who hasn't done customer support troubleshooting before.

There was a lot of talk of looking at training worksheets and doing practise exercises ""in your own time"" which early on I assumed meant in between training sessions and tickets but I soon realised that there was barely time to do the training and the tickets so ""in your own time"" was really code for in the evening / at the weekend.

This is not the 9-5 job (with an hour lunch) that they sell it to be. 8:30-6:30 was the norm just to try and keep on top of the metrics and training. When I was regularly skipping lunch breaks and barely leaving my desk during the 10 hours to try and keep up with the metrics, this is when I knew it wasn't the role for me, certainly not for the salary they were paying.

On the first day you're told all about the cool Slack channels and Employee Resource Groups you can join. The reality is there's barely time to do your job, let alone look at anything that sits outside of your role.

During the first week of training there was a lot of emphasis on taking a break from screens from time to time but once into the second week that went completely out of the window and wasn't mentioned again. You're soon on back-to-back tickets/training sessions/meetings with barely time to take a bathroom break."

208,HubSpot,It has lost its luster,2021-12-14,3.0,Technical Lead,"HubSpot continues to be a great transparent company that really strives to listen to what their employees have to say and work to make changes.

I've grown so much during my time at HubSpot, and because of that experience I would strongly recommend the company to someone who is just starting out as a software engineer.","I've been at HubSpot for over 5 years.

HubSpot has been focusing so much on growing the engineering team that they spend little time figuring out how to value their more senior engineers.

HubSpot has not been scaling salaries with the new remote market. Additionally, they don't really factor in tenure when considering total comp, in effect I get the same comp if not less than a technical lead that just joined the org. This has lead to many tenured engineers leaving the company to work for remote companies that give them 20% raises and better benefits, and I'm strongly considering doing that myself.

The culture has also been hit very hard by the pandemic. I respect what the team has been trying to do, but I can't take another awkward zoom culture event. The fun parties and off sites are mostly gone in favor of the socially distanced corporate office party.

My last con is the workload. Given the growth we've had recently we've been hiring new engineers and spinning up new projects and teams left and right. This, along with the recent high turnover of more tenured engineers, has resulted in teams that formed with a majority new members. On top of that, every team has on average two ""business critical"" projects they are working on that involve multiple teams. As a result I'm juggling way too many things."

We aren't often overworked, we're provided with extra learning opportunities and speaker series, and we get more days for rest and mental health/rejuvenation than anywhere I've heard of.

On top of that, most people are genuinely excited about the work they're doing. They're invested in HubSpot's long-term future and want to make sure we're moving the right direction, quickly. It's an exciting place to work because the people care about what they're doing.","There's a lot to learn and sometimes it's hard finding the resources to help. 

Because HubSpot has grown so quickly, the business has changed dramatically during the company's lifetime, meaning internal processes and initiatives change often and documentation is only completed when people have capacity (infrequently). So when you need information about a specific project or initiative, it can be hard to find the right learning resource, aside from word-of-mouth."

- Love the free book program
- Love that I actually can use the unlimited vacation benefit and my manager encourages me to use it","METRICS
- Having to reach 14 web tickets or 23 chats per day + all follow-up cases is very unrealistic to be able to have the mindset to Solve For The Customer.
- Our performance metrics go against the CORE value of the company SFTC. I can't go above and beyond for the customer with the mindset: I still have this many tickets/chats to complete, are you done so I can move on to the next customer? And how can we not have that mindset when we can only reach the metrics if we spend a minimum amount of time on each ticket, as short as possible.
- With the stress of having to meet the metrics, you can't even enjoy team events because doesn't matter if that's team events or meetings, you're still expected to meet that metric."

- As much as possible, this is a relatively large tech company that is not ""evil"", so it feels good to work here from a personal values standpoint","- Hybrid work is here to stay, I get that, but it also feels like no one can be bothered to show up at the office, making it harder to connect and maintain a culture (other than the culture in chat rooms)

My mentors.,"I've been at HubSpot for 6 months and I've never felt such burnout before. The workload is unsustainable and when I bring this up to my manager, I hear, ""Oh that's totally normal, all new hires feel that way."" This baffles me -- if everyone feels overwhelmed, why don't we recalibrate the workload/expectations? I see my team members editing Google Docs at 11, 12 at night on the regular, which indicates to me that the work/life balance on my team (in particular) is lacking. I dreamed of working at HubSpot for almost 5 years. Now that I'm here, I'm realizing that it's not a good fit for me, which is crushing."

There are 3 things that really set Hubspot apart (1) Fantastic management team that puts people - both customers and employees - first. Empathy is a core Hubspot value and the leadership team truly walks the walk. Especially during COVID, all decisions have prioritized employee and customer wellbeing, and I feel so grateful to be in such a supportive work environment. (2) World-class place to learn. Hubspot is a fast-growing leader in the SaaS space and therefore has almost endless opportunities to learn and take on new responsibility. Further, leadership has invested heavily in formal training programs to upskill employees in oth technical skills and leadership. (3) Openness to new ideas and perspectives. Even though Hubspot is a sizeable public company, it still has the nimbleness of a startup. If you have a way to do something better, people will listen and you will be given the autonomy to create change. Such a breath of fresh air coming from larger, more hierarchical organizations.","Because Hubspot is scaling fast, sometimes things feel like they are moving at the speed of light. You have to be a dynamic and flexible person to thrive in this environment."

245,HubSpot,Extremely rewarding place to work,2021-11-08,5.0,Engineering Lead,"Hubspot for me has been an extremely rewarding place to work. If you want to grow your career in a challenging environment where your hard work is actually acknowledged then this is the place. 

I have previously worked in a company where you literally just coasted and got your annual increase. People doing barely any work would get promoted just for time served while the engineers actually doing the hard work had to just wait. Engineers at hubspot are held to a high standard, and if you can meet it then you can grow very quickly. On top of that the development process is any autonomous engineers dream.

Team culture is huge here, toxic cultures are quickly addressed if they crop up and teams are encouraged to ensure their psychological safety is in focus at all times. Not all tech companies care this much about their employees mental health, I really want to stress that. Burn out during the last year is a hot topic and one that management is actively addressing with weeks of rest, mental health services and encouraging teams to take time off and set realistic deadlines.",We’re scaling quickly and not all the processes that worked when we were a small tight knit engineering team work as we grow. This is something we’ll want to address to set appropriate expectations.
246,HubSpot,"Great people, average role",2021-11-08,3.0,Growth Specialist,People you work with are great and unlike other US based companies that have a solid presence in all their remote offices as well. Onboarding and basic training of the product is great.,Pretty cut throat sales environment. Most reps have been on performance improvement plans and they seem to look at it as though it’s a good thing. In my opinion so many reps having had been on PIPs indicates unattainable targets. High volume of prospecting required unlike any other sales roles I’ve experienced - close to 100 calls a week. Lots of sales reps with minimum leads so everyone is stepping on each other’s toes to get good leads in their names. Insane amount of internal meetings. Felt quite micromanaged most of the time.
247,HubSpot,The best place I’ve ever worked. I’m here for the long term!,2021-11-06,5.0,Mid-Market Account Executive,"I get to sell the best product in our market. Amazing culture and smart, compassionate coworkers. Incredible leadership from the top down. Unlimited PTO and sabbatical every 5 years for all employees. 4 months full pay maternity AND paternity leave. Incredible office in Cambridge. High quota attainment is the norm. Stock purchase plan and stock given away for high performers which is amazing!! Tons of contests to win stock which has gone up 4x in value since I joined the company only 1.5 years ago. Also I get to expense my professional coaching which is a huge benefit!",Low base salaries. Easy to make up for if you perform well. The company is growing tremendously which is exciting but I wish they would grow people and not keep increasing quotas. The last increase has been a little challenging.

- Despite the fact that HubSpot has grown so quickly, it still preserves the small-company feeling of offering flexibility to pursue opportunities that interest and excite you. Teams are given a lot of autonomy, so there is always room to learn and grow.
- The company works remarkably hard to create an inclusive community where every single person is able to bring their best, whole self to work. They also invest in their employees, and you feel the impact.
- HubSpot has a remarkably customer-centric culture that permeates everything the company does. It's motivating and rewarding to work for a company that leans so heavily into its mission to help millions of organizations grow better.","Honestly, can't think of any."

- I use and love the product and the fact that we get an enterprise level account for personal use is fantastic. I feel very invested to make a good product as a customer.
- WLB is fantastic. I am encouraged to take time off and I don't feel bad about doing it. 4-week sabbatical every 5 years is huge. Product team also gets 2 weeks of rest a year, one week during first week of July and one week during last week of December.
- A lot of growth opportunities. Teams are kept small (5-6 max) so that there's a lot of chances to grow in skills and lead to help grow your career. If you're looking to advance, this is the place for you.
- Company actually tries to embody the values. For example, upper management was Transparent about ways they fell short in particular areas and are taking employee feedback seriously to make a change
- Pay is good for the company size and market (at least in Product Eng)
- Internal tooling is great. They built their own CI/CD so that devs can focus on writing code rather than fixing a DevOps system. And they have great UIs","- Work is challenging and can feel like a treadmill increasing in speed. If you're not ready for it, it can be tough. BUT there's a lot of things that are changing to help that like the weeks of rest, unlimited PTO, and more
- Homogenous tech stack (can be both a pro and a con). All back end runs on Java 8/11, Dropwizard framework, and the same CI/CD. This is great if you want to move teams but it's hard to pioneer a new technology.
- No cost of living raises or annual bonuses. You can get stock refreshers if you perform well but I personally would prefer an annual bonus determined by company and individual goals."

They have amazing programs any policies meant to raise people up. They grew and hired during the pandemic, not letting a single employee go. They scale leaders and train new hires.","My only comment from a people perspective would be that sometimes the people making decisions about what programs are necessary are more technical minded and don’t have the development experience and hands-on knowledge needed to make the best choice, and don’t lean on the people that do you enough.

314,HubSpot,The KPIs for the support reps are unfair and stressful.,2021-09-25,2.0,Customer Support,"You can work with smart people.
You can choose your working style once a year (remote, from home, or mix)
The pay is not that bad for an entry position (but you should be prepared that high stress will come along.)
When you need a day off, you can take it. (It doesn't mean the work-life balance is great - most of new hires have to work work as late as 10 pm or later and senior colleagues even won't help you much - I feel sorry they just keep asking what you have tried and you'll often have to keep repeating the explanation)","ABOUT THE COMPANY
- Even though the management says that the company cares about diversity & inclusion, it only covers the job application process. I know several colleagues who suffer or have suffered from health problems/disorders due to overwork, and they had to leave (or they had to decide to do so) as they couldn’t keep up with the high expectations. I understand this happens at other companies too, but it is so disappointing considering what they claim they are. 

ABOUT POSITION'S KPIs
Again, even though the company ""cares"" about diversity, all of the support reps are expected to excel at everything - dealing efficiently with all tickets, soothing unhappy customers and generating sales.
I believe support reps' KPIs are unfair.
- They use NPS as the customer satisfaction survey, which results in a lose-lose situation. 
The score is usually used to measure loyalty towards the brand, so customers often send lower scores because they are frustrated about the product or situation (account suspension, feature request etc.) and customers' moods affect the score a lot. Also, customers don't know the standards of the score. (Most customers may not think that a 5-8 out of 10 scores would hurt reps' individual performance score. And we're not allowed to explain how it works in HubSpot.) I believe there should be better and more specific questions to measure individual performance than ""On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend to a friend?"".Needless to say, it affects customers as well. Some reps never take angry web tickets or account suspension and it is understandable: who can be happy about an account suspension and the lack of desired functionalities? So it’s almost guaranteed that they’re going to get a negative or passive score for the ticket, no matter how much effort they make.
- Replying to existing tickets is not counted towards workload / units of work. Also, units of work of live chat tickets are counted as almost half that of other tickets' from other channels - even when you deal with a 2-hour chat. Some customers ask ""Oh wait, I'd like you to check another thing"" several times in one ticket, just like tickets from phone/call-back tickets. Also, you have to deal with 2 or 3 chats simultaneously and you have even more pressure, as many customers expect reps to write something every 3-5 mins.
- They have a KPI for upselling/cross-selling, but you would not get a penny for the closed deals, unless you won the global content (that is affected a lot by the performance of sales reps.)

ABOUT THE TEAM
- Getting a bad score on NPS after making a lot of effort is already heart-breaking. Not sure why they have to expose negative comments on the looker dashboard that everyone sees every day. 
- They don't localize KPIs. Customers from some areas have a higher tendency towards a greater number of replies and additional questions. Also, if you deal with non-English tickets, it'll take a lot more time for reps to gather English information to research docs and file internal tickets in English and to translate information for the customers, but the minimum daily/monthly quota of the units of work is the same as for English-speaking rep's.

- ​While I was there, I didn't feel supported by the manager. They start to say ""use good judgement"" within the month you join and you bear full responsibility if anything bad happens. We (especially new hires) make decisions which is to ask the team leaders or other colleagues before getting back to the customers because we don't have enough experience or knowledge to make decisions by ourselves yet. If something bad (e.g. negative NPS happens) happens, you'll be blamed for ""poor judgement"". In my opinion, ""use good judgement"" shouldn't be an excuse for managers not to set rules or not to be responsible for their teams"
315,HubSpot,Great values,2021-09-23,5.0,Account Executive,"Unlimited PTO, annual week of rest (company shuts down for a week in July and quotas are reduced accordingly!) they go all in with mental health and self care!","Takes a long time to move up in the company, if you want to be in sales, you have to work your way up a very specific path"

Little things like blocking lunch in the cal and flexibility to step away for appointments and kids is a benefit I haven’t been afforded in my past 10 years at other companies. People seem genuinely happier here because they are able to take time off when they genuinely need it. There isn’t a culture of working just for the sake of looking like you’re working.","Equity is arguably slightly below market. No annual bonuses. 

Very high learning curve 

The greatest pro above also results in a lot of inefficiently managed processes. HubSpot is trying to scale and many things are very ad hoc and unstructured without too much formalization. Some level of organization and accountability would help here."

You're expected to spend free time outside of work doing work. No QA. There are a lot of all-hands meetings where upper management spits out propaganda about how great the company is.

Overall, it's a very fast-paced high-stress environment, where an engineer is essentially expected to perform the job of an engineer, QA, DevOps, L3 support, and a product manager, and be as efficient as if you were just an engineer. You'll randomly get assigned responsibility for supporting other teams' code running in production without being given any time to actually understand it."

I am not disappointed, and I can see the honeymoon phase lasting a long time.

There are more pros than I could list, but here are my favorites:

- They make you feel important and appreciated: you receive you everything you need to succeed in your job. Brand new IT equipment, a bonus to adequate your home office, and even send you nice gifts on special days such as your birthday and when you get sick. 

- I was lucky enough to take advantage of the global week of rest.

- The onboarding covers all important topics in order to understand and be part of the culture, such as diversity, inclusion and belonging, working with a public company, legal and security aspects of working in tech, etc. plus, there is always something new you can learn.

- Competitive salaries in your country or region.

- Working from home.

- Internal mobility is encouraged, and there is a lot of opportunity to grow.

- My most favorite part, is the amazing people who work at HubSpot on every level.","- The team culture in Colombia is different to the culture in the US. There are things that can be improved, but it's still a great place with great people. 

- No salary transparency makes you wonder how different are we being compensated compared to our peers in other countries. Still, the compensation is above the average in Colombia, so I can't complain.

- This is a pro for customers (better prices for LatAm!), but a con for employees. HubSpot exchanges USD to COP at 3000COP per 1USD, and along this year the rate has been closer to 4000COP, so all the bonuses and benefits that are translated to from USD to COP, end up being less money that we expected."

376,HubSpot,Amazing place to work,2021-08-03,5.0,Senior Technical Marketing Manager,Its been a good few months since I joined and I must say its definitely one of the best places to work. Onboarding was smooth and there was a clear direction to my learning goals. The projects and benefits all really stack up and make it a rewarding experience,So far so good. None that I can think of yet. Might update this later in my tenure if I find any.
377,HubSpot,Putting the CULT in Culture,2021-08-02,1.0,Customer Success,Office is nice. Product is very good. That's about it.,"This isn’t a place to go if you have experience, it’s a very immature company and the trouble with hiring mostly young people with little experience is it ends up a bit like a school yard. The outcome is some fairly ugly scenes, which are supported by spineless managers which encourages, at best, a lack of accountability and finger pointing, at worst, individual accusations and even worse manager approved bullying.  

Hubspot is a sweatshop and a cult in Dublin, they live together, work all day together, hangout together in the office late at night, so unsurprisingly promotions happen with in these circles. 

Benefits are way below industry standards - office bean bag chairs instead of pension contributions. Health care only cover dependents 50% and wages are very low.

DB&I is rammed down your throat every day but if you’re a straight white male above 35, you’re wasting your time in Hubspot, opportunities won’t be coming your way. Promotions go to cult members who are wholly unsuited to leadership roles but follow orders at expense of others.  
There is an underlying narrative dismantle the fact that IT is a mainly male driven industry; my manager would openly admit the he was only hiring women and on another occasion we had to sit through a man bashing 2 hour training about those horrible men in their 'boys club' being unkind to the new girl - delivered by a female... of course.  

Customers are prioritised over employees, WFH during Covid highlighted this – 6 months before any WFH contribution was made, yet customers were given a free ride at the expense of our targets.

My 3 years in Hubspot were a complete waste, people here a so fake and believe their own hype – it is a marketing company after all."

Managers are very competitive at any cost. Fear and bullying is common! Employees are “gone” overnight. 
The perks are thrown at employees and the talk of mental health supports are there, as long as unrealistic goals are met.
A lot of politics and changes in leadership means that very little gets done because the targets keep moving.
Not a nice experience."

Don’t let the Glassdoor reviews fool you, it’s not all lollipops and rainbows. Different sales divisions constantly gaming the system and stabbing each other in the back to steal leads. Massive amounts of red tape and bureaucracy to get paid out your commission on deals.

395,HubSpot,The investment in culture is real,2021-07-20,5.0,Vice President,"When I joined HubSpot, I wondered if the marketing around their culture was real... a healthy skepticism I maintained for probably my first whole year. Now that I've been there for a while, I can attest that it is indeed real and everyone works hard to hold the bar high.

I really like how we keep the focus on customer impact & spend less time trying to emulate competition or react to short term market trends. The focus on the customer also makes it easy to make the hard internal decisions - we do whats best for customer when at all possible.

As for how they take care of employees, I specifically like how they do consistent employee net promoter scores and then review as a management team (director and above) to take action on any pain we find.","There are sometimes competing priorities that make it hard to know what's ideal to focus on. If we're launching a new Hub, is it important to grow that Hub or more important to make the rest of the platform (5 hubs) more valuable? Some leaders would say the latter, but rate you on the former. Probably just life in the big city, but a single unified go to market engine can create fiction with an org that serves 4+ personas with 5+ hubs in 7 major markets spread across Small / Mid / Corp segments. Whew!"
396,HubSpot,"Amazing Culture, Impactful Work",2021-07-20,5.0,Strategy and Operations Analyst,"Everyone I have interacted with is fun to work with and will go out of their way to help you if they can. Work life balance (especially now that you can choose to be fully or partially remote) is amazing and the company culture truly respects your time and you as a person. Use good judgement and get your work done and no one micromanages you. I feel like my opinion and work product is valued in meetings and the company does a great job of calling out good work publicly, which makes you feel good about it too.","Not a downside for me personally, but team/company is becoming more remote, so if you need in person for your work experience, or dislike video calls, this might not be for you."
397,HubSpot,It's all true!,2021-07-19,5.0,Recruiting Coordinator,"The flexibility and unlimited vacation time are no joke. HubSpot really walks the walk on that one. I came to HubSpot from a very traditional corporate culture so it's absolutely refreshing to be working in an environment without passive aggression, pointless meetings, pressure to not take time off, etc.","I think it can be a bit challenging to onboard remotely in terms of feeling connected, but that's not HubSpot-specific. The office is re-opened now though!"
398,HubSpot,The hype is real,2021-07-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Truly one of the best companies I've ever worked for. Amazing culture and talented coworkers, management is transparent and cares (and provides time off to prevent burn out), and flexibility is unparalleled. Very inclusive and ahead of its time compared to majority of the companies out there. A breath of fresh air in corporate America. The perks are also unique with free monthly books, tuition reimbursement and fitness reimbursement.","If you like to meet in the office and only work synchronously, may not be the place for you. I enjoy working from home and in this hybrid-remote environment but sometimes lacks the same camaraderie- however HubSpot combats this with an awesome line up of events and opportunities to meet other remote employees in your area. Really can't think of any cons aside from personal preference for personality types."

As an employee I feel truly valued and still can’t believe I lucked out getting an Enterprise role at this dream of a company!,"None so far…if I had to nitpick, I’d wish for cleaner data, but that’s a very small complaint. Salary a bit lower than market rate for Enterprise sales, but you get so much more with Hubspot company culture and benefits so it ends up still being well worth it. Also, I think the Corp/Enterprise sales team comp plan is constantly evolving - and so far it’s been only for the better so I don’t think this is much of an issue."

401,HubSpot,A life changing experience,2021-07-15,5.0,Customer Support Manager,"I've worked at HubSpot now for 5 years. I joined as a Customer Support Specialist and I've had a number of roles before most recently joining the management team in 2020. 

In my time at HubSpot I've grown so much as a person and had my entire life changed. HubSpot created a welcoming & open space where I was able to bring my full authentic self to work. as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, this was something that was really important for me, but also gave me the opportunity to really discover who I was and where my values lay in a way that I hadn't had the opportunity to do up to this point.

I've had encouragement and support with my career goals, with each of my managers working with me to help me improve my skill set. When I started working towards management, my VP even provided me with monthly mentorship & guideance when I asked - this isn't something you'd have access too at every company.

I've been given the space to try new things, sometimes it went well, sometimes I failed. I think the important piece here is that I was given the space to fail & learn from it, but I was supported in recovering from those failures. 

HubSpots focus & commitment to DI&B has meant I've worked with people from all sorts of backgrounds - this has been such a valuable experience as it's really forced me to challenge my view of the world and look at things from other peoples perspectives. I've grown a lot as a person both professionally and personally as a result. 

HubSpot has always been fair and generous with compensation, my managers have always been open and transparent around their thought processes, and even considered my preferences when adjusting compensation.

HubSpot is has some of the most passionate, kind, and dedicated people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and working with. It really is true when our leadership say that our culture is our people - I've worked in a bunch of places before HubSpot & its our people that have set this experience apart.","We sometimes struggle to keep up with the high growth that experience which can lead to some teams carrying additional work to keep things moving properly. It can be hard to get approval for new roles as quickly as needed during high growth periods.

It's a very fast paced environment, so if you struggle with this & retaining a lot of information it can be really challenging."

403,HubSpot,PTSD Nightmares from HubSpot - actual nightmares,2021-07-14,1.0,Small Business Sales Representative,The ramp up period at HubSpot is nice because you will get paid your first 6 months a good amount even if you don't close a ton - this is helpful financially,"My old manager at HubSpot still pops up in my nightmares, although less than before. 

I quit HubSpot without another offer as my mental health was at an all time low, and no I was not new to Saas sales, AE life, or upset about the lack of work/life balance. 

My best advice is to read the HubSpot tell all - Disrupted - before joining this company in sales. I have never been more gaslit in my entire career, months after quitting I realized ""complaints"" people were making about me to my manager were in fact very likely fake and used as a mechanism for fear. I was told for months I would get fired, put on performance plan, etc and when I asked for the plan in writing, I was told my metrics were actually not poor enough to be put on plan. It was all fear mongering and gaslighting. 

Hubspot will come across as ""woke"", but it couldn't be further from the truth. I was told as a woman I was too aggressive (it's sales), and people were uncomfortable with my energy and my participation in group sales training as I was without tenure and not at 100% attainment. The day I decided to quit HubSpot, my manager said something to me I can't put in writing, but it was so grossly inappropriate as it related to male private areas. HubSpot is sexist, if not also racist (there are a few token people of color on the sales floor). HubSpot will also pretend to care about mental health and unplugging - the only time I was told to take time off was to ""consider medical leave if I wasn't going to hit quota."" 

If you're reading this and thinking about quitting HubSpot, do it. Most of the people I started with quit within a year (once a fat chunk of their stock vested), and we've all come out the other side and commiserate often on how brainwashed we were to think HubSpot was the golden goose of tech, when nothing could be further from the truth."
404,HubSpot,Amazing Place to Work!!,2021-07-14,5.0,Sales,"incredible people, encouraging work environment, HubSpot is the best!",nothing to complain about :)
405,HubSpot,DO NOT RECOMMEND,2021-07-14,2.0,Small Biz Sales,"Remote option and 
Decent pay","Any positive review you see from anyone in sales either started prior to the pandemic (and be Yamani came to HubSpot) or is too new to understand what they signed on to. 

Quota will go up twice a year. Your territory will decrease twice a year. Demand will never increase. Saturated market. 80% of your day as an account executive will be doing BDR type job functions, but you will be required to sell mid market sized deals. 

HubSpot offer a FREE suite of tools. People will book time on your calendar to talk about FREE tools. Remember you are in sales… so you will have to delete these invites and make a lot of people mad. 

The sales culture here is ATROCIOUS. Zero work life balance. You will be consumed with HubSpot and hitting a monthly quota. If you are married or have a kid- do not even consider working here."
406,HubSpot,"Some perks lost with lockdown, still a great company to work for",2021-07-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Atmosphere: colleagues are all driven and nice, it's a great place to grow with good people.
- Office: free lunches, vending machines with snacks, beer on tap, coffee machines galore, video games, hang out spaces etc.
- Promotion path: relatively transparent for my role, with annual compensation increases as well even without a title promotion. Internal mobility is easy (albeit very competitive) too. I'm told salaries are slightly lower than elsewhere but bar the really big tech companies I haven't heard much examples of that. 
- Resources: You're given the resources to do your job, whether it's tools or the training to tackle problems. It's also very rare that too much is asked of you directly anyway. 
-Benefits: Pension scheme is decent (match your contribution), there's funds available to pay for education courses if you ask, the share scheme has been great given the company growth, health and dental insurance are very welcome, unlimited holidays means I never worry about stretching over my days (I take about 30 a year with no pushback at all).
- Remote vs office: have always been allowed wfh the odd day, but now full remote is an option, or full office or a hybrid. You just need to pick one. Knowing I could move (even country) is great.

Overall, working here has allowed me to really grow my career. I had no experience in tech before, but came through the support team which thought me a lot about HubSpot and the tech landscape, and was able to move on for a new role and skills (like many others from support). I've personally experienced a huge increase in salary too, and the shares have added to that and given me sums of money for a deposit that I thought impossible before. If you're coming from a similar (probably tech) company then these changes may not be as noticeable","- Lockdown: no office has removed some of what I loved about the work and the atmosphere. Hanging out with colleagues after work for drinks, or during for table tennis was a great way for work to feel more social and less of a grind. For some, remote work will be worth it but for me the office was a big plus. Remote work has been handled as well as it can be though, better than my of my friends or family in other companies report. 

- Challenging: whilst you're given everything to succeed there is a steep learning curve. The software is huge now, and if you haven't worked with this sort of online software before there's a lot of general tech info to catch up on too. You'll be given everything you need and so many people have skilled up in the process (incl me), but it's draining learning so much at times.

- Work/life balance: Usually really good, managers and colleagues will stop you working too much. It's 100% not expected to work past 5pm (Dublin). They just gave the whole company a week off, too! 
However it doesn't always work that way when things are busy for you, and during lockdown in particular I think that has slipped more as we're not in the office to support each other on it. That has definitely made things more stressful for both myself and others at times (hence the need for the week off I think)."

Sort of questioning if this is the right place for me tbh."
410,HubSpot,Happy to be here and looking forward to a more efficiences,2021-07-12,4.0,Senior Learning Experience Designer,"The culture is incredibly authentic and inclusive. Reading reviews from HubSpotters on the internet and the talk of feeling that sense of belonging is what really led me to the company. Several months in, I have no regrets! I feel accepted and supported.

The work-life balance is on point. Leadership makes it clear that team members need to make time for their personal lives and to fit work into that – not the other way around.

I am given autonomy to do my work the best way I can, and I'm empowered to reach out for support and guidance when I need it. I was genuinely surprised at how autonomous work is at HubSpot, and it took a sec to get the hang of it, but it's definitely what I wanted and I'm loving it.

Remote/office/flex work options are great. Health insurance benefits include plenty of mental health benefits.","I can definitely feel that I'm working inside a complicated machine. The company is at a place where they're shifting into moving more efficiently and those growing pains are evident virtually everywhere. It's often hard to find the information you need because resources are outdated and cumbersome to navigate. I rely heavily on others to steer me in the right direction, so I'm thankful I have others to help me out! I also find it's sometimes difficult to do my job because there are so many hands in the pot at any given time, and every group has its own vision of what needs to be done. It's something I'm working through strategically, but it'd be nice to get groups on the same page before jumping into projects. This is a bit aspirational in any situation though, and I do consider it part of the job in most cases.

There's also an interesting dichotomy between people who have been HubSpotters for 5+ years and the newbies in other departments (not mine). I can sense a hesitance to move forward with new strategy/ideas/etc with the 5+ group, and sometimes it feels like it gets in the way of getting things done. However, I've seen this everywhere I've worked, and the situation here is certainly not intrusively bad."

Transparency in company communication from top to bottom. I’ve honestly never worked for a company that is so open and honest in what they’re doing and where they’re headed.
A company culture that values the customer AND the employee very highly. They are the shining example that showed when you value the employee, you’re also valuing the customer. Both drive each other.
Great benefits and true opportunities for growth. But keep in mind, your growth is the result of what you put in. All the tools and avenues are available at HubSpot, but you can’t expect to just sit and wait for it to be given to you. You have to take the initiative set your goals and utilize what HubSpot provides to help achieve them.
I really could go on and on, but there are so many reviews out there that do such a better job at articulating the pros of working here!","The only con at the moment is having to see bad reviews of HubSpot that were clearly written by the same person. (See recent 1 star reviews by a supposed current/former SWE.) I can understand leaving a poor review that provides honest feedback on one’s experience at a company, but submitting multiple poor reviews out of bitterness to artificially downgrade HubSpot’s score is a bit childish and extremely unprofessional. If you have valid gripes about your experience and how you were treated, I’m 100% positive Katie Burke would set aside time to personally listen to them and work to make any necessary changes. That, at least, would be more productive than the method this person has currently chosen to use."

-Instead of providing actionable, constructive feedback, Leadership plays favorites and gives feedback based in emotion, typically tied to how much they like you or not.

- If you challenge Leadership, even on appropriate matters like operating models or direction, you're labeled as someone who takes feedback poorly or called a ""bad apple"" (which a colleague of mine was actually called speaking up too much).

429,HubSpot,Amazing place to work,2021-06-27,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"The people are incredible, as is the work/life balance. HubSpot is an incredible place to work.",Major ambiguity around the role and very little control over your own metrics. Lacking innovation/creativity and there's a lot of red tape to do/try anything now in a meaningful way given the size of the organization.
430,HubSpot,Great company,2021-06-24,5.0,Technical Support,Great ethics as a company,Internal mobility is a struggle
431,HubSpot,PR like “The Internship” but it’s a sweatshop in disguise,2021-06-24,1.0,Software Engineer,Good internal tools. No Ops.,"Watch the movie “the Internship” and you’ll get a sense of what HubSpot is marketing itself as. It’s a disgusting systematic tactics to exploit the blooming tech industry with an over-saturation of inexperienced young talented people trying to get their foot in the tech scene.

HubSpot shamelessly markets itself as a shiny big tech firm when all of its benefits are only for PR stunt. You need to be the top 5% - 10% to be able to use the “Unlimited holidays”, it’s not for everyone. The gym membership reimbursement is a prepaid MasterCard that expires after 3 months and you cannot get cash out of that card.

HubSpot is actually a sweatshop in disguise. HubSpot’s JIRA tickets are measured in minutes, and you see tickets estimated for only 15 minutes! You are expected to deliver a task, including find the issue, do the a code change, finish your code review, and deploy to QA and test it, and deploy it production. You then spend a few minutes logging on the ticket saying that you spend 25 minutes doing the task, because you didn’t want to look bad claiming the entire task takes you twice as long.

The entire system is designed to be a ruthless grind to exploit every penny out of their engineers. Any other company would have a much better work-life balance."
432,HubSpot,Very Close to being the shining example of corporate America,2021-06-24,4.0,Program Manager,"HubSpot really walks the walks in so many ways with their values and follow through. I particularly appreciate and adore the DI&B efforts at this company. I find that top down transparency is better than anywhere else I have worked. I have psychological safety in the workplace with my team. There is really not much that HubSpot does wrong. Unlimited Paid Time Off is a perk that workers actually use, with the exception of Sales, really. The flexibility to work remotely is wonderful and modernizing with the times. My VERY favorite thing about HubSpot is their focus on mental health and their willingness to put their employees first in much more tangible ways. In 2021, they announced their first ever week of rest in which the entire company will take a week off to combat the burnout we have felt from the pandemic.

Moving around this company once you are in is incredibly easy to do and nearly everyone does it. This is a huge bonus. Get your foot in the door and move around!","The biggest let down of HubSpot has been discovering some gender pay gap issues. The lack of salary transparency has proven to be because there are equity differences they are not proud of- not just by gender gap but amongst people with the same roles. With all of the values and follow through that HubSpot gets right, this feels like a massive and important miss. I think that there is an opportunity for HubSpot to get radical with their salary transparency and become an industry trend setter. The core values of HubSpot don't agree with this issue being allowed to continue. 

There is also a shocking amount of disorganization that was acceptable as such a small company, but with this huge and rapid growth, the systems needed to keep up. I will say they are absolutely doing the work to make improvements across all departments, but anyone who comes from equally large companies over to HubSpot WILL be shocked."

449,HubSpot,Great company to grow a career,2021-06-08,5.0,Marketing Manager,"HubSpot is a great company! As I have now joined another organization, I can say that the HubSpot name opens a lot of doors on a CV. 
During my time at HubSpot I learned a lot and wouldn't be there where I am now. People are very smart there, and it's amazing to learn from them! HubSpot also has various programs to learn and grow as an individual contributor or as a manager. I enjoyed my time there.
I had great growth opportunities, but you definitely need to put the hard work because promotions don't come easily!","HubSpot is an American company, and you can feel it: regions are most often left behind in the reflection - even if a lot of investments have been made towards regional go-to-market in the recent years. But when times get tough, regions will always be an after-thought from what I experienced. It feels that there are inequalities between marketers working in different regions. Regional marketers don't have the same resources and the same visibility as the ones working in the US, even if they often have to achieve as much with 10 times less resources. 
I also thought that the off boarding could be improved, I never got an interview with HR when I left (in good terms), even if I had to fill out a written form."
450,HubSpot,This company cares,2021-06-08,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"As many others have noted, HubSpot has done a tremendous job of emphasizing good culture and working to make it a reality. It's also clear that the decision-makers care about the things they're talking about, whether it's business-related, social, or anything in between. Nothing is given lip service without the action to back it up, which is refreshing and needed.","As a remote employee, it takes a bit more effort and intentionality to feel connected to the company mission and my team. It's more of a disadvantage of my own circumstances than the company though. They've made every effort to make remote work a delightful experience. We're all still learning and growing as remote work becomes more prevalent."
451,HubSpot,Couldn't be happier!,2021-06-07,5.0,Email Deliverability Consultant,"HubSpot takes their culture very seriously- which means they tend to walk the walk and stand by what they say. 

HubSpot also provides amazing befits like unlimited time off, free books, and hosts amazing events and speakers. The benefits are endless. 

I've always been WFH so I am very impressed with their remote culture- though I understand those who went from office to WFH had a harder time.

It's easy to feel welcomed. So much so, that I cannot image every wanting to leave HubSpot.","There are always areas of improvement - like their understanding of Disability Awareness. There is not an ERG for people with disabilities and they did not have basic accommodations for those with disabilities set up - like captions at meetings - until recently. They are improving this.

It is a very fast paced job and you are surrounded by amazing and smart people, so it can sometimes feel like you're getting left behind. However- this can also be combatted via their development programs and a really great boss!"

Don’t be fooled by the rave reviews here and articles written by ex/current HubSpotters on LinkedIn. Go speak to someone who is/was working at HubSpot in the role you want to apply to. The person should be close to you too in order for them to be honest to you.

With unlimited vacation and access to great benefits you feel as though your mental health and family are a priority. 
It’s an exciting time to be a part of the journey of a company that is growing as quickly as HubSpot.","HubSpot is growing and with that more and more responsibilities are put on our plate. Our base pay has not grown in relation to product growth and I feel that we’ve surpassed the threshold where the work no longer correlates with the pay. In my role in particular the diversity and subscription level of the customers you work with does not equate to a higher pay.  Promotions may take a few years to get and require you to be firing on all cylinders to catch the eye of management, even still the pay increase with these promotions is small. This position is beginning to feel like a stepping stone rather than a career the way our positions have been valued. Given that the ramp to becoming a product expert is becoming a longer and longer road this model doesn’t seem sustainable."

- HubSpot's internal resources are impressive (Diversity trainings, product trainings) 
- A fun software with a lot of possibilities to use internally and with your clients 
- Internal software process is CLEAN - they continue to put a lot of thought in logging just enough data to measure you but not slow you down too much. 
- Great job communicating company roadmap and decisions from top level management
- An amazing place to glean some leadership best practices at all levels 
- HubSpot handled setting up its employees for remote work really well
- They say there's a “a lot of autonomy"" but you'll be so busy you need not worry about this","- The people are amazing, but this role / team does not have a lot of bandwidth to connect across the team. It's easy to feel isolated.
- Onboarding specialists are overworked and underpaid. You can make more money at smaller tech companies - this job is a great way to get your foot in the door in saas implementation and learn a bunch of different business processes. 
- Calls 6-7 hours a day with customers, staying up to date on products in your 'spare time', and contributing to the ""hubspot community"" or else you don't get to be a part of it
- There were so many amazing ERGs at HubSpot but I was so exhausted and frustrated from my day to day I couldn't take advantage of them
- This experience reminded me way too much of college ie. take responsibility for all of your own work, get assigned more than is realistic, participate, make connections as much as you can, but you will be only be rewarded if you're tan extremely high achiever
- There's not enough bandwidth to go above and beyond for most or even half of your customers
- Big company that demands small start up grit without the small start up perks (compensation, internal growth, independent projects, connecting deeply with your customers)
- Lack of support for troubleshooting questions about the product"
514,HubSpot,HubSpot gives me faith in business and in humanity,2021-04-27,5.0,Marketing Manager,"This company truly walks the walk. They aren't getting these awards for no reason — they really do earn them.
I've never worked for a company that's more honest and upfront than HubSpot. I have faith that people will do what they say they will. I have faith that businesses don't have to be cutthroat to get ahead in the market. HubSpot is the epitome of good sportsmanship with customers, employees, investors, competition, and leadership. 
I feel like my role and my work matters for the bottom line of the company. I feel connected and important to our overall mission.
The pay is fair and equitable for the work that I do. I haven't once thought ""I don't get paid enough for this."" and that's a true testament to psychological safety and job security here at HubSpot.
People are truly respectful and considerate. When things go well we celebrate the wins and call out what we did right. When things could be better, we address them without pointing to faults in people. I've never seen this in a workplace before. 
There's so much trust here. It takes some getting used to if you've always had to watch your back at work and walk on eggshells. Nobody is breathing down your back about anything or looking to fire you. You're trusted to deliver and everyone wants you to succeed.","Working remotely is great, but it does have its pitfalls when it's forced rather than chosen. I'd love to visit the office once a quarter, but because of the pandemic, that hasn't been an option. I wish I could see my coworkers more and really connect with them. But I'm sure those opportunities will come soon.
Some processes are hard to work around, like getting access to internal systems."

- Lovely People
- Encouraging Leadership
- Career Opportunities
- Good Benefits + Stocks
- Learning Opportunities
- So much more I could include here, but the general feeling is that they deliver what they pitch during the interview process, and before even completing 3 months on my role I was asked by my manager 'What do you wanna do next?'. I guess this already says a lot about the environment you're in and how everyone around you wants to see you grow. 

I couldnt' be happier with the opportunity to work in such an inspiring company that is made of inspiring people trying to do their best every single day. I can't wait for us to be able to work from the office and hang out Friday after work with some free pints (cliche but true).

If you're a marketer reading this be sure you'll work on super cool projects with super smart people. Tips for the interview process: be your true self, revisit the culture code as many times as you can, and think about the projects you've worked on that showcase some of these values. Good luck!","- Not much to include here, in general, I'm loving the experience but starting a new job from home was a bit of a challenge. 
- The company onboarding was super smooth and organized, the team onboarding I felt could be a little more structured but I'm already helping my manager with the process for new hires."

HubSpot are being very thoughtful about how they scale which I feel will set the company up for success in the long run. I also appreciate their open and transparent communication. 
• Amazing product that customers love. Covid-19 has accelerated the move to digital and this has benefitted HubSpot which is currently in hypergrowth. I feel HubSpot is just getting started and this is an excellent time for those looking to grow their careers to join us. 
• From a recruiting perspective the strong partnership between recruiting leadership, our stakeholders in the business and finance has been so refreshing to see. Becky McCullough and her leadership team in recruiting have worked really hard on building this partnership and it really shows. As a result, there is strong planning in place when it comes to hiring and growth so the recruiting team is set up for success versus being reactive and super stretched all the time. This also has a major positive impact on recruiter work-life balance which I also hugely appreciate and have not seen in my previous employers.","• To be honest, my experience so far has been really positive so hand on heart I've not experienced any cons. 
• I think it's only natural that as HubSpot scales there will be growing pains. Having joined from a larger company, I see this as an opportunity for me to contribute my perspective and processes that will help HubSpot grow better."

Great work-life balance/no micro managing: Everyone works hard but they expect you and want you to mind yourself.

522,HubSpot,"Great company, great benefits, great people",2021-04-22,5.0,Project Manager,"The one thing that has stood out to me is the way this company speaks about the social issues that are going on in the world. They have proven time and time again that they are willing to openly discuss taboo issues that others may shy away from. 

They also are really good at bringing in outside speakers to talk to you about things like life, social justice, goals, mental health, family, etc. 

Lastly, the benefits are amazing: unlimited vacation, 5-year sabbatical, free books program, tuition reimbursement, primary and secondary paid time off (16 weeks), stock","The only ""negative"" thing I would say is that at first, it's hard to really understand what information is really important and needed for you to succeed at your role and what information is just nice to have. Also, I've struggled really understanding the org chart and people's roles and responsibilities. It doesn't seem to be clearly defined"
523,HubSpot,"Great remote workplace, but some leaders need more EQ",2021-04-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"Senior leadership makes positive changes and cares about the company culture.

There are some rockstar tech leads and engineering managers here.

Lots of opportunity to work with senior engineers.

High mobility + flexibility. Engineers are encouraged to work on new projects/teams and to continue learning.

Not very stressful, at least in my experience as a Software Engineer. I pretty much work 9-5 and don't feel pressured to work more than that.

The company is experiencing a ton of growth and seems to be scaling well.","A handful of engineers have poor communication skills. There could be more training for engineers to not come across so arrogant, condescending, or harsh in their speech.

It seems some senior engineers get promoted to tech lead too quickly. I have noticed some tech leads are better at being engineers than they are at empathizing with people.

Not all tech leads will check in with you on a regular basis. This is hard when working in a remote world. Anyone in a leadership position should be trained to check in on new hires more often. Better to be over-communicative.

Base compensation seems fair, but I think HubSpot could bump up the stock reward and signing bonus values to attract more talent."

- Absolute micro-management
- Since they try to show off that they have the best culture, the only way they can do the opposite is by being passive-aggressive. Leads retract on their own statements and have partial and targeted behavior. Giving a code review at midnight and expecting it to be addressed the next day before 8 am meeting. Since they are easily replaceable, they have an incentive in setting you up for a failure.
- Doing the same work every day (this is true for most teams). You cannot change the teams until a year if you do not like the work. And even after a year, you are at the mercy of the reviews of the same people you are trying to get away from to change the team.
- If you are smarter than your superiors, you are absolutely screwed (when I say seniors, they can be the same age as you or even younger, since they can make anyone a TL)
- WFH is a joke. I am scrutinized even if I take lunch break more than half hour, or fail to reply to slack within 5 minutes. Really wish we were in office because I can at least go to the bathroom and may not be perceived as underperforming or just not attentive to work.
- Adhering to best software practices is a forgotten thing

I have survived for some time now but under absolute torture. No use reaching out to higher level management because the person higher up the food chain always wins. You cannot show the truth, if everyone hates it. Do not know when they will fire me, but expecting it sooner rather than later because this has happened to numerous other people., in the same way."

589,HubSpot,"HubSpot is what you make of it, with a high floor and an even higher ceiling",2021-03-01,5.0,Senior Product Analyst,"HubSpot is great. HubSpot is weird. HubSpot is great because it is weird. You're afforded more responsibility and potential for career growth than perhaps is reasonable, but it's what you make of it. You, the employee, will be afforded numerous opportunities to excel. I get to work with extremely qualified yet approachable leadership at an extremely successful company (and I might even make an impact from time to time). I'm just some rando. I don't get it, but I'll roll with it. All of which is to say, ""I feel lucky I work at HubSpot,"" and ""I enjoy my job."" It's been and still is an incredible ride.","You get out what you put in. HubSpot is flexible. If you want to focus on yourself and maintain strong barriers between yourself and work - you can do that. If you want to go all-in and work all the time - well, you can do that too. That said, the example set by leadership definitely points toward the latter as the preferred employee behavior.

HubSpot's culture is great, but it's also all sorts of idiosyncratic. I find it endearing and I enjoy navigating it. I can understand how others might want something more structured or quote-unquote ""normal."""

594,HubSpot,Drink the kool-aid and you'll love it,2021-02-25,3.0,Software Engineer,"Pretty good pay, smart people, autonomy","As the political tensions grew, so did the tensions at Hubspot. You had meetings where you had to talk about how privileged you are for being white, and it was even more-so for white males. This was regardless of your own background, or where you are from.

There's an interesting slack channel there called ""politispot"", which became fueled by emotional rage/hate. You'll see comments in there like ""Alabama shouldn't even be a state"". ""All Trump supporters are racist"", or ""My cousin/sister/dad is a Trump supporter, I don't know how to react..."" with everyone agreeing or not objecting to them. Most of the articles that were posted were essentially click-bait headlines that just riled up everyone's emotions even more. 

Hubspot brought the outside political environment into work. Oddly enough, most if not all of the folks there are totally fine with blanket statements calling a group of people racist, re-training for white people, and other concerning behaviors. Unfortunately, Hubspot still retains its cult-like reputation that was highlighted in the book ""Disrupted"". Perhaps, even more disturbingly so."

I love all the autonomy and support I get to try new things and take on large, vague projects. I'm constantly learning, and if something isn't working out or I've stopped learning, switching teams is easy and even encouraged (I've been on 5 teams, and have tried out tech leadership as well as individual contributor roles). My peers support me, and I feel like they also care a lot about the team and our success. There's physiological safety to voice your opinions and try out new things, even if you're wrong and you fail. There are a few teams where this is not true, but you can easily move off or avoid them altogether by asking around.

There is a lot of emphasis placed on mental health, and taking the time you need to live your life as well as work, which is wonderful. Primary and secondary parental leave are both now 4 months, which is incredible!","There exist teams where there isn't physiological safety and they seem to operate contradictory to the HubSpot way.

Salary was ok","They only cared about metrics. What I learned in training (going above and beyond and really caring about the customer etc) flew out of the window once I started working. All 1-2-1s with my manager came down to ""why is this metric low?"" But no one ever gave me concrete methods to improve my stats? The training was abysmal. My team leader was impossible to deal with. He was a such a negative person that when I had a question or problem I would go to anyone else first because he was so terrible to deal with. 30 days into my job I realised that I had made a big mistake by joining and started applying to other companies.

If you want a job where you can establish a great relationship with a company, have a career and develop professionally I don't think HubSpot is for you. However, if you just need a job to hold you over for a month or two until you find a job that you really want to commit to, then HubSpot works fine as a temporary solution."

Truly an ideal situation, and I'm honored to be a part of it.","As with most growing & scaling companies - change is constant. You have to be flexible and open to it in order to thrive here.

They have big ideas, but haven't actually fleshed out those ideas or clearly delegated next steps, leaving those trying to execute on them scrambling to figure out which way is up.

The design system is powerful, and relatively-well maintained. The pay is above market rate.","Some design leadership is toxic to individual contributors. There seems to be an expectation of excellence without any guidance for growth, and in some product teams, the product managers have all the power. Design leaders will side with them in conflicts and didn't seem to listen to feedback. The worst part was the condescending attitude from some higher up design leaders. It does not allow for growth in a design career on some teams. There doesn't seem to be a sense of psychological safety. A lot of people's reasons for leaving HubSpot seems to be swept under the carpet."

It can be tough to grow into a role unless you have an advocate in the company.

Supported employees with $1000 each during Covid to work from home,"I took a 50% pay cut from my last two sales roles to take this job, because they completely sold me on this job being fun, exciting, low stress, and a great atmosphere. None of that is remotely true. 

This job is a constant marathon that you can't ever finish. I wake up every day miserable, wake up all throughout the night in anxiety sweats and panicking about work the next morning. I haven't had a minute where I have felt good or confident about this job since I started. The numbers are too high, and the expectations are ridiculous. Starting this job remotely has been a nightmare. 

If I stay in this role I will have a heart attack in the next year or two. It is absolutely ruining my relationship. I am so stressed out that I snap at my loved ones who are just trying to help. 

I feel completely trapped here because of COVID, and would love nothing more an another option. Any other option. I would gladly cut my pay in half AGAIN to have any semblance of quality of life. One of these days I will drop dead at this desk, and HubSpot will fill my seat with another.

I refuse to refer anyone to HubSpot as I firmly believe taking a role at HubSpot is the worst move anyone in sales could make for their careers. Before HubSpot, I lived every day with joy and energy and passion. My life has been utterly awful since starting this job. HubSpot has sucked every last ounce of life out of me."

This empowers employees to grow, learn and develop their skills to move on to the next stage in their career.
Another point that is truly aligned with the company culture is that people are the best perks. Everyone who works at HubSpot is nice, friendly, insightful, and resourceful. Everyone is very collaborative and open to share their experiences and knowledge to help you grow.","It is an American based company, which means, although there are other offices around the world, the culture is very US oriented, which sometimes doesn't feel inclusive if you're a EMEA based employee or an APAC based employee."

I’m so thrilled I got hired here, it’s finally a company that doesn’t treat you like just another number. My on boarding process was great, and I’m impressed with the organization and resources available to employees. With that being said, it’s not an easy job and you will feel overwhelmed with the product knowledge and tons of information you need to get accustomed to.

Depending on your previous skills you might have an advantage if you know design and css well, SEO, worked with analytics before , have ever run a blog and know about networking (DNS, domain management, redirects etc). These are all possible cases you have to troubleshoot and prior knowledge will make life easier for you.

My own portal to test features and use the product is a definite Pro - how awesome is that?

Tip: Take advantage of the courses in the academy, these are free for everyone. Continue to grow your knowledge and don’t let the pressure get to you. Don’t sacrifice your work life balance, cut your lunch short etc. even if you may not reach your goal. Crush harder on another day.","More one on one support during ramp and for new hires, resources are great, hands on support is better"

I started in customer support (entry level HubSpotter) with a liberal arts degree and no tech knowledge. The job had its stress--answering customer calls without even knowing the platform--but there are great processes and resources set up to make sure you get the help you need. Now, I truly enjoy the troubleshooting I get to do, have time to take the free coding classes, and work with incredible people.","The onboarding process for support specialists feels like building the airplane while flying it. You learn on the job, which can be stressful at times, but after ~5 months you get to the other side of the curve and can really invest in learning how software works."

The great reviews on here may seem somewhat forced, but they're truly evidence of years of hard work by an amazing People Ops team led by Katie Burke. I was skeptical coming in that it would not live up to its hype, but I've been very surprised that even during Covid-19 and the subsequent shift in our working environment, I still feel excited and happy to ""come in"" to work every day. I feel like my work is valued, and I feel like my time is respected (my hours are flexible and I don't feel forced to work when it isn't necessary). I'm working with some amazing people and I can't wait to see what the next few years are like!","Onboarding was a bit difficult during Covid-19 and I was disappointed by it.

Believing in our product and our mission is easy, but it's the people that make my job meaningful. HubSpot is filled with a diverse range of employees from all around the world working towards a single goal. As we've grown and scaled one of the areas we have continued to thrive is hiring top talent. Not only do we hire top performers and leaders we hire people that are kind, trustworthy, and empathetic. The feeling of camaraderie and belonging is authentic and represents the values that are important to me outside of work. 

I'm most proud of our focus on LGBTQ+ initiatives. The HubSpot LGBTQ Alliance celebrates Pride year-round with a variety of global initiatives for both employees and strangers. These programs create a more inclusive work environment, hiring pool and make me proud to call HubSpot my employer.","We're mostly working from home these days, I really miss our office.

Wish the company showed the same level of compassion to their employees that they did to their customers and prospects during COVID. 

If you want to drive change within a company and truly stand out, this is not the place. Tenured AE's are there for a reason - they got in when HubSpot was still a scrappy startup and they've made a truckload of money after the IPO. If you're a new rep, good luck seeing that level of financial success - and they WILL lay you off if you're not hitting your numbers."

761,HubSpot,Amazing culture and leadership,2020-10-13,5.0,User Experience Researcher,"I cannot say enough about HubSpot's culture & leadership. I am continously impressed and feel grateful to work here. 
 
- Customer centric: leadership and product truly care about customers and making the best experiences for them. Leadership (CEO, CTO etc) constantly appreciate engineering as well as UX efforts and trust employees/teams to design the tools for our customers. Leadership makes an effort to highlight customers and learn from them 

- Amazing leadership: Leadership treats you as a human first, an employee second. Obviously they want you to get your work done, but they are empathetic (especially in these times) and build out a culture that invests in employees and gives them the support, education & programming they need to be successful 

- Transparent/Thoughtful crisis response: It's no secret that 2020 has been an insanely hard year for many. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, leadership has given regular updates and kept employees in the know about what is happening. That's no small feat, given we are a global organization and countries are all making different decisions. They did not shy away from tough conversations, and were transparent with us in all of their plans on how to move through this time. They are ahead of the curve in announcing what the future of work will look like post-pandemic, and giving multiple options to employees so each person can freely choose what is best for them. On top of that, with the social justice issues we are facing specifically in the US, leadership has taken a strong and necessary stance on investing in DI&B efforts (not just saying they will, but highlighting their action plan, reporting on diversity hiring etc) and standing by Black employees during these painful times. We have a new required training around racism in the US, they have made donations to the Equal Justice Initiative and more. HubSpot is actively trying to help employees be better people and make our communities better for everyone. They acknowledge that they still have more work to do. 

I was at a previous company for a number of years, that I had loved, but it was my first job out of college. Coming to HubSpot opened my eyes to what true leadership is, what it looks like when companies actively invest in employees, and what it means to be a socially conscious company.","HubSpot is a large company and our Product team is enormous (which is also a good thing!). Sometimes things move quickly, or change, and it can be easy to be siloed or not have all of the information. This is a challenge, but honestly does not impact my feeling on HubSpot overall. I also think this is something our teams can be equipped to work through"

763,HubSpot,"Great executive management, product strategy and future of the product",2020-10-11,5.0,Manager,"HubSpot continues to execute exceedingly well, and has been growing very well, even several years after going public. The product is getting really good, and the people are great to work with. 

Additionally, it’s a company that generally encourages you to just be a better person - from the Culture Code to recent programming teaching how to be anti-racist - cultural initiatives arent just standard corporate lip service.","There’s recently been a lot of external management hiring, focusing on ‘those who have seen the movie’. This works for executive hiring, but there’s been less of a focus on upward promotion as many orgs have stayed quite flat, while externally hired managers have had mixed success."

790,HubSpot,Lives Up To The Hype,2020-09-08,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"HubSpot has a fantastic reputation that is well-deserved. Having worked at a few companies (both in and out of the tech space) prior to coming to HubSpot, I can truly say I hope to never leave. 

A few standouts for me:

- Transparency. From the C-Suite down, everyone at HubSpot is open to sharing information, collecting and actioning feedback, and owning up to growth opportunities. 
- Customers. As a CSM, much of my time is spent working directly with HubSpot. My customers are fun and challenging to work with, and I've grown as a consultant in my time here.
- Work-Life Balance. I'm encouraged to take time when I need to, and leadership practices what they preach here. It's helpful to see everyone take time when they need it, as that reinforces the intention behind benefits like unlimited vacation.
- COVID-19 Response. You can't leave a review in 2020 without mentioning COVID, right? The support leadership has shown through thoughtful programs, WFH reimbursement, and flexibility has been next level.",Internal mobility within the CSM org can feel rigid at times.
791,HubSpot,Hypocritical concerns of approach versus reality,2020-09-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are incredible, talented, smart, and supportive",The actions of the individuals are hypocritical to the company's messaging - using ZoomInfo is very anti-inbound

However, your teams want you to succeed so don't hesitate asking for guidance and tips on getting organized when starting."

796,HubSpot,Lucky to be here!,2020-08-28,5.0,Sales,"I've worked at HubSpot for 3 years and so grateful for my experience here. Pre-Covid when we were in the office every day, I thrived in the culture and loved the dynamic of the workplace, as well as the autonomy. I was a little nervous when we all started working from home, but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how mindful and amazing our leadership team has been. From all the precautions they took right away, to how quickly they have been able to adapt and shift given the circumstances, to the fact that no matter what our well being has been top of mind. I'm really excited about the new remote options, and grateful for the flex option that is being provided.",The main con being in sales is the monthly quota vs. a quarterly quota. Monthly adds a lot of additional stress to an already high paced role.
797,HubSpot,Transparent and genuine,2020-08-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love the fact that if I want to, I can read the thought process behind every major decision we make as a company. Over my 10 years at Hubspot it's what has kept me going - senior leadership makes great long term decisions and shows their work, allowing people like me to plan longer term projects to align with company vision and wrap my head around why we make certain calls","At times the fast pace of change can result in some ambiguity and grey area between roles. Depending on the job you are looking at, you may need to be comfortable with that ."

801,HubSpot,Company is set up well for the next phase,2020-08-25,5.0,Strategy,"HubSpot is set up well for it's next chapter of growth. 

The company has been able to evolve from a Marketing hub + fully inside sales model to a full growth suite + freemium go-to-market that sets a strong foundation for the next 5 to 10 years. To get there, HubSpot has taken a strong build-oriented approach that stands in stark contrast to some of its peers. It's exciting to watch the pace and quality of the innovation coming from that group. 

Adding Yamini as the Chief Customer Officer has been a great fit both in terms of leadership style and experience. 

Finally, Katie Burke as our Chief People Office has navigated us through the pandemic and shift to remote work better and more smoothly than I could have imagined. She's an inspirational leader for HubSpot and we're lucky to have her. 

Exciting times ahead.","As with any company, as HubSpot grows and scales it needs to reinvent itself and its operating system. Sometimes those changes come with speedbumps -- either because there is fog around a specific decision, or the systems aren't read to handle a change. HubSpot has been good at owning those, and course-correcting quickly -- but it will happen."
802,HubSpot,Its set up well to succeed,2020-08-24,5.0,Executive,"The company has done well over the years, but is particularly well set up to succeed going forward. It has become much more customer-centric and that is paying off. Its made deep product investments that are paying off. 

The company takes culture very seriously. It talks the talk and walks the walk on culture. It has made some nice enhancements to its culture in the last couple of months in the face of Black Lives Matter and Covid.

I'm proud to work here.",It's probably not for everyone. The company has very high for itself and its employees. It expects excellent performance.
803,HubSpot,Biased culture & opportunities depending on one's situation & role,2020-08-24,3.0,Engineer,"- Unlimited PTO
- Supportive of different people's work-life balance. 
- Frequent company and team AMAs, especially since COVID
- Lots of support, merit, and acknowledgement if you're an engineer, PM, or designer within the product org. Other roles, not at all.
- People do care about movements such as BLM, mental health, COVID","- Prides themselves on the HubSpot culture code (HEART), but HubSpot really isn't ""Humble"". The product team has a very marketing-esque (with cheering) monthly meeting. And there's a lot of hype to promote HubSpot. Humble? Not the slightest.
- No visibility into salary bands and career growth. (Hint - not Transparent; re: T in the culture code). Other tech companies do this better. 
- Promotions and seniority is inconsistent throughout the organization. Product org keeps changing and they promote unqualified people to management roles, but are slow to promote others.
- WAY TOO much change. 
- Benefits don't match up to other tech companies (pre-COVID)
- Product teams often don't communicate, or do so after the fact.
- Performance review cycle is inconsistent for roles. It's not ""peer"" feedback when that feedback is optional."

806,HubSpot,Couldn’t ask for more!,2020-08-23,5.0,Sales,"Joined HS back in February in a leadership role and I was extremely impressed by the company.
Lots of cons:
- team built on talent, people eager to learn and do well
- promo process in place based on pure objective metrics
- culture driven by pur HEART approach people are here to help internally and towards customers
- focus on improving DI&B in a real and accountable way
- transparency and clarity on the vision
- product development and strategy
- adaptability during the pandemic break out providing immediate tools to sales and customers to help during these time
- overall benefits from health insurance to RSU, tuition, flexibility to   Work from home and now remotely
- looking to improve constantly
Really love the company and couldn’t ask for more",With all honesty can’t think of any so far maybe low % pension contribution but all the others and extra benefits are fantastic
807,HubSpot,Grow with HubSpot,2020-08-22,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"It is an incredible feeling to work for a company with a true growth mindset. There will always be growth opportunities for the company and its engineering organization, but the company has great leadership, especially in people ops, to ensure we smartly grow from those opportunities. Even the company culture code has changed in my time at HubSpot to put greater weight on empathy.

The product/engineering values, like the culture code, are powerful and accurately reflect the technical culture and how to be successful within it. There are high expectations for the performance and growth of engineers. The result of those high expectations is a group of very smart people working together to solve hard customer problems with a large amount of autonomy. There is autonomy at the team level to decide what customer problems to solve and at the individual level for how to best solve for the problems. Everyone has a lot of flexibility over when and where they do their best work or to take a break using the unlimited vacation.

The company seamlessly made the transition to full-time remote during the quarantine. They provide resources and requested lots of feedback to ensure that management and onboarding can be as successful in this new environment. Once the pandemic ends, I am thankful for the ability to choose to work full-time remote or be ""flexible"" and only go in a few times a week without any pressure on which option to choose, and instead be able to make the decision that works best for myself and my family.","The technical culture will not be a great fit for everyone. There is intentionally no dedicated QA or ops teams. That requires engineers to take full ownership of their code and have a solid understanding of our customers. Writing code can be the easiest part of the development lifecycle for customer-focused engineering teams. Because of the company's size, fewer problems can be solved by engineers in isolation. It is hard to be successful with poor communication skills. The small, autonomous team model can hit friction when coordinating across teams or groups."
808,HubSpot,A rare company that goes above and beyond for employees and customers,2020-08-21,5.0,Product Design Manager,"When I first came to HubSpot, I worked as a Product Designer on a team with a Product Manager who had been at HubSpot for five years. I couldn't believe how excited they were about the team and company mission. I was skeptical that someone who'd been at a company for five years could still be so animated about it. After all, it's only a matter of time before cynicism creeps in at every company, right? HubSpot is different. The culture they preach is one everyone truly lives by. Not just in the good times, but also the bad. The times I've seen HubSpot's integrity on display is during times of crisis, where tough decisions had to be made with real tradeoffs. Time and again, HubSpot's leaders have always come back to the core values of being humble, empathetic, adaptable, remarkable, and transparent. HubSpot's executives think for the long term, and it shows in every decision they make.

For me, HubSpot has been a place to learn and grow more than any place I've been. I've benefited enormously from so many opportunities to shape various parts of the product as the company has grown. Because autonomy is so core to HubSpot, I've always felt I can make a difference, even as we've grown larger.

I have two young kids, and HubSpot has been an ideal balance between an energizing pace of work, and the flexibility to be present with my family now - not later when they're all grown up.

I'm a big believer that impact at work isn't dependent on your physical location. Thankfully that aligns with HubSpot's believes as well, which allowed me to move from Boston to Orlando, FL, to be closer to family while continuing to grow my career. I'm grateful to HubSpot's commitment to remote work, not as just an option, but as a way of life that HubSpot fully embraces. That commitment benefits me personally, but is also good for diversity, inclusion, and internal mobility.

After two years of beginning a remote manager, managing up to 10 people with a mix of folks in the US headquarters, our Dublin office, and remote locations, I can say I've been able to have just as much of an impact as I would have in the Cambridge office. The company has invested heavily in the technology to make global work a smooth experience. Recently, they've also doubled down on the culture of remote work to make sure its the norm, not an afterthought that privileges hallway conversations at HQ.  Our approach has been thoughtful - accomodating a range of needs folks have and avoiding a dogmatic position on either extreme of office-only or remote-only policies.

As a UXer at HubSpot, you'll meet folks with a range of incredible talents, all with a humble attitude. Everyone wants to do their best work, solve real problems for customers, and enjoy working with each other while they do it.

Being at HubSpot is the best thing that's happened in my career and has been a huge benefit to my family. I'm grateful for the experience and see a lot of promise still ahead. HubSpot is just getting started with a strong strategy and thoughtful leadership at the helm. It's the people that make it so special, so you should come along for the ride.","At our size, we're a little behind on scaling our systems and operations. This creates friction and can take away time from focusing on customers and product strategy. That said, I see signs we'll continue to invest here and we'll catch up as the company matures.

Our DNA of small-autonomous teams has kept us nimble. The tradeoff is a structure that makes the execution of a smooth, cross-platform UX a challenge.

We have a ways to go on hiring a more diverse team and retaining those we hire. However, I'm continually impressed by the long term thinking and deep commitment of everyone in the company to make systemic changes that will last over the long haul. We're not looking for PR, we're looking for real durable changes we can make."

It makes it a place where you never quite feel secure. There are favorites and in-crowds. It can get in your head.
815,HubSpot,A more technical take...,2020-08-07,4.0,Software Engineer,"All the cultural pros have been covered by everyone else, this place is amazing, the people are awesome. 

As a backend SWE straight out of college working for HubSpot for about 8 months now I want to point out my most important pros so far so I can help other college students make an informed decision

1. You will learn, and you will learn a lot. HubSpot doesn't just have a great culture, it has an advanced technology stack. The code base is very new (even at its oldest points) and we utilize a vast array of technology.  Your resume will be very impressive after being here for just a year. Your bosses are very supportive, and will make sure you are learning from every pull request, and every mistake. You're encouraged to take your time and develop your skills, I have never felt like I wasn't being supported by my team during my ramp up process. Everyone around you is very intelligent, and you're able to just absorb information and knowledge. You'll get a bunch of different opinions (HubSpot engineers are very passionate), and it'll be up to you to draw conclusions and decide what the best path forward is. You learn by doing, and you do a lot here. 

2. The infrastructure is state of the art. Unless you're on the dev ops/infra team (bless them), you won't have to worry about deploying/scaling/monitoring your teams' service, it just happens automagically. Your team has a mission that is well defined, and you will pretty much only be writing code that adds direct value to that mission. This allows teams to iterate very quickly, and is honestly one of my favorite things about working here.

3. Autonomy. You will absolutely not be micro managed. Do you think this new technology that just came out will help the team? You have the freedom  to pursue that.  There is no set work schedule, nobody to track your hours, if you're executing and doing your work effectively, how you manage your time is up to you (meetings are generally from 11 AM - 3 PM from what I've seen).

4. The relationships between product managers and software engineers is absolutely phenomenal. All product managers I've worked with are surprisingly technical, and understand that what may seems simple to the lay man, may actually not be quite so simple, and will respect our estimates and feedback. The product managers also do a great job communicating what the customer pains are, and are a great bridge between us and the customers. I always feel like the work I'm doing has a purpose, and is directly adding value to the company, and this is largely thanks to the wonderful PMs we have. 

5. Wide variety of roles. We have backend/front end teams. Within those teams we have dev ops, infrastructure, platform teams etc etc. You have the freedom to pursue what you're most interested in and where you take your career is really up to you.","Experiences may vary from team to team. Sometimes the infrastructure is too ""magical"", meaning it can be tricky to grasp and understand."

820,HubSpot,"The good stuff is great, and turns up every day in smalls way",2020-07-30,5.0,Sales Director,"I'm almost 1 year in, and my experience has been very positive. Well known for 'The HubSpot Culture Code', you'd be forgiven for thinking that's just a 'web-document' or something that's only externally facing. 
You'd be wrong!...don't get me wrong, during my interview period, that was a very interesting piece of the assessment I was making myself, but to see how it shows up, that focus on our people and their true well-being, in small ways every day is amazing. 
I'm in Sales, and the absolute focus of senior leadership, and the entire business, is to promote and enable rep and team success. From how we target people, to the broad support structures in place, to help you grow and win, its feels almost a little innovative, even special. 
It feels like a great time to be here, with so many pieces of the jig-saw falling into place - our product, the growth strategy, the ambition driving us and the people here now and joining every month, all this excite me for the future. 
I can't not mention how the company moved us to fully remote since March, the People Ops and Logistics teams did an incredible job, and while we focus on our people, our partners and our customers, the business has proved incredibly resilient - again, down to how people work, because of how they're treated IMO.
Are you in Tech Sales, or any Sales for that matter?!....or do you want to explore a career change into Sales? Look at HubSpot, we try to hire the right person, not fill a role.

The money is good for the type of sales that we do, we are expected to bring in a very reasonable number every month.

Sales culture is not nearly as intense as elsewhere.

The C suite are trusted by staff and even liked... not always the case in big tech. 

The Dublin office feels like ground Zero for what ever is happening in the company.

RSU competitions

President's club for over achievers, which is always a great time.

They let you change paths, there are people who are crushing sales who used to be in services or m=sales manager who used to be managers in the Service org. 

They are taking a more hands on approach to systematizing sales process and sales training.

They will pay for you to up skill up to 4k€ per year.","They are a strange set up on account ownership, it becomes like real estate and reps sit on accounts for years - some people have built their career on 'owning' the right companies in the sytem - I got in 5 years ago so I've always benefited from this but the newbie's struggle to build a capacity of decent companies.

The stamping system for territories can be frustrating. Anything over 200 employees marked corp, seems unnecessary.

The product has been hard to sell to enterprise businesses - this is improving and HS's offering is getting more robust every month.

Sometimes Sales and Services don't see eye to eye but that has been the same where ever I've worked

There is not a lot of real hand raisers looking to talk to you about Hubspot, if you have the right attitude and take ownership of your pipeline this can easily over come but I remember being really surprised about the quality of top of funnel when I started.

They really try to make the culture positive, this could actually be in the Pro bucket if for some people. I become uncomfortable sometimes with some of the culture events as I don't know what to say or what the right approach should be on sensitive questions like race or politics. Some people like to have these discussions at work but I'd prefer to get on with the job."
826,HubSpot,The Gold Standard,2020-07-22,5.0,Marketing Director,"Since the day that I started at HubSpot I have been both challenged and trusted to do my job well. Leaders across the organization have consistently invested in me and my career, allowing me to become more confident in myself and my ability to run a successful team.

I have worked in tech for years, and I have never seen the type of transparency that HubSpot celebrates every day. The company will not shy away from addressing topics of concern, and does the work to support our employees through employee resource groups, external resources and beyond.

Tech can be known for job hopping, but I am definitely not leaving anytime soon. I have never doubted my ability to continue to grow and learn at HubSpot.","Being an external candidate, hired directly into a management role was intimidating. Often times in decks & internal resources acronyms and historical references make it hard to get onboarded independently without having to ask for clarity.

I'd encourage employees to think back to their first day, and create internal resources that are digestible no matter how long you have been working at HubSpot."
827,HubSpot,Flexible working conditions and very well set up to work from home,2020-07-22,5.0,Legal,"This isn't my first review of HubSpot but my circumstances have changed since I last wrote and I feel compelled to share my overwhelmingly positive experiences. 

I have a chronic illness and my health has deteriorated significantly over the last year. At any other company, this would have seriously affected my day-to-day working life. It may even have meant I couldn't continue working. But at HubSpot, where adaptability is deeply ingrained into the company culture (which includes flexibility and remote working), my working life has continued without any glitches or stress. In fact, I would go so far as to say the accommodations HubSpot made for me reduced any stress levels. I was allowed reduce my hours to work a 4-day week. I was allowed work from home as much I wanted (which importantly, never impacted how I work or my connection to my colleagues). The nature of the work I was given was adapted to suit my circumstances. I don't have to ask for permission to attend medical appointments and I'm never made feel like I'm asking for special treatment. I'm simply trusted to do my job, which I'm still very capable of doing, just not necessarily at an office desk, between the hours of 9 and 5. I'm also still very much challenged every day with new responsibilities and tasks, which is very important to me because I don't ever want to stop learning. It's important to mention that even before my health deteriorated, I had the same flexibility to manage my home life and parenting, when it comes to things like children's doctors appointments for example. 
As well as those practical things, one important thing to mention is that I felt comfortable opening up about my circumstances and being 'my authentic self' at HubSpot, something I could never do at other companies. I know many people who work in chronic pain or with some other personal weight on their shoulders and don't feel able to talk to their employer about it for fear of how it might affect their career. At HubSpot, while I can't speak for every employee, my experience has been that HubSpot wants to help employees to their jobs however they can and colleagues are empathetic and understanding. 

Aside from my personal circumstances, I've been very impressed with how HubSpot has dealt with the Covid crisis, always putting employees, customers and partners before profit. They acted quickly and the support and resources they provided while we all worked from home while parenting was fantastic. Don't get me wrong, they were still tough months for everyone, but it really felt like we were all in it together, helping each other get through each day. And leadership were incredibly transparent at every stage so we knew where we stood from day 1, with regular updates as offices closed etc. I'm not sure they could have handled it any better.

As an ally, I'm so proud to work for a company that walks the walk when it comes to social issues. There's always work to be done of course, but it feels like there's a genuine passion to do the right thing and a thoughtful process involved to identify real and impactful actions that we can take as a company to be better allies and support minority communities, both within and outside of HubSpot. Leadership are also very transparent when it comes to the efforts Again, full transparency, I'm speaking as an ally here, not a member of a minority group.

So all of that, along with the incredibly smart colleagues I work with every day, the top-notch perks and the fast-pace (which I love), I highly recommend working here.","Over 3 years in and I still can't think of any. Except that if working in a fast-moving environment isn't your thing, HubSpot might not be for you. For me, that's a Pro though, because it's nearly impossible to get bored at HubSpot and the days fly! It's also really interesting, varied work too so that makes a difference."

Empathetic: Leaders at HubSpot really care about their teams. There is no finger pointing when things go wrong, instead everyone just jumps in together and solves the problem. 

Adaptable: The company's response to COVID has been amazing. Tons of communication, flexibility and rapid evolution. How many other companies hired teachers to teach multiple classes almost every day from March-June? 

Remarkable: I have never felt like I have been surrounded with so much talent in my career. I am honestly floored by the quality of people that I work with every day at every level of the company. The people here are not only amazing already, but everyone is pushing to be better every day.

Transparent: Everything is shared with the whole company. EVERYTHING. Board slides, sales results, financial data, etc. It's all there because HubSpot leadership trusts employees can handle knowing the truth and because they know that this transparency is how we all can succeed together.",HubSpot does not pay top of market on salaries. I believe that is intentional because it pulls in people who believe in the mission vs those who are purely financially motivated. It also gives everyone an incentive to maximize enterprise value and increase the stock price (every employee is a shareholder).

HubSpot has been accommodating as a remote employee, my manager has encouraged me to focus on my family when I need to, and the planning from an executive level has provided me comfort during an uncomfortable time.

I have felt for a long time that HubSpot has been the best thing to happen to my career, but 2020 has solidified that in ways that I couldn't imagine.","Some might view this as a pro, but things move FAST.

Especially during a time of anxiety and confusion I've been so impressed with leadership's transparency, empathy, and communication. It's a place where everyone can have an impact, where leadership actually reads feedback, and where customers do come first.","Any company that is rapidly scaling faces growing pains. The company still hasn't figured out processes for everything which can lead to confusion and cause friction, especially when it relates to the operating system or yearly planning. I do think that the recent leadership hires that have been made are really making a difference and I would encourage the company to keep learning from others."

We have a executive leadership team that truly cares about the company and puts a ton of time and energy into making HubSpot a great place to work, a great place to be a customer, a great place to partner, etc. During the pandemic, the executive leadership team hosted ongoing ""Ask Me Anything"" sessions for the whole company to literally ask them anything. It ranges from daily exercise habits to tough questions on how we're handling certain situations...and it's just amazing to see a leadership team this transparent and honest with its employees. It makes so many of us proud to work here and to be a part of a company that will truly leave its mark in the tech landscape. I'm also endlessly proud to have a CEO that truly understands the importance of having strong women on his executive leadership team and on his board of directors. This is all on top of the usual perks that come with a tech company (coffee bar, smoothie bar, on-site gym, glorious, stocked kitchens, etc...)...but those perks pale in comparison to the real heart underlying HubSpot.",Every company has some things that could be better...but those are largely outweighed by all the pros at HubSpot.

The culture is extremely liberal. It is very closed minded in terms of opinions that aren't in line with the company bureaucracy. I'm liberal, but I'd prefer to leave my political opinions and religious beliefs at the door. 

The work-life balance is somewhat hit or miss. Some teams have more challenging work than others, but the expectations aren't adjusted accordingly. Managers tend to play favorites, allowing personal feelings to impact productivity.

The best part of America is that (compared with other countries) we can freely have differing opinions and still be respected. Not. At. HubSpot. Anything that is a typical viewpoint of a conservative is NOT OKAY. The company preaches acceptance but really it's only if you agree with them. It is absolutely, incredibly important to have a diverse workforce but if you alienate regular white guys it's just as bad as alienating any other group.

847,HubSpot,Specific Growth Opportunities,2020-06-21,3.0,Customer Support Representative,"Hubspot has undeniably poured money into developing a fantastic facility with many tech amenities. The people are all friendly and there's a genuine camaraderie within departments. 

The benefits were up to par with a scaling mid-sized tech company and the location was accessible. 

I really believed in the vision of the leadership team, and the north star of the company influenced each business unit, resulting in a strong combined effort!","The customer support rep job is an entry level job and the only clear pathways available are into customer success and backline support via the product expert role. People successfully transition to other roles, but compared to success and backline support, other transitions are much less direct and have a lower probability, meaning you might be forced to stay in customer support for much longer than you desire. Timing is a huge limiting factor with regards to non-traditional internal transfers -- you might be waiting for the perfect opportunity that you ultimately get passed over on. More on this below, but this is a greater risk because support reps are not paid well. 

Depending on your background, customer support can be a fantastic entry point into a strong company. But for some, the choice will be between taking a support role for 40k instead of a position that pays a non-negligible amount more at a non-tech company. I believed that I would be able to ascend quickly based on working harder than other support reps, but the internal structures do not incentive outperformers, they reward time in seat. Despite being able to complete cases with rapidity while maintaining a high NPS score, I was not able to take on stretch projects due to my manager tracking ""availability"". While the operation justification for tracking availability made some sense, practically it meant that I was not allowed to work towards my next desired role during my work day despite exceeding the core KPIs of case count and NPS. This is not how a salaried role should be structured. Becoming more efficient at your current role is how you stretch into the next role at any other company. My development was throttled due to this dynamic.

Finally, you'll be paid below national market rates at every step of the way at Hubspot. For some people the pros mentioned above are worth being underpaid and experiencing stagnation, but I didn't believe it was a prudent early career decision -- although it might be a valid choice at a more senior position within the company."

- This role is hard, so it's not for everyone. Don't expect to slide by doing the minimum. If you take pride in your work, you'll succeed here.
- As of spring 2020, starting salary is 40k a year, which some people don't like.
- The product knowledge can be exhausting. You're not expected to know everything, but it's still a challenge. Just remember to relax, breathe, and do your best. Management understands and sees you as a human."
849,HubSpot,"Work hard, management have high expectations but still, the best place I've ever worked.",2020-06-16,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at HubSpot 2 years and this is my first review - I didn't want to write one any sooner than now as I was still in the Honeymoon phase and I really wanted to be transparent about the good, bad & ugly*. 
*There is no ugly. 

This is a company that has the highest of high expectations. I have had good & bad days here, but still I love it because everyday I am challenged to think differently and grow as a team member and an individual. 

They have the usual tech perks, but what stands out is the 'leaving loudly' when it comes to vacation. Unlimited vacation is used and encouraged. 
The autonomy they speak of is real, and scary at first when you aren't used to it. You are expected to know your job, do it well but know also when to ask for help (and it will be provided). This can take some getting used to. 
The culture that is amazing and that surprised me so much when I joined. What is making me write a review now is how this company has pivoted to support employees who are surviving remotely during this global pandemic. It is brilliant (especially the classes for kids during the day to help parents get work done!) and inclusive. Now I am watching how they are supporting my black colleagues during this racial pandemic - is even more remarkable. They have even given each employee an allowance of $50 to purchase hard copy books on anti - racism to help educate and encourage conversations. 
They always talk about DI&B claim they are working on it and that it isn't perfect, I'm grateful they have had that mindset because it has created a safe space for people to speak up on how the company is handling everything, feedback has been both full of praise and also constructive criticism on how to think/act and do better.

My role as an IC has been interesting also - I've been able to work on global projects, speak with leaders and learn from them. I have learnt more in this role than any other previous role.","We are a global company but it can feel at times that if you aren't in the USA you may be passed up for promotions because you aren't visible enough, this can change from team to team but it is a common feeling that we aren't global first all the time."

851,HubSpot,So impressed with Onboarding!,2020-06-15,5.0,Sales Enablement,"Culture is taken more seriously than anything else. Day one, we were told unequivocally that Black Lives Matter, that they understand they have work to do internally and need to do better at helping externally, and they are amplifying the voices of their BIPOC consistently. They take Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging extremely seriously as both a part of their culture as well as their business model. I've never been so impressed with a company's transparency and I am only one week in. The benefits are largely standard, but their unlimited paid time off policy is not a trap like many companies. I've heard several leaders say things like ""you should try to make sure you take AT LEAST a week total per quarter"" or ""we have mandatory mental health days."" They pay much more fairly than several prominent tech companies in the area. They have incredible remote capabilities that have made them very versatile and ready for Covid-19. I have no doubts that they will be at the front of leading the world into the new normal of corporate business and saas.","I don't know of any at this time.

853,HubSpot,Know what you're getting in for,2020-06-14,2.0,Software Engineer,"Benefits are excellent. This is a standard mid-sized tech company that's performing well. You'll get excellent medical , dental, & vision, excellent stock options, above-average base salary, a beautiful office, unlimited PTO, and more.

The company has done an excellent job of becoming a best place to work for women, and this shows, from the high number of women in top management positions. The company hasn't achieved this by taking a radical feminist stance of trying to encourage women to be more like men and then driving them away in the process, but rather, by valuing women for who they are and creating special benefits that women will enjoy. On site you'll find manicures and pedicures available, and the company offers flexible hours and other benefits so that women with children won't feel they have to choose between their children and their careers.

The managers have created a positive environment by genuinely listening to their employees (en masse). This is a company that understands how to hire developers. Developers are given freedom to suggest and implement new projects, attention is given the removing processes which can impede developers, and so on.

You really will be working with the best of the best. Your colleagues will be alumni from the best names in the industry, such as Google.

Having this company on your resume will improve your job prospects. The company is recognized as being one that hires the best of the best. However, this comes with a caveat that if the job doesn't work out, it can also hurt your prospects because many employers assume that if it didn't work out for you at HubSpot, you must not be a good developer. This is especially concerning given the above-average chance of it not working out for you, which is something I will cover in the cons.","The company has done an excellent job of creating a positive environment for women, but this can lead to double standards. In the office, women make sex jokes of the same nature that you'd expect most women only to make in private with their female friends. It's generally understood that if a male employee were to make similar jokes, he'd be fired.

Most tech companies err on the side of not hiring an employee they're on the fence about, in the belief that it's more detrimental to the company to make a bad hire, than it is beneficial to make a good one. HubSpot wants to ensure it doesn't miss out on a rockstar developer. The way it reconciles these two competing interests is by hiring anyone the company could go either way on, but also firing them if, for any reason, it isn't working out after 3-6 months. What this means is it's possible to be hired by the company, placed in a situation in which it's impossible for you to succeed through no fault of your own, and fired three months later. In my case, I was placed on a team in which the tech lead was out recovering from surgery and the person who was supposed to be helping me was unavailable. After six months I was fired without the company ever trying me on a different team.

What Dan Lyons wrote about the company only caring about the bottom line is very true. The managers do listen, but only to large numbers. As an individual, you matter very little. I worked 10 hour days and on weekends to compensate for the absence of management I was given. I suggested pairing me to work with someone from another team for just a few days and it was ignored. People knew I was struggling, but not a single one ever offered to help me. The only management I was given was being told that anonymous members of my team had assumed I wasn't doing work, and because the team is more important than the individual, it was my job to figure out how to get them to stop. When I was fired, I saw a very different side of one of my managers. This was someone who was largely respected in the company and regarded as a sensitive, helpful manager. I was told I didn't have common sense and that I didn't belong in the field. I've since gone on to lead projects at major companies and be courted by some of the biggest names in tech, but once the company decides it doesn't need you, you see its real side. 

The company's approach to management is very passive aggressive. They might hold a meeting telling everyone they don't want them to feel they have to work too long, but privately you'll be told you're underperforming and you need to get your productivity up.

Even though the company does take steps to create a feeling that you're around friends, the truth is many of the people will show a different side of themselves once you're no longer with the company. Only one person from the company has kept in touch.

The reputation about being the best place to work in Boston is largely hype that the company has created. During the years I've worked in Boston, the only people I've met who wanted to work for HubSpot were college students who bought into the hype. By contrast, I know several seasoned developers who know about this company's reputation and don't want to work here. Everyone in Boston knows someone who knows someone who got overworked by the company and either was fired, or quit.

Once you leave the company you'll meet multiple people who tell you they felt the same way as Dan Lyons but were less vocal about it, etc."

I believe our senior leadership team has done a tremendous job of listening to our customers, employees and investors and as a result has hit the mark in getting our product roadmap and go to market strategy right. Our financials, online reviews, ENPS and customer NPS scores are objective proof of this.

It's incredibly rare in a several thousand person company to be able to work this autonomously and see the tangible impact you can make as 1 employee. This is even more evident in our developing and emerging market groups such as Southeast Asia, India and Japan. 

I believe that every employee is trusted and encouraged by leadership to drive strategic initiatives which can impact the company's growth, our customer's experience and the community's adoption of best in class marketing/sales/customer service strategies.

I'm surrounded by some of the most intelligent, driven, and creative people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. This team constantly pushes me to level up my knowledge and skills, and hold myself to a higher standard. 

Very confident in our product and the people we have in place. Excited to see what lies ahead and grateful to be a part of the journey.","It can be easy to lose sight of how special it is be be a part of what we're building.

You of course get direction and insight from people higher up, but engineers, product managers, designers, and business stakeholders all work together in autonomous teams to make things happen. As a software engineer, your work is always high impact, and you get to shape how your team operates.","Especially now, certain parts of the org are feeling some growing pains that come from scaling up. In the long term that's a good thing, but sometimes it can cause some logistical issues in the short term."

891,HubSpot,Unparalleled Medical Benefits in Singapore but HR is a Disgrace,2020-02-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"HubSpot has one of the best medical plans, which does not require a health screening to be eligible. Meaning pre-existing conditions and illnesses are covered too. Dependents not only includes spouses and children, but you can also add your girlfriend/boyfriend or partner onto your medical plan with the same exact coverage too.

Majority of my colleagues are wonderful people and many of us have formed great friendships due to the culture of the office. We have team-bonding outings and activities, some sponsored by the company and some by our manager/team budget. 

We have a well stocked pantry with snacks, ice cream, fruits, drinks, cold brew coffee, cold brew tea and even beer - all for free! Not to mention a free weekly lunch  on Thursdays for the whole office, which sometimes doesn't feed enough of us, but it is free so can't complain.

We have a prayer room for our muslim colleague, we have a mother's room, a meditation room which we all use as a nap room, and we have a fully equipped gym.

Having unlimited leave is communicated verbally, but it is not in our contract, as this is only applicable for top performers and if your workload is manageable in your absence. Our contract states 18 days annual leave, which is still pretty good if you add in all the public holidays.","HubSpot proclaims to be a company with HEART but that is not the case, which is a let-down as I was led to believe otherwise. Employees and Managers are not treated equally or held to the same professional standards. There is also a bias between local and foreign employees.

Managers who should be on our UGJ (HubSpot's Use Good Judgement Policy) plan due to their insensitive unethical behavior, comments and action - do not, but instead wins a trip to our annual President's Club and not because of hard work but due to riding on the coattails of the team. 

Many complains have been made from various people to HR but our HRBP does nothing. There is no consequence to bad behavior and it is made to seem like we are sensitive and should not finger point, and instead we should be the ones to reflect on our own behavior and not nit-pick. When HRBP follows up, it is just a formality, to document, and it is a waste of our time as our feedback gets brushed under the rug, because HRBP has more important things to do. HRBP is hardly in the office, we all wonder what our HRBP actually does. 

HR is suppose to play a big role in mitigating conflicts. Conversations with HR are expressed as confidential but that is not the case, whatever feedback you've shared gets passed onto your manager. There is no trust and no psychological safety whatsoever. When you try to set up time to talk with HRBP, it either gets rescheduled because HRBP out of office or never happens at all because it gets forgotten and you are left hanging wondering, ""What is the point?"". Our HRBP tends to get emotional and has expressed that receiving personal feedback is not a strong suit. How then are we supposed to communicate to our HRBP if there are certain things we are unhappy with HR on?

Just a few days ago, I saw someone left a feedback on Glassdoor titled ""Shady practice being rewarded"". Our HRBP should have flagged that AE to management and put that AE on our UGJ plan but did not, if that AE was on the UGJ plan, promotion would not have been triggered and people will not be angrier at this outright scam. Now the whole Singapore office is talking about it, even though no names were mentioned, we know who it is and it is driving morale down.

If our HRBP claims to not know about this issue with that AE (which has been happening over an extended period of time and isn't a one -off case), it can be believable, because our HRBP does not bother to build relationships with employees or help resolve internal conflicts, but instead panders only to senior leadership."
892,HubSpot,Customer Support Specialist,2020-02-07,3.0,Customer Support Specialist,"Incredible first company to work for out of college. I’m sure this sounds redundant, but the people at this company are absolutely incredible. Never have I felt so welcomed at a place, and I never feel judged or like I can’t be anything but myself.

Along with the people, the culture is also amazing. I’ve gained so much from working from this company.","I will be fully transparent in that when they first hire you, they hype up how much internal growth is possible.

That said, they brush over the fact that while they do open applications internally to everyone (no matter your position or team), the Hiring Managers/Recruiters don’t emphasize exactly what level or tier they’re looking for. As of yet, I’ve applied to 3 internal positions and have yet to land any of them. The process is smooth and they even give you feedback afterwards, but I feel as if the feedback is just for show, as I’ve acted on the feedback by doing various things to “up my skills”, but nada. I’m not the only one in my current role (Support), that feels this way.

Because of this, I’m currently seeking other job opportunities outside of HubSpot to continue my career growth—because sadly as of right now I feel like I’m stuck in a dead-end in my position. I’ve met with countless people, made connections with, and asked questions to the people on the team I’m looking to join, but it still doesn’t allow me to get hired on the other team. Many reps in my position have left the company in the past for the same reason."
893,HubSpot,Shady practice being rewarded,2020-02-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits and passionate people (mostly).,"Summary: Sales Rep who pulled off several shady deals are flagged to  the sales management, but ignored and covered up. The said sales rep was not penalised with HubSpot’s use-good-judgement plan, but instead promoted. 

Background: An AE sent out several emails to existing customers, telling them that they can procure a new SKU without additional cost. 

Essentially, the AE gave a major and perpetual discount off the existing products, and added the new SKU in the new contract at full price. With that, the AE gets recognised for the full revenue associated with the new SKU (yes, that is how the HubSpot sales commission plan used to work. It was recently changed in Feb 2020). 

This does not positively grow the business in the long run, and on the contrary, harms the business which operates on a subscription basis. 

When the services team has consolidated the deals closed due to this bad practice, the management turned their cheeks and ask for the team to not “finger-point”. It makes sense, as such big discounts require the approval of the higher sales management and they were part of the team that made such shady deals possible.

Due to the “new revenue” brought in by the said AE, he was promoted in the following month. It's a slap in the face for the others. 

Conclusion: Hard work is overrated at HubSpot. Learn how to game the system."
894,HubSpot,Truly the best place to work,2020-01-31,5.0,"Consultant, Technical Architect","Company culture, benefits, the people, flexibility, pay, exciting and fun work, diversity","Honestly, haven't found any yet. Remote work is still somewhat new to HubSpot so there are times that being remote can be a bit challenging and feel a bit isolating, but they're working really hard on this and are doing a great job navigating the remote world."
895,HubSpot,The Company You've Been Looking For,2020-01-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've been working at HubSpot for less than a year and these are the things that I've loved since starting

- Flexibility: Just be sure to communicate with your team and managers and flexibility of schedule is offered to you if you need it. It makes you feel like you're in charge of your schedule as long as you're producing the expected amount of work.

- Autonomy: At first, coming from a different company/culture, this was an adjustment. But, I can honestly say that I love being in charge of making my own day to day priorities while driving towards an overall set goal. It makes me feel empowered and I take pride and ownership over the work I'm doing each day.

- Great People Work Here: Amazing people ready to welcome anyone that is new and help with any questions.

- Creative Freedom/Everyone's Opinion Matters",The only con I have would be the sense of being overwhelmed a bit at the beginning of my career here. There is a lot of information available to new employees and it can be hard to determine where to start. The learning and development team does a great job of trying to set you off on the right path though.
896,HubSpot,Best place to work,2020-01-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Genuine focus on DI&B, career development and long-term growth. The product itself is world-class and genuinely solves customer issues, making it easy to sell, service and work with. But the thing that really works is the people. It’s a genuinely brilliant place to work because my colleagues are outstanding.","There can be long hours and demanding workload, but the balance is up to you as an employee through various perks (working from home/remote, generous salary+RSUs, generous maternity/paternity leave, infinite vacation time, etc.)."
897,HubSpot,"Outstandingly environment, good tech, minor growing pains",2020-01-23,4.0,Software Engineer,"What companies call ""culture"" is really about norms. Norms cause people who otherwise might act differently to act in a way that the norms encourage. The norms at Hubspot are to make people feel welcome and supported, to assume best intent, to be patient and solicitous in helping people grow and learn. One of the most impressive things is that the management relationship is not the kind that makes you feel watched or judged, but managers seem to go out of their way, whether or not sacrifices are necessary, to make sure that you feel comfortable, are not stressed, and most importantly are growing in your role and toward your next promotion.

Tech-wise, I have been extremely impressed with the platform tooling at HubSpot. It always ""just works"". I would even put it at contrast with a lot of commercial cloud computing software for its reliability, ease of use, and overall reasonable-ness. And the people who build and maintain it are always solicitous with their assistance if you're having trouble.","HubSpot's systems have grown very rapidly, and they're now quite complex. In some areas there are archeological layers of legacy stuff that has to be understood and worked with, but could and probably should be much simpler. Also associated with the level of growth is a possible lag in onboarding. Currently there is a quick burst of onboarding on some basic tools like Maven and our deployment platform. But after that you're kind of on your own to acquaint yourself with the intricate and often unintuitive product-specific systems that you need to work with. Under the banner of autonomy, engineers are expected to drive the rest of the process by asking questions and giving feedback on how they're doing. For various reasons I think that kind of guidance should be more structured and should mostly come from others, not be solicited by the new hire.  Another recent hire and I were talking about this recently and a choice line was ""it's hard when the onus is on you to connect,
and you're new so you don't necessarily know what to say, but you have a nagging sense that you need some guidance."""
898,HubSpot,"Super welcoming, makes you feel like you found your people",2020-01-15,5.0,User Experience Researcher,"No pressure to ""know everything"" - I was eased into my product area and my skill area with a ton of resources.
You wonder if everyone is a happiness droid and realize very quickly - no, everyone is just super nice and smart and willing to listen to you and help you
Flexibility - You are in control of yourself and if you need the morning to get some personal stuff done, do it. If you need to work remote b/c you miss your dog, do it. It's very liberating to work in an environment that values your independence and doesn't ask questions about it - you are responsible to get your own work done and b/c I don't have people questioning my work habits, I feel more empowered and energized to deliver better work for the team and our customers.
It's a vibrant place to work and interact. There's an energy here.","It can be chaotic at times but honestly, I think this shows that there's a lot happening here. People are open to reflection and if you have an idea, you can run with it. That is empowering. But b/c everyone has ideas and can run with them - it can be challenging to figure out which thing to dive into - choice paradox... That being said, I will gladly take on this challenge to get the pros"

It has been wonderful over my past year here to be able to work with my manager and team to determine how, when, and where I do my best work.","Not that this is completely a bad thing, but HubSpot has extremely high standards for its employees. Meeting those standards is a challenge, which is great for growth and career development, but transitioning to life at HubSpot is an uphill battle.

The culture is so inclusive and welcoming and their words match their actions. I was skeptical if a company could really live up to the culture code HubSpot claims and turns out, HubSpot can! They say what they mean and mean what they say. I can from a very bad work environment previously and I have cried on this job with HubSpot but they were all happy tears.","HubSpot is a HUGE product, so I always feel like I am missing some kind of information.

915,HubSpot,So good that I am afraid to talk about it,2019-12-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"This review has been long overdue. One of the reasons to join Hubspot was their Glassdoor reviews and the fact that that leadership reads those reviews. It is only fair to pass on my own reflections to people interviewing and considering to join.

Hubspot is a seriously great company and I hope it never changes. They have great focus on culture and it shows everywhere. In part I am reluctant to praise them as to not throw them off course by drum beats. But as CTO Dharmesh Shah says often that great companies have two products and culture is one of them. So it would be great to have that challenged and tested.

Huge list of pros but some of them are

1. Autonomy
2. Great colleagues
3. Meaningful work and impact
4. Growth opportunities
5. Being part of a company with a visionary leadership with great values

For anyone reading this, I recommend checking out Hubspot's Culture Code slides (available online). Following/Checking Hubspot Life on Twitter and engaging with leaders by various avenues available.

Hubspot is fairly transparent and I have always been amazed by autonomy, support and avenues available so openly.

I think I will not able able to work for another company in foreseeable future after working here.","Since this review will be read (as other reviews) I will take the opportunity to write some feedback to act on as well

There's not really any big cons but I wish 

* There was focus on having healthier snacks in office (I do munch on what's available and that's not good for long term)
* Please double down on the messaging of autonomy and remote working. As I did felt some reluctance in people about these at times"

— It often feels weird to celebrate milestones because everyone outside of your team already forgot what you were doing and why it was important... onto the next thing.
— Leadership team is pretty ruthless about who they have in what position at a given stage of growth. If you’ve grown with the company for a while and you’re a Director or above and you’re not networking and doing homework on how the last company that successfully navigated this upcoming growth phase figured it out for your area of responsibility, you had better watch out."

924,HubSpot,"Stimulating, fun work environment with great work-life balance",2019-12-11,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"Working at HubSpot has been a challenging, fun, and rewarding experience. I can honestly say I've learned so much in just the 1.5 years I've been here, and I've met some great people along the way.

Management really listens to you and gives you honest, constructive feedback that you can put into action to grow your career. They've put a lot of energy into building out their IC track for designers—which is much appreciated since not everyone wants to grow into a management role. 

They also care a lot about work-life balance and are always ready to revisit priorities when things get a little too busy. From day one, I've seen this commitment from leadership when they hired me as a remote employee after I expressed a desire to stay near family. They care about their employees and have invested in technology that makes it easy to stay connected, even when you're far away.

If you want to work for a company where you can travel, meet amazing people (I'm literally wowed by how talented my coworkers are on a regular basis), have a lot of good laughs and make some really great software, this is the place for you.","HubSpot values and empowers individual teams to have autonomy in how they approach their work.

931,HubSpot,Amazing Experience,2019-11-29,5.0,Onboarding Specialist,"I can confidently say that all the great things that you read about HubSpot are indeed true. I've been at HubSpot less than a year, but long enough to be able to get the entire experience (post new-hire honeymoon phase).

1. The best part about HubSpot are the people. HubSpot puts immense weight during the interview process to hire people that are smart, driven, and most importantly kind. I've made some great relationships during the time I've been here, and it makes work that much more enjoyable. Everyone here is motivated to succeed and advance their careers, and it fosters an exciting environment.

2. Company values. HubSpot is a company looking to be profitable like all others, but it strives to do so in partnership with its customers. You've most likely heard all about the inbound methodology, but HubSpot truly does strive to do business holistically and in a way that makes the world a better place. This not only applies to the way HubSpot goes about business, but also the way it treats its employees. You work hard, but I've never worked somewhere that invests so much in individual growth as well as transparency.

3. Benefits and perks. Benefits are great compared to where I've worked in the past. The coffee is fantastic, snacks are good, and beer on tap is great. 

4. Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. HubSpot puts soooo much into becoming a diverse and inclusive company, and strives to foster an environment of belonging. It admits that it's got some more work to do in this department, but it's truly steadfast in eventually becoming a leader in this category. 

I can go on and on about my experience at HubSpot. I can't genuinely say how grateful I am for the opportunity to work here.","I don't really consider this a con, but more of a disclaimer to potential applicants:

Prepare to work hard. If you want to coast in an easy 9-5 then HubSpot is not for you. If you are coming from another industry, then prepare to put in even more hours learning the ropes and becoming familiar with tech, marketing, sales, and general business acumen. You can quickly become overwhelmed (especially in the beginning). Every employee is here to grow and make a name for themselves, so if you don't give it 100%, you will be left in the dust. 

This isn't to say that the work-life balance is bad (it isn't). You just need to work hard and hit your metrics in order to succeed."

Everyone is very friendly and willing to help!","The pay is not great for the amount of technical work we do. Also, the job can get very stressful when dealing with a lot of difficult cases at once. There is less flexibility with Support and a tough late schedule for the first few months."
938,HubSpot,Best place to grow,2019-11-15,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The ""Use Good Judgement"" policy enables a fantastic work environment. It removes layers of bureaucracy that typically creates friction for employees. Want to go to Greece for a week? Okay just use good judgement. Want to work from a treehouse? Go for it as long as you use good judgement (aka get your work done).

Besides the great policies, HubSpot's best perk is the people. Diversity of experience is vital to self-improvement and HubSpot provides this through all of the incredible people you get to work with. Most HubSpotters have experienced something in their life that makes them ""Shiny"".  Our mystery dinners align us with people and an executive host that we usually wouldn't run into; after a few minutes you may learn that the colleague to your right had played professional baseball player and the women sitting in front of you was a detective in a past life. The growth you experience at HubSpot is gained through hard work (HubSpot is a challenging environment) and an openmind to other perspectives. Here's some other things that are cool:

944,HubSpot,One of the Best Places to Work - Culture of Growth and Quality of the People is Unparalleled,2019-11-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"SingSpot is easily the best company I've worked for! 

First up, let's talk about the perks at SingSpot! Many of these reviews say they're unreal but let me break it down a little. It's a 'known fact' that Singapore's national pastime is eating - SingSpot delivers above and beyond on that front. Here's a list of what's in the mix: Waffle Wednesday, Catered Thursday Lunches, (newly-introduced) Panini Friday, End-Of-Month (EOM) Pizza and EOM Drinks. Not forgetting the amazing and well-stocked pantry - coconut water, green tea, ice creams, assorted nut dispensers, regional tidbits and 2 beer taps. 

If you think we're all about food and drinks, we have got in place an on-site gym and an annual gym subsidy for folks to balance the sinful indulgence. It does seem apt that I mention a little about our focus on Health and Wellness, especially after all that speak about eating and drinking. What we got at SingSpot is an insanely good medical and insurance coverage! It even covers visits at the Chiropractor and TCM specialist. What's more, we've even held massage sessions at SingSpot during our Health and Wellness Week. 

We are also a rather fun-loving and diverse bunch! Fun fact, we have more than 20 nationalities in the APAC region and that really brings on different perspectives. We also get together frequently as small groups and a couple of times every month and every quarter in big groups. Some cool gigs we've hit up in the past- Virtual Reality Park, LaserTag and Fragment Room. We have various interest groups ranging from the cat-lovers group to school alumni groups and women groups to a ping-pong club. 

It would be an absolute crime to not mention the unlimited vacation program and the flexibility to work from home. I love how the company recognizes how everyone may be wired differently - working remotely may help one to deliver their best work. To appreciate longer-tenured employees, HubSpot also offers a five-year sabbatical program which is a 4-week paid sabbatical with a $5k bonus! For those who may be interested, we do provide Employee Stock Purchase and Grants along with the employment. I do also think that we're quite competitively compensated at SingSpot. 

I also adore the work-life balance here - leaving work on time means I get to pursue my other passions/interests outside of work which value-adds to my work.

Now on to the 'more important' perks! HubSpot values personal development and growth of every single employee. The culture of growth and learning is seen in so much that we do - monthly new hire panel, new hire training program, workshops, AMAs, Specialized Training, Company Wiki and our Internal Online Learning Center. The leadership here is extremely transparent - we even have access to the decks/documents from their off-sites. The extremely feedback-centric culture might feel a little uncomfortable at the start but soon enough, you'll look forward to receiving them and eventually delivering some of your own. One of the rare perks I don't see often in other organizations will be my one-on-one weekly sessions with our Managers and Team Leads. These sessions have been truly critical in removing my learning roadblocks and accelerating my growth at HubSpot. The icing on the cake is the free books program and annual tuition reimbursement of $5k available to us to spend on educating ourselves. Overall, I'm just extremely grateful to be in an organization that values our personal growth and development - putting in place all they can to help us become the best versions of ourselves.
 
My last and favourite perk at HubSpot. I can unequivocally say that it's going to be the people I work with. It's one thing to read about a set of values that a company say it will uphold and one thing to see them truly lived out by everyone day in and day out. At HubSpot, it's the latter - I've seen how each and everyone I've come across has lived the ""HEART"" values out and it's such a privilege to come to work some of the smartest, knowledgeable, humble folks I've known. The resolve to solve for our customer is really infectious. It's really inspiring to see people who are trying to become the best versions of themselves and in turn if motivates yourself.  Also, I've never seen a company so happy for people who are leaving the company for further pursuits. Someone once said, ""A good measure of a company is how they treat those who are leaving."" and I think we rank pretty high in that regard.

We have great vision and plans in the coming few years. Although I can't divulge much, I'm really excited about our growth in the coming years. 

I guess this my dream company to work for. So you can say that I'm living my dream now!","The following may not be con per se but they're definitely areas of concern for some people:

- There are really high standards and a really steep learning curve. For some, it might be too metric-driven at times. Therefore, the intensity of the roles might not be for everyone. There's a high chance for burnouts. That said,  the management has tried to improve this with health-related workshops (sleep, posture and nutrition), providing a meditation room, building a safe space and enhancing psychological safety.
- It's an extremely fast-changing environment. SingSpot operates a little like its own startup and it's a bit of a double-edged sword. While we're agile and adaptable, we can get a little disorienting for some. We don't have a lot of policies so typically you'll hear UGJ (Use good judgment) but that can have differing interpretations. Some see this as empowerment, trust and autonomy but some view it as a lack of guidelines. To each his own, I personally love it but a little more processes/systems and playbooks wouldn't harm.
- We're also not as well-known in APAC and in Singapore as compared to HubSpot in other markets. So you might find yourself trying to even spell out ""HubSpot"" for some customers. I personally find that really exciting that we're in the process of making ourselves better known in the region.

Some other areas for improvement
KPI 
- Some of the metrics connected to performance used in this region may not be the most reflective of an employee's ability and can become customer roadblocks. They can be majorly swayed by cultural perceptions of scoring. 

Product
- While I love the frequent product updates, we can improve the way they're shared.
- Product adaptation to meet regional expansion goals can be enhanced. On the product front, more localisation and more language support are very much welcomed, especially in the APAC region. We're trailing behind in terms of mobile play and eCommerce play. 
- The ideas in the HubSpot Ideas Forum can be worked on more actively (especially those with more than 150 upvotes over an extended period of time).

Career Development 
- Availability of certain roles in other regions may not be available in SingSpot, especially for more product-oriented and niche roles. However, internal mobility is great! 

Strategy 
- The playbook for certain markets such as India and some other Southeast Asian markets is still in its early stages and strategies from North America might not be as applicable. 

Cross-Collaboration
- Cross collaboration/function can be improved - introduce more projects that require the involvement of 2 different functions

Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion
- Even though we are rather diverse in nationalities and ethnicity but we can be more conscious in embracing inclusivity and belonging. Comparing SingSpot to other offices, advocacy in LGBTQ isn't as strong. Also, the choice of restaurants and food preferences during social events can take more into consideration of Muslims, Vegetarians and Vegans.  
- Also, we have quite a skewed ""younger"" group of workers  (mostly millennials) and the balance of some more senior workers could be useful for us. 

Giving Back 
- We can be more environmentally conscious - more conscious with choice of food vendors and in encouraging the use of own reusable cutlery.
- We can also give back more to the community in Singapore e.g. Blood Donation Drive, Community Events and helping the elderly etc.

Just a caveat here, no company is perfect and some of these are present in most companies of our nature (SaaS company, mid/large scale and trying to localise). These are simply things I hope we can improve on but I would still like to highlight that it's still one of the best companies I've worked for. This is so especially so when I’ve worked already for a few companies prior to HubSpot."

The amount of money and time Hubspot takes to guide and train each employee is staggering and I would suggest a big reason why so many people love working in Hubspot so much.,Some people will never be happy and can affect the morale around the office every now and then.

954,HubSpot,It's All About That Balance,2019-10-24,5.0,People Operations,"I joined HubSpot when we were a small startup and have been here to see the company flourish and scale while still remaining committed to elevating culture (it's been a LONG time since I wrote a Glassdoor review!). Culture at HS goes far beyond the benefits and perks and is truly about the people. – One aspect of the culture that has been meaningful to me most recently is how much the company supports working parents and the flexibility needed to make your personal and professional life work. - We welcomed our first baby to our family last year and going out on leave and completely disconnecting is a really scary feeling. My colleagues, manager and broader People Ops team were overwhelmingly supportive in helping me prepare and even more so leading up to my return.  

Don’t get me wrong – you’ll work hard at HubSpot, REALLY hard. – This place is demanding, but the work you do will be fulfilling and you can create your own career path (within reason) if you are a consistently strong performer and seek out the right mentorship. The company also fosters continuous learning and will never be complacent in building balanced teams that align with the company’s customer centric mission.","no more unblended fruit offered*

It's pretty hard to get into HubSpot, but once you're through, you'd see why.

There's a lot of openness & transparency, and it's a place where employees are empowered. Our employee perks are pretty amazing too!","I wouldn't say this is a con per se, but because there's so much of a start-up culture, and new things are happening all the time, sometimes it does feel like you're building the plane as you fly.

People of various backgrounds and nationality bring unique expertise for work and also vibrancy to the culture. The benefits also form a part of the culture for example, weekly meals and wellness weeks are often celebrated by the company.
People are genuinely helpful, you can grow as much as you set yourself to.","Depending on the department you are in, it could lead to different experiences of team culture and management style. Some management styles do not suit certain individuals. However, this is something you can learn more of during the hiring process before making a decision  (e.g knowing the direct manager you are working with, speaking to someone from HubSpot on the same role you are interested in). The manager you work under most directly influence your experience at HubSpot on a daily basis."

It's built around small, autonomous teams with a big mission that move fast and iterate. There is very little top-down anything, each team determines their own destiny.","As we've grown, we've added more and more engineering teams that have narrower and narrower scope.

If you are looking for your next technical challenge, HubSpot is a great place to be, and the challenges are getting bigger and bigger as the company scales up.

Fabulous platform support. You'll probably never work anywhere else that has bespoke CI/CD tools that are as polished and reliable as HubSpot's. Developing software at HubSpot is a truly fulfilling experience... If you like Java.

Top notch executive team. Brian Halligan is probably one of the most customer-centric CEOs in Boston, and Dharmesh Shah is a CTO able to operate at every level from dreaming the big dreams to writing the SQL queries himself.","Not unusual to scale-up organizations, HubSpot has some rough edges around role alignment when hiring externally, promotion paths across the technical and leadership boundary, and sometimes suffers from the downsides of a massively decoupled product org consisting of hundreds of small teams empowered to run fast in the direction they choose.

By and large it is working for them, and there are alignment processes in place that get the job done where it matters, but be on the lookout for pockets of unchecked chaos, or unexpected feedback."

Especially when our greatest lead source is referrals because people have such great experiences of working with our team.

The work/life balance is incredible, and although Sales can be very stressful in any position, HubSpot does everything it possibly can to prevent burn out.  Unlimited vacation time, benefits for exercise, free snacks and drinks, loads of team events, it makes it truly fun to work here.

Not to mention, HubSpot is still a rocket ship, even years after going public, and there is no sign of slowing down.   It is clear that with the number of promotions that building a career in the Sydney office has a very true path to personal career growth.

One of the greatest parts of the office is how international it is, with the leadership team really focussing hiring the best talent possible.",Sometimes ANZ does feel like a true satellite office with other departments that we work with being located in either our EMEA or USA offices.

Sure the food is great, the unlimited leave gives me the flexibility I want to see my family, the free book program has encouraged me to read more, weekly meditation has reduced my stress levels and the regular team and business-wide events are exciting. But it's the people I work with and the opportunities I have been given that keep me engaged. Someone told me before I started that the people at HubSpot were going to be my really good friends, not only this, they would encourage me to be better, think deeper and bring out the best qualities in me, and this is something I see everyday!","None that I can think of. I do wonder where I will end-up next (job-wise at HubSpot), as there are limited positions in Sydney, however the office is continually expanding so I expect more positions will become available! 

I understand that transferring overseas is a difficult process."
984,HubSpot,"The most Caring, Flexible and Supportive Company I Have Ever Worked For",2019-10-11,4.0,Senior HelpDesk Technician,"HubSpot is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.  Walking in the door in 2016, I immediately felt comfortable and at home with my team. I was able to ask questions, be myself and learn everything I needed to learn how to GSD at my role.  I was tossed into a fast pace environment and able to give input on how things could be better.  
My voice was not only heard, but valued. 

I was able to move up in my role within my first year, have been given accolades for work well done.  

Now, almost four years later, I am still feeling fulfilled, challenged and happy to get up and work for this company everyday. 

I have been able to move my working site to remote in order to better address my mental health and to better figure out my life plans.  And I, again, was supported in every step of that process.

As a remote worker, I am given opportunities to spend time with a whole new community of people.  I have the support of a remote program manager who makes sure that we are included in events and opportunities that all the other sites get. And I am able to do the things I need to do to gain a good work/ life balance. 

So, if you like a job that allows you to get up, live out your morning routine the way you would like, work on projects that are fast paced and exciting, and supports anytime you need... you will probably like it here. (oh, and the unlimited vacation time isn't the worst, either)","The only even remotely small con I have to list would be around definition of roles. But, even then, I feel like if I want to learn something, I can just ask.  If I want to try to tackle a new opportunity, I just ask.  I have learned that titles do not define the human, the work and the compassion and all that other human stuff does.  

And I know from a clarity side, this is being worked on and will continue to be worked on as we grow."
985,HubSpot,The only job I've ever had where a couple of years in I still like to get up and go to work--every day.,2019-10-11,5.0,Marketing Professional,"Smart people with great ideas. It's the only company I've worked for that has a surprising lack of jerks--that has to do with a carefully cultivated culture and the way that the founders/executive team think and the company is structured. The benefits are significant, but the most important, in my mind, is the unlimited vacation, flexible work possibilities, free books, great medical, and the perk of being able to use the software for personal use--which is super powerful if you have a side hustle. And that side hustle? It's supported and encouraged. Having happy, fulfilled employees make for better employees, and they get that.  Oh, and it's a phenomenal tech company for women with over 50% of their workforce identifies as female.","Salaries trend lower than at other tech companies. This has happened because most employees are hired at a young age and work their way up through the company so they don't need to be as competitive. In particular, salaries may be difficult to swallow for older Boston high tech workers (and it may be harder to compete with younger candidates for jobs for that reason--most of the managers are not that long in their careers), but it's worth a shot, because the cool work, great managers/colleagues and the benefits DEFINITELY may offset that con for you."
986,HubSpot,H.E.A.R.T,2019-10-11,5.0,Senior Project Specialist,HubSpot's people are all so very kind and I love coming into the office everyday. Everyone I've met is happy to collaborate and truly help one another grow better.  Leadership is very transparent about our success and failures and are always open to feedback on ways to improve internally and externally for our customers.,"Things are always changing at HubSpot, which can be a pro or a con, so if you are not an easily adaptable person and find change difficult to cope with, I wouldn't recommend HubSpot as a place to work."
987,HubSpot,Culture,2019-10-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"I really like the emphasis HubSpot has made on making an inclusive and belonging environment. Compared to everywhere else I've worked, the company seems so much more accepting of people with a variety of expressions, backgrounds, and experiences. Management also acknowledges that there is always room for improvement (and continues to take action to improve). There are many opportunities to get involved in DI&B initiatives.

There are a lot of perks like free food, dogs in the office, an onsite gym, working from home, and expensed team outings. I also view my coworkers as friends.

My manager keeps my career growth in mind, and I receive clear and actionable feedback to work towards an eventual promotion. I also have a lot of independence to determine my own schedule/hours and the projects I would like to work on.

Initially, I was skeptical of the Unlimited Vacation policy, but I have had no difficulty taking time off. My manager suggested taking off about 4 weeks per year + holidays which is more than what other companies I looked at offer for my role. I can also extend holidays by working remotely.","As HubSpot has grown, the culture and hubspotlife has not fully scaled. For example, the new office expansions (1C and 10C) have substantially fewer amenities and a much less social atmosphere than the main buildings. It's also been harder to sign up for traditions like Mystery Dinner and company outings.

For software engineers, the work-life balance and burden of being on call can very greatly depending on the team. For example, some teams are almost never paged, while others are paged multiple times a day."

HubSpotters are empowered to be autonomous and are constantly given opportunities to learn and grow, from the free books program to almost weekly events focused on DI&B.

I have truly never felt like there was a more inclusive, comfortable, and supportive environment to do your best work in. 

I think my favorite part is that all new hires, regardless of their department or title, complete a week-and-a-half of company and product training. It truly bonds your new hire class together and makes sure that everyone is on the same page for why HubSpot works like it does and how they are solving for their mission.

Obviously, all of the other reviews will talk about the benefits, perks, flexibility, etc. The best part is that it's all true and using the flexibility to work remotely or take time as you need it is not only allowed but actively encouraged.

The company is very supportive of remote work and I still feel very connected even though I am several states away from HQ.",Honestly I don't have any Cons at this point.
1001,HubSpot,"Wonderful Culture, Team and Product",2019-10-11,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,HubSpot is a wonderful place to work. You will not work for another company that cares more about their employees than HubSpot does.,HubSpot grows at such a fast pace its tough to get a full understanding of the tool.
1002,HubSpot,Best place I've ever worked,2019-10-11,5.0,Technical Lead,"* The people here truly walk the walk in terms of culture. Our values are real and practiced by every employee.
* Leadership truly cares about diversity & inclusion and is putting significant investment toward moving the needle here. There's a long way to go but we've started to scratch the surface of progress.
* You get an insane amount of autonomy in your role and have the opportunity to make a huge impact for our customers.
* The people who work here are just the best.
* The flexibility in work hours and location is incredible. You're trusted to get your work done whenever and wherever you can be most productive. This has made life/work balance so much easier.","* Gender and ethnic diversity in engineering is terrible
* Compensation in engineering is lower than other tech companies in Boston"
1003,HubSpot,Would Recommend to Anyone,2019-10-11,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Flexibility, Career Growth, Personal Growth",Not all locations get access to the same perks
1004,HubSpot,"Beefy technical infrastructure, great people",2019-10-10,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Most everyone I've worked with in here has been a pleasure
- Development infrastructure and tooling is great
- Small teams and plenty of responsibility/opportunities to learn","- The lingo/vocabulary/abbreviations can be a bit of a pain to learn on top of soaking up everything else
- Hearing phrases like ""our customers bleed orange"" and the corny cheering at technical talks kills me inside"
1005,HubSpot,"Fast growing, lovely colleagues",2019-10-10,5.0,Channel Consultant,"I have worked in many companies prior to HubSpot, big corporate companies and also startups. HubSpot manages to add the fun startup vibe to a fast growing and stable business. I could not be happier with my colleagues, I have the freedom to work on projects and a lot of support from management.",Challenges due to the fast growth - But we are managing it really well all together
1006,HubSpot,They really do care!,2019-10-09,5.0,Customer Success,"Working at HubSpot has been an absolute pleasure! I've been lucky to work with some great companies but HubSpot really does come out top. I feel valued and encouraged and I feel that everyone wants me to succeed and is willing to help ensure that happens. I feel absolutely at home and I can be myself, which is one of the most important things to me - and that's not the case in many roles/companies. I'm lucky enough to work with some great people where diversity is standard and learn something new from them every day.",There really aren't any downsides worth mentioning! Better coffee? :-)
1007,HubSpot,"Constant learning, great colleagues, great place to be!",2019-10-09,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Colleagues, learning, salary, flexible working hours, unlimited holidays","very fast moving, sometimes lack of structure"
1008,HubSpot,Great place to work,2019-10-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great company culture. Excellent perks. Heavily promotes learning and self-development i.e. free books programme, annual tuition grant to take courses etc. I also appreciate's management's commitment to diversity and inclusion - truly feel that I can be my authentic self at work.","Work can feel very siloed - you work on your own set of prospects/ customers/ projects. Not necessarily a bad thing as you are then accountable for your own success. As other reviewers have pointed out, internal mobility is also a challenge."
1009,HubSpot,Join for the Culture alone,2019-10-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Incredibly clever people that are open and approachable
* A culture that allows me to bring all of me into work and know people will accept me.
* Numerous opportunities to grow into new jobs
* Incredible emphasis on self-development, including money for your own tuition each year.","* All teams are not necessarily treated equally, ie Sales & Product vs Services."
1010,HubSpot,Absolutely recommend!,2019-10-06,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Working for HubSpot is really amazing. We work in small team (around 3-5 engineers), and my manager recognizes everyone's work a lot. The technical challenges are very interesting, and I am learning a lot every day. But the people are really what makes working at HubSpot so unique. Everyone is really kind and willing to help. 
Flexibility and work life balanced are also very present: I am able to work from home  whenever I want. 
Finally, there are a lot of events that makes working there very fun!",I wish there were more opportunities to transfer offices for engineers (not only Cambridge and Dublin)
1011,HubSpot,"No company's perfect, but this one's really, really, really good!",2019-10-02,5.0,Associate Product Manager,"- Flexible schedule; take care of your work, contribute value, and have the flexibility to decide when you take vacation. You're an adult, nobody's here to keep tabs on your every move.

- Supportive colleagues; the people who work here are pretty great! I've been on many teams over the years and it's always been a net positive experience. Perks like good coffee and snack are nice and all, but they're not going to make you happy at work if your colleagues bring you down. Fortunately, the people at HubSpot are our best assets.

- Option to work from home; more efforts lately to make remote work better for everyone! I am local to the Boston area and like to come into the office, but I love having the option to work from home if I need to.","- Demanding; you'll be challenged in your job. Hopefully that appeals to you! If not, you should probably look elsewhere. Personally, there have been times when I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I feel I need to do, but I've always found my manager(s) and team mates to be supportive.

- Opportunities for career growth exist, but it takes a lot of work an patience to move into different roles; I don't think this is inherently bad, but it seems to me that as the company gets bigger, it also gets harder to change trajectories in your career. People are always willing to speak with you and there are lots of resources to explore, but it can certainly be hard to find the time outside of the regular day to day."
1012,HubSpot,Partner Program,2019-10-02,4.0,Partner Specialist,"Autonomy, Company investing in success of product (good product to sell), Diversity & Inclusion","Comp and Promo Criteria = Black and White-- doesn't necessarily align with what they truly want from partner sales.

1013,HubSpot,A company with an empowering culture that focuses on you,2019-10-02,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,"HubSpot values learning and growing - and it practices what it preaches. As a HubSpotter, I have always felt like my job was being valued. Additionally, It's surprising to see how the leadership focuses a lot on the personal development of all employees, and I see myself growing as much as I want to in HubSpot. Never want to leave this place!","The company is growing  rapidly and is naturally prone to many cons of a normal ""entreprise"", so the next few years is going to be an important period as much as it would volatile and unpredicted."
1014,HubSpot,Great company,2019-10-02,5.0,Engineering Lead,"- Great infrastructure for engineers. You can write code, test it, deploy it and monitor it with great tools and low effort.
- Work on real products. Other big tech companies with Dublin offices do unimportant projects or SRE work in Dublin. A lot of HubSpot's core product is built here and Dublin is not treated as a satellite office.
- Really smart co-workers and a good culture of teaching and learning.
- Lots of team autonomy. The company sets high level goals and it's up to teams how they contribute. 
- Generally pretty low corporate BS
- Flexible for remote work, WFH, etc as long as you are delivering
- Really inspiring engineering leaders and executives who listen and care","- It has grown very quickly. It feels less tightly knit than it used to.
- Starting to lose the smaller company feel, with rules etc increasing. Although a lot of effort is put into preventing this and keeping us nimble.
- A lot is expected of you. Not necessarily in terms of hours worked, more so your skills and abilities and the effort you put in. It was hard when I started to get up to speed."
1015,HubSpot,Love working at HubSpot,2019-09-29,5.0,Sales Representative,"The perks are great. 
Management team is raising the bar. The MD is approachable, transparent and always there for the team. I have not seen this kind of leadership ever.

1018,HubSpot,"Great job if 23, bad job if 33",2019-09-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really successful business, smart and dedicated leadership and teams, not afraid of change.","Company caters to professionals early in their career. Career progression stops once you pass a senior IC role. There is literally no plan in most roles. If you want career progression you need to be in product or on a new team. Teams in marketing that are well established are ignored and don't get resources. The message if you have feedback is ""that's great you can always leave the company if you want."""
1019,HubSpot,Great place to work for,2019-09-27,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"Best UX peeps I've worked with, growing up and setting trends, humbled, smart, super motivated to do the right thing for the customers",Growing rapidly can challenge the communication and vision alignment within the teams
1020,HubSpot,HubSpot is growing up,2019-09-27,5.0,Technical Consultant,"Talented and lovely people and a very positive atmosphere. HubSpot Berlin is now big enough to be a ""serious"" employer, with all the stability and some of the perks and amenities you would expect from a large IT employer. At the same time, it is still a dynamic and fast-moving place with lots of cross-functional opportunities and steep expected career trajectories in most roles.","Right now there is no Human Resources team in Berlin, causing inefficiencies (having to translate and explain German laws and conventions to Dublin-based folks). This situation should improve very soon though as far as I know.

There is no engineering team in Berlin yet, so fewer technical roles and opportunities to liaise with developer teams than in other offices."
1021,HubSpot,Great place to work,2019-09-26,5.0,Marketing Manager,"- The people. I love my coworkers, they are the best part about working at HubSpot. I learn from my teammates every day and I truly enjoy working with them. The people at HubSpot are incredibly smart, driven and innovative and I feel lucky to work alongside them. 
- The flexibility. I have the freedom to work from home or take days off whenever needed. The unlimited vacation policy isn't unique to HubSpot, but it is a differentiator in the way it is truly embraced. 
- The autonomy. Even as an individual contributor, I own my projects and am involved in all aspects of their strategy and execution. Even though we're a growing company, there is still the startup culture where we all do what we can to improve the parts of the business we control.","- The systems and processes. These are typical growing pains in a scaleup. Maintaining autonomy in a growing business is tricky, especially when several departments rely on the same internal systems."

1030,HubSpot,"Great benefits, weak leadership.",2019-09-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Benefits are unparalleled - good compensation, excellent medical coverage and unlimited vacation.",Leadership is out of touch and sorely lacking in transparency. MD makes the sales team do this insane 'blood commit' (it's actually on their calendars) where reps commit a number - with their blood.

1034,HubSpot,Great company. Great culture. Great mission.,2019-09-24,5.0,Operations Specialist,"The culture is absolutely amazing. Although we have the opportunity to work from home as much as we want, I find that coming to work reenergizes me because we are all focused on a central vision, to make the customer happy. Shoutout to our leaders for maintaining the culture even as we continue to grow at a fast pace. 

The company is at a stage where it is really able to invest in systems to help alleviate pain points that could be solved with automation. It helps make the work we do more impactful instead of making us feel like we're toiling away on administrative tasks. 

Management practices what it preaches in terms of unlimited vacation and work/life balance. It really makes a difference when your director tells you that unless you have extremely critical work (which my team rarely does) you should be taking at least 2 weeks off at the end of the year in addition to time off during the rest of the year. They are also very flexible and understanding that there is a life outside of work. I appreciate the encouragement to make work fit around your life instead of the other way around.","There are some growing pains since the company is growing so quickly. Management is used to moving very quickly, but it might be time to slow down and invest in systems and processes instead of barreling forward and troubleshooting later."
1035,HubSpot,One of the best companies to work for,2019-09-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Love the company culture, I have worked for a few other companies that pride themselves on being best places to work, but nothing has rivalled this. People are smart, hardworking yet humble and it only shows that the company is hiring right.

While they are definitely hardworking which shows that the company is hiring right, will definitely need good leaders or the good ones will leave."
1036,HubSpot,The best workplace so far!,2019-09-23,5.0,Business Development Representative,"I joined HubSpot a few months ago from a larger competitor and I couldn't be more happy with that choice! 

*Great work environment (and office) 
*High level of autonomy
*Dynamic and fast-paced
*Structured and a clear career path
*The company culture is great! 
*High level of engagement from your manager - they really take time to help you to progress professionally. This even applies to managers from other teams - it's easy to reach out and get advice. 
* The people working at HubSpot is amazing and I look forward going to work everyday.","* The starting salary can be a bit low compared to the competitors, but as soon as you progress this evens out quickly. 
* As HubSpot is growing massively it's important to adjust to the changes and keep up to date with everything that going on! This is not necessarily a con, but I guess it can be for some people."

1040,HubSpot,Great company with awesome people and growth!,2019-09-18,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"HubSpot is a fantastic place to work! It is a fast-paced environment with driven people working on solving a lot of different problems for our customers. One of the best things is seeing the growth of HubSpot. The company is remarkably transparent from the top down about how things are going for the business. 

There are so many reasons why HubSpot is a great place to be. The flexibility is awesome as well as many of the fun perks (unlimited vacation, free coffee, a gym, cool free events to attend, etc). Having worked at a few companies beforehand, I know that it is remarkable to be somewhere that cares about its employees as much as HubSpot does. 

Finally, HubSpot is a great place to be because you can really grow your career here. There are some many opportunities to grow and gain new skills. If you are interested in trying a totally different job (say you are in sales but then want to become a product manager) you can do it! It requires extra work but the fact that the opportunity exists and that people are willing to just meet with you and let you take on special projects is awesome.","HubSpot is still a young company with some growing pains. There is a lack of diversity (which is a priority for the company but still an issue) as well as some pain around scaling as we grow. There are times that your team will be working on an issue for a few months only to discover that another team is ALSO working on the same problem but the teams didn't speak to each other so no one knew. 

There is a feeling that HubSpot's salaries are on the lower end of the spectrum compared to our peers. Some of this is true, but I would also point out that HubSpot employees have stock options which is very valuable. That being said, it would be great if HubSpot made public salaries for every role."
1041,HubSpot,Great place to work,2019-09-18,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Interactive community - everyone is always willing to help. The atmosphere is positive, I walk in whistling and walk out whistling!

I've met some of the most incredible people working here and made friends for life as a result!","If you don't thrive in a fast-paced environment where a lot is expected of you, this is not the place for you.

- Great support for internal mobility - there are lots of opportunities for lateral movements internally and HR supports them
- Improving very rapidly in the diversity, inclusion and belonging space. Leadership has this as a top priority and I feel that HubSpot has made great process in the last 12 months.

But, making big investments in leadership development."
1062,HubSpot,"Great company, better people!",2019-09-12,5.0,Marketing Manager,"HubSpot is an incredible place to work! Not only do I feel challenged everyday, but I also feel empowered to do my job well. HubSpotters deeply care for one another outside the workplace and are passionate about their work. It's rare to find someone who isn't willing to go above and beyond for another HubSpotter. Some other highlights:
- Flexible work policy (unlimited PTO)
- Commitment to DI&B initiatives
- Autonomous environment","HubSpot moves and changes very quickly. This can be good/bad, and isn't for everyone. You're constantly challenged and expected to try new things!"

-It's easy to slip from work-life balance into ""work-life blend"" if you're not careful, although this is not expected by leadership, it can happen if you don't set boundaries for yourself, due to the level of autonomy."

- Great culture
- Awesome pantry
- Fast paced environment – I like this so it's a pro for me. We move really fast and try very hard not to break things. 1 year here is like 3 years in another company, you get to learn and grow quickly, as long as you can keep pace 
- Psychological safety is a thing, people care about it and about you","Internal mobility is really hard in Singapore because it's a smaller office with less roles. Many of the cool roles are only available in Cambridge (HQ) or Dublin. 

Sucks because it's an office where you have a lot of talented and hardworking people early in their careers (especially in the Support team), who are dying to learn more and build their knowledge and skills. There are many who are pretty tenured and keep working hard but it's extremely demoralizing when we don't see the light at the end of the tunnel (i.e. roles that we can see ourselves moving on to)"

1067,HubSpot,"An amazing company and software, albeit struggling to make a difference in Asia",2019-09-11,3.0,Service Organization,"This is a review of the Singapore branch:

HubSpot is an excellent company with lots of positive attributes. While compensation in the service organization is not overly competitive, the training and exposure received are worth the effort. Perks are generous, and a high degree of flexibility is offered to employees, such as working from home or unlimited leave (although these are often abused in this region). The product is definitely one of the best CRM / Sales / Marketing automation tools globally for Small and Mid Market companies (although very US-centric - significant improvement could be made on regional adaptation)","- If you already possess good knowledge about Digital Marketing / Automation / Sales processes as you enter the company, you will likely hit the ceiling quickly as the majority of clients are small businesses that are unsophisticated in their use of technology.
- Most managers are inexperienced and would tend to repeat mistakes. That includes things such as not taking actions on low performances, constantly asking subordinates on what should be done and lacking rigorous standards to help team members grow their skillset.
- Leadership is generally not knowledgeable about our product and competitive landscape (lack of technical knowledge and business acumen). It makes it difficult for them to evaluate the resources they need or differentiate between top performers and those requiring improvement.
- In Singapore, the perks granted are often being abused. However, little to no actions are taken by management to enforce more discipline.
- As most staff is below 30 (average age around 27 years old), you rarely feel challenged by more senior co-workers.
- While the Software is great and globally competitive, there is almost no plan to adapt the product roadmap and processes to Asia (SEA/India). As a result, growth in this high potential region has somewhat been disappointing."

Internal wiki is difficult to navigate and while its improved in the past few years, because we're moving so quickly, there's still an over abundance of information and outdated information on there.

The level of autonomy you get is astounding - you really get to make your own  decisions and own them
You'll get to work with some of the best, most brilliant people out there -- literally every interaction I have with a fellow colleague just blows me away. People are really really good and know their stuff 
Career-development wise it feels that if you do put the hard work in -- there's no limits of where you can go. 
Salary and benefits wise it's good","Culture feels a bit artificial - there's a lot of stuff being organised by a special culture team, but few people get involved, personally I don't because it doesn't feel genuine
If you're not a white 20 -something male you might have real  trouble fitting in. the company is really trying to do more in the DR&I area but fort the moment that is unfortunately the reality

- You can get real ownership and responsibility if you want it
- We seem to have nailed training in the last year or so, both directly and indirectly related to your role
- We're getting much better at age diversity

- Office space is next-level good. I can't wait to see what the new building will be like!","- Gender diversity in Engineering is really bad. Like REALLY bad. I-haven't-interviewed-a-women-in-three-years bad, despite me doing relatively frequent interviews.
- Free food served is basically a recruitment tactic - it's poor quality, mislabeled, and unhealthy. There are regular promises to collect feedback and improve, but I've never seen anything happen there.
- Somewhat related to the above, health and wellness seems to be basically limited to providing (very good) health insurance, handing out the odd smoothie, and telling people to take the stairs rather than the lifts.

For the Renewal Manager role specifically, I've really enjoyed my ~1.5-year tenure thus far. There is an amazing group of folks that work in the department and everyone has been super helpful for my growth in the position as well as my long-term career picture.

The Renewal Manager job is mentally stimulating and rewarding, as a good bulk of our role is collaborating with customers and internal teammates to help customers with their renewal. There is a big piece of problem-solving that's involved that I personally love. This position will also sharpen your customer-facing soft-skills, which is great as communication is such a key part of almost any job. Being able to effectively communicate will help drive success for this role and future positions as well.","There aren't many downsides in my opinion, but I will call out one. The Renewal Manager organization is constantly looking for ways to make our day-to-day responsibilities more efficient and better which is awesome. At this point though, I don't feel as though we have the appropriate technical infrastructure/resources to help build out some of the efficient process/changes we're looking to implement.

The managers and the people are all so friendly, approachable and smart - it's a great work environment and you keep learning a lot.","The food is not great - we have free food, which is great, but the choice and quality is quite poor. Another minus point is that eco-friendliness has not fully arrived yet with disposable cuttlery, mugs and many plastic boxes for the food."

THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES!
This is a company that truly cares about the employees and wanting the employees to grow and develop both professionally and personally.

E.g. 5K SGD tuition reimbursement grant per annum for everyone, free books programs, e-learning platforms, master class, internal wiki, the list goes on… 
THE AUTONOMY AND FLEXIBILITY!
Employees are trusted and given the autonomy to be at their best. E.g I work more efficiently and effectively at home and I had the flexibility to work from home whenever needed without providing justification. (This may subjected to the team due to the nature of your work)

THE BENEFITS
A company that takes care of the employees, amazing benefits! Eg. Unlimited leave, I took 30 days last year (The guideline here is to USE GOOD JUDGEMENT). Unlimited TCM, maternity coverage, awesome medication coverage where your dependents will be covered too",Not that I can think of now.

1126,HubSpot,Why joining HubSpot is even better than an MBA,2019-08-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are many reasons why HubSpot is the place to go work for. A lot of tech companies use frills like very attractive perks and benefits (modern designed offices, unlimited vacation, great insurance coverages, parents benefits and many more, we get the drift) and dangle in your face. I think that's besides the point why. 

People leave a workplace (no matter how nice everything else is) if they do not feel secure, have a poor manager, or does not believe in the management of the company. 

Let me illustrate how HubSpot has well thought out systems and teams to protect against that disenchantment that attrition is real if none of the above is met. 

1. Feeling secure
The day that you join HubSpot, regardless of team / role / title, you go through an onboarding program that is world-class. Everyone will learn about the product, and everyone needs to do an intensive project that will put one in a potential customer's shoes - learning how to actually use HubSpot's platform. Having gone through 3 months of onboarding led by the Learning and Development team, you basically are left with very little chance of failing in your role. Learning doesn't stop when onboarding ends. HubSpot really believes in investing in employee development, because if you do a quick search, you'd come to the realisation (as did we) that the cost of hiring a replacement and re-training far outweighs the cost of ensuring that employees are able to adapt and keep themselves upskilled for tomorrow's job. Everytime there is a new significant product change / launch, every customer-facing team (Sales, Services, Support) undergoes training to ensure we know how to talk about it, sell it, and teach customers to use it. Besides internal trainings that are required, HubSpot also believes that when you are upskilled, you also become a more valuable employee to the company. We have a very generous annual tuition grant of S$6750/year for accredited courses, and a discretionary budget for any employee development course, as long as you know that this will help you get ahead in your career. I've since used the budget to take online courses from Harvard Business, Stanford Centre of Professional Development, and other SEO-related courses to enhance my knowledge. We also have our internal Learning Management System called Learn@HubSpot, and these are all FREE to take. There are particularly interesting ones like ""Communicating Effectively With Executives"", ""Why Is Internal Mobility"", ""Working from Home Etiquette"" to job-specific skills like ""Intro to API"", ""Google Ads Advanced Training"" etc. With so many resources available to ensure that you are successful, if anyone complains that they feel they are not progressing, it's really on them to take the initiative to grow, and not just grow, but grow better. I know that all these don't just benefit my role today at HubSpot, but also prepares me for any future endeavours I wish to pursue in the future. If anything, HubSpot allows me to feel like I've stood on the shoulders of giants to accomplish what I have.

2. Great managers
It is not possible to have perfect managers at any company. The realistic and pragmatic expectation is how best we manage a poor-performing manager, and ensure that others have the chance to grow and become a great manager. I am an individual contributor, and I have seen my fair share, and worked with amazing managers at HubSpot. These are individuals who care greatly about the success of their team and solve for their team. Everyone at HubSpot lives by the motto of ""Solving for the Customer"", now, our managers live by the motto of ""Solving for the team"". Their main job is to remove any obstacles that prevents individual contributors from performing and excelling, and then let them do their magic. Of course, not all managers are amazing, but there are feedback channels available to surface this to management. It is on the management to ensure that poor managers are trained, and if not, let go, in order to not harm the entire team. I've seen senior managers in very highly visible positions get let go because their performance is just not up to par. It sends a huge message that when the team is not performing, it's usually because the manager isn't managing well, and we are not afraid to make hard decisions when needed.
Usually such decisions are made in the HQ, because these are also the managers who have the greatest impact to either hurt progress, or forge progress. 

3.  Believing in the management of HubSpot
This is my number one reason aside from the rest why I think working in HubSpot beats going for any MBA program. The executive leadership team is highly transparent. We are talking about 80 pages business strategy memos written by senior leaders that are shared to everyone in the company. There are HELMs (HubSpot Executive Leadership Meetings) and various board meeting decks being shared. Essentially, if anyone who has poor judgement and wants to screw HubSpot over with divulging such information, can. But most don't, and won't. When you are given a lot of information and responsibility to protect HubSpot's future, you tend to act in the best interest of the company. I think this is something that many tech companies say they are transparent, but don't act as they do. All our leaders are also available through Slack, and you can literally just reach out to any senior leaders and ask them anything. I recall having to get some information from our CPO (Chief People Officer) Katie Burke, and she responded to me within a couple hours. I'm based in Singapore, and I have access to our top management in the US, in such proximity. Imagine how powerful that can be in a 2,600 strong company. For the most part, when we say we want to do something, and set it as a company goal, we usually do it, and make bets on it. I've seen how my own role has transformed since the last 1.5 years because of the nature of the development of HubSpot. As we started from a Marketing software company, we have now grown into a platform company. My KPIs have evolved to align with the progress of the business, and everyone is very agile in ensuring that we keep acting and delivering to evolve the company. Our COO strongly believes in HubSpot being big and fast, and I think we are getting there.","It's not all a bed of roses at HubSpot. But when you think of any cons and weigh it against the pros, any reasonable and logical person will be grateful and be counting their blessings of just how lucky being a HubSpotter really is. I remind myself to not take things for granted because of petty trivial things that as with time, this too shall pass."
1127,HubSpot,Inbound Growth Specialist (Account Executive),2019-08-23,4.0,Inbound Growth Specialist,"This is a review for the Singapore office:

values & work life balance
- transparency of management - one of the most transparent company I've ever worked for
- feedback culture - everyone including MD encouraged to give and receive feedback
- genuinely nice people who work here 
- flexibility and unlimited holidays - (however many people abuse this privilege)
- an international hub with people from all countries 

career advancement and opportunity
- still a small hub within a big market (Asia + India) so lots of potential and opportunities to learn
- a global company so lots of opportunity for internal mobility","- leadership outside of Singapore office is great, Singapore office leadership is lacking, they promote from within and managers lack experience (ie. don't know how to forecast, keep team accountable)
- surrounded by lots of new grads who lack business acumen - lack of talent here to learn from
- global internal processes still need work and causing lots of friction for sales reps to sell
- give out trophies for everything"

Even then, I only have good things to say about the people that I work with, the values of the company, how management truely lives up to the standards we promote as part of ""HubSpot culture"". 
Of course no company is perfect, but having experienced a few other roles in my career, I can truely appreciate how happy I am working here.",Can't really think of cons at the moment.
1130,HubSpot,Probably the best company I've worked for,2019-08-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"HubSpot Singapore is a great place if you're starting out your career. Employee onboarding is very well thought-out and managers and team mates are transparent and supportive. If you're more senior and looking to build on your leadership experience, this is the place to be. Forget about titles for a while and you'll realise the exposure you get is really good. As HubSpot Singapore grows, you get to collaborate with different leaders in teh region or even globally to help solve complex problems and truly get a chance to build something special. Company is pretty flat, which makes localised plays easy to execute. Flexible working hours make it easy for people with other life commitments like kids, etc.","Not really a con, but the pace can be blistering fast. So you'll need to be able to get used to the pace."

The culture encourages you to build your work around your life, rather than the typical other way around and managers work with to reach your career goals.","Like with any fast-growing company, there are some growing pains, but leadership is transparent about what those are and how they plan to fix them."
1138,HubSpot,I love HubSpot!!,2019-08-21,5.0,Business Development Representative,"All of HubSpot leaders give you the autonomy to work despite your position.

From training and facilities, to teams and culture, HubSpot truly lives up to the hype. Passionate and high achieving people without the ego are everywhere and more than happy to both make you feel welcome and help you out when you need it.

Many times I've worked at other companies who touted their company values, only to be on-boarded and find out they were a thinly veiled lie to appear to be innovative. With HubSpot I had some skepticism but it's lived up to it all. If you're thinking about applying, get around it there are some absolutely great people to work with and equally rewarding roles on offer.","None, you're given every resource and opportunity to both hit targets and exceed them."

Management doesn't hide anything from the teams, openly shares stats and results even during periods where things aren't amazing.  There is a lot of effort to be thoughtful and inclusive. 

The business as a whole is also doing well, so it is a good experience to see what it is like working for a global company that is going through a growth phase, even when it's alrady quite large.

There are a lot of challenges working in Asia, there are definitely some things that don't go smoothly, but the ones that thrive here are the ones who understand that and want to help solve those new problems that global teams or HQ hasnt solved yet.","Company says it wants to be ""global first"" but is still quite a long way from getting there. I think we are getting better at recognizing that HubSpot operates in many countries, and so we are more and more international from that sense, but our operations and our systems are still very much USA centric and it's a frustration for a lot of regional teams."

They aren't lying when they say they care about your progress and your experience, a lot of the processes are structured to understand how you feel and they will push you to grow 
- At least in APAC, pay is rather competitive. It's not the top of the industry from what I know, but compared to many others in a cheap labour market in this region it's good 
- Benefits are UNREAL. So good! Medical insurance is super comprehensive, and unlike other companies people and managers genuinely encourage you to take your unlimited leave. + the amazing food and events make things all the better 
- The people! Most managers (90% from my experience) and directors have 0 airs to them. So willing to talk and help each other out. I came from many other firms where higher ups were more than eager to make everyone else do their dirty work, here management works alongside you and does the work with you. I've had the Senior VP, Managing Director, International - Jeetu memorise virtually everyone's names and he would personally address any of our questions, professional or personal
- Most colleagues are so willing to share and help. There are exceptions naturally, but no one I've met in all my time here is malicious, which in itself is a miracle to me. For context, I am a massive, massive pessimist. I was convinced every firm would be out there to squeeze you dry and you do the same. But the people here in HubSpot have proven to me that your colleagues can truly push you to become a better person.  
- The work is rewarding. I've met real customers who have expressed gratitude that we have helped them grow better as a business 
- So much autonomy! Many of my previous companies would tout that they are ""forward looking"" and ""flexible"" but reality was employees were staying till 10pm. HubSpot gives me the autonomy to work from home (even in APAC! which is huge!) and so long as I deliver, there is flexibility.  
- Huge, huge pro to me personally : the facilities. All your equipment is brand new when you first come in. The office isn't an open office which is incredibly not conducive as proven by multiple studies. Really empowers you to work better","- Processes in APAC are not optimised at the moment, there are many things internally we could work on to be more efficient and to avoid less grey area. 
- As a US-based company, it can be very challenging to work with APAC's cultural and buying behavioural differences. We're still working on localisation, I think we still have quite a long way to go in thinking global but acting local 
- Everything moves incredibly fast, sometimes too fast. The product evolves so much that even customers can get tripped up , and employees often have to bear that frustration with customers. If you're someone who doesn't like fast moving industries, this is certainly not a company for you."

1153,HubSpot,A Place to Learn and Grow,2019-08-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Culture: I remember reading HubSpot's Culture Code when I was going through the interview process. I thought it sounded nice and aspirational (as it is with most businesses). Upon joining, I was surprised to find that HubSpot really ""walks the walk"" when it comes to culture. And it's not just about ping pong tables and beer taps; it's about all of us creating a place where we can do our best work
-Training: I went through a month of training before I was ever expected to deliver anything. That's true of most roles at HubSpot. They really want to make sure that each person is set up for success. And the learning has continued throughout my journey (over two years now)
-Flexibility: We are encouraged to work ""wherever, whenever, and however"" we want. Of course there are limits, but I love that HubSpot treats us like adults and hold us accountable for the output more than the input. I personally work from home one day each week
-Remarkable people: HubSpot is serious about its recruitment and it shows. I have the pleasure of working with some of the smartest, most creative, most genuine people of my career here at HubSpot
-Career growth: HubSpot is growing quickly and that means more opportunity for everyone. For me that means growing my skills and contributing more back to the business. But it's also meant that I've been promoted twice in two years
-Benefits: Where to start? Unlimited time off, free books program, tuition reimbursement, excellent health insurance... the benefits are many","This is specific to APAC, but because we're so small (compared to the US) and growing so quickly, that means some of us have to take on extra responsibilities outside of our core roles.

While it is possible to find a job internally, support reps aren't taken seriously in most other parts of the company, and have to re-start at a different entry level position after knowing the technical side of the project inside and out. HubSpot pays far below industry standard in all roles, and internal reps are frequently lowballed when being promoted. The atmosphere and goals have become more authoritarian and less encouraging and certainly more rigid and have a misaligned ideal of what it takes to actually leave support, which is widely recognized as the only reason for joining support in the first place≥"

I feel like I know as much information as everyone around me and that we value and enable this transparency so that we can do our job better. This brings me to my second point that we believe there is always more to learn and encourage people at all levels within the organization to continue to learn and grow. I've not seen that modeled to such an extent with other employers. The organization is fairly flat, which gives folks a lot of autonomy and leverage to bring great ideas to the table and it helps us to better elevate the voice of the customer and truly be understanding our customers' needs by hearing from them directly as well as hearing valued feedback from employees who are customer-facing.","I have left this blank for the last 10 minutes while I am trying to think of something... I don't have many cons, if any. I think there are learning curves along the way as any company grows quickly, but even that has been positive since HubSpot realizes its areas that it needs to improve (increasing diversity, for an example) and has proactively worked towards getting better with this."

It's also allowed me to follow my passions in life, like travel, and fit my work around my life instead of the other way around. That's not to say there aren't days where I work a little longer or projects that take up more time, but it all balances out and I'm thankful for","As HubSpot grows, naturally there are some growing pains that are going to happen. I think that leaders are really going to have to dig in to  our culture and make sure we're continuing to scale that as HubSpot grows, both within the larger company, but even on smaller departments and teams. We work with amazing people, and we can't fall away from celebrating people or building relationships as HubSpot continues to grow."
1166,HubSpot,An incredible place to work!,2019-07-31,5.0,Program Manager,"I could list a lot of pros - the benefits, the technology, the mission, the transparency - but two things stand out:

The flexibility: As employees, we work hard to meet high expectations, but we're also encouraged to leverage flexibility to accommodate a work/life balance.  As long as the work gets done, they trust you to work where and when you need to work, which has been so impactful on my work and life and will keep me loyal to the company for years to come. The company also allows remote work, which is an incredible option for those of us who prefer to work from home, are not located close to an office, or may be looking to make a physical move in the future for various reasons.

The community: The company is full of empathetic, helpful, and energizing people, which makes it a really great place to work and learn. From the very top level to individual contributors, I've always felt welcome and comfortable reaching out, collaborating, and asking for help when needed. This type of environment also fosters opportunities to branch out of your own role and explore other functions and possibilities, which has been really helpful to my career growth.

In the three years I've been at HubSpot, I've been able to transition my career into a new space,  pursue a graduate degree thanks to the flexibility in HubSpot's schedule (and their tuition reimbursement!), and grow both personally and professionally in so many ways. It's been the best career move I've made so far and I couldn't be happier.","This isn't  a con, but more setting context - HubSpot is what you make of it. There is so much opportunity, trust, and growth available to every employee, but learning to navigate and take advantage of all of that can be overwhelming at first, so it can take time to find your footing."

Look no further than HubSpot!,2019-07-31,5.0,Management & Leadership Development Facilitator,"It's rare to find a company that has strong values and actually operated to uphold them. Beyond the snacks, coffee garden, flexible work policies, unlimited vacation, career growth opportunities, innovative ideas, and supporting a properly integrated work-life, HubSpot as a tool actually works to help small and medium businesses grow. 

It is rewarding to know that we are enabling individuals to have a better workday, bigger pay check, and aspirational goals through our platform and services. In return, employees are rewarded with a truly remarkable culture and work experience. 

Speaking directly to leaders looking to join HubSpot - come to HubSpot if you want to lead with your authentic style, develop employees for career success not just task success, and have some fun at work.","HubSpot is a place where people are committed.

1177,HubSpot,A great overall culture hampered by bad middle management,2019-06-24,3.0,Services,"- Unlimited vacation is truly unlimited - no tracking system, no red tape, no snide comments from coworkers or management (at least in my experience)

- In spite of recent code red mishaps, I think the software is heading in the right direction. I can't speak to the overall strategy, but for the most part, as both an internal and external user, there's been continuous improvement in functionality, and the UI and general ease of use is considerably better than garbage like Marketo and Pardot

- There are enough people at this point that you'll definitely find like-minded colleagues. People are generally smart and capable (though there's definitely a Dunning-Kruger effect and HubSpot's internal insistence on its meaningless stat that they're harder to ""get into"" than Harvard certainly doesn't help things), and I've connected with some truly incredible friends and colleagues here","Two main cons, neither an easy fix:


1. The ""Peter principle"". Upward trajectory at HubSpot relies heavily on an eventual promotion to middle management. This is seen as ""prestigious"" or a sign of talent, but the fact of the matter is that across departments, the responsibilities of managers are vastly different from those of individual contributors. Although not universally true, wayyyy too many people get promoted to a management position based on their excellence in their current role, with little regard for whether those skills will translate to middle management (hint: they often do not). HubSpot's only alternative to rewarding excellence besides the management track is pay raises and more senior titles. 


This isn't all that different from how many other companies operate, but it doesn't absolve HubSpot of its poor managerial culture. As the saying goes, ""People don't leave their jobs, they leave their managers"", and far too many strong contributors are put into managerial roles where they're at best ineffectual and at worst, an active hindrance to employee performance. There's a strong sense that managers view their status at the company as an elevated one, where it should be the reverse: middle managers are there to enable their employees to give their best performance, not to flex their tenure. Ironically, because of this culture, I've seen the converse scenario as well: middle managers stuck in middle management because it's the ""mature"" thing to do, despite being talented and smart enough to be a better fit as senior members of their team.


2. Diversity and inclusion. There's been a strong push at HubSpot lately to be better about diversity and inclusion, which is great to see. The problem is that most of the top-down directives are coming from a place where the top is neither very diverse nor inclusive. 


About a year ago and a half ago, I personally saw a new POC hire go through the new hire training, and then be let go almost immediately. Apparently, his manager didn't feel that his output was very HubSpotty. I bring this story up because I think it highlights how much work HubSpot still has to do.


There's countless research out there highlighting that no matter how much raw intelligence or talent someone from a low-income or low-privileged background possesses, there's going to be a (usually pretty rough) transition period when they move into a more demanding environment. It's not laziness or lack of fit - it's the natural outcome of trying to adapt to completely new environments, environments which are often very familiar to those who were privileged enough to get tutoring, go to schools with AP classes, attend top tier colleges, etc. I'm not suggesting that it's HubSpot's responsibility to fix systemic inequality. I am suggesting that the company should be more patient with those they hire from, to put it bluntly, less ""Martha's Vineyard"" backgrounds. The fact that you would hire someone, put them through a month-long training (in which they've presumably turned down any and all other offers of employment), and then fire them right afterward is... not great. I chalk this one up to the individual manager's inability to empathize or just a general lack of D-I training and awareness, but it's a particularly insidious component to the systemic exclusion at the heart of tech that I don't think is talked about enough."
1178,HubSpot,Growth and opportunity through hard work,2019-06-24,5.0,"Manager, Customer Success","HubSpot is the best place I've ever worked, before thoughts drift toward this sounding fluffy, hear me out: 
-HubSpot offers flexibility unlike like I've ever had at past employers. Being a working parent this is one of the several difference makers in my day to day. If I need to leave early or come in late, no one ever questions it. This comes from setting a standard of trust within all HubSpot employees. It's expected that you dedicate your self to working hard and when you need to handle life as we all do, there are no issues at all. During my time here, yes there have been growing pains as there are in any scaling business, that said with incredible growth that I've seen and participated in you do reap rewards from the collective success. 
-HubSpot does a great job hiring smart, driven people.

Free snacks, a large open office campus plan with plenty of common spaces, smoothie bar, gym, unlimited vacation, etc. The people are generally pretty smart, talented, and hardworking. The intentions are always good, and this is particularly clear when it comes to their diversity and inclusion efforts. As an individual contributor at the company, I very much enjoy working with my peers. It feels like we're ""all in this together."" Great health benefits--HubSpot will pay your deductible--and there's a lot of support for parents and caregivers.","HubSpot is finding it increasingly difficult to scale its culture across 9 global offices, and as a result, culture is especially struggling at ""home"" in Cambridge. As the manager corps expands, there isn't enough training or support available to first-time managers. As a result, the company is seeing a lot of turnover--including folks who've stuck around for 4+ years but didn't find it worth it to make it to 5 to get the company's 1-month sabbatical.

My coworkers were smart and hardworking. Cross-collaboration - although strained from growing pains - is still achievable with the right channels.,"HubSpot’s Customer Success org is struggling. They’ve had high burnout in this role due to larger than average customer ratios (think 1:200+ in a bad quarter) and impossible targets. You can only offer a certain level of service at those ratios, which makes it impossible to hit target. This leads to high turnover rates, which causes even higher ratios.

Instead of solving the problem, managers blame it on Customer Success Managers not working hard enough and don’t take the concerns of over half of the org seriously, which leads to higher burnout and higher turnover. You see where I’m going with this. Customers can feel the stress in this org, too. 

HubSpot’s a good name to have on your brand, but if you need a job only stay for a year and then move on. The “Best Place to Work” award doesn’t apply to the Customer Success role. There’s a reason why there’s always a “Customer Success Manager” position open, and it’s not because they’re growing in this space (they’re actually trying to cut down on overall headcount in services).

It was really hard to move out of support. The job is presented as a catalyst for growth and moving into other branches of the company. And this was true for some, but it interviewed for no fewer than 5 internal jobs and was not given actionable feedback.

I had two really poor experiences with managers. When I was there 80% of managers where first-time managers, and I never really felt supported by either one. I was giving mixed messages about my performance. My numbers were always good, but it was always implied that I wasn't working hard enough.

These cons added up to a hard to digest lifestyle and poor self-esteem. My manager even suggested I should leave the company because I wasn't happy, instead of asking how she could help. She is a very celebrated manager now. It makes me uncomfortable."

1214,HubSpot,I love HubSpot,2019-03-22,5.0,CSM,"I've been working at HubSpot for many years and have seen the company grow and change. The core principles haven't changed though: ultimate transparency, trusting employees to use good judgment to do their jobs,  and being innovative. These days, working with smart people and having the flexibility to do your job as you wish in a fun environment is worth everything.","This is not  a 9-5 job that you can leave behind when you go home. Also, certain career paths leave less room for growth within the company as the skills don't translate as well to other departments without taking a huge pay cut and starting over (I suppose that's the case no matter where you work)."
1215,HubSpot,A happy place with happy people,2019-03-20,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"- Great work-life balance, no pressure if you feel like taking a day off or working from home
- Very nice atmosphere around the office, there's everything you need from drinks, facilities & food/snacks
- Open door culture, you can always talk to somebody when you need to
- People are happy and don't complain about work like in many other companies, surely there are faults here and there as in any company but it's not something you come across every day. 
- You can be open and honest even to management without having fear of negative consequences.
- Overall it feels good around here, it's busy and can be hectic from time to time, but it's enjoyable rather than annoying.","It can sometimes take a bit longer to progress in the company, mainly because it's so busy so days fly by, but moving to a different role or department isn't the quickest progression at Hubspot, which might actually be a good thing some times."
1216,HubSpot,"Flexibility, Cooperation & Trust",2019-03-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some people may rave about the free food/snacks, the gym, the beanbags, the beer taps, the cool events and talks...  and that stuff is all pretty amazing. But for me, the real perk at HubSpot is the flexibility to work when and where I need to (within reason) to get the job done. And the fact that I'm trusted to do my job. There's no micromanagement and you end up wanting to work better as a result.

When I was pregnant, and as a parent now, this flexibility is everything to me. Being able to pop out for appointments or work from home when my baby is sick without any stress or hassle is worth more than any amount of free food. They allow you to be your 'authentic self' at work which you probably won't think it a big deal for you, until it's a big deal for you! In my personal experience, HubSpot really cares about their employees. So whether you're pregnant, you're unwell, a family member is unwell or there's something else going on in your life, in my case, HubSpot allows you to do your job around that life event (again, within reason). It sounds too good to be true but it's really a win win. They invest a lot in our training and onboarding when we join so why wouldn't they want to help us continue to work to the best of our abilities. Their systems are also set up to allow us to dial into video chats and access documents from anywhere.  As long as you're working hard and getting the job done, that's what matters. It's a great way of managing employees in my opinion. I used to think work/life balance meant getting out the door on time (which never happened in any other company I worked at) but now I know it means being able to fit work in around my life. 

HubSpotters are generally also amazing at helping each other out. The culture is really set up to make people work together. We're encouraged to thank and recognise colleagues who help us out. I've never been thanked more for just doing my job as I am here. And while that might seem like a corny pro, it actually really makes a big difference to your day.

The company also check in with us quarterly to see what issues are concerning us; what they might need to change. The month I started, there had been a big change in how we sell our services which meant people were going through a phase of working late to figure it all out. It became clear in the survey so HubSpot acted on it. Not only did they continue hiring to meet the needs of the company, they also brought in outside support to help us 'unplug' and manage work/life balance. 

Finally, they genuinely do their best to live by the Culture Code. When I read it (at interview stage) I was skeptical. Seemed too good to be true. So I tested it. I asked a bunch of Qs about maternity leave/pay; what the company is doing to help women thrive in tech etc. I was convinced these would go against me but instead, they were seen as positives - meant I was a good culture fit because I cared about the stuff the company cares about. I also love working at a Customer First company. It makes it much easier to do your job.","It's a fast paced company (no doubt!) so if you're looking for a role where you just settle into the job and do the same thing every day, it's not for you. Our products and systems are constantly changing but most HubSpotters find this challenging and for me, it's actually a pro. Keeps the job interesting! But it might not be for everyone so it's worth mentioning it here."

More often than not, CSMs work an unrealistic and unhealthy amount of hours in order to keep afloat. It is common to witness CSMs trying to one up one another by highlighting how much administrative work they accomplish in one business day and how quickly they manage their call volume and overall workload. These tendencies were then encouraged by management rather than focusing on the quality of our efforts with customers. HubSpot endorses that their staff “work smarter, not harder”, but these rituals are both toxic and taxing.  A majority of the Customer Success Manager’s job is to juggle the sheer volume of new customers, which unmanageable long term. There are far too many administrative tasks and unnecessary meetings, which distract from “Solving for the Customer” and allow for less time to be spent on the critical component of relationship building with our customer base."

-Most reps work 9 hours a day and are praised for working over time, despite minimum pay. working overtime seems to imply you are better (from a peer to peer standpoint, and manager to employee)
-Inappropriate to set a metric for ""tickets"" as opposed to ""customers"" at such a high number. I think you would solve for a lot of issues if you hired and trained your support reps in certain areas of the product-- you are doing a disservice to both your support rep and your customer (not setting up anyone for success)
-This role should not be advertised as a way to get somewhere. you need to start hiring people that absolutely love to troubleshoot software--you also need to be way more transparent about the types of troubleshooting that is going to be ""encouraged"" (namely, writing HTML and CSS. This is a huge skill, learning a language... not something to be excluded from a job description or even the interview)
-Speaking of ""encouraged"" troubleshooting... It needs to be way more obvious what a support rep should be responsible for doing. This expectation should begin when the customer purchases the product---and also, make this way more clear during training
-Your wiki is disorganized and impossible to find anything relevant, including your Knowledgebase. Noone can find anything in these places by just searching a  subject; Google seems to be the solution. Please organize your resources.

The people at HubSpot are also very kind and outgoing, so it's not hard to fit in for the most part. Brian Halligan is the man, very motivating, very enthusiastic, and really cares about his employees, as does Dharmesh. Leadership team is excellent, you'll learn more than you could imagine during your time at HubSpot.","The sales team is huge, and it shouldn't be. I think there's a bit over 500 sales reps, and HubSpot really only needs about 200. The territories are extremely saturated, you're given a few zip codes to work with no matter what vertical of business you go into (small biz, corporate, non profit, etc.) You'll spend about 80% of your time prospecting to companies that have already been reached out to by other reps at HubSpot, so to gain new business can be very difficult unless you dedicate 80 hours of prospecting each week. The sales cycle is long but you have support on all ends to help you finish. Would not recommend being an account exec, but if you start off as an SDR you will definitely learn a lot. They keep hiring more and more account execs which is leading to more than 70% of the sales org not meeting their quota.

It is also not very diverse, but then again, not a lot of companies in Boston are. Most of the people are of course white but it's hard to get other nationalities when that's all that is available in Boston. I was one of the few people of color in the entire organization, so of course I felt like we weren't represented very well. Out of the 1000 plus employees, I would say abut 30 or so aren't white. Having said that, I never felt out of place or insulted or anything, everyone is very welcoming. It would just be nice to have more minorities in the crew."

In-office benefits like stocked kitchen, gym, beer, and coffee are nice. 

You learn a lot, and having HubSpot in your resume is always good. 

Fun place to work if you're new to Boston, or just out of college and looking to network with other young people.","There are many problematic elements about working at HubSpot. Many of them are well-documented in prior reviews so I won’t waste space on them here. But here are a few themes that haven’t been delved into too much here. 

Work/Life balance 
Many teams at HubSpot work harder, not smarter. Employees who work long hours are seen as more committed, and more productive. Employees who utilize the “unlimited vacation policy” are often seen as frivolous and lazy. I was encouraged to take fewer days off after my wedding, and even when my spouse was in the hospital. The expectation was you’d always have your laptop “in case anything came up.” If someone left their desk before 6pm, you’d often hear them say something like “I have to go to an appointment but I’ll be back online by 8.” Oftentimes managers would communicate this as well- reinforcing the idea that you needed to be “online” 24/7. 

Age
Much has been said about HubSpot’s lack of diversity. I do believe there’s a good-faith effort to improve this, and I respect the standards they’re trying to set in the industry in this matter.  But what they seem unwilling to address is the lack of age diversity. Among all the people I collaborated with at HubSpot, I’m struggling to think of even one person who was over the age of 35. There are a lot of problems with this, obviously, but one thing that stuck with me was the “inmates running the asylum” vibe. Over and over again, major problems were left to a bunch of 25 years old employees to solve. While we (I was one of those 25 year olds) struggled to find solutions, these “crises” could have been solved easily through the lens of experience. Reflecting back, I often think about how every day felt like a fire drill at HubSpot, and I think much of that is because we all had no frame of reference. It was nearly everyone’s first or second job, and we all could have really benefited from someone working with us that had longevity in the industry, or longevity even in an office setting. 

Ego 
Now here’s something with a harder solve. HubSpot has an ego problem. Employees are told over and over that they’re the best, the most intelligent, etc etc. and that ethos is internalized by many. There’s a “win at all costs” mentality that causes high tension between employees, and fosters and extremely competitive environment internally. There’s a “watch your back” culture- your teammates WILL undercut you to get ahead. Leaders who’ve had complaints leveled against them time and time again continue to get promoted or shuffled around departments. If you provide results (hit your goals, etc) you’ll be held up as a “golden boy” and protected."

From never even considering sales as a career in my college days, the amount of coaching and training I've received at HubSpot has been more than I could have imagined. The learning is constant and I always feel there is more to learn. HubSpot as a whole also has exceptional executive leadership that not only cares about the customer and the growth of the company but on it's employees as well. I'm very bullish not only on the growth and market potential we have but also in the Diversity and Inclusion initiatives that our Co-Founders have places as an area of emphasis. As a sales rep that is also Latino, I've felt very comfortable in my time here, surrounded by ambitious, driven, intelligent, and kind people.","The expectations are consistently high and not without it's stress.

1255,HubSpot,Customer Support Specialist,2018-11-30,2.0,Customer Support Specialist,"HubSpot does a really good job making employees feel very valued at work. They are flexible with the employees’ work life balance. So people are very happy, creates a very welcoming and friendly environment.","Do HubSpot employees really have good quality of living though? It is very difficult to live in Boston with this very low salary. I make less than 40 k at HubSpot. There is no transportation benefit, no meals provided, and no bonus unlike other companies. With HubSpot salary, your quality of living is very pathetic. Unless you want to pay very high rent around Boston, you would have to live very far away. For commuters, cooking at home is not an option, especially if your dept requires you to work late shifts. Nobody has time to cook. You either snack your meals with free snacks in the office or spend a lot of money buying food. There are a lot of employees in the office who snack their meals with chips and cereals from the office. They are brining in smoothie baristas next year, but I bet there are going to be a lot of people drinking smoothie to substitute their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I did not sign up for any health benefits because I cannot deduct any more pay from my salary for that. I just suck it up and suffer through if I ever get sick.

On weekends, you shouldn’t go out with your friends because you would not have any money to save up for your future. They have “unlimited” paid time off, but they should not call it unlimited because who would be dumb enough to take unlimited paid vacation and get fired? Some employees don’t feel comfortable taking vacation because they always say “Use Good Judgement.” 401k? Their match is a joke. You are not going have a bright future here. It is true that they have fun events and food here and there, but they are not even having employee holiday party this year! HubSpot is making a lot of money right now, all time high stocks. Very strange how employees not benefiting much from this. No holiday bonus, awesome. You will not make any fortune out of stock purchase plans.

When I succeed, people help celebrate my success. This culture lays the groundwork for moving fast, failing fast, and continuous iteration which I think is key for success.

Many companies stop caring about their employees' satisfaction as they scale. HubSpot is scaling like crazy and makes sure to invest proportionally in employee satisfaction. I think this will be instrumental in keeping HubSpot as a top destination for talent.

Great product with extreme potential.

I feel like my manager cares about finding work for me that interests me, while addressing the needs of the business.

I have received great mentorship.

Many fun / social opportunities (like mystery dinners, where employees are randomly matched with execs and share a meal together)

Awesome facilities: showers, gym, meditation room, free kitchen, tea-making robot.

Fantastic infrastructure and support for engineers.

Clear communication about requirements for career growth.","401k matching is weak, some flashy benefits offered but 401k matching lags behind."

Their product is great, and customers love it. You actually get to interact with customers as much as you have time for (UX tests, actual dinners with customers, annual conference)
If you haven't so far, at HubSpot you will quickly learn what is actually important when it comes to making software. 
HubSpot is no one trick pony. There is plenty of innovation, new exciting things, and they MOVE FAST!","HubSpot is big on culture and this can be a bit overwhelming. You might feel like you are losing your own identity to it, or that your identity doesn't matter, and it is all about how well you work in the HubSpot system.

- While I believe in the mission of helping organizations grow better, I sometimes find myself doubting whether or not I'm truly making an impact on others' lives - marketing and sales software isn't my passion. That's personal, though
- Flexibility is a double-edged sword: work/life balance sometimes goes down the drain a bit as a result of seeing that others are online at early/late hours and not defining exactly how much time someone should be spending on work.

No deadlines, no release management, no all-day sprint planning, no daily stand-ups and no sprints for that matter. We work as small teams with great autonomy. I can push my work into production any time I am ready, as soon as I am ready, and only when I am ready. Getting my work done is practically frictionless. HubSpot employees are eager to offer assistance and share their collective wisdom. There are teams of software engineers whose sole responsibility is to make life easier for other software engineers. This place is quite unlike any other engineering organization I've ever worked at.","This is not necessarily a ""con"" for everyone, but HubSpot's employees tilt rather young.

Currently, the wording and the pricing of our products are very strictly focused on growing US (or US-focused) companies, and fulfilling their marketing strategies and ideas.

HubSpot is the first company I've ever worked for where I can count on every one of my colleagues to support me when I need it. Departments are so well aligned in their goals, it's almost always in someone's interest to help you, and vice-versa, even if you work for different teams.

- Precision. Brian Halligan (Founder & CEO) recently described this company as a ""laboratory for ideas,"" and that's exactly how it feels. Although the work I do here is consistent with the marketing industry today, HubSpot does it with a precision and at a depth that is hard to come by. You're always given the opportunity to run an experiment or touch a new piece of software that upgrades your business acumen.

- Personal growth. You work with people who are so smart and passionate about their work, it inevitably rubs off on you. I can feel myself getting smarter and faster because of the people I work with every day.

- Amenities. Free food when you need it. Work from home when you want it. The office is so cozy, though, I usually prefer coming in. :)","The first week of training can be overwhelming depending on the department for which you were hired. A lot of information is thrown at you, and while it is all important, it can be hard to sort out what you'll need to know right away to be successful.

This place is a bit of a bootcamp, at least when you start. You work so consistently hard that it's easy to feel swept up in systems and processes that offer little time to digest and ask questions. (You get much better as you go.)

Work-life balance is a priority here, but it might not be inherent to your position. It's up to you to find that balance and protect it -- even if that means having some patience and/or a conversation with your manager."

I've personally found so many opportunities to continue to have an impact and grow and stretch beyond the initial scope of my role. Beyond that, HubSpot cares deeply about its employees and fostering an inclusive environment, which is demonstrated in the continued investment in our employee resource groups, training/development for people managers, and in our benefits. As a working parent who recently went on parental leave, I can't stress enough how much HubSpot's insurance coverage, parental leave, and workplace flexibility has enabled me to fulfill my roles both at work and at home. Can't think of a better place to learn and grow my career.","Things move quickly and we're still figuring out how to communicate change.

People work hard and party hard!
The company paid a lot of effort in promoting diversity and gender equality.","401k much is really low, only 2500"
1314,HubSpot,Still the best place I've ever worked,2018-10-04,5.0,Engineer,"5 years ago, when I set out to find a new job, I really searched for companies that valued their employees. In some of my previous jobs, that was certainly not the case. 

At the time, Dharmesh was just releasing the Culture Code and I was immediately sold. The autonomy, trust, and positive attitude exhibited at HubSpot are far beyond any other company I've worked for in my 20-year career. 

The management team takes the feedback from quarterly (anonymous) employee surveys very seriously and has proven themselves over the years to fix patterns of issues.

As a manager, I've learned a lot on how to help people achieve their goals and take on more responsibility.

As an engineer, I've been able to carve out time to pursue difficult technical challenges and get recognized for them.

The technical infrastructure is amazing, allowing engineers to iterate quickly and ship stuff.

Hands down, this is the best job I've ever had and I'm terribly concerned that if I ever have to leave, I'll be very disappointed that my next company doesn't live up to my experience at HubSpot.","The company has grown a lot and while that allows us to get more done, it also drastically increases the coordination and communication needed to launch a project. Sometimes it's not clear who owns what. It's a bit easier for people who have been here a long time, but I think it's really hard on new folks.

With great power comes great responsibility. If you're not comfortable shipping things and then being on call in case it blows up in the middle of the night, then HubSpot may not be for you. Luckily, we have a lot of resiliency in our architecture, so services are much more reliable than in other companies I've worked at."

This is something I've had an issue with in my career, not feeling like I'm a part of something that's making a difference. I see the difference I'm making each day and it keeps me coming back for more.","Honestly, I don't really have a con for working at HubSpot. That being said, you're in control of your own destiny. HubSpot will allow you to grow, but you have to want it. You have to be curious. You have to be dedicated to being the best. If you do, then HubSpot is a place for you, because they allow you to create your own opportunities."
1317,HubSpot,Amazing Place to Work!,2018-10-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been with HubSpot for just under a year and have loved every minute of it. The work I do is engaging and my team and managers have been nothing but supportive. As the company is growing so quickly, there have been a lot of changes in the short amount of time that I have been here but also a chance to take on new projects and grow my skill sets. I see a lot of potential for me to grow with this company.","Not really a con but just a couple things to keep in mind when considering if it is the right fit. HubSpot is growing quickly so that means there is always a lot going on and a lot of new projects could come your way, so you have to be adaptable. Another thing HubSpot values is autonomy. You won't find a micro manager which is great, but if you like to have a lot of feed back and a lot direction on what you should be doing you will want to be clear about that with your manager."

1321,HubSpot,"HubSpot is the ""Google"" of Boston",2018-10-04,5.0,Product Manager,"Very autonomous environment with a lot smart people who are motivated. But not smart in a  competitive or aggressive way. I've experienced 0 top-down pressure. I feel like I have the freedom to really dive into customer problems and be creative about solving them. HubSpot is customer obsessed and actually means it. The product hierarchy feels really flat.

The culture is so friendly and genuine. People just say ""hi"" in the morning even if they don't know you. Simple stuff like that really matters. Also, dog friendly environment, UM WHAT. Amazing.

The CEOs don't treat themselves like gods and I literally just saw one of the CEOs (Brian) walking around with his dog. They are very involved, but not in a control-freak type way. Their visions are also sound and reasonable, yet inspiring. They are smart dudes!","It's a growing company so there are some growing pains obviously associated with that. For example, not every team is on the same methodology...some practice Scrum, some don't practice anything. It's a very engineering focused culture with little project management so sometimes that's stressful because you never know what's going on or what the focus is. It feels like there's an aversion to process because they want to keep that ""startup"" feel.

As a PM, you really gotta drive that focus or else things feel chaotic. Because each team is autonomous, you can try implementing some new stuff if your tech lead allows you to.

The product culture is also learning how to measure success with releases. It seems like a new topic that they're trying to implement.

There are some weird product/engineering things that need to be fixed, but it doesn't impact my positive feeling of working here. They just need to be open to new things and adopting practices from the top software companies."

- Career growth, HubSpot doesn't just use this as a recruiting gimmick. Managers work with you to find out where your strengths are and what areas of the business you would most thrive in!
- We can't talk about HubSpot without thinking about the company culture. From flexible schedules and endless food/coffee to quality healthcare, retirement, and investment options it's one of the best I've seen in the industry!

Even in the last 10 months that I have been here, HubSpot has grown at a rapid pace and it keeps the environment so exciting. 
The awareness around work/life balance is also very appreciated. 95% of the time, I love coming into work and collaborating with my peers (and playing with all the dogs). But 5% of the time I need a mental health day, or I would rather work from my couch in pjs. My quality of work doesn't decrease - in fact, knowing that I can do that and not feel weirdly guilty about it like I did at my last job,  increases my productivity. Thank you, HubSpot, for understanding that sometimes we need to listen to our bodies and take care of ourselves....AND we are still dedicated to our careers. Many companies feel like that is an OR statement.","Double edged sword - with the rapid growth and so many new products being launched, it can be really difficult to keep up.

Being surrounded by super smart people that are all aligned towards the hubspot mission provides a sense of: we’re all apart of something greater than ourselves.","Diversity is definitely the first thing that comes to mind. There are not a lot of people or color ESPECIALLY in sales. There has been a couple things put in place to make the sales org more inclusive, however, there’s a lot of work that needs to be done.

Flexibility - we are trusted to get our work done.  There is a lot to do, but I never feel like I am forced to work on someone else's schedule.  Many people on my team work remotely whenever they need to.

Growth trajectory  - We are growing fast.  I feel like we are only in the beginning stages of growth.  This is a positive for the company and also for my personal career growth.  I'm confident my career will grow as the company continues to grow.

 People care - Not only are the people hardworking, but I genuinely feel like the people I work with care about me as a person.  They care about my personal and professional goals.  I come to work everyday feeling like I can bring my whole-self.

Diversity & Inclusion - We still have a long way to go to build a ""company our grandkids will be proud of"", but there has been significant progress to make HubSpot a more diverse and inclusive team.  Our leadership team has made this a core priority and have put resources behind our diversity & inclusion efforts.","If you don't like working in the ""grey"" and ambiguity, this may not be the place for you.  We move fast and everyone is empowered to make decisions without always having all of the details.  This is a strength for some, but I've seen it be overwhelming for others.  If you are looking for a more predictable pace and structure, HubSpot is not the place for you."
1335,HubSpot,Great opportunities but stay vigilant,2018-09-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The entry level tech support position is a great opportunity for someone like me who's switching career paths or just starting in the software industry. The training is thorough and the experience you get working with customers is EXTREMELY valuable - you can completely start your software career from zero here, and the skills are transferrable if you decide you'd like to work at another company. Once you get out of Support, or if you start at a higher position, there's a strong feeling of belonging to a community and being truly respected and appreciated by your colleagues for people who do good work. The benefits are unbelievable so you'll definitely feel comfortable and taken care of. It seems like you also have some pretty extreme job security because the company basically refuses to fire anyone unless they're a colossal failure, but I'm not sure if I would 100% consider that a ""pro."" 

I have a lot of negative thoughts I'm going to share below but I don't want it to come across the wrong way - the pros GREATLY outweigh the cons at HubSpot. There are only a handful of positions here where you'll feel under-appreciated and underpaid. If you're smart and responsible, you'll move up quickly and you'll have fun doing it. The culture is fast-paced and challenging in an exciting way, Brian and Dharmesh are absolute wonders to be associated with, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to grow and succeed. The benefits are excellent and will make even the less-desirable positions comfortable. Take advantage of the unlimited time off, free healthy food in the kitchen, crazy good health care, and generous sabbatical!","If you're starting in Support, as many people at HubSpot do, GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN. The work is grueling, hours are long, expectations are ridiculously high, and you'll be abused pretty regularly by customers (although this has gotten a lot better since they've put restrictions on who can call into the support phone line). The success of the company is so heavily reliant on support (a lot of customers list support at the top of their reasons for choosing HubSpot over competitors) but no one cares about you at all except for your direct manager (DIRECT support management is amazing, to be fair). Sales and account managers will throw you under the bus or bully you into spending your whole day on difficult side projects for their customers so they don't have to do their jobs. 

The pay is super low even for an entry level tech support position, and the majority of jobs that are readily available to you after a year or 2 in support come with insultingly measly pay raises. View these positions as stepping stones. You're not getting everything you can out of the company until you're 2-3 steps away from Support. That being said, don't give Support too much of yourself while you're there. You'll get ahead by doing your job well and networking and that's it - don't waste your time on side projects and overtime because it will not benefit you, and the second you show that you're willing to put in extra work, upper management will bleed you dry. Keep your head down and trudge forward if you want to succeed here, and be wary of your low-effort colleagues. For some reason HubSpot refuses to reprimand kids in Support who do *under* the bare minimum and continuously make HUGE mistakes. These people will make your job so much harder because they're looking for every excuse to put their work on your plate so they can go enjoy the free beer. Don't befriend these people, and when their lack of effort starts to effect you, just go right to their manager and move on. They're not worth your time.

Now that I'm out of Support I enjoy my job SO MUCH MORE. In fact, this is my favorite job I've ever had, despite the fact that I'm still not getting paid a competitive rate. I'll take the lower pay for a job I truly enjoy and the feeling of genuine respect in the workplace though. 

The last thing I'll say about HubSpot is that you should be wary of the work culture. Especially when you're in Support, they'll try to distract you with constant social events and parties. It honestly feels like a frat house at times and there seems to be this constant pressure to drink and party, especially when you first start. Like with any other job, just be careful. Go to the social events that seem fun to you or that will actually help you network. If you're going to drink, do so lightly and skip the afterparties. If you're in Support, I would honestly recommend not going to any parties if you can avoid it. Finish your work and go home because otherwise the office will become home and it gets unhealthy really quickly. Since it's so common for people to start drinking at the office, the line of when work ends and time off begins gets blurred and things can get ugly. People have no boundaries and are constantly embarrassing themselves by talking about private/personal things that should NEVER be discussed in the office. Don't be one of them. Trust me, I've made that mistake a few times during my early days at HubSpot and I'm still humiliated."

Even before being hired I felt that I had already picked up a lot of interviewing skills and they openly give you tips on how I could have made my answer or preparation a bit more polished. 

While it wasn't an easy process, but I definitely appreciated what I learnt and it made me realise that HubSpot was somewhere that was genuinely interested in developing my professional and personal capital.

Throughout the entire interview process my two main points of contact were Elayne and Yuan from the Singapore office.

No real growth opportunities. Work-life balance looks more like a metric to hit rather than actually caring about this balance. Employees forced to work back-to-back tasks non-stop all day and pressured to go home on time. A lot of burnout.
1352,HubSpot,Sales,2018-08-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots to write here. The month-long new-hire onboarding is very intensive but a good bootcamp for learning about the company, the product, and the industry. As long as you are hitting you're number, you can enjoy the amenities of flexible work (remote). Their investment in building a culture team shows as an employee with numerous events at the office as well as after hours/weekends. My favorite part of working here was the learning - from colleagues as well as the Hub Talks where they bring in executives from other companies to share their story.","In sales, it was a bit of an extra grind with monthly quotas which further amplified ""what have you done for me lately"" feeling. There would be pressure to oversell/force a sale too quickly at the expense of hitting a monthly number from your direct managers/directors at points. Managers also are overworked/spread too thin so the employees that work under them get limited development/coaching because their manager is often running around in meetings, interviews, etc... This in turn leads to the 1:1s to be about your forecast and spreadsheets and less on coaching and developing with deals. There was also a lack of development for reps wanting to move into manager roles - a lot of it is left to you with the expectation that you won't get a manager job until having interview several times."
1353,HubSpot,Remarkable Onboarding Experience,2018-07-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"After 6+ years at agencies, to say that I was nervous to start at HubSpot was an understatement. I was starting in a new role and in a brand new industry, but after my first day of training, I knew I had made the right decision. The onboarding experience was something I had never encountered before and made my transition comfortable. Beyond product training, thanks to my manager I had my own training and onboarding projects that set me up for success. I continue to learn each and every day at HubSpot and love working for a company that is so transparent, flexible and values each and every employee as individuals embracing their strengths and differences.","It's truly up to each and every manager to set up new hires for success. The L&D team is fantastic with robust product training, but I'm not sure I would have felt so secure in my new role if I hadn't had the specific onboarding projects from my manager afterwards, so I would continue to encourage managers to put the effort into thinking about the best way to train new hires for specific roles to ensure success."

- Everything is in the Wiki. From the latest marketing experiments (which in my opinion, are pieces written 10x better than any you'd find on growthhackers.com), to the Management team's targets, focus, thoughts, and priorities. I can spend hours going down the rabbit hole in this encyclopedia of knowledge from the smartest people globally. There's best practices and playbooks all documented, learnings and experiences from individuals who've been there done that, that we recently needed to have someone's full time job as a Wiki Manager to organise this world of information.

- Culture. From projects working on diversity and inclusion, to ensuring that there are plentiful employee engagement activities, there's a lot of activities planned, if only you have time, bother to attend, show up, and engage in them.

- Learning. This spans not just your own job scope, but also personal development, and future career growth. There are just so much resources available to tap on, like taking Managerial lessons if you intend to be a Manager one day, to attending workshops like becoming a trusted advisor. Seriously, it doesn't get better than this. There's $5k tuition grant and a free Kindle books program. HubSpot really invests A LOT in educating employees to be the smartest of the lot. 

If you are looking for somewhere to stand, HubSpot is a giant. Anyone driven enough is invited to stand on its shoulders to look further than what one can on him/herself.",One of the biggest cons of a big company is that there are cliques and silos formed within teams. Humans tend to gravitate toward similar people with similar experiences. One of the ways we deal with that is to play musical chairs and physically move people around at their desks so different teams get to be near each other.

1370,HubSpot,How good can it really be? Short: Really good.,2018-05-16,5.0,Customer Success,"Every part of the interview process was extremely well thought out and honestly enjoyable from a candidate stand point. The team really puts the effort into understanding your baseline for Inbound and if a good fit after the initial video interview (worst, most awkward part for me) and phone screen  making sure the candidate is set up for success when talking to a hiring manager. 

You definitely get put through the gambit during the onsite portion. I spoke to three managers and two directors in 30 minute sequential meetings. All were great, but particularly the Service Director. It really wasn’t an interview after the first minute or two of talking to him. It was a conversation, and an insightful, engaging one at that. A++ 

From the minute you’re brought on, you have a huge wealth of freedom and autonomy to just get things.. done. Everyone deeply believes in the company and the product and I may have had one or the other in previous roles but rarely if ever both with other companies.  Definitely cool.","Training can at times lack structure. There were times during the two week training you would come in, have a session for an hour and have a blank calendar the rest of the day. Perfectly fine if you use good judgement (hint) but you may struggle if you’re not used to building out your own day or if you learn best in traditional student-teacher dynamic."

I really love the people I work with.. we higher on culture really well and i've seen fantastic sales people not hired as they weren't seen as culture fits.

Unlimited leave and solid balance on work/life balance

Very flat structure - exposure and access to Execs is very easy

One of the most transparent organizations ever, the humility of the C-suite, the regular candid posts and communications on both wins/losses is just amazing considering the size of our org

Top class inside-sales training, you spend a lot of time overseas in product training and have regular training after you come back as well. Once you return you have a senior sales rep to shadow and you are also put on a lengthy ""ramp"" to get you ready for a full quota.

Regular sales competitions with equity, cash, travel prizes

The product/vision is something you can really get behind if you are passionate about helping businesses grow","HubSpot has traditionally hired a certain type that really want to over-perform - but this has resulted at times in a sales org that doesn't take as many breaks as necessary. We have unlimited leave (completely paid for) but not as many people feel OK to take it .

Very sales driven org and have seen examples of a top sales rep get away with a lot more discrepancies then typically would be allowed. Really reminded me that results can matter more then doing the right thing but this was the only time I have been disappointed by management.

You have to be either really talented or work very hard when you first begin to do well- a lot of our sales managers are either new or promoted from top senior reps which means they can't teach to sell the solution yet or they are only just learning how to manage people. Expect to pick things up quickly or rely on senior sales reps."

1388,HubSpot,Life in Sales @ HubSpot Sydney,2018-03-31,4.0,Account Executive,"Good place to work for, great benefits and recently fixed pay so you can expect to be happy from a compensation perspective. 

If you’re a high achiever, expect good stock incentives, commission and international travel perks, some of the best I have seen. 

You can expect some fairly good flexibility when it comes to taking extended holidays, time off and working away, depending on the manager. 

Really good senior leadership outside of ANZ, although you don’t get to meet a lot of them, expect to still be guided by smart people. 

When leaders do respect you, they do everything they can to help your career at HubSpot. It’s a great atmosphere in that sense. 

You will have a crazy amount of people who want to talk to you and love HubSpot. In order to win here, expect to work hard and smart, be a great at telling stories and have a consultive sales approach.","Hubspot ANZ focuses too much on internal hiring, which naturally results in the wrong people for the job. HubSpot does a really bad job at sourcing for managers externally, some of the worst I have come across. 

Expect your manager to be incredibly green / new and rely on good reps to mentor you.  If you expect the manager to guide you, you will fail in this setting as you will feel like you’re teaching them how to manage people. This could change in the future, however is a current pain in the office. Managers come in with no training, so in a way you can’t blame them, but just be mindful of this. 

Working flexibility arrangements aren’t the same in ANZ, so be careful about reading the culture code and expecting the same in our office, because it won’t be. This is the same for reps at 70% of target or 150% of target, so don’t expect to be a high achiever and have more flexibility. 

It’s a very young office, so you will need to be okay with heaps of banter, silly chats and young people. I don’t mind this but you will need to be aware of this culture. Average age is probably 24-26.

You might complain about culture, or fill out our quarterly ENPS to give feedback. Expect nothing to be actioned, but constantly here “we’re working on how we can improve this”.  My 2 cents is that because everyone is so green, they don’t know where to start."

I like the perks -- work from home, bring your dog to work, unlimited vacation, sabbatical, transparent decision making, etc.

I like being on a winning team.",Its hard work.  You gotta bring your A game and be good.
1434,HubSpot,This is what I've been searching for,2017-10-20,5.0,Director of Engineering,"I've worked in the software industry in the northeast for more than a decade, and while I've been successful there's always been something missing. At HubSpot I feel like I've finally found what I've been looking for (take that, U2). I know that sounds like a big statement but everything I've seen in engineering aligns so perfectly with the values I've practiced and preached, from the top of the stack to the bottom. I don't want to bore you to death with an essay, but here are some of the things that really stand out:

* The technical talent on the team is amazing. I've worked with brilliant engineers in the past, but the consistent level of intelligence, capability, and competence here is impressive.

* The passion the entire team gives and the pride they take in what we're doing is such a motivator and inspiration. I've read the same stuff you have about the 'cult'; it couldn't be farther from the truth. This is hard working people taking pride in what they've accomplished.

* The lack of bureaucracy and process is so refreshing. It's focused on Just Effing Doing It instead of endlessly debating and needing sign-off from eighty nine different levels. This can definitely take some getting used to because leadership is largely just sketching a very rough outline and everyone else is not only filling it in, but erasing the lines and redrawing as they see fit. It can sometimes feel like we're veering around a bit, but leadership does a fantastic job of catching that just as it's beginning to show signs of a problem and correcting it.

* I didn't realize how much the politicking at my old company was affecting me until I came to a place where... well... it doesn't happen. There's a real lack of kingdom building or ladder climbing - and instead it's very much a bottoms-up mentality with a focus on what you've done and not how well you play the game.

* Competence and excellence are recognized and rewarded. It's not about who you know or what group you're in; if you do awesome stuff it's seen and celebrated. I was so tired of needing to brown nose to get ahead. Here I've told my boss to his face he was wrong, or that I disagreed with our leadership, or that I was going to do something and didn't care what he thought, and rather than being smacked down I was thanked for pushing for what I knew was right.

* The culture here is Absolutely. Fantastic. There's an commitment to employee satisfaction that they really do take seriously. There are regular satisfaction surveys, we have people dedicated to making it an enjoyable place to work, the company's very willing to spend money on things that could be considered frivolous - like team lunches, or trivia nights - and any tool you need to do your job better is essentially yours. I'm not naive enough to think that this is all altruism, but it definitely feels like the company cares about us as people. And what's more, that belief and focus is practiced and felt at all levels, by everyone here.

I know that all this sounds too good to be true or like I'm a soulless shill, but I couldn't be happier with my decision to move here. If you're looking for a place that dispenses with the crap, does awesome things, hires amazing talent, and treats its employees with respect and kindness you could do a hell of a lot worse than HubSpot. I'm looking forward to many more years here.","This isn't a place that caters to passivity. If you're looking for a lot of hand-holding or you need structure in order to be successful then this really isn't for you. Our entire philosophy is based around small, very technical, autonomous teams, and that requires those teams to be extremely self-driven and self-directing. There's plenty of help if you ask, but if you're expecting someone to give your formal requirements, document the steps you should follow, or shepherd you through your day-to-day you're going to be sorely disappointed. We want passionate, driven, opinionated people who aren't going to sit back and let someone else make all the decisions.

Our lack of structure and process is almost a negative, and I'll be the first to admit we probably need a little bit more. We're growing rapidly but we don't do an amazing job of defining defaults that lead people to the right solutions, which means every new tech lead or engineer has to figure a lot out for themselves. I think we could stand to do a better job structuring things (just a tiny bit more!) so that people fall into success more easily."

Instead of contacting me about my concerns as a former employee, HubSpot decided to reach out to someone that is tangentially connected to this situation for feedback on an experience that he knows nearly nothing about.  HubSpot epitomizes what is wrong with the world today and is a remarkable example of modern day discrimination, cultural insensitivity, institutionalized racism, implicit white bias and income inequality.   

Martin Luther King, Jr. once wrote that ""most whites in America proceed from a premise that equality is a loose expression for improvement.""  I stand by my belief that HubSpot is not diverse in the faintest sense.

What most people are most attracted to (unlimited vacation etc.) is actually not what keeps me in my job. I get to work with the best group of people, both here in Sydney and all over the world in our other offices. I have a fantastic manager who pushes me to achieve things I never thought I could (or rather that I never *think* I can, until I look back and see how far I've come).

I find my work-life balance has ups and downs. Sometimes I'm flat out and all I think about is work, but on the flipside, I never get downtrodden by it as I have the best team and we're all in it together. The fact I'm able to manage my own schedule (when I work, and where I work) with no questions asked really helps too, as even when things are crazy, I can still fit my job around the rest of my life."

- There is so much opportunity to make an impact

- Being B2B means that our users are using this software day in and day out and running their businesses on HubSpot, which gives you a lot more reason to care about the customers vs working someplace like Facebook

- People are generally automonous with the right level of communication

- Meetings are kept to be as few as possible, as few people as possible, as little time as possible, as productive as possible, so there is plenty of developer time and no time spent in unneccessary meetings

- People work around 40 hours a week, NOT 50-60

- No the unlimited vacation doesn't mean you can just not come to work, but it also doesn't mean you can't take time off. People take more time off on average than companies with a fixed amount of PTO. I'd rather not have to save up time off just in case I need it than have my leftover PTO paid out when I leave.

- Working from home is not frowned upon

- Upper management is transparent

- It never gets boring because we never get complacent, everything is always changing, growing, moving forward

- No deductible on health insurance","Everything I can think of to put here is things other people might not like, like all the change and fast pace, but I don't see that as a con myself"

If any of the cons below sounds a bit familiar, move within or out of the company, seeing those things in 2017 is not worth it.","Subtle misogyny and sexism exists. It's saddening things like:

""Be careful on what you write on interview reviews, European candidates can request transcripts"", and those emails are not talking about confidential information but about language, disguised sexist jokes.

I've seem post-interviews starting with: let's hire the attractive one to boost moral.
Jokingly comments like: Be impartial even though girls are not you thing - directed to a male employee.

Upper management acting inappropriately towards other employee, making suggestive (and highly questionable) comments on private subjects.

It's not rare to hear comments like ""That's how that person is"" or "" They do a great job, it was just a silly comment"", when things like the ones above described come up in conversations.

It's conflicting and infuriating to see a lot of people playing along (power/hierarchy situation) makes one wonder: are they trying to survive or is this just how they truly are?"

I know it is a priority for the leadership team, but the lack of diversity is a con. 

Another con is compensation - salary is less than competitors."

1461,HubSpot,Great place to thrive as a high performer,2017-09-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you're dedicated and self-motivated, you'll do very well at HubSpot. It's not and never will be a place to blend into the scenery. You've got to do more than your job description and be eager and proud to do so, and I think that's where the ""drink-the-kool-aid"" comments come from. As you'll see, I'm solidly not that, but I love HubSpot, warts and all, and I firmly believe that the company has nowhere to go but up.

I've seen people go from zero to near-C-level in under two years here. Is that everyone? Of course not. HubSpot absolutely means it when they say you can be a high-performing individual contributor your entire career (I am one). But for people who want to move up the org chart, and have the chops to do so, HubSpot absolutely provides the framework and the support to give someone that chance.

The perks are nice. Beer and unlimited vacation and a barista and all that good stuff is nice, but it's actually secondary. Because we have those perks, it means we only have people who can have those perks and not abuse them. The caliber of the ""average"" HubSpotter is anything but average. Every single HubSpotter has something to learn from and be impressed by.","Remarkably few. One, because HubSpot is willing to take risks on people and helps them move up the ranks, people sometimes do get promoted before they're ready for it. There's nothing more demotivating than a bad manager, and I've seen entire teams underperform for months while a bad manager is either coached or replaced. I'm not sure there's an easy fix here. On the whole, it's a good thing that HubSpot gives those people those chances. There probably needs to be more guardrails and mentoring around this to identify where a newbie manager is potentially having cascading negative effects.

Second, and this one is some tough love from me, but it needs to be said: You need to toe the line on some things. If you're politically conservative, keep it to yourself. If you're liberal, preach it from the rooftops. HubSpot, for all its diversity and inclusion efforts (which are admirable!), does not allow for certain political viewpoints to be shared at all, and certainly not respected. On the one hand, it's not surprising that the majority of the company is more liberal. However, the Women@HubSpot and LGBTQ Alliance use Hillary Clinton campaign slogans in their ""official"" materials. I get it, I'm solidly liberal, and I don't think it's done with any sort of malice, but I've seen people basically shouted down and degraded for expressing any view that isn't solidly on the left side of our political spectrum. I know a few conservative folks at HubSpot, and I know for a fact they fear for their careers to even engage in debate on certain issues. It's never good for anyone to feel silenced, and in this manner, it's happening here. It's a glaring dark spot on HubSpot's supposed openness, and it needs to change. I am sure that it will in time, but it's something to be aware of if you are in that set and are considering HubSpot to work for right now. Hopefully in a few years, this won't be the case."
1462,HubSpot,Great place to work. Seriously.,2017-09-20,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"There's a reason HubSpot keeps winning best place to work awards. It really is a great place to be. The company truly cares about the wellbeing of their employees and shows that through great benefits and perks, transparency with employees on the direction of the company, and a strong management team. 

There's a culture here where, no matter your role, if you have something to say, your voice will be heard. 

The people working here are consistently whip-smart, super hard working and generally fun to be around. Come for the free candy wall, stay for a great career.

Benefits include:
Tuition reimbursement
Unlimited vacation
Free books
Stocked kitchen

And of course, the CANDY WALL! (my favorite)","As we become a bigger company, we're going through the growing pains of a scale up.  On the upside, everyone's aware and making an effort to create simplicity in all processes."
1463,HubSpot,HubSpotters,2017-09-20,5.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"- Health insurance coverage has been the best I've had - lowest of costs and the company takes care of the deductibles.
- The pay is fair or above market value - the employee reserved stock units is often what makes your pay exceed the market value
- New hires are pliable and extremely coachable, experienced hires are people who are ""remarkable"" at their prior roles; I've learned a lot from my peer.
- Work-life balance is real here, same with unlimited vacation. You take what is needed and the team absorbs your absence with a plan. 
- People care about other people - so much that we'll often sacrifice our own goals to work on someone else's project that requires our expertise so that it succeeds. 
- If someone spills coffee in a meeting, the following will happen without fail: the closest people will drop their surroundings to help, the people on the outer ring will look for paper towels, and then the hive mind solves the problem. 
- The company structure changes every year, to best facilitate problems that need to be solved in the near future.","- Free waffles on Wednesdays occasionally gets cancelled
- Boardgame nights start way too late in the day
- Mystery Dinners (eat with a C-suite, chat, paid by HubSpot) favors a younger crowd without family commitments
- HubSpotters feeling ""entitled"" to company perks (like all three mentioned points mentioned above)
- On a more serious note, the company structure will occasionally make employees lose morale. Turnover tends to occur during those times, but it is still way below the industry average."
1464,HubSpot,Challenging and rewarding work,2017-09-20,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"HubSpot is an incredible place to work and grow your career. I find the work to be challenging in the best way. I've got a manager who supports me wholeheartedly, an executive team that listens and takes action, and peers that are insanely smart, talented, and driven. I've been given the tools I need to succeed, but I have to work hard to provide value for our customers and hit my numbers. 

Something I really appreciate is that the company practices what it preaches with HEART and our mission. Being in such a transparent workplace is even better than I expected, and the company is open when we aren't meeting goals. It's pretty cool to see it all in action. 

Another thing I really value is the number of opportunities I have to get involved outside of the 9-5. A few awesome things I'm involved with are Women at HubSpot, People of Color at HubSpot, HubSpot on the Town, book clubs (thanks, free book program!), Healthy at HubSpot, and even a Ru Paul's Drag Race fantasy league.","It is an incredibly fast-paced place, so it's not built for everyone.  For example, I used the unlimited paid time off to take a 2-week vacation and when I came back there were a number of big changes that took place in what seems like the blink of an eye. I personally love this, but it can be tough at times."

I work on challenging problems and often lead systems design on these projects. The people I work with are brilliant and I learn a ton from them. Working in BET I also get to learn a lot about how our business runs and how we're helping it grow. This is not something I expected when I joined, but has been an unanticipated benefit. 

Beyond the work itself, HubSpot is a great place to be. The benefits are fantastic and the company really cares about its employees","A lot of growing pains that I'm sure many companies experience. It often feels very siloed between departments and cross functional projects can be extremely difficult. The level of politics within the company as a whole has risen during my time here and sometimes it feels like we're doing things to placate peoples egos rather than move the company in the right direction. But these are exceptions rather than the rule. 

It also feels like we love starting big new initiatives and then abandoning them without notice after about a month. We should have more follow through or be more transparent about our focuses changing."

1469,HubSpot,Work/Life Balance + Intense Career Growth,2017-09-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"HubSpot is an amazing place to work. Being here for a little over a year, I've seen us scale in number of employees, overall revenue generation, perks, and professional development opportunities.  We've seen hardships along the way, but I can honestly say that 80% of the changes we've made have been undoubtedly for the betterment of the company as a whole, and have spilled over unto us as individuals, to enrich our daily work life. Our constant push to always be improving really affects each of us in unique ways, and in my opinion it's always for the better.  

One of the top reasons I stay at HubSpot is because of the work/life balance and flexibility to make your own schedule.  Although my friends and family may not at times think I have the best ""work/life"" balance, the way I structure my time is completely up to me, and I capitalize on our Unlimited Vacation policy often.  It's incredibly refreshing to be able to map out your own days and schedule, and be able to enjoy things in life outside of work, whether they are during the typical work day or not. 

I've been able to grow on my own at HubSpot in numerous ways due to the autonomy that has been given to me, and our Culture + L&D teams have done tremendous work in making sure that outside and internal trainings are available and top of mind to anyone who would like to attend.  There are so many leaders here that actually care, and it's just an amazingly collaborative environment that I feel truly stems from our upper management and executive team in a trickle down effect.","Although we are self-proclaimed ""policy averse"", there are times when policy and direction are paramount to success, and I think we fall flat there in many areas. I think we can do a better job of operationalizing our day to day, without losing sight of our customers as the main focus.  I think in a lot of ways HubSpot isn't a company that appeals to everyone, and I think we need to change this approach as we grow.  While this may be okay when we are a mid-sized company, this won't be an optimal way to operate once we become very large.  There are many ""cultural issues"" we face as an organization, and while I feel our company culture is mostly positive, I think there are pockets of teams here that operate in ways that wouldn't work for every type of background/personality/culture, and in my opinion we need to look outside of our bubble more often to create a more conducive environment that serves all types of people around the globe if we want to stay relevant as a Global leader in our industry."
1470,HubSpot,Best Company I've Ever Worked for So Far!,2017-09-13,5.0,Associate Product Manager,"Incredible sense of transparency... 
The company LIVES by the Culture Code... It's not just a marketing stunt.
Everyone has incredible passion and love for the company. They genuinely want to help and do the best they can to make HubSpot's users successful and in turn, make HubSpot successful. 

Team independence is awesome as well. You don't get buried by processes... move fast, ship it and measure!","A few growing pains... Nothing out of the ordinary but super interesting time to be a part of the company if you're OK with change. 

Salaries can be a bit lower and the benefit packages less than a major corporation... but every company has it's give and take. Salary might be a bit lower but you get a whole lot of culture and excitement in your day-to-day which more than makes up for it in my opinion."
1471,HubSpot,"Decent place to get started, but doesn't reward tenure",2017-09-13,3.0,Operations,"HubSpot is tremendously transparent internally and owns that 'T' in the culture deck. Hand-in-hand with the transparency, many challenges/opportunities are available for anyone in the company to take initiative on. Moreover, I've always felt that I have the autonomy to manage my work schedule and design my own approaches to solving problems. 

The people of color culture is great, and it's fantastic to see enough people who truly gets it and care about it enough to push through with many initiatives to drive D&I.","The compensation is considerably lower than market value, and raises will get you stuck perpetually in catch-up mode because they're positioned as % raises. 

As HubSpot has grown, I have felt the business > team > individual paradigm of ""use good judgment"" erode. Now it feels more like team > individual > business. More time is spent ""talking about talking"" to see which team gets the credit rather than simply doing a piece of work that benefits the business. Team priorities are set up similarly so forget about helping another department with something quick (even if it takes <1 hr and has a high impact on the business) because ""it's not on the roadmap"". The only ways to overcome this has been to either positioning the ask so they see what's in it for them or going to upper management.

I've seen many top, A-level people leave as a result of either compensation or bad management, reducing them from someone who was tremendously helpful to others to having to deal with politics and become jaded."

There is nothing that fires me up more than being on a growing team and moving from a mere application, to a stack of tools, to eventually a platform and figuring out how to become a facebook, amazon, oracle, etc. catered to SMBs. The possibilities really are endless for the company from that perspective as they have gone from Marketing tools, to Sales tool and more.

As an individual contributor, the possibilities are endless as well for what career path you want to carve out assuming you can over perform.","What makes me nervous as we push to this idea of becoming a platform, is the speed in which we do it. I've worked for companies where they thought the timing was right to add fuel to fire and as a result essentially spontaneously combusted because things needed to be ironed out internally first before truly thinking up hyper growth.

Also, transparency I think is becoming more of an issue. As an organization who preaches how transparent we are, I think this has become a little distant compared to years past for front line employees to the c-suite....even though we say we are transparent. January is shockingly not that far away and I think there is a ton of unknown still on a month to month basis."

But HubSpot, like most growing startups/scaleups is not great at change management. There is good transparency, but that does not necessarily equate to good communication. There is thrash at times because the org structure does not support the goals that leadership sets for the company (which seem directionally correct, but execution is lacking).

The company is very young and lacks diversity in many areas (race, women in leadership, etc), though there is a genuine effort to improve here."

Culture, Opportunities, Transparency, Flexibility. The list goes on and on and on and on. At HubSpot I learned that you can have life/work balance. I learned that life happens people will stop, listen and help. The environment is perfect for you to grow as a person and professional. 
Bottom line, for anyone reading this, if you have the chance to work at HubSpot, go for it and fully embrace the opportunity, it will probably be the best experience in your life, it will forever change your perception of work and people (for the best).
HubSpot made me a better person and a much much much better professional.
Kudos to all People Operation, you are doing a fantastic job on creating and maintaining a great work environment.",There's still small cultural subsets here and there that doesn't quite fit the company culture.

1511,HubSpot,The BEST place ever to start your sales career,2017-08-09,5.0,Business Development,"HubSpot has done an amazing job at balancing what's important. There's so much autonomy within the organisation, paired with carefully thought-out and rolled-out processes. 

I started as an Inbound Sales Coordinator and am now in a Principal BDR role. The promotion path in sales is incredibly transparent, and hard work is both recognised and rewarded. My managers have challenged me and been incredibly supportive since day 1. 

The people at HubSpot are some of the best you'll ever meet, both incredibly helpful and hard-working. The culture code isn't a PR front to get people in the door — sure, it's a little cheesy, but it really is embedded within the entire org which is so wonderful to be a part of.

- Flexibility: I have a family outside of the East Coast and being able to visit them and having my team and HubSpot understand that is a priority is amazing","Currently, the only downside I see at HubSpot is that we are only located in the Eastern part of the United States which limits our ability to reach out in the States for other talent."

Many organizations have mission statements or sets of company values. HubSpot lives the company values from the bottom up and the top down. The management team believes in hiring people with HEART (Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable, Transparent). When you trust the people around you, you let the politics of a typical workplace slide away, and focus on delivering a fantastic customer experience and product.","The majority of employees are young professionals (which is dynamic and fun), but sometimes lacks years of real-world experience. The executive team has made up for this over time by hiring more experienced managers/directors/VPs.

- Surrounded by bright, hard working and motivated people. 
- Very flexible work environment.  Mentality is come in, get your work done, and leave.  Managers never expect their people do be at their desks just for face time.
- People are encouraged to think outside of the box and if there is a better way to do something you are encouraged to speak up and recommend/implement change.  You never hear anyone say ""well that's how we've always done it so we can't change""","- Company is growing very quickly and is in scale up mode.  Always a lot to do, pace can be very hectic and you have to expect and be comfortable with constant change.  This kind of environment definitely isn't for everyone.
- There is a decent amount of ""group think"" on various topics given the young demographic of employees and the company's front line leaders.  If you don't feel the same way about certain topics there is a tendency for the ""group"" to dismiss your opinion - you'll need to be comfortable speaking up and challenging people if you want your voice to be heard and you're not aligned with the vocal few that are passionate about the topic at hand."

1558,HubSpot,What do you want to learn? Do it here.,2017-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This place has pushed me in a lot of ways -- it's almost overwhelming the number of different skills, tactics, knowledge, frameworks, etc. that I could choose to focus on and learn from my colleagues, customers and prospects. 

I love the autonomy, I love the opportunity to move around internally and work cross-functionally. If you are comfortable seeking out opportunities and taking big jumps in your career, this is the place to do it. 

Brian Halligan, Dharmesh Shah and JD Sherman are some of the most transparent (and very different from each other!) leaders I've ever worked with. The fact that we have access to their thoughts, concerns, vision, etc. in REAL TIME and at our fingertips at any minute means we can all do our jobs that much better. 

Plus - you can't beat the community, friendship, and honestly, family that you meet here. I spend more time with my co-workers than my actual family, so they better be good people. And let me tell you - they are.

Some highlights over the years -- I've worked with executives who have opened doors for me and written recommendations that I would never have even met in person at a different company. I've had a diverse set of mentors that seem to have fallen in my lap -- something I never found though sought at other companies. I take classes every year that HubSpot pays for to help me add to my skillset and my value to this (or any other) company. I work when I want, where I want, and have a team to support me. I have a manager whose #1 goal is to see me get promoted and succeed, whether it's on her team or not. I have equity as a top performer. I get to travel globally to meet customers and speak at events.","Things have certainly changed over the course of the past half-decade (what company doesn't when going from 300-1500+ employees that rapidly?) We've retained our culture but our processes and day-to-day workflows have certainly changed. This isn't a con so much as a result of growth that any employee must learn to adapt to at any growing company. If you're thinking of joining -- know that you are NOT joining a startup. The culture feels like it, but experience in a larger company and how to navigate throughout an org will be a huge value add. 

You're never going to get paid the highest salary at HubSpot. It's just not the case, but there is huge opportunity and benefit outside of your annual salary. Read the last paragraph of my Pros section -- if you care about money more than these things, you may find this as a con at HubSpot."

1560,HubSpot,Exciting company to work for you are looking for personal growth,2017-03-30,5.0,Channel Account Executive,"HubSpot is a dynamic company in a fast-growing technology segment. The company never sits still and you can sense that the excitement through the constant new products and features being launched. And the management never flinches from making bold decisions that has a major impact on the entire company.

One of the great perks in working in HubSpot is that you are surrounded by some of the smartest people in the industry. More importantly, because of the transparency in the company (particularly through the internal wiki), you can understand the thoughts and debates behind many important decisions made in the company. That makes it for a great learning experience if you are willing to invest your time and energy.

On the sales team, there is a strong structure and data-driven process around it. I feel HubSpot is a great place for a salesperson to start their career (especially if they want to build a career in tech sales) as they learn so much, not just learning from more senior colleagues, but also from learning the process.","The constant changes, while mostly positive and much needed for the company as a whole, can take its toll on individuals. On the sales side of things, the changes can impact your ability to do your job but you still need to hit your quota so there is a lot of adapting needed.

I look forward to coming to work every day to be a part of something big and interesting. The coworkers I have are brilliant and fun to be around, the work is challenging and fulfilling and the flexibility I have to accomodate my growing family means the world to me.","Opportunities to grow and learn are everywhere, but you have to be adamant about seeking them out. As soon as you start looking you are bound to find them, but you have to take the initiative to look."

Employees are given a lot of latitude to tackle meaty challenges across the business and drive results. Given how quickly we're growing there's plenty of opportunity to make an impact
-unlimited flexibility. This isn't a face-time culture, and employees are encouraged to find a schedule that works with their life
-benefits are amazing. The health insurance offers great coverage, $5K annual tuition reimbursement for continuing education, and every employee is offered restricted stock as part of their compensation package
-incredibly smart, driven, motivated people who constantly inspire their peers to do their best work","-feeling some growing pains that are totally characteristic of a scale-up: equipping front line managers with the tools and skills they need to successfully manage their teams, becoming more globally focused"
1567,HubSpot,An Incredible Place to Learn,2017-03-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Lots of good humans here. I especially like the wide variety of life experiences. I hope as we get bigger, we keep taking risks in hiring to bring in more high potential people with atypical backgrounds. 
2. Love my manager.
3. With the growth and breakneck speed of the company, you get so many learning opportunities just by doing your job and keeping up with company communication. I've been able to work on really interesting, high-impact projects, and I'm confident that this will set me up for success in the future, where it's at HubSpot or elsewhere.","Like most workplaces, there are some politics and there are some jerks. There's a fair amount of preaching around how we don't stand for politics and don't hire jerks - this seems a bit silly. They exist. Would love to see us be better at holding people accountable when they poison the well."

Really learned how to do inside sales the right away.,I don't have anything negative to say. great place. great people.

Transparency is everything and you can really grow professionally if you want.,"The biggest problem of this company is the first line management team, who is full of inexperienced people, who have been promoted because of their great performance as an individual contributor, but not necessarily for the ability and potential in managing people. Unfortunately these managers are not enabling the success of their team members, but they are mostly interested in showing upper management that they are as cool as managers as they were as individual contributors."
1577,HubSpot,Mid-Market Account Executive,2017-03-13,4.0,Mid Market Account Executive,Really great product and a ton of leads. Culture is fun and it's an easy job.,"Salespeople are not talented there and super over-confident. All the good ones have left and either started companies or gone onto sales leadership positions at growth stage startups. Territories have shrunk a lot, which is to be expected.
The BDR program is a joke and I heard it is getting worse which is hard to believe.
All in all cool place, but got really big really fast and individual contributors are no longer valued."

1579,HubSpot,"Overall, fantastic",2017-03-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"HubSpot has a pretty fantastic work environment with amazingly smart co-workers. Every day I'm encouraged to push further than I did the last while knowing that I have the full support of those around me.
Free breakfast and lunch are fantastic perks, as are perks such as the on-site gym (and gym re-embursement which just about covers the cost of a budget gym like Flyefit down the road). We also have unlimited paid holidays, but I don't know if anybody has ever gone significantly over the 25 days marked in contract.
I'm now at the point in my career (generally two years at a company, in tech at least) where I could be earning significantly more if I were to jump ship and join a different company. I have no real desire to make that jump, I'm still learning new things at HubSpot every day, and can see the effect that my work has on the people who use our tools.","Dublin seems to be in a constant state of running out of desk space.
Pension contribution remains subpar.
Some minor politics creeping into the Dublin office. You sometimes have to be friendly with the right person to get something done.
We have a new internal mantra that HubSpot is becoming a product driven company. I have yet to see any real life examples of this - it still feels very much a sales driven company. I've no strong issues with a sales driven company, but I'd prefer to call a spade a spade, at least until the transition has been completed."
1580,HubSpot,Running out of orange kookade,2017-03-03,3.0,Business Development Representative,"Usual IT perks- free food, free sweets, free beer. Educational allowance. Laid back attitude when performing well from most managers.","The lack of proper planning is glaring at times - the let's see how things go and then react attitude may work for management in terms of staying flexible but it affects the sales floor morale, stress levels and promotion path. 

US centric thinking, the company hasn't mastered the art of localisation. There's a real sense of the have and have nots."
1581,HubSpot,Fun place to work with plenty of opportunity once you leave,2017-02-22,4.0,Senior Support Engineer,"HubSpot was a window into a workplace you can actually enjoy. The employees are intelligent and fun. You have access to a snack area, beer fridge, ping pong table, games, hammocks, etc., and you learn a LOT while you're on the job.

Despite the Cons listed below, this is still a really great place to work.","Into salary is on the lower end of the scale (but by no means is it unlivable or far below average). With enough rear-kissing, you can move up, even if you're not qualified. If you're exceptionally talented, you can move up. 

Once you've worked here, you have the skills to be successful and desirable/attractive to other companies who will gladly hire you and at a hire salary than you made at HubSpot."
1582,HubSpot,Life as a BDR,2017-02-21,4.0,Business Development Representative,"AMAZING. COLLEAGUES. They are some of the smartest people I've ever met, and the most friendly and easy-going. Definitely the kind of people that you'd like to stay in touch and stay friends even after if and when leaving HubSpot. Good job recruiting the brightest people out there!","A LOT depends on your manager, which can be good and bad. Every manager manages their team differently, and that reflects on the flexibility of where/when/how you work sometimes regardless of how much you deliver.

Also, not much of a con depending on some people, but there is a lack of teamwork in a day-to-day. Of course there are plenty of times when we reach out to others for help/guidance or confirming something, but most of the job is done alone."
1583,HubSpot,Overall Great Company!,2017-02-20,4.0,Junior Associate,"HubSpot invests in people, diversity, and culture. No workplace is perfect, but HubSpot is always taking serious strides to get there anyway. Very flexible workplace if you take advantage of it, and overall good experience.","Intense work environment, high expectations, and work flexibility depends on your manager. Some coworkers feel judged by their managers if they don't get into the office at before 8 am or if they leave before 5 some days. (I don't personally experience this but it all depends on the team and manager you work with). HubSpot isn't as diverse or inclusive as it should be, but is working toward it."
1584,HubSpot,A Company That Cares,2017-02-17,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,"I have only been working at HubSpot for four months but I could not be more pleased. It is extremely evident that this company cares about the well being and success of its employees. Yesterday, for instance, I had a customer address me with extremely hurtful and inappropriate language. Shortly after the call, I was contacted by a fellow colleague who assured me that I did absolutely nothing wrong and that she would be following up with the customer to explain to him that he cannot treat HubSpot employees with such disrespect. If you end up deciding to work at HubSpot you will constantly have a team of amazing and talented individuals to stand up for you and guide you to success. 

Other Pros: 
*I am constantly learning new and amazing things about the inbound marketing space. 
*Unlimited Vacation & Sick Days
*AMAZING co-workers
*Room for advancement 
*The negative customer interaction that I chatted about above is extremely rare. I would say 95% of my customer interactions are extremely positive and rewarding.",I have not experienced any cons.
1585,HubSpot,"Jaded, But Thankful",2017-02-14,5.0,Senior Implementation Specialist,"The company has a great and unparalleled culture. In fact, one of the main reasons why people come to the office is to be with their peers and everyone is an expert at something.

The open work environment is great for collaborating and it's easy to speak and chat with someone for almost anything - work related or otherwise.

The folks here give a damn about their job and it's a wonder why most everyone is very successful at their jobs and stay to advance, or move on to better things.","The hustle and grind. 

It's fine to have a busy work day but for some positions, it's unreasonable to 'solve for the customer' for every customer each and every day. Some positions tout 'having the flexibility to control and manage your day' when it's simply not true with customers demanding more and more when you only have so much to give on a daily basis.

Some positions are better off than others; there's 'unbalance' between various services positions that brings one's fully booked, back-to-back day into question against someone else with 'nothing to do.' Something like that tends to decrease morale, doubt whatever fairness there is in the office, and isn't helpful to customers."
1586,HubSpot,Great Culture,2017-02-12,4.0,Business Development Representative,"Amazing co-workers, vibrant and innovative culture, career growth opportunities and management invested in growth",Work life balance turns into more of a work life blend.
1587,HubSpot,HubSpot,2017-02-12,4.0,Sales Representative,"Great place to work, great people and great perks",A bit of a boys club
1588,HubSpot,Beautiful Company Inside & Out,2017-02-11,5.0,Support,"Unlimited vacation (omg?), candy walls, well stocked pantries, lovely office space and the list goes on, but I thought I'd narrow it down to the top 3 intangibles (aka things you won't see from pictures/articles) 

1) Work life balance.
 
Love the point of 'making your work fit into your life'. It feels truly awesome going to work and doing your best with wonderful (or any adjective that's synonymous with super amazing) colleagues who tough out the day together; it ain't easy, but that's why it's fun. Why work 12 unproductive hours when you can work 8/9 good ones and enjoy the well deserved break at the end, right? 

2) Genuine effort by management to engage with staff at all levels

It is very heartening to see executives leaving personal notes on replies (eg., Glassdoor) by employees because it shows that they truly care. Beyond the gesture, I think it speaks volumes of the transparency and accessibility all employees enjoy within the company. 

3) Career development

The career development track in HubSpot is so so so clear. What I really LOVE about it is the fact that everything is so well defined through metrics, definition and time frame (as with everything else in the company actually).  The beauty of this system is it gives you ample time to prepare/gear up for the outcome, while also giving you a well structured and balanced framework to measure your current performance against the target- no ambiguity there + accountability for personal growth.","1) Feedback channels get abit messy/ convoluted

This is a tricky one because it's difficult balancing openness and feedback efficacy. The issue with having an open door policy with almost anything that goes on in the office, is that yes, you get fantastic feedback that could bring about the next big change, but on the other hand, it's getting pretty messy (with the company expanding so quickly). 

Surveys and regular 1-on-1 sessions with managers are effective in garnering qualitative responses, which are useful in identifying pain points/ suggestions. But the issue arises when qualitative responses are gathered through open channels (i.e., internal forums/ company wide surveys); discussions get increasingly lengthy and difficult to measure. Is there a way to streamline the process?  

2) Updates about the development of global offices

With the company expanding pretty rapidly, it would be great to know how the other offices are doing (i.e., growth plans / head count) because this gives employees more time to chart their career growth based off what is currently in works."
1589,HubSpot,Amazing company,2017-02-08,5.0,Recruiter,"I just started a month ago at HubSpot and was surprised how accurate the culture code is. People at HubSpot are really genuine. There are no hidden agendas (or I haven't noticed them yet). Everybody is there to help each other. 

Just a month in the C-level trusts us with a lot of information. It's impressive how transparant HubSpot is considering the cize of the organization. Employers really feel involved. Because of the expansion of the company there is great perspective for career growth. 

++ Career opportunities
++ Culture

Couldn't be happier. Also, love the way they've created global roles in the company, a lot of folk in here working across multiple regions with 3 owning global departments.",I really don't have any to share from my personal experience.
1591,HubSpot,HubSpot is the best place I've worked,2017-02-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Of the four different companies I've worked for, HubSpot has, by far, been the best. The people are collaborative, eager to help, and not afraid to tackle hard projects. And, management puts their money where their mouths are- investing in a thriving culture (not just surface-level tech perks like candy), ardent focus on our customer experience, and transparency at all levels.","The overall age of the company skews a little young. However, as we continue to scale, management is being more fleshed out with tenured professionals which helps the company to mature."
1592,HubSpot,Middle of the Road,2017-02-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Hubspot does have a great culture.

Company growing really fast so lot's of opportunity to carve out a niche if you want.
Relationship with clients is generally based on the 'you're a human, I'm a human' basis. They appreciate our support and in return we do our best to help them overcome challenges rather than simply so 'no, we don't do that'","Workload can be heavy and requires some flexibility but this is returned in freedom to work when you want and where you want, so long as you continue to meet goals and expectations."

-You're encouraged to keep learning and growing in your career. There's a generous education bonus, lunch and learns and a book scheme. If you decide you'd like to try something else careerwise, that's also an option (eg. support to marketing or sales)

-Great people to work with. Cross-collaboration across teams is common with people sharing their experience with others so you can learn from everyone.

-Conveniently located offices in Dublin city centre with transport access to many areas of the city

-Work life balance is great. If you need to work from home that's not an issue. If you have a family emergency then you can tend to that without guilty or stress. Generous holiday options. 

-Very flat hierarchy. People are treated like equals so a lot less pretense and posturing than at other companies I've worked at","-Some growing pains with new processes, but management are very receptive to feedback and actively listen to concerns from staff

-Thankfully in a minority, but there are a few entitled people who don't appreciate the efforts our facilities and culture teams put in to providing us with amazing benefits like free lunches, beer on tap, nights out and more"
1598,HubSpot,Incredible people with an incredible vision,2017-01-30,5.0,Channel Account Manager,"I've been at HubSpot for over 4 years and there are so many things that I love about HubSpot that it's hard to count.  The people that I work with are some of the best of breed - they're smart, creative, hard-working, helpful, and sincere.  In many ways it's inspiring and challenging in raising the bar; it also reinforces that this is the way you should feel about the people you work alongside with (ie a team).  HubSpot recruits for very particular values and has a process that is proven to work, and nurtures employees to those values to ensure they grow too.  

HubSpot's software has come so far in the years that I've been there, and is now a world-class technology stack.  The product team that we have is incredible in liaising with people on the ground so that we have a constantly evolving and improving vehicle for customers to derive growth from.  This happen - ie bugs, but they work tirelessly to do right by our customers.  This ideology of ""solving for the customer"" is present in every being at HubSpot, and I love that.  This means that we aren't selling something and leaving that person hanging, it's about ensuring that they know how to use it, apply it to their business, and learn from it so that they can own their own growth.  That is really powerful stuff that makes it easy to be passionate about selling.  Seeing the results that they achieve is pretty incredible too.

HubSpot also let me move to being a remote employee - I am so thankful for being given that opportunity.  If you propose an idea and it makes sense (quantitatively first, then qualitatively), HubSpot is willing to try just about anything.  That is a really empowering feeling.","Big changes happen frequently within the sales organization and the admin is sometimes difficult to transition to.  Sales team is also very political.

Selling Marketing Automation isn't easy, requires a lot of work to first learn, then qualify, differentiate, and close.  We find that 18months in is when reps start to hit their stride, and it's true.

Inbound leads only is a thing of the past - you have to prospect outside of what you are given if you want to be successful"
1599,HubSpot,Why Work at HubSpot?,2017-01-30,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Where to begin! Stock options, dental care, health care, free breakfast and lunch, continual education and training, openness of direct and upper management. HubSpot is exponentially good for benefit. The promotion path for sales is also very clear and achievable once you put the work in.","The workload is heavy, but manageable.

1611,HubSpot,My People,2016-12-30,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"1. Hubspot has values. At my first company meeting, I discovered Hubspot hired Ta-Nehisi Coates to speak at their yearly conference. If you don't know Ta-Nehisi Coates, he writes about being a Black man and a Black father in the United States. You can't have a speaker like Ta-Nehisi Coates and feign indifference. Being someone who also cares about Black people and issues of racism, I was so grateful I started crying at the company meeting. Hubspot was willing to ruffle feathers and lose business to stand behind someone they believe in. It was refreshingly honorable.

2. Hubspot hires people who are both sharp and kind. At almost every job I've had, someone has always made me feel small or uncomfortable. At Art.com, a woman would completely ignore me whenever I'd try and communicate. I'd try to talk to her in the hallway and she'd act like I'm invisible. It made me feel horrible and it made me incredibly inefficient at my job. At Hubspot, I've never met someone I haven't liked. Consequently, I'm a happy person, I collaborate easily with new people, and I'm efficient in getting work done.

3. Hubspot is a big company with a small company feel. Big companies get overly political and bureaucratic. Culture is often lost and you quickly become a bee in a hive-slogging through process after process to get your job done or to accomplish any HR task. You feel like your voice is lost. Hubspot has maintained an incredibly friendly, free atmosphere as a 1500 person company. There is a shared culture of getting things done, putting ones ego aside, and asking questions. Everyone is responsive and accessible from the Head of Culture to the VP of Product. You're empowered to do what's best for your team and to lead your own charge in your own way.

4. Hubspot has great design managers. It's common to promote the loudest, most extroverted, outspoken people. Hubspot is different in that they promote a variety of personalities into management positions. My boss is a soft spoken, incredibly empathetic person. His boss (the head of our department) is a super creative, nurturing type who's always looking ahead and reexamining the way we work to ensure we get what we need. My therapist says I've never been this happy. She says all this time, I've just been looking for a good manager.

So what about that Disrupt article that guy wrote-the one that talks about how Hubspot is a frat house filled with 20-year-olds? Here is what I can say:

- I had read the article and I was skeptical about the seemingly very young people who interviewed me.
- They won me over in minutes with their smarts and lack of ego (to me, this has nothing to do with age).
- I've never experienced any of that fratty behavior in Product.","I moved to Cambridge from Oakland, California. Winter is cold. I could do without the winter."
1612,HubSpot,Senior Inbound Marketing Specialist,2016-12-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, nice culture and great product. They also hire very smart people which keep you wanting to improve and grow.","Fast pace, so I do not recommend it to people that do not like constant change. There are lots of new initiatives that can pan out great or go completely bust. If you join one that go bust, be ready to potentially go down with it."
1613,HubSpot,A great place to learn and grow,2016-12-25,5.0,Software Engineer Co-Op,"The culture is amazing, the learning and growth opportunities are endless, and the people are great.

Management is awesome. They try to know everyone by name and do a really great job of keeping tabs on the state of the office and the product. And since they have such an ear to the ground approach, they are always open to suggestions and questions.","Housing! It was so hard to find housing for 6 months, especially since I knew nothing about the area. HubSpot, please do something to make sure your coops have housing!"
1614,HubSpot,What the *&^ is wrong with this place? (Hint: all the right things.),2016-12-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"*Transparency*
HubSpot shares all company performance data, financials, and executive meeting notes with all staff. Other companies don’t do that. Other companies hoard, and filter, and release bitesize chunks of “digestible” information to their frontlines. But HubSpot's commitment to transparency means that every employee deeply understands how the company works, why the strategy is what it is, and why our execs make the decisions they do. It also empowers every employee to knowledgeably identify opportunities to improve the company — our founders openly share their thought processes (and their concerns and their blindspots) because they want everyone at HubSpot to have a founder’s mindset. You’ll learn more about business, leadership and decision-making in 1 year at HubSpot than you could at any business school.

*Dynamism*
Our leadership team refuses to fall into complacency. Good is not good enough. Even if we’re beating the industry average on some measure, if they know we can do better, they will push us to do better. They’re not afraid to break what works in order to find something better. Other companies would be happy to make small tweaks to earn incremental progress. At HubSpot, you’ll learn best practices, but you’ll also learn to constantly challenge the status quo, whether that’s around sales tactics, go-to-market strategy, product innovation, or customer service. 

*Professional Growth*
Many entry-level employees will start with concrete tasks and a clear plan, but as you grow, you will increasingly have to define your own roadmap. You will be expected to experiment (and fail), you will be expected to digest as much knowledge as possible (through coffee chats and devouring the internal company wiki), and you will be expected to take advantage of unlimited free books and thousands of dollars available to support classes/training. Other companies puts people in boxes and make them climb a pre-defined ladder; HubSpot takes a build-your-own-adventure (with some guardrails) approach to professional growth. 

*Autonomy*
Use good judgement. Take as much vacation as you need. Work from wherever you are. And get sh*t done. The results you produce matter more than whether you’ve followed every instruction in some hundred-page employee handbook (see: other companies). Some people prefer structure, rigid expectations, clear lines of authority, etc. — there’s nothing wrong with that, but that’s not HubSpot. If you like freedom + delivering on high expectations, you’ll thrive at HubSpot.","Many of the things that make HubSpot great are also the things that can be frustrating.

*Autonomy*
Lots of autonomous individuals and teams acting in loose harmony can lead to duplicative efforts — e.g., two smart people both recognize an opportunity and chase after it without “someone in charge” recognizing that they’re doing the same thing.

*Transparency*
Holy torrent of information. Given how much information and data is made available, it’s sometimes hard to know what I should know and care about. At best, this can simply be a time suck; at worst, it can be overwhelming.

*Manager Growing Pains*
As the company as grown rapidly, we’ve promoted a number of first-time managers. Young staff look up and say, “Hey. I could be at least as good as that manager!” Which leads to frustration, more inexperienced managers, and misaligned expectations about what professional growth should look like at its best. I think we've recently made a number of good investments to alleviate some of this pain.

I understand that these downsides are inevitable given the choices we’ve made. I wouldn’t have chosen differently."

Given time to explore different solutions, trusted to find the best. Everyone is pleasant, which is a first for me after 10 years in Boston tech industry.

1620,HubSpot,A Great Place to do Your Best Work,2016-12-08,5.0,"Manager, Implementation Specialist","I stole the title of this review from our COO - but I really believe in it.  HubSpot is a place where people really pour their heart into their work.  Many do it because they believe in HubSpot's mission, some do it because they believe in their team and their coworkers, others because they want to succeed personally.  But the one common thread with everyone I've reported to, worked alongside, and even hired, was the passionate commitment to doing their best work here.  This has led to me, specifically, experiencing an incredible amount of personal growth - as I'm constantly learning from amazingly wise and intelligent people.","HubSpot's grown rapidly over the last several years, and despite our 'startup like culture' (which is a phrase that has become ubiquitous and meaningless) HubSpot is a big company.  Our cultural values have helped us maintain a high bar for employees, but there's a near-constant battle being fought against complacency, routine, and excessive process.  You really do drive your own success here, but you'll occasionally need to carry the weight of others on the way to the top.  If you come in with the expectation that HubSpot is a mythical unicorn that every employee rides off into the sunset, you will be disappointed.  You need to work hard, and put up with the occasional amount of bulls*%&."
1621,HubSpot,Always Learning & Growing,2016-12-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"HubSpot is in its 10th year as a company, and is really hittings its stride.  Other the years we've really learned a lot as a a company and as a culture.  There's room to grow in ones career, make lateral movement, try new things, hear your ideas be heard, and so much more.  

The culture is one of a kind, as well as the people within.","HubSpot isn't a corporate company, in terms of culture.  There's a lot of autonomy and not a lot of strict black and white rules.  If you're looking for that structure, this place will be a tough transition.  It's up to the individual and the employees as a whole to ensure everything runs smoothly."
1622,HubSpot,Still in Love After 6 Years,2016-12-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"In my 6 years at HubSpot there's been an incredible evolution from 170 to well over a thousand employees.  We've gone from a scrappy startup to a legit business. 

While quite a lot has changed, the reason I joined is the reason I stay - I'm constantly surrounded by bright, engaged, dedicated colleagues.  People who work at HubSpot really care about the company and we've continued to attract exceptional talent.  

What this means for me is that, while the business has evolved, I've never had to have a meeting with a manager who's too busy to help or a colleague who's disengaged.  This is a drama-free environment because the people who work at HubSpot are here quite voluntarily. 

HubSpot is generous with employees - but it's not over the top.  Motivation to be work here is largely *intrinsic.* We're not here for a free breakfast, lunch and dinner, free dry cleaning, or whatever nonsense other tech companies divert into retaining employees.  I find my managers, my colleagues and my team are here because they love the work.

And when you enjoy your work and the people you work with, it's an awesome place to forge a career.","As we grow, it's been difficult to keep track of what's going on across the business.  This is a little disorienting because I had been used to better understanding all of the moving parts."
1623,HubSpot,This company gets it,2016-12-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Hubspot is a company that really thinks about how modern people work, how to get the best out of them and how to ensure they feel fulfilled in their role.

The commitment to the purpose of helping customers grow is palpable.  It finds it's way into every conversation and every decision across all functions and levels within the company.

There is a strong belief that we are changing the way the world chooses to engage in commerce...and the ""we"" driving this change is an awesome group of talented, quirky, driven, and giving game-changers.","Having lived in many other company cultures, it's hard to find a con.

1648,HubSpot,"Balance. Yes, it's possible.",2016-10-05,5.0,,"As a 40-something in the fast-paced, ever-changing world of tech, current sentiment would be that it's near-impossible to succeed in your role as professional AND a parent. Luckily, at HubSpot, that's top of mind for the company and I can honestly I'm making it work. There are flexible workplaces on paper and there are flexible workplaces in practice. I work at the latter. Halloween party at in the afternoon at daycare? I'm there. Child sick? Work from home. Vacation? I take it. Really. There are no weird looks. There is only acceptance and support from my team and colleagues. I can't say how much that makes me want to work harder and give my all.

Which leads me to the work. It's challenging. It's collaborative. It's evolving, which is a good thing for those who like change, and perhaps scary for those who want solid footing in knowing exactly what their day will look like. But it's always ""all hands on deck"" to solve a problem, to get to a goal, to make things work. 

Which leads me to the people. They're smart. Really smart. But they're consistently GOOD people. I find the more people you talk to at HubSpot, the more you find they hire people who care about others, who are curious, and who want to do what's right. 

Also, great opportunities for international collaboration; autonomous project development (passion projects); employment benefits like wellness programs, food, learning stipends, etc.","HubSpot is growing (really) fast and is a SaaS company that serves the mid-market (SMBs), which means it lives in a precarious situation of being a bit of an outlier that has to figure things out without proofs of concept out there in the world. That may be scary to some people.

Growing pains, though normal, mean that organizations within the company may need to re-org from time to time. Again, not an issue for someone who embraces change, but could be disruptive to certain personalities."

1657,HubSpot,"Great company, exciting future head",2016-08-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I've been working at HubSpot full time for several years now -- and never before have I been as excited about the future.  The company is in the midst of transitioning from a single (marketing) product company to having multiple products and -- most importantly -- a free CRM that we expect to be widely adopted.  The product is great and fun to image where we can take it.  The energy and excitement around the office is remarkable and hasn't changed from my starting days pre-IPO.,"As with any company that's growing rapidly -- with multiple offices around the world, new products and new go-to-market models -- there is some growing pains.  For many 'managers' this is their first time managing someone, and sometimes they're not great at it.  Additionally always staying on the same page about everything that is going on can be tough and while people try to always post to the wiki, that's hard to keep up with."
1658,HubSpot,Hubspot,2016-08-20,4.0,,Super smart hard working people - and super nice.,Competitive - we opened a new market and it didn't work out - so I didn't have the numbers to show to move to another role.

The company has a can-do, GSD culture that will set you up for success in the future.","Especially on the sales side, things do get a little bit bro-y.  It's an odd feeling seeing a 22 year old grabbing a beer from the taps in the kitchen -- at lunch -- and I think that there could be more proactive steps taken to address that type of thing."

1664,HubSpot,Great place to work,2016-07-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been reading a lot of the reviews here and paying attention to 'Cons' part. Some people aren't happy that you have to work very hard, or that HubSpot has a specific culture, or that you're promised X but get Y - not something that I've experienced.

I get that as companies grow there will be some pains and because we're dealing with people.. you can't please everyone, but people need to take a step back and stop venting - we're all human and trying really hard to make a fantastic working environment. 

Unless you've worked some crappy jobs (and I have) than I don't think you can appreciate just how much we're given.

I'm also a little confused why some people are upset about working hard: You get out what you put in, particularly if you're in sales. The amount of support, training and help you get is outstanding. It's the only company that I've ever worked in where you have: free food, gym, an onsite trainer, where you can ask any manager for help and get it, you can ask any team member for help... and get it, you can ask the tech team for help and they solve the problem within minutes - this doesn't happen in other companies!

Additionally, the perks are better than most other companies: free food/drink, alcohol, games room, education, training, gym... the list goes on.

Pros
- Best solution on the market
- Fantastic working environment
- Competitive environment
- Very talented employees
- Food/Drink etc
- Great CEO who speaks to you like he appreciates what you're doing for him and the company
- Really nice people who care about their job
- Great opportunities for upskilling and career path is set in front of you","- Brian Halligan needs to stop saying ""top of the mornin' to ye"" when he's on the radio in Ireland - nobody in Ireland says that.
- Where the hell is the ping pong table in the new Dublin office?
- Sometimes too many meetings
- The free beer runs out too often. Also, while I'm on this subject: the keg room isn't refrigerated so when we have to (manually - there should be a robot that does this for us) change the kegs, the fresh beer is warm - this must be fixed. Btw, thanks for changing the taps
- Not enough women on the sales side. I understand that this is because far less women apply for a sales roles, but it would be nice"

While the general trend is improvement, some changes cause strain on certain areas of the business and have caused problems in the past and present."
1669,HubSpot,Best software employer in Dublin,2016-06-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"Unlike a lot of other bigger companies, HubSpot has a product & engineering team in Dublin that does real work. Core components of their business are developed here--it's not just some satellite office that does reliability.

They have very good pay, good benefits, a very nice office, and just an all-round great team here.","Ever since it's gone public and as the company has grown, a little bit of corporate-ness is creeping in. The ""startup"" feeling is slowly leaving the company. People are in place to try to combat that, but there's a limit to how much they can really do."
1670,HubSpot,HubSpot is everything I could have imagined...and more!,2016-06-20,5.0,,"- career growth: my manager and coworkers are great mentors and genuinely want to help me grow my career and learn each and every day. 
- perks: unlimited vacation, food, beer, nap room, gym, Equinox classes, AMAZING PEOPLE AND CULTURE! 
- immediate impact: I started at HubSpot about 8 months ago and I immediately felt like I had an immediate impact on my team and the company. It's truly amazing how each and every segment of this company is important. Each department feeds off one another to operate this amazing organization and product. 
- transparency!!","compared to other similar companies it seems like our compensation is lower. However, the perks HubSpot has really does outweigh any small gap in compensation."
1671,HubSpot,Able to make a huge impact early in my career,2016-06-17,5.0,Product Designer,"I think the thing I love most about HubSpot is that it's at a place where we're established enough to have the resources and the wisdom of a company that's figured out what we're doing, but still small enough that a single person can make an enormous impact. For a designer like me, that's huge. At a larger company, like Facebook or Google, I'd never have as much autonomy to make the design decisions that I currently do as the sole designer for my piece of the HubSpot software. That's given me an incredible opportunity to grow my craft and has made me so invested in the part of the product that I work on.

Besides that, the people I work with, especially my immediate team, are fantastic people - they genuinely care about their coworkers, the company, and the product we're building, they're smart, they're helpful, and they have good senses of humor. I couldn't imagine a better group of people to work next to every day. In addition, I've never had a problem with work life balance at HubSpot - I set boundaries for myself before I started working full time (like not working on nights or weekends except in extreme circumstances, not responding to emails or chats after hours, etc). Of course it's easier for my role, since I don't have to be on call like engineers do in case something breaks, but I've found that my coworkers are very respectful of my work hours.

In general, HubSpot is a fantastic place to work, and I'm incredibly happy at my job.","Things change as the company gets bigger, and as it gets bigger it gets a little harder to make sure the right information gets around to the right people. There are a few growing pains like that, but they certainly pale in comparison to the pros."

1674,HubSpot,Excellent for people looking to grow their careers,2016-06-13,5.0,,"I've been at HubSpot for a little over 6 months now. Leaving my last job I wanted to make sure I was going to a company that I could grow in and learn a lot.
During my interview I was quick to admit that I would have a lot of questions in order to learn more and get to the point where I would be a strong contributor to my team and to the company. I was nervous that saying this would make them want to go with someone else. Perhaps, someone with more experience. The two people interviewing me told me that anyone I ended up working with would be more than happy to mentor me, they weren't kidding.
I have been overjoyed with the amount of guidance and support I've received from everyone on my team since I started.
Not only my manager but every single team member takes the time to answer any questions I have and help me out with anything I may need. 
This type of accepting and collaborative environment is truly amazing. 

Since I started my manager has worked with me tirelessly to make sure I'm working towards a promotion and feel that I'm growing in my current position. She is always telling me what I'm doing right and what I can improve on. The constant communication, mixed with praise and criticism, is exactly what I need in order to succeed. 

The benefits and culture are an added bonus. Nothing beats having the flexibility to work from home and take days off when I need to. A lot of people that I talk to about HubSpot ask about how realistic Unlimited Vacation is. To answer that question, it is very realistic. As long as you are getting your work done then taking time off will not be a problem.

Other perks are a gym onsite thats open 24/7, only for HubSpotters, that includes multiple different classes every week, fresh fruit and veggies daily, constant communities service opportunities, lots of social/team building outings, and so much more.

I could go on forever about the perks of working here but what is most important is what I mentioned first. People actually care about helping you grow your career and getting you to where you want to go. You don't see that many places but you definitely see it here. 
Coming to work every day is easy when you believe in the company and the company supports you.","Lot's of perks can be distracting.
You have to know how to manage work and play. 
It is easy to get caught up in fun things that the culture team plans but you need to know when to say no and focus on your work. 
It can be difficult at first to find this balance and if you don't find it you obviously wont succeed."
1675,HubSpot,"Amazing place to learn, grow, and start a career",2016-06-13,5.0,Marketing,"I've been working at HubSpot since I graduated college a few years ago and can't really imagine being anywhere else. Since day 1, I've been given complete trust in my work and projects. I started on the marketing team doing everything from writing email copy to creating offers and ebooks, to publishing blog posts, to coming up with social campaigns to promote HubSpot's global presence. There's always something to work on and anyone can say ""I think this is an important project so I'm going to lead it and see what happens"". I didn't realize how rare that was for a recent grad to be able to do until I talked to friends of mine who were working on things that would never actually be customer-facing. The biggest reason though I've been able to succeed in that environment is because of the people, particularly managers. I've read a lot on Glassdoor and other platforms about HubSpot's management, and while I can only speak to my experience, I've had amazing managers my past 4 years here. They know when to be hands-on and hands-off, and they don't just manage, they're impressive individual contributors which has made me work harder. Beyond managers, the people here are great. They go above and beyond to teach (someone led intro to HTML and coding classes during lunch time for anyone who wanted to learn and it was super helpful), and I truly enjoy being around them. People I work with are wacky, quirky, and kind. I'm going on 4 years here and I'm excited for what's next!","There are some growing pains like any company and things still being figured out, but I think that's normal."
1676,HubSpot,"Amazing Career Growth, Culture & Leadership",2016-06-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been working at HubSpot for over two years and the career opportunities that I have been afforded have been nothing short of amazing. HubSpot is a fast paced, energetic environment and if you put your hand up to get involved with projects that help with the growth of the company, you can be given the opportunity to make an impact. 

I love how HubSpot has become a truly global company in the years since I've joined and there are no barriers when it comes to opportunities for collaboration. I work daily with colleagues at our US HQ and very often with my counterparts in our Sydney and Singapore offices which can be so insightful in terms of cultural perspectives and has been wonderful for my own professional development. 

Some of my favourite benefits/perks that make my job even more enjoyable or show that HubSpot cares about my growth & well-being:

- Annual Gym Reimbursement
- Tuition Reimbursement (night classes to up-skill in my new role at a top university) 
- On-site massages
- Free book program

Going deeper, you'll find a stable, people-first culture that makes this whole thing work. Working at HubSpot was the best decision that I ever made.","The pay is a little lower than the industry, but it's worth it when you look at the perks. I'll take slightly lower pay at an awesome company with amazing perks over the reverse any day."

Each new SydSpotter brings a fresh perspective, and adds to the culture which we are constantly evolving. Having worked in the Dublin & Cambridge offices, I'm lucky to have a benchmark for how Sydney is going comparatively to the other offices. In many ways we operate autonomously as a startup, but with massive support, guidance (and requisite performance expectations) from HQ and our APAC head office in Singapore. HubSpot (globally) is a very special place where I've had the chance to massively develop my career while helping others do the same. Oh, and the product is also amazing/improving everyday.","1.

They do not know how to actually manage, the company was built on helping the employee's out, but the manager brings in the way of managing for a old fashion company who does not have unlimited vacation, which Hubspots motto is ""As Long You Get Your Job Done"" they tend to make you work more then you have to so they look good, along those lines, they do not praise the employee who actually does the whole work in the department, as for me...i did all the work...while the manager got all the benefits...promotions and bonuses...it's a slap to the face to watch someone (your manager) get the rewards you work for and nothing towards you."

1690,HubSpot,What It Is Like to Build Your Career at HubSpot,2016-04-12,5.0,Sales,"Pro= A great place to grow your career.

Here is my personal experience working for HubSpot for a little over 5 years: Before I joined the HubSpot sales team I had ~8 years sales experience, so like a lot of folks on the Sales team here, I was pretty well along into my career. I understood sales when I joined the company, but 5 years later I've also had the chance to learn and do a lot more than I'd bargained for.

Here's just a small sample of what I've gotten to work on so far: - Refine my sales skills with the best sales org in the business -Create and build my own team from scratch- going from experiment stage to fully functioning cross-functional team -Learn how to hire, build, coach and manage a team -Learn how the operating system of a top-notch business is run, and how to replicate those processes - Learn how to go from start-up to scale-up.. which is incredibly valuable in the market. I have been trusted to do all this with a ton of autonomy, but also with the support and guidance of a very smart group of people.

I can't imagine how else I could have learned, and actually *done* all of this any other way, any other place.. in such a short time. Hundreds of my colleagues have a story a lot like this one, and there will be hundreds more, I'll bet. All of these challenging opportunities have made this more than a ""job"", but really a fast track for my professional (and personal) growth.

It is a privilege to work for and learn from an extremely bright and talented executive/management team. Our founders, and especially our CEO, have been a couple of the most influential people in my career. It is worth mentioning that I am also a mother with young kids, and have found an exceptional work/life balance here because our leadership genuinely cares about the team and creating an environment where working parents (of which there are many) have the flexibility to take care of our families and our careers at the same time. I've been able to balance everything that is important in my life while earning a very good living to provide for my kids. I am proud of the company, our product, the smart team I get to come work with every day to help our customers be successful in their businesses, and the fact that we have a lot of fun while we do it.","This is, for sure, very hard work and the bar is high here. Since tech moves so fast, and what our customers need is always evolving, we all need to move fast too. That means always being out of our comfort zones, updating skills and iterating. That might not be the right fit for everyone. You really have to thrive on that, I think, to get as much out of your work here as I have."
1691,HubSpot,Sales at HubSpot,2016-04-11,4.0,Account Executive,A lot of upward mobility for someone starting out their career in sales. If you perform well you'll get promoted,Typical cutthroat SaaS sales culture. Not much job stability
1692,HubSpot,Support Engineer,2016-03-24,4.0,Support Engineer,HubSpot Support is a really amazing team. Everyone has eachothers backs and as far as I know there is no backstabbing or nepotism. The perks are amazing and I enjoy coming into work every day and being able to proudly tell others about my place of employment.,"The salary. The salary is so low. It is nearly impossible to live in Boston on 35k a year. This is a very technical job and Support Engineers know more about how to use and troubleshoot our product than anyone else in the company, and the salary/level of respect we get does not reflect that."
1693,HubSpot,Strong Leaders & Strong Culture,2016-03-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The amount of autonomy you are offered right out of the gate gives you a feeling of true mutual respect. There is an underlying message of ""you are here for a reason and we are so excited to see what you can do!"" It's a fast-paced and fun environment where there's always a new project to tackle and a strong team to support you in the process. The commitment to true transparency encourages HubSpotters to ask questions and hear real answers. HubSpot also understands that not everyone works in the same way and really solves for the employee by offering both tangible and more abstract opportunities to build a work environment that's best for you (e.g. nomad desks, unlimited vacations, common areas for co-working).The flexibility and true investment in its people makes HubSpot a great place to build a career and has so far been a great place to find my professional voice.",With the company growing quickly it can be really easy to be be complacent and not get to know too many of your colleagues. Continuing to encourage these interactions will be invaluable!
1694,HubSpot,Extreme toxicity in a place that claims 'Culture is King',2016-03-23,1.0,Technical Support Engineer,"The seductive elements that are evident at most hip tech companies these days.  Free food, free beer, great benefits, 401k, decent pay, free gym, attractive office space, stand up desks, the works!  You'll feel like a real king for quite some time with all the nice perks.","This is the 'outstanding' culture that Hubspot prides itself on that I honestly witnessed on a near daily basis:

- Male colleagues who VERY openly talk about which Hubspot girls they wanted to sleep with or thought were hot, in the most vulgar of terms.  If a certain Hubspot female was coming to the office, you'd sure hear about it!  

- Coworkers who VERY openly make fun of and gossip about colleagues on and off their team.  Know that when you are out sick that you WILL be talked about behind your back, and might have a meme or two making fun of you and shared to the whole team.

- A boss, who you are supposed to respect, that gets beyond wasted at nearly every company event.

- Coworkers who talk openly and loudly about topics ranging from the size of their genitals, the girls they slept with that week, the drugs they took that week, and the coworkers (on the same team) that they dislike.

- People who are so genuinely awful that they make the 'no jerks policy' look like a complete joke, but have complete impunity because of their particular relations to the boss.

- Coworkers and bosses who openly start drinking the free beer at 3pm.

- Expletives and extreme vulgarities dropped openly and loudly left and right, regardless of the subject matter, but most often when complaining loudly about coworkers or customers. 

- Bosses and managers that are so inexperienced, incompetent, and juvenile that they not only set the precedent of the above behaviors, but in the face of real professionals waste no time in passing all 'smart people' work off onto them, taking credit for all their ideas and accomplishments without thanks, and running to them desperately for support and counsel in their never ending crisis's.

- Middle-Upper management who know all too well about all the above problems (because they have absolutely been told directly or via TinyPulse) but ignore them by remaining conspicuously absent and silent, or firing the people that have the balls to speak up in more adamant ways."

At HubSpot, there is always something new to learn and you won't get bored here",The opportunity to move across global offices is still limited but I'm sure that will come as the company continues to grow.

1) You will be told to ask for help when needed, but you will then be shamed for needing help

You will ALWAYS be told to ""ask for help or questions"" and that you would be provided support, but when an employee bravely asked for help on things they were not certain on to help them in their role, is it ""support"" to be shamed by the management for not knowing it? Shamed and belittled for voicing out, by the same people that were hired to lead and support the team?


2) Even if you hadn't applied for the job but they had reached out to you, they will interview you, look at your CV, offer you the role after several rounds of interviews and hire you. Then they will tell you you are ""inexperienced to work with them""

Is it good leadership to constantly tell an employee repeatedly that they are ""very inexperience and it is clear that they need to face more of different situations for them to get the experience"" but then not providing them the support? If they had thought of an employee as inexperienced, why would they hire the person in the first place, and then only give them 3 months to prove to be exceptional in the role?

Additionally, don't be surprised if they also belittle you by saying that your ""English and Communication skills are very poor"".

These comments come from the same people who hired you. Your confidence will be chipped away daily.


3) If you are a local with expertise in the region, they will hire you as a ""local face"" and also to be someone who can help the company find a middle ground between the local business culture and their American practices. But once you're hired, don't expect the management to want to listen to your feedback. 

During my tenure, the local/expat Management were adamant of having a ""we have tried, tested and proven results for these in the US & Aus, Hence, it would work in the Asia region and you should just follow what is told"" mentality.  Is this really how you want to Solve For The Customer? 

4) Want to know what your progress is like and where you stand in the company? Don't bother asking the management. They will tell you things to deceive you so you would trust them, and then next thing you know, they're done with you. Transparency level = Opaque


5) Your understanding of your jobscope & skill sets needed, your global co-workers in the same roleas understanding, and the local management's expectations of your role will be extremely misaligned. So be quite prepared to be confused and ""inexperienced"".


6) Understand the features of the products but need more help with explaining them more succinctly? You can ask for help with fellow co-workers and even request for some time to do product training. 

But don't be surprised that as per Point #1, you will be shamed by the management for being transparent about the help you need and they will spin a story telling other employees that you do not know even the bare minimum. Yet somehow, you passed your New Hire Training. 


7) If the company is done with you and you resign on the same day, they will pay you to leave immediately, treat you like a criminal, humiliate you by saying you are not allowed back in the office to pack their own things, like a Bank's retrenchment.


8) For a company that prides themselves on hearing feedback, when an exit interview was requested, it was immediately refused. It required me to go up to the upper management before I was provided one. 


These were only the few out of many bad experiences I've had with the company; more specifically, the management here in Singapore. It is fine that the company felt that I was not a good fit, but it was absolutely uncalled for to treat someone with such hostility and humiliation.  It has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth, and also for the current employees to see how I was mistreated. 


SUMMARY: My whole time with the company since I returned from their New Hire Training in Boston was handled extremely poorly. Let's just say that for a company who prides themselves on a ""great culture (code)"" and a ""no-jerk"" policy, they did not carry that over from their HQ to their other offices (in this case, Singapore)."

There's minimal overhead in the develop-test-release cycle. Career growth is something that's actively discussed between managers and team members.

Wanted to second something another reviewer said about the Services team - everyone seems to say we are highly valued but it doesn't match in terms of compensation or career options, especially when compared to Marketing and Product. Since we're more of a boots-on-the-ground team that doesn't get a lot of exposure to other teams (we're always on the phone with customers), it's hard to feel valued beyond words.

Easy advancement was a huge selling in my first year. now that I'm at the spot where it's time to look for a new opportunity, there aren't as many non-management paths as I would have hoped. I'm sure it's still better than a lot of companies out there."

Freedom, to an incredible extent, to choose when, where, and how you'll get your work done (using good judgment, naturally). Freedom to be yourself, which I particularly appreciate after some of the more oppressive places I've worked. Play to your strengths and find a way to make your strengths benefit your team and the company, and you'll love going to work every day.","This much freedom isn't everyone's cup of tea. You do need to be able to chart your own course and define what success means to you. Huge progress has been made in helping employees grow and learn as they take on new roles, but you still do have to do a lot of the heavy lifting yourself. But that's the tradeoff of a place that treats you like an adult -- you have to actually act like an adult and make things happen. It's a price I'm quite willing to pay."

The perks are also second to the people, as a woman starting out in a fairly male dominated industry I was worried I wouldn't fit in but I feel like an equal and a friend.

Development from your direct peers is something I've really taken advantage as there are so many talented people to tap if you're willing to.",The only area for improvement is having more structured training on an ongoing basis.

1714,HubSpot,As awesome as advertised,2015-12-20,5.0,Tech Lead,"Engineering teams are fully autonomous and operate in many ways like individual startups.  The teams are only given a high-level mission and not individual features or dates to achieve.  The incredibly talented PAAS and FAAS teams allow product teams to narrow their focus and rely on systems just working. The pace of the product teams is unbelievable.

The company puts a large focus on personal growth.  There are weekly tech talks for the product team, an occasional HubTalk/Failure Forum, classes for management training, and even classes on non-work related topics.  Management reads all feedback and reacts accordingly.  The product blog is great and another way for employees to share knowledge.

The Culture Code is real.  Every employee has the HEART referenced by that code.","The company puts a big focus on ""Use Good Judgement"" and being hands off.  That is a great way to operate, but it may not be for everyone.  HubSpot wouldn't be a good fit for engineers who need heavy processes or need to wait for someone to tell them what to do."

But its so much more than the free food/beer/casual environment. HubSpot is spurring a real culture shift when it comes to work. I honestly wish that more companies would model theirs off of ours because it WORKS. You work when/where/how you want, because at the end of the day, you know what you're responsible for and are treated with the respect to get the job done. Feeling empowered within your day to day work as though you're an owner of a start-up, yet having the support and guidance of a large international company is one of the best gifts I've ever been given. And oh yes, we get rewards and recognition for that strong performance to boot.","I feel disappointed by colleagues that don't take advantage of all that HubSpot has to offer, or those that may not have experienced life outside the HubSpot world who may take these benefits for granted.

There are a lot of different departments that can appeal to anyone coming out of college or experiencing a change in their career or wanting to take their skills to the next level. I've learned more at HubSpot over the past few years than I've learned at any part of my life. They TRULY invest in training and that's huge. Most companies miss this, HubSpot does not. It's actually sometimes sad to get out of training because you're like WOAH! I just learned a ton of incredible stuff, I've met all these great people... now I hope I can do just as well as they've set me out to be... You want to fly at this company. As you go through highs and sometimes you'll feel like you messed up (but you really didn't) if you do continue to prove yourself, you do have the ability to advance in your role, you will move up, or even if qualified, possibly join another department. HubSpot has flexibility and they are human to understand sometimes it takes a year or so to understand what really drives you. Also, the perks of after work are fun and the added benefits from mystery dinners to the gym in the office to working from HOME are huge. I love that I can work from anywhere and that I actually DO have complete trust from my manager. This company is human.. sometimes you want to jump for joy, sometimes, you feel like well, this is definitely a job, but the majority of it, what you put into the machine, you truly get back out :).","Work life balance can be difficult AT times. You do have to be committed to working here. There are days with long hours and added stress due to the being in a growing company, a SaaS business model, and sincere drive to succeed here (like... people don't want to give anything other than 100+%) but that's why HubSpot isn't for everyone. It's only a con if 100%+ isn't something you don't aim for. It can be very ""clicky"" at times and that can be a huge bummer, but you find your way and the people who build you up and you focus on your career development."

If stock performance and revenue over-achievement are any indicators we're in good hands.","While Hubspot has made significant strides in identifying, hiring, and promoting well-qualified women to leadership positions; with lots of work still left here.

- Free beer
- Great pay (if you are a developer)
- Fun parties
- Some cool people
- Amazing benefits 
- Free gym
- Great on the resume
- Unlimited vacation policy
- Stock options","- Frat house college type culture.  Can be fun sometimes but is mostly horribly juvenile and unprofessional.  Can be very hard to work as a serious professional in this environment.  

- Extreme lack of diversity on all counts.  If you are white, extroverted, and come from a wealthy family, you will fit right in.  If you are none of those things - good luck to you and your sanity.

- Still tries to act like a start up when there are now well over 1000 people.  The lack of structure worked once, but now it feels very messy and too loose.  A lot needs to be tightened up (in a way that doesn't lose the casual atmosphere altogether).

- Unqualified and inept management.  It appears that once you have been at HubSpot for x many years you get promoted to management, no matter if you were a developer or a support 'engineer', which is an absolute nightmare for real professionals to work under.

- Unmet expectations.  They do a great job marketing themselves to potential hires, saying how they are truly changing the world, how there is infinite opportunity in the company, how they are the best of the best, that it is harder to get into HubSpot than Yale, that culture and transparency is the #1 priority. Never in my life have I felt so duped.  When you are done drinking the Kool-Aide and realize you have been had on all counts, you will feel extremely disheartened and disappointed.

- Unmet role expectations.  I was sold on a position that was 100% different than what was offered.  When it was time to get to work, my daily tasks were far below my skill set and offered no challenge.

- Too many young people and too much drinking.  There are taps in the kitchen, and all big parties are heavily alcohol involved.  Again, if you are a frat house type extroverted person, you will love it.  if not (especially introverted developers) you will feel left out.  

- Hidden HR Department.  HR is deftly called ""People Ops"", and people are left in the dark about the support they can offer to employees.  When I needed to reach out to HR I had to ask several people for who to contact because I had no idea how to find them.  This is deeply troubling as many teams are rich with conflict and politics, and HR could help resolve this issues before they compound into bigger problems."

Hubspot hires primarily for fit which involves attitude and ability. Yes the interview process is rigorous and can be long, as the policy is one of “hire to keep” rather than “hire to fire” as other companies tend to do. I love that Hubspot Dublin, Boston, Sydney and now Singapore is staffed with really smart people who are keen to learn, open to being coached, ambitious to progress and aim to help together. This would explain the exceptional global growth with everyone going in the same direction with complete openness and transparency.",I have been working for Hubspot in Dublin since they opened in March 2013. This is a really busy environment where everyone’s success is mutually interdependent. There is a big focus on being both an individual contributor and being part of a team; hence working with colleagues to assist prospects and customers whilst being responsible for your own activities is huge. There is a strong focus on accountability and metrics; so if you don't do busy environments or if you are a solo operator who prefers to fly your own flag and if you are not comfortable with transparency and visibility then Hubspot is not for you.

1747,HubSpot,"Really fun, really exciting, but also challenging",2015-09-16,5.0,Marketing Intern,"Everyone is smart. People don't micromanage you. You work on your own, but you also work in a team.","Everyone is very smart, so you have to work harder to stand out her than you would otherwise."
1748,HubSpot,Learn more about growing a business than you ever expected,2015-09-16,5.0,Sales Manager,"I have worked at HubSpot for over 4 years, and have essentially received an MBA in growing a SaaS company.  Even though my responsibility is sales/management I have insight into how the marketing operations function, how pricing/packaging is determined etc...The internal wiki + transparent company culture allows young people getting started in the workforce to not only make good money and learn how to sell, but to really get the vision of the company and understand the inputs needed to get us there.  It has made me think more about solving for our customers first, than the company before myself, and this is the attitude that most employees have here.  I believe this is the reason for the high market cap and success of the company.","Early on my work life balance was less than ideal.  You really have a lot to learn and it can be tough if you don't have a super organized brain.  Our leadership team takes great strides to ensure people actually take vacations and unwind, but if you come out of the gate struggling you may feel more pressure to catch up."
1749,HubSpot,Wonderful place to work,2015-09-11,5.0,Business Systems Analyst,The culture is phenomenal. It's very refreshing to work for a place that so encourages personal growth and happiness in the workplace.,Advancement through the company is a daunting and not readily available process.
1750,HubSpot,Worst company to work for,2015-09-09,1.0,Inside Sales,"Free goodies and Unlimited Holidays (that you can never really take advantage of)
Used to be good in the old days (according to what senior employees stories)","Lack of collaboration and communication between departments
Illusion of success (numbers get manipulated to look better)
Always looking at others instead of at themselves
Not a nice place to work - pressure with none or little rewards"
1751,HubSpot,Best place to sell in Boston,2015-08-29,5.0,Channel Account Manager,"HubSpot really does live up to its billing. There are incredible career growth opportunities, middle and upper management who care about your future, and virtually everyone is young, smart, and hungry. 

Training is very helpful and ongoing. Your manager really cares about you doing well and will do everything in his or her power to help you. Everything is very metrics-driven, so quota and ramp can be difficult, but if you stick with it and work hard, you can make it. 

You will be a better sales rep, professional, and leader for having worked at HubSpot.

Great brand. People leaving voluntarily are typically taking $200k+ sales management roles at more true startups.

Perks live up to the hype. You can operate completely on your own schedule. Team/sales/company outings at least twice a month, free beer and food, employee stock purchase plan, stock grants for sales overperformance.  Stock price has doubled since IPO 9 months ago so value of grants continues to rise.","Not for the faint of heart. If you want to punch the clock at 9, and again at 5, HubSpot is not the place for you. The learning curve is steep and the work, especially in sales (and especially in channel sales) is hard.

You're constantly stack-ranked against your peers and there's intense pressure to meet and exceed quota. Expect a challenge.

Comp is decent in sales but I know it's higher at more enterprise-level companies. Also management can feel reactionary rather than proactive.

The culture is great but the constant patting ourselves on the back for it can get annoying. Do we constantly need to be congratulating ourselves for having happy and dedicated employees? Can feel like an orange-spraypainted cult at times."
1752,HubSpot,Great place to be an engineer,2015-08-28,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Lots of autonomy. Everything is always ""what to do"", not ""how to do it"". If you want to get involved in product decision making, you're free to do so. If you'd rather dive in and reshape the tech stack, you're free to do so. If you just want to hack and build, you're free to do so. All will be rewarded. The company does a great job matching people's skills and motivations to the work they're doing.","The cadence can be spiky. The weeks before the company's annual conference can get intense with deadlines. If you're not self-motivating, you will probably not find yourself progressing in the company, as they definitely expect you to take on the responsibilities of the job you want to be promoted to first. It's a good thing for some, but I've definitely heard people feel like they lack direction for what abilities and personal traits they should be working on."
1753,HubSpot,"Yes, it really is awesome.",2015-08-25,5.0,Implementation Specialist,"- Ambitious, hard working, smart people

- Great vacation policy
- Productive, caring management
- Tuition reimbursement plan
- Culture focused on learning, professional and personal growth, excellence","Hmm, this is a tough one... In my personal experience there aren't really any downsides. It can be hard to meet and mingle with people outside of your department, but I think that's a challenge at any company that has over a few hundred employees. HubSpot still has a bit of a startup vibe in the sense that it's still growing, there's a high energy level, can be really fun, etc., but it's not a startup anymore, so if that's what you're looking for I suggest you go a lot smaller. 

At the end of the day, there's no other company I'd rather work for. Hands down. Everybody here genuinely cares about our customers, our company, and each other. I feel cheesy saying that, but there you go."
1754,HubSpot,Happier than I have ever been.,2015-08-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I've had the benefit of working at other companies and that generated context on what the normal working world is: this isn't it.  We're encouraged to be ourselves.  The whole goal is to align an employee with what their passion is and create a start-up environment for you to run.,"Come prepared to work.  We are passionate and driven.  
Don't lose perspective.  I see way too many people get upset at the smallest things here."
1755,HubSpot,Disappointed engineer,2015-08-20,1.0,Software Engineer,"The company does have aggressive growth plans, or at least that is the way they lured top talent like me from the bay area. People are relatively nice and work is not too fast paced.
You get the standard perks such as coffee, breakfast, beer etc. that have become table stakes now.","Work is not as exciting as I had thought and the product managers are just some rude East coast MBAs. The quality of the software engineering talent in the company is actually pretty bad compared to the two other companies I have worked with.
It does not feel or work like a start-up. So don't let them fool you with ""start-up culture"". It is the same messy office politics culture you can expect in a badly run mature company."
1756,HubSpot,It's an overall rating of a 5 until it's a 1 - - and you don't see the 1 coming.,2015-08-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get to be  passionate about your work.

The people you get to work next to, 99% of the time, are good people -  first which makes you want to work with them. They are team players who consistently strive to be exceptional for their clients, for HubSpot, for their team and for themselves last.  

People are smart, work hard and care about helping each other.  It's rare to hear anyone say they 'don't have time' or 'that's not my job.'  

It's a very special place and not everyone is lucky enough in their career to work at a company that is fun, has great people, allows you to dream big and build big - if it works, it becomes your job.  

Client service and satisfaction is a real thing here and the sincerity of HubSpot employees shows.

Clients/customers are generally awesome.

You will learn a lot from your peers and if you are willing to seek mentors, as well as, challenge yourself.

You'll meet your future business partners because people have great ideas, are entrepreneurs innately and you'll teach each other something everyday.","Sometimes bad apples slip through the cracks and don't understand that being a team isn't about anything other than delivering the best work product to your clients.  Those people are hard to work with and make it difficult for those around them.  It's rare, but when it happens it makes an impact.

Constructive feedback/1:1 meetings are mostly a joke where your manager asks you, in a way they just learned at a workshop, how they should be doing their job.  'How can I help you do xyz?'  That's not leadership.  If people knew the answers to why they weren't great at certain things, they'd solve it for themselves.  People are go getters at HubSpot, so if they aren't doing something right, their manager should be the one doing some reflection. 

If you are looking to be inspired or hope to develop as a professional, beyond the basics, you'll be disappointed.  If you have any experience or talent, you'll likely be managing up because huge growth is awesome, except when you're saddled with a new manager who may have been a great individual contributor, but is in no way a leader.  Experienced people are rarely, if ever, pumped about how much their manager teaches/coaches them  There are some great leaders and the people you work alongside are outstanding.  The reality is you'll likely end up with a mediocre, micro-manager who pretends to embrace new ideas, different tactics, but is constantly CYA-ing instead of GSD-ing."

The tech stack is great, red tape is minimal, cross-team collaboration is the norm.","Current location is a bit crowded because we're growing so quickly.
The soda fountain doesn't have orange soda."
1763,HubSpot,Great place to learn and grow,2015-07-22,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"The company recently went public, so we're in a period of very high spirits and energy.  HubSpot is definitely on a trajectory toward world domination in marketing automation.  I have never encountered a HubSpotter that I really didn't like.  We do a great job recruiting, hiring and maintaining a positive culture.  (By that, I mean the type of person we hire and the way they behave in the work place is very constructive, transparent and hardworking.)","Like many people, I wake up from time to time questioning, ""what do I want to do when I grow up?""  So, I turn to our internal job board and scan open opportunities.  If I don't find one that strikes my interest that day, I feel a little defeated.  I don't think this is a pervasive issue, nor uncommon to other companies.   It is clear that HubSpot is focused on a particular market segment and if you are working on the fringes of that segment, it can feel a little marginalizing to realize your mission is not the core HubSpot mission."

There is terrific access to management, who truly believe and act on transparency and helping their employees develop their careers. 

HubSpot has been making great strides and investments in diversity, both gender and racial - believing that a diverse workplace is one where a differeing view point is a valuable one.","Relatively little age diversity. This is often a blast, because there are lots of young people and that feels really vibrant. The downside is being able to learn from people who've been around the block a few times."

My manager always has my back, but also constantly challenges me to push myself and deliver my best work.","HubSpot has a very collaborative and meeting-heavy culture. While this environment is great for coming up with creative solutions and working with people across the organization, it also means that getting the work done often requires working outside the normal business hours."

It sounds cheesy to say, but I've truly never been pushed as hard, or enjoyed what I was doing, as much as I do here. You will be a small fish in an ocean of amazing employees. That said, the amount of support from employees at all levels of the company is immense. Provided you're inspired by the hard work of others, you will be motivated to accomplish more (and in less time) than you thought possible here. The autonomy granted here, along with the transparency, attention to culture, and paths for career growth are just a few of the factors that make this company amazing.","The work is hard.

* All the perks: vacation policy, free beer, free snacks, 5 year sabbatical game room, food trucks, cookie days, and there's little surprises and fun days happening all the time. 
* A company that realizes you need to spend to grow. We're always able to try new technology and software if we can demonstrate the value added via POC. 
* You don't hear ""no"" here very often - its better to try things and 'fail fast'  (as long as you have a rollback plan!)","* Empowered and enabled to make huge mistakes or earn huge wins. <-- This isn't for everyone. For some people its scary, and paralyzing when you don't know where to start because your direct manager isn't telling you exactly what to do. 
* You will often find that you didn't get to what you wanted to work on during a particular day because something comes up and throws you all off course - you need to both be able to switch gears very rapidly, and not be bothered by it. 
* A lot of people think HubSpot is fun, and hip because we have beer etc. - but take a walk around the office after 6 or 7 pm any night, or even on a weekend and there will be plenty of people here (young and old, senior and entry level) working their @$$ off to carve our a career for themselves or help the company get to the next level.

1) Company leadership is incredible. I have never worked at a company where I had such trust in executive leadership. They are transparent with our goals and current state and it is obvious that they are all scary smart. 

2) The focus on culture is like no other company I know. HubSpot definitely cares about its employees. Google the culture code that we have if you'd like to get a glimpse.  Dharmesh is such an awesome leader with this.

3) The employees are dedicated, smart, and just a ton of fun to be with. 

4) The office (I work at the one in Cambridge) is super nice and conveniently located. There are a ton of perks too, including soda, free food, free beer, ping pong and other games, and the list goes on.

- Training: Comes from Oracle which is generally seen as a company that give employees pretty good training. I can honestly say that HubSpot blow them of the roof. It's amazing how much time and effort they put into making you successful (in the end them also, but still)
- Culture: Open, flexible, no baby sitting, a lot of responsibility put on you. (It's not a place if you like getting told what to do all the time)
- Promotions: Data driven and no BS promotion path. If you hit your numbers you'll get promoted, simple as that. (targets are achievable, not a walk in the park but would be no fun if it was too easy...)
- Basically everything else (too much to list). Oh, and did I mention that we don't really have a set # of vacation days. 25 is minimum, but no one is going to chase you down as long as you hit your numbers.","- I don't know, that we don't get free lunch on Wednesdays?

They invest so much in making employees happy and productive. People are smart and genuinely nice. They have a no-jerk policy and actually screen out the meanies to prevent any poison from getting in the door. Smart. Management rewards people for helping each other and collaborating. Team spirit is so high it is unbelievable until you experience it. Customers are more like adoring fans. They love every aspect of the company and actually cheer us on! Another impressive aspect is the career growth. You see really young people leading big teams and growing in their careers. That is not something you see just anywhere.,Not a con exactly but as the company gets bigger it may be harder to retain the amazing culture. So far they are doing a really great job of it.

Some of the thinking around creating a world class culture is bleeding edge innovative. I'm impressed.  I've worked in some great companies like LinkedIn and Microsoft and HubSpot is much further ahead in how it thinks about culture. Just check out HubSpot's culture deck and you'll see what I mean

Great career opportunities, which they deliver on if your doing a good job.

The company is in hyper-growth with great people, which is a real plus, the bar is high to get in and when you do, your learning from all around you.

Growing and learning is not always smooth sailing.  It can be incredibly rewarding.  You need to comfortable with ambiguity a lot.  You won't be told what to do much of the time.

If you do those things, there are few limits.

Transparency - Want to learn how a SaaS product company actually works?  You can see all the gory details here.   The level of transparency and the willingness of the C-level folks to not shy away from even the toughest questions, but actually engage any and every HubSpotter is truly exceptional.

1811,HubSpot,"A fast, amazing company full of remarkable people",2015-04-02,5.0,Vice President,"There are a lot of pros about a growth company like HubSpot. My biggest (and I think one of the most important to deciding if you want to work at HubSpot) is that there's no speed limit at HubSpot.

Over the 5 years I've worked here, I've had success going as fast as I was capable of, often being pushed by my peers and leaders to go even faster. I've also seen this for people around me over time, and as we've grown we haven't lost the incredible sense of pace at HubSpot. This results in a limitless pace to personal development, learning, skill development, and (ultimately) career development in a rapidly growing company. And it also means the people around me are experiencing the same pace, success, and growth.

That's rare, and that's why I still work at HubSpot and love it - because the pace is as fast as ever (even picking up, maybe!) and it breeds a remarkable group of people in an incredible environment.","Retrofitting your previously existing skills to HubSpot requires a serious amount of abstract professional thinking. Most job transitions are not as challenging as the one to HubSpot - especially if you're entering in a leadership position.

If you're not prepared to adapt to the way the existing business runs, you'll be chewed up pretty quickly.That is to say that there is a ""HubSpot Way""; it'd be naive to say it's the ""best"" way, but it's a way that works well for the people here and for creating a business that positively impacts many, many people. Just be prepared to adapt hard."

- You will learn the best practises for marketing and sales which are already being copied and adapted in several industries which will enhance your career options either inside or outside of Hubspot

- You will join a young team of interesting individuals who all have something special about them if you dig a bit deeper. I have so far not met one boring person at Hubspot whether it be at Cambridge or in Dublin

For professionals in their late twenties to mid thirties:

- You will have the opportunity to build one of the next fortune 500 companies and the according team around you, if you are made of the right stuff

- You will build the processes around the currently existing products

- You will sell a concept and a product that truly provides value add to your clients and easy and complex at the same time depending on the maturity level of you and the clients you are talking to",- Transparency is not very everyone in a highly result driven environment.

1814,HubSpot,"Amazing company, amazing culture, amazing team with incredibly audacious goals",2015-03-28,5.0,Vice President,"I have worked in the Boston high tech scene for over two decades, including being part of multiple startups, and have never been at a company like HubSpot. What makes HubSpot different really starts from the culture.   We strive to be true to the HubSpot Culture Code (www.culturecode.com), even though we acknowledge it is aspirational.   The culture really makes the place remarkable including a tremendous focus on autonomy and transparency; every individual has the opportunity to move the needle at the company.   The other thing that is incredible is the audacity and desires of the company.   We are not out to be just another company.  We want to be a remarkable company in the Boston area and are not afraid to be very bold in the markets we go after.   Every time I think I have come to grips with the magnitude of our goals I am surprised by another mountain behind that one.","Particularly as an experienced person, coming into HubSpot can be a culture shock.   You likely know the traditional playbook and, if you come into HubSpot and try to just use that playbook, you will fail.   We aren't like most other places and the traditional playbooks won't work here. The key to succeed in coming to HubSpot is understanding how to take your experience and knowledge and fit it into our culture.  Once you figure that out, and there can be some bumps and bruises along the way, you can thrive in ways you probably have never been able to before."
1815,HubSpot,Trusted leadership team who cares about your development.,2015-03-28,5.0,Channel Account Manager,"HubSpot's training is top-notch, both their inbound marketing training as well as their on-going sales coaching. From a lead perspective, HubSpot generates 50K to 60K leads per month which means no cold-calling for the VAR Channel Account Managers. Further, their marketing team creates really great, helpful content which people love, so 99% of the calls you have are with people who already love the brand and product. The managers really care about your development and don't micro-manage. They let you run your own business. They put an emphasis and teaching, coaching, and learning. Further, they pay very well. I went from making $55K/year at my last sales job to $184K in my first year with HubSpot.","The most difficult part of the job is time-management. There are a lot of unqualified leads that come through and it's your job to disqualify prospects who are not going to make good re-sellers. You must quickly assess if HubSpot's Partner Program can help them or not, if not, you must break up with them. In your first year as a VAR Channel account manager, you must work very hard to set yourself up for year 2. This means long hours at the office for your first 6-9 months. However, the payoff is worth the wait."
1816,HubSpot,Fantastic place to learn and grow - amazing coworkers and ability to make an impact,2015-03-27,5.0,Tech Lead,"I work on the product team so my experience is definitely shaped by that part of the company.

- The people here are really fantastic. Super smart and very friendly. Having been at early stage startups previously it is wonderful to have a deep bench of people to learn from -- whether about engineering, product design, growing a product, etc. If you want to start your own startup someday, this is a fantastic launching pad.

- While marketing/sales software doesn't immediately sound thrilling to some, HubSpot is way more customer focused than most software companies and really engages with them. Even as an engineer you can have a lot of interactions with customers in direct feedback, user testing, Inbound, etc. They are truly appreciative of the work that goes into building the product.

- The company doesn't rest on its laurels, and that is true about launching new products, settling for outdated technology or anything else. It is fast-paced and always look to improve.

- The culture is very oriented about learning and growth. The product team structure gives employees meaningful responsibility early and coaching along the way. It is well-suited to people who really want to grow/learn (which can sometimes mean operating outside of your comfort zone).

- The management team is smart and overall the company is really good at course-correcting when something doesn't work out. It has a very experiment-driven culture and will double-down when it works, and try again when it doesn't.

- It is far from perfect but it is an organization that comes closer to truly living its values than most. And strives to do better over time.","- The environment puts a lot of responsibility on people's shoulders. People get to choose their own level of engagement. It is definitely not required to work heavy hours, but some do. Similar some people opt-out of most cultural/fun outing (and that is fine) but others have a lot of friends at work. There isn't a single answer to how much people work.

- A lot of focus is put on the small teams which can mean things feel a little chaotic. There isn't always an obvious central plan and so requires talking across teams and engaging with communities to make sure teams stay appropriately in sync."
1817,HubSpot,Why I Like Working at Hubspot,2015-03-27,5.0,Inside Sales,"- That I've been able to make my own career path and have seen others do the same. Performance plus persistence plus patience plus experimentation is valued at Hubspot.  
- That I've had some of the best managers in my career at Hubpsot. I haven't had a bad manager here. Have gotten great support and a kick in the pants when helpful too.    
- That I've worked my butt off, but it hasn't felt like it's been for nothing. I look forward to coming into work everyday or...
- That I'm able to work at home at my choosing many days. I love to be able to see my family during the day and avoid the 45 minute commute. 
- That I'm around inspiring people. Hubspotters are a mix of big thinkers and tireless executors, often within the same people. It is pretty amazing. 
- That Hubspotters are resilient and optimistic. I've been around long enough to see a few bumps and bruises. Most folks here are part of the solution, not part of the problem. 
- That I'm pumped to see what the next 5 years brings.","It's more a work/life blend that work/life balance if that's not your sort of thing

1820,HubSpot,"World-class product, world-class culture",2015-03-23,5.0,User Experience Designer,"Before joining HubSpot, I had very high expectations for the people, product, and culture. All of my expectations have either been met or exceeded. I work with extremely talented, intelligent, and motivated people that individually produce more than entire teams at other companies that I have interacted with. Beyond that, I have not yet encountered an instance of ego or political domination. The company is very open minded and receptive to criticism and innovation. Considering how large HubSpot is, it's also a very flat organization. For example, I sit just a couple desks away from Brian Halligan (CEO). He uses the same desk furniture as everyone else and because he sits out in the open, he and all of the execs at HubSpot are extremely accessible. I have an immediate team of 3 people and I correspond with 8-10 people on a daily basis. This allows me to have true autonomy and influence over my work. We are building a legitimately world-class product and it feels awesome to be a part of that. The energy at HubSpot is extremely positive; the company is doing well and you can feel it. On my first day, I was immediately given all of the tools that I needed to complete my work (regardless of cost). HubSpot believes in enabling you to do what you do best by giving you access to everything that you need. All of the culture-related promises are true. There are no designated work hours (at least for my role), unlimited vacation, the office is incredible, free food is everywhere (and beer / wine), there are dozens of events every week that the company pays for, you name it. Working at HubSpot is challenging in the best ways possible. I have never grown so much, so quickly in my life. I go home happy every day and I wake up ready to get after it again.","HubSpot maintains a very fast-paced, results-oriented (read: ""work hard, play hard"") environment. They're very diligent about recognizing high performers and the criteria surrounding recognition is totally pure (it isn't political). This is great when you're the one being recognized, but it also places a lot of social pressure on the people in the audience, thus creating a subculture of competition where you may always be chasing after that next ""quick win"". A byproduct of this is a high level of self-motivation and team-driven motivation. While I personally have noticed my work-life balance improve, I do feel that some people may work too much, and it may be a result of this aspect of the environment. If you generally don't like your job or you don't enjoy ""taking your work home with you"", you probably won't fit in. For example, many HubSpotters are friends or roommates with each other outside of work. Beyond that, if you don't produce legitimate results or you don't know what you're talking about, people will call you on it. This is only a con for a certain portion of the working population though."
1821,HubSpot,"Great culture, remarkable people, great products, and amazing career growth opportunities.  HubSpot has it ALL.",2015-03-23,5.0,Director,"There are so many pros to working here it's hard to know where to start.  

At the company level, our executive leadership is truly a dream team that anyone would be proud to work for and with.  They make excellent decisions, have an outstanding forward thinking vision, and genuinely care about the people they have working for them.  And to see the openly walking the floors interacting with everyone is always great to experience.

Our culture is everything you read about and is why people come on here with such positives reviews.  People  often times make decisions based on how something will effect the culture here and that speaks a lot.  As we grow, keeping the culture consistently positive becomes more and more difficult but HubSpot continues to dedicate more time, people, and investment into it.  If anything it appears to get better as we grow and hire more extremely talented people to join the team.

Our solution is amazing and it truly delights our customers.  I'll also say the way we treat our customers throughout their experience with HubSpot, especially post sale with the Services team, is truly remarkable.  I can say no one cares more about their customers more than we do and our investment in their success is proof of that.",Many people have talked about work-life balance here at HubSpot.  I would be prepared to work very hard when you work here and sometimes that means putting in some extra hours.  But the people that do that here want to be here working with their peers and if anything I see people struggle to leave the office because they enjoy the environment so much.
1822,HubSpot,Dream job in here,2015-03-20,5.0,BDR,"The best thing about working here is the energy you feel from one employee to the next. The management is just as energetic, and takes time to mentor lower-level folks like myself. I never feel drained by meetings, calls or otherwise with my coworkers or managers, and we all spend a lot of time together. Everyone is fired up about helping businesses succeed, genuinely.",The interview is tricky! You have to really spend time learning the product and how it is different in the marketing world. I recommend asking a friend who works here to coach you. Asking for help is a necessity from day 1.
1823,HubSpot,"Hands-down, the best place to work in New England.",2015-03-20,5.0,Business Development,"HubSpot is a place where you can essentially reinvent yourself every year (assuming you do a great job in the role that you were hired for). Even post-IPO, the company is growing at such a pace that there are always new leadership opportunities opening up and chances to join ""startups within a startup"". The people are passionate about the product, the customers, and one another.","HubSpot is not for everyone. You will need to do a great job at the role you were hired for in order to benefit from lateral or upward mobility, and you will likely need to be proactive about seeking growth. That said, this is the exact type of person that I WANT to work with. Wouldn't have it any other way."
1824,HubSpot,Great place for go-getters to learn and grow,2015-03-19,5.0,Marketing,"At HubSpot the sky is the limit, anything really is possible. As someone who started in the support department I've seen that first hand. There is no better way to enter HubSpot than through support, you learn so much about the customers, the products and the culture, better than anyone else working here. 

With that knowledge you have an opportunity to make a huge impact in almost any department. The key to HubSpot is making connections with other people in your department and other departments early on. Get involved with projects that you find interesting and where your skills are needed, even if they don't necessarily pertain to your current role. 

You can't expect to move into a new role but simply doing your job in support or in any other position for a year or so. It's not enough, everyone at HubSpot is incredibly intelligent and talented and the ones who advance most rapidly are the ones who put their hands up first and figure out how to get the job done.","Sometimes the work-life balance thing can be challenging, but having a gym helps, being able to work out midday is awesome. The flexibility of working from home whenever you want to/need to is great and unlimited vacation is a real thing! The work hard play hard mentality applies very strongly at HubSpot - if you operate with that attitude already, it helps!"
1825,HubSpot,"Quick interview, world class training, & the best company I have ever worked for!",2015-03-18,5.0,Business Development Representative,"HubSpot has an amazing culture - everyone is here to work hard, our customers come first and thats how it should be. I am surrounded by former ivy league students, MIT grads, and some of the smartest people I have ever come across. The benefits are great (health insurance, ect...), there is also all sorts of in-office perks, snacks, a gym, coffee, open office environment. The top level execs sit at an open desk just like everyone else - it's incredible. 

When you work at HubSpot you become part of a family of 800+ people and the religion here is Inbound Marketing.",I would say that the only con of working at HubSpot is that because the company has gotten so big it is hard to meet people within the company - but that is hardly a con - you just need to find ways to meet new people. If you're not outgoing this isn't the company for you!
1826,HubSpot,"Great company, amazing opportunity for personal and professional growth.",2015-03-18,5.0,Product,"HubSpot has done a remarkable job giving people more autonomy and freedom as they grow, not less.  Management has strong beliefs, but they're loosely held -- meaning that they're willing to listen and empower people to create their own path forward.  It's all about impact and finding ways to enable more people to have a bigger impact.  Really impressive. 

This creates a high energy culture and team filled with real stars.","HubSpot is not for everyone.  Autonomy comes with responsibility and impact only comes from the effort needed to get there.   If you're someone who wants to come in, punch the clock, follow the rules and head home -- you're going to have a hard time succeeding here and being happy."
1827,HubSpot,Definition of why working at a high-growth company is invaluable.,2015-03-18,5.0,Marketing,"I joined HubSpot right out of college and I really feel like I've grown incredibly fast as a result of the company growing incredibly fast. From day one, I've been given huge responsibility and a network and room full of bright, helpful people who make it easy to succeed. Our execs are dedicated to making this whole thing happen and it shows- they're extremely appreciative of employees and in touch with the challenges at a high and detailed level. There really is a special culture that comes from that example, and the fact that we treat culture like a first class citizen and prioritize making this an amazing place to work. There's a ton of freedom to take something and run with it and a constant feeling that what you're working on is part of a larger, impactful mission. And, I know everyone everywhere says this but the work/life balance here really is unmatched. I really don't feel like I need to answer to anyone or justify why I got in at 11 instead or 9- that trust just makes for a more comfortable environment.","There's always more to do and more to learn. That can be good and motivating, but sometimes a little intimidating."

There are alot of perks to working at HubSpot, but at the end of the day it's a great place to work because of the great people who work there.","You work with some of the best people in their industry. This means that the expectations are set extremely high, which can be disheartening if you're just starting out your career like I have."
1829,HubSpot,"Great culture, not much room for growth.",2015-03-13,4.0,Senior Support Engineer,"A lot of great people work here, and the flexibility of ""unlimited"" vacation is fantastic. There's a strong community vibe, which I love. Plus a stocked kitchen, a nap room (though have you tried sleeping on a hammock? It's not comfortable), and a new gym (I didn't get a chance to use it as it opened the week before I left, so I can't vouch for its quality).","Specific to working in Support: the position is sold as a jumping-off point from which you can get any job in the company, but in reality that's a very difficult leap to make -- even when you're working hard and networking well. It is absolutely a job where you can learn a lot, but in my experience other departments tend to be reluctant to hire from Support. If you do apply for positions elsewhere in the company, the process tends to be long, drawn-out, and confusing, with unhelpful feedback. It's easy to get burnt out in Support, particularly since management has begun cracking down on productivity metrics. In addition (this is an incredibly whiney complaint, but it should be said) it can feel like Support is the redheaded stepchild of the company. Other departments get showered with ski retreats and personalized Bose headphones, while Support gets a warm handshake and a pat on the back. Not to undervalue the back-pats; it's great to hear the execs tell you you're the most important department in the company -- it just would be a lot cooler if they actually treated you that way."

1832,HubSpot,Career Growth - Joining a Rocketship,2015-02-17,5.0,Inside Sales,"It's not really about the beer and ping pong it's about the people you get to work with everyday, training to build skills in sales you get to experience, and the potential for long term career growth that comes from working at a rocket-ship company like this. The sales team is well compensated and offered lots of bonus/contest opportunities throughout the course of the year and ensuring sales people are treated fairly is often top of mind for the executives.

Anyone at any level can take on additional responsibility, step up to solve big problems, and be a part of a extremely transparent culture where you can learn the ins and outs of a SaaS business.  Hard to beat that in today's work environment especially in a successful business.","It's a demanding environment which may not be for everyone, but as hard as it is it's often found to be one of the most fun places to work due to the people and career opportunities."
1833,HubSpot,Awesome place to work,2015-02-12,5.0,Inbound Marketing Specialist | Account Executive,"Great people, great view! Fantastic sales support and a really positive team feel.

1834,HubSpot,Great growth opportunities,2015-02-12,5.0,Sales Manager,"The company is growing like crazy and there's lots of opportunity for someone who's highly motivated to advance their career in sales. It's a fun environment, they run contests all the time and over performance is lucrative. Sales mgmt puts on have end of month celebrations at area restaurants/bars when we hit our number and there's budget for  team activities. I started 3 years ago and have been able to more than triple my income in that time. There have also been opportunities to create and add value in ways other than by hitting quota and that's helped me recently transition into a role in sales management.","There's no bench press in the gym...But seriously, It's a high pressure environment where consistent growth and over performance is expected and you will be held accountable. You're held to a monthly number, so if that's off putting to you this probably isn't the right job. Promotions path on the sales side is very numbers driven with little emphasis put on qualitative elements."
1835,HubSpot,Best Job I've Ever Had,2015-02-11,5.0,Sales Manager,"Where do I start?  The people and the culture are amazing.  Before HubSpot I worked at a couple of Fortune 100 companies, did consulting for two years, and briefly owned my own business...none of those work environments came close to what HubSpot has.

Apart from the people and the culture, the training and support is great, the pay is good, the perks are good and always growing (free food, in-house gym, etc.).

As a high growth company career options abound, and lateral moves are common.  I am in sales, and because the sales team in particular is growing fast there is good upward mobility as we add managers to keep pace with the team growth.","In the past I would have said work-life balance, but once I realized I was a borderline workaholic I was able to put limits on how long/hard I would work.  My performance hasn't really declined (I was in the area of small incremental gains where the return for additional hours wasn't there) and I'm very happy with the balance I have struck."
1836,HubSpot,Incredible Ongoing Sales Training,2015-02-11,5.0,Channel Account Manager,"The biggest pro of working at HubSpot is the people. People that are smart, hungry, focused, motivated, and intent on helping me succeed and be the best I can be. In the past year and a half I've grown more as a person and as a sales person, through group training, team training, and one-on-ones with my manager.

HubSpot is not afraid to give employees new opportunities to help us grow either.",The ramp is tough. There is a lot to learn and it's a tough sale. Luckily HubSpot gives you the resources and support to get you through it and you will be a much better sales person on the other side.
1837,HubSpot,Great Company,2015-01-22,5.0,,"Great company with an amazing culture, people. and perks.  The growth isn't slowing down, so you can succeed if you work hard.","It is no longer a small company, but still has a start up feel.

1838,HubSpot,Great Company - extremely faced paced and hard work but you are rewarded and celebrated for it.,2015-01-15,5.0,Inbound Marketing Consultant,Fantastic executive leadership. Innovate in many ways and doesn't do things simply because that's how they are done. Great people and transparency like no other.,Middle management is still a little naive and inexperienced but it's improving.

1839,HubSpot,"Promising, Fun, Energized Company with Great Culture and Product",2015-01-08,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"HubSpot is an incredible place to work as a software engineer. The team is truly top-notch. While marketing/sales software might not sound like the most exciting thing to an engineer, waking up every day to work on a product that changes people's and company's lives is amazing. There is an underlying trust given to all employees - the only policy is ""Use good judgment"". Teams are autonomous and have full ownership over their piece of the product. The tech stack is strong and infrastructure is top notch. The office is great, there is energy, and the company is growing. Leadership doesn't get everything right all the time, but they are transparent and introspective.",The company is growing quickly which means there can be a lot of change. Teams are shuffling around often and product can change. It's not a small startup anymore so you won't know everyone.
1840,HubSpot,World Class Colleagues and Amazing Vision,2014-12-31,5.0,Account Executive,"Great companies start at the top, HubSpot's leadership is remarkably brilliant, driven, and transparent. As employees we are constantly challenged to think outside the box, add value, contribute to the conversation, and go above and beyond goals. No organization is perfect, and there will always be challenges. In fact, there SHOULD be or you're not doing anything right. But what is amazing, is how this company uncovers challenges, understands them, and fixes them remarkably fast. 1 week at HubSpot = 3 months at any other similar size company #GSD","Pace, this is a fast moving environment that can sometimes be overwhelming. It's also nearly impossible to stand out. Our teams are made up of A+ players. Hitting 100% of your goal isn't impressive. Hitting 150% of your goal isn't impressive. But, that's not something that will change and I don't think it's something I'd want to change."
1841,HubSpot,I love working at HubSpot!,2014-12-24,5.0,Software Engineer,"The culture. I fully admit to drinking the Kool-Aid but darn, it's tasty and refreshing. ""Use good judgment"" really does cover most of our policies here. It's empowering and simultaneously encourages employees to really think about their actions.
The people. They're smart, motivated, humble, and overall a great group. I joined HubSpot over two years ago with the promise of learning more than I had at any previous job, and I am still learning a ton.
The perks. They keep getting better and better.",I feel disconnected from the non-engineering parts of the company. Within engineering things can be quirky/dysfunctional and if you can't adapt to the kind-of-weird ways we work (or have the moxie to effect the change you want to see) then you will not last long.
1842,HubSpot,"Good learning experience, frustrating due to lack of structure",2014-12-18,3.0,Business Development Representative,Amazing product and some of the coolest and smartest people I have ever met. It is so easy to get passionate about the future of marketing and work on your skills here.,"Worst BDR program out there. There is no structure to how we operate and no clear direction. The metrics encourage laziness and hinder sales development(which is all self driven). If you want to pick off hot leads and not really build your skills then this is the place to do it. If you want to build loyal reps that come from the BDR level then work closely with those who are eager to learn and stop trying to slow them down. 

Main problem here is that it is not a sales driven organization, so a lot of the sales people here are not true salesmen, but instead are working off of who finds the best leads first. That's frustrating if you are talented, especially at the BDR level."
1843,HubSpot,Senior Software Engineer,2014-12-15,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great culture, great people, great perks.",Didn't find the work that exciting.

You're working with some of the smartest people and no matter what role you're in there is always someone with new ideas on how to improve.

I've worked as a BDR, a VAR BDR  and now as a sales rep and I've had all the coaching to help me be successful.","Not all managers are created equal, though inexperienced managers have been replaced and sales is doing great now.

Its up to you to get the help you need. The sales training never stops but its on you to get it.

It can feel like some people are only out for themselves but, well, that's sales"
1845,HubSpot,Working at HubSpot is fantastic,2014-10-23,5.0,Sales Engineer,"Culture is a big thing here - it is promoted well, and they follow up on their promises. I have a good promotion path and work with a great team. It's fun, I learn new things every day, and I feel comfortable in myself working here, I fit in.","Not many. It's mainly people that can be difficult, most things within the company are fine. I do find that the office here in Dublin is alienated from the US though."
1846,HubSpot,"Work hard, play hard...",2014-09-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"HubSpot has an unrivaled vibrant and dynamic culture that is at the core of everything they do. Working with incredibly smart, driven, and passionate people who genuinely enjoy being at work, doing what they do is a dream come true. 

The HubSpot way is to be constantly improving. From executives to directors to managers, everyone is very open to constructive criticism and feedback. They understand that there is always room to get better and they are willing to do what it takes to get there, and make sure everyone else is along for the ride too.

The benefits are great. The unlimited vacation is real and the added perks are a nice bonus, but the real benefit to working at HubSpot is the caliber of the peers that you have working alongside you. They are scrupulous in their hiring process and make no exceptions for people that won't fit into the culture of the company and the team they are joining and it makes all the difference in the world.","Expectations are high. Getting started can feel like a bit of a sink or swim situation. And, staying in the office late is the norm. BUT, the interview process is pretty transparent so it really shouldn't come as a surprise."
1847,HubSpot,Inspiring and educational environmental with incredible co-workers.,2014-09-29,5.0,Marketing,"The people who work at HubSpot are the best people to surround yourself with. From Day 1 I was blown away by how smart, forward-thinking, and approachable everyone was. Both entry-level employees and executives with 20-30 years experience always make time to teach others. Everyone is very focused on what they can do to help others in the company succeed.","As the company has grown it has become harder to move up in your career. That being said, you are still getting more experience than you would if you moved up at another company."
1848,HubSpot,One of a kind company in Boston,2014-09-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Real company, real brand, real mission. I believe it when the founders say that they want this company to be an anchor company in Boston that is still going strong in another two or three decades, and I believe they'll pull it off. Great team of very smart people, extremely selective about who they hire. Everyone is devoted to the mission, for the most part everyone has a sense of mutual respect and helpfulness towards each other. You can't work here and not learn a dozen new things every day.","Long hours, high expectations for output. Certain ""front line"" sales & services positions are tough to succeed in. Some departments and people have an air of superiority, like their work contributes more to the bottom line than everyone else does."
1849,HubSpot,"Well run, growing fast, changing the business world.",2014-09-26,5.0,Marketing,"Fast growth creates a lot of opportunities.  Well run company with a lot of depth on the management team.  Big vision that should carry the company for years to come.  Flexible work environment, hours and location.  New office space is a big improvement. Very transparent with the management team sharing meeting notes and presentations from the board of directors on an internal wiki.","If you are lazy and want to work 30 hours a week or play a lot of ping pong in the office, this is not the place for you.  HubSpot is a fast paced environment with smart people that work hard."

1852,HubSpot,"Smart people, tons of learning opportunities, helpful managers, great place to grow a career.",2014-08-22,5.0,Marketing,"HubSpot is very good at hiring, which means that everyone who works here is smart, talented, and driven (& on top of that, really fun/interesting people to spend time with). There are also a ton of opportunities to learn & grow your career: training sessions, $5k/year to spend toward continuing your education, Toastmasters for public speaking training, etc. I've found that managers here are genuinely interested in helping you grow your career & specifically don't want to pigeon-hole you in the position they hired you for. The philosophy is that if you're good, they'd rather keep you at the company & move you into a position you're happy about rather than see you get frustrated & leave. Also, the flexible working hours/work-from-home policy is awesome.","People work really, really hard here, so the pressure is on pretty much all the time. Very much work hard/play hard. It's not for everyone."
1853,HubSpot,"Noble mission, but it has normal big company problems",2014-08-08,4.0,Inbound Marketing Consultant,"It's a great place to learn a lot about marketing and entrepreneurship, and a fun office environment. There's a lot of autonomy, and as long as you hit your metrics you'll have a long leash, and flexibility. One of the only companies I've come across that truly encourages you to move around between depts. The biggest asset are the people work there. Everyone is super smart, and they're quick to fire employees not working out. It leads to a really top notch organization.","They hired great start up minds to grow the business, but aren't a start up anymore. So those people are getting bored and leaving, or being forced out. HubSpot has a really noble mission, they're trying to transform the way a modern business operates (with progressive views on vacation, flexible hrs, transparency, etc). However, the mission is different than the reality. They're an 800 person company, and internally they function like one. Lots of red-tape, politics, lack of cooperation between depts, and comp cut-backs were happening when I left."

1864,HubSpot,Best place to work on the East Coast,2014-02-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"HubSpot offers huge freedom for top performers and an ability to aggressively direct your own career. It also offers mostly well-formed roles that can permit ""normal"" work-life balance. A lot of that is what you make of it, but the key for me is the abillity to work harder and to get rewarded for it. In all roles, that is highly valued over time, and the growth of the company is reflected in the growth of individuals at all levels.

Also, it's worth noting that as an organization HubSpot admits to not having it all figured out, and actively wants to improve with the help of all of its employees. Again, not for everyone, but if you're into that kind of environment, you can really flourish at HubSpot.","Can be overwhelming at first, but if it's a good fit for you, you'll love it. Understandably, it's not a fit for everyone. Management is a lot better at accommodating different work styles today than it was a year or two ago.

Can also offer mixed signals with recruiting practices (e.g. beer fridge and ping pong) when reality is a hyper-growth, hard-working job. But I think savvy candidates get this."

- a ton of politics, for a company that claims to be ""flat"" and have a ""no door policy,"" behind the scene politics dictate everything.. .and if you aren't behind the scenes, then you simply fall victim to decisions made
- for a place so data-driven, they ignore a lot of the big numbers... namely the number of people leaving, its as if the floodgates have opened.
- favoritism... if you are one of the named few, you can do anything you want (i.e., not perform) and still have job security, even opportunity for advancement, over people who actually deserve it
- AWFUL pay... even on the sales team where you can supposedly make a ton, they pay miserably low salaries, far below market-rate, and if you even try to ask for a raise, you will be looked at like an alien- and probably treated like one

It's a great place to start if you're looking to get a cool name on your resume and learn the ins and outs of a SaaS company.","There are so many holes in this company that a candy wall and unlimited vacation cannot fix. 

Promotions are totally out of control. There are many senior employees who do not deserve the titles or pay they have and continuously get away with underperforming and mismanaging their teams. There is a complete lack of management training so people who are promoted into a management role have ZERO idea what they're doing. Company feedback forms clearly identified that junior employees felt there was a lack of management and senior employees acknowledged the absence of management training. Nothing was done about that when I was there. 

Salary was also a huge pain point across many departments. For one of the more expensive cities in the country and a company that claims to be doing extremely well, they could afford to pay employees (who are claimed to be extremely important), more than the bare minimum. It was heartbreaking to see a chart shared at a company meeting listing what an entry level employee should be making at a software company and it was $10k more than what employees are offered in entry level roles.

Sales people can't take vacation unless they claim quota relief months in advance, otherwise you'll go on vacation but risk being fired because you didn't hit quota. And in other departments, you have to work throughout your vacation just to keep up, or work 80+ hour weeks before and after your vacation (which kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?). The office is so full of intense, A-type personalities, which can be a good thing for being around smart people, but also a bad thing because nobody EVER stops working, so you feel like you can't either.

-Prepare to work 50 hrs a week (No work-life balance).
-About 2 people in this role quit a month (they bring on 4-5/mo)

1884,HubSpot,A great company eyeing to go great places,2013-06-18,5.0,Support Engineer,"The best trait of HubSpot is by far the people - my co-workers make my days not just tolerable, but enjoyable.  I think that I can safely say that everyone at HubSpot works hard, but not so hard that you lose the ability to have a life or friends outside of the office.  If I've needed days or half-days off, I've never been given angry eyes or felt like I was being judged for it.

On that note, the vacation policy is hard to beat.  It was recently amended that you must take two weeks minimum (to cover for the dark side of ""no vacation policy""), but can take infinity otherwise (the company meeting actually used the infinity symbol).  

I feel challenged at my job - not in a way where I feel I cannot succeed or am fighting an uphill battle, but in the way where each day has some new challenges and isn't the day that it was before.  I work an eight hour day regularly and do not feel pressured to work more, nor is my workload one that requires more.   

I think one of the biggest pros though is that I can tell that the management actually actually cares about the employees - and not in some superficial ""You matter to us"" way, but in a real, ""We invest in you and do things to show that how you feel is actually important.""  It's little things, but when there was a city-wide emergency, they made sure that everyone was safe, accounted for and had a way home; they survey us and list our grievances publicly, giving a plan of action for how to deal with them; the founders and executive team sit at open desks and encourage anyone to stop by.  It's in the things that no one expects or requires that show a real investment in the employees.","Some positions are clearly in a better spot than others - those on the sales side are clearly (and not unjustifiably) pushed to reach their numbers.  Sometimes, hitting those numbers comes with on-boarding customers who may not be ready for HubSpot, which can burden members of that team, as well as support.

Additionally, there appears at times to be a divide between support and other parts of the company.  HubSpot is valued for its support team - you can call in and have someone answer the phone, most times, within a minute - and be walked through almost any problem you have.  However, there is palpable tension over the compensation of this team and the value that seems to go sometimes unmentioned."
1885,HubSpot,A great place to grow your career,2013-06-16,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- If you kill your numbers, you can switch departments and work on pretty much whatever you'd like. It used to be encouraged even more, but you can start a project on the side that you believe in, and if you prove its worth, you can turn it into your full-time job.
- Lots of flexibility. Unlimited vacation policy is what you make of it -- too many people guilt trip themselves out of going on vacation. You can also work remotely whenever you need to, no questions asked.
- Extreme transparency, even as the company is growing. If anyone complains about transparency going away, it's their own fault for not keeping up with the internal wiki.
- Opportunities are not based on age, but on talent and results. So if you're a rockstar, you can progress in your career relatively quickly.
- A ton of smart people to learn from.
- Nice benefits.
- Great location near a T (green line, but it's better than driving!)","- Compensation. I had to fight for what I get now, and I still know I could be making more elsewhere.
- Very cliquey and reminiscent of high school. It wasn't always this way, just within the past year or so.
- The culture has been a bit forced lately. Lotttts of talking about it, without any real improvements being made. 
- The hiring bar has gotten so low. We're looking for cultural fit so much that we're bringing in people who are chatty and social instead of being productive and knowledgable of the field.
- The kitchen area is consistently gross.
- Very cramped working quarters (and you literally have to wait in line to use the restroom), but we're getting tons more space so this should be getting better by 2014."

- Incredible support and guidance from managers and the team as a whole. Blank slates / open minds are welcomed and even encouraged. Training is on-going and thorough and there are so many resources that will help make sure that you can and will succeed
- Great place to establish your career, regardless of your age / expertise. No matter who you are, if you spend 2 years working at HubSpot, you should walk out with a very good understanding of what it means to build a company, how to launch an experiment, what types of metrics the company needs to hit in order to reach our fullest potential, why those metrics matter, and so much more.
- It is a FUN place to work. This has nothing to do with the beer fridge and ping pong table. This has to do with endless challenges that everyone is invited to help tackle. This has to do with a strong network of colleagues, many of whom will help form your professional network far beyond HubSpot. This has to do with a culture where its appropriate to challenge authority and where big bold risks are generally compensated with great rewards and recognition.",HubSpot is not for everyone.

Personally, this is an extremely motivating work environment - to know that ""I'm not the only one"" giving it 110%.","While it is great to promote from within, I wish there was more clarity & visibility into internal promotions - understanding the root cause for these promotions - more than just the normal highlights, a couple examples & top accomplishments of an individual, but the real ""why"" behind the promotion.

You should just wave goodbye to having a life, because your life from 7am to 7pm is now 100% HubSpot.  The monthly quota is very difficult to meet, and if you have four months sub-quota, then you are at risk of being put on the performance plan.  The turnover is high and they recently made it more difficult to get promoted.  Also, they try to sell the ""no vacation policy"" as an opportunity to responsibly take unlimited amount of vacation.  However, since you are on a monthly quota, you basically find yourself NEVER being able to take vacation.  Fortunately, they recognized this.  But the way they combatted this was by increasing the monthly quota and saying once you've been there for a year then you can take two months at 50% quota (and still get paid 100%...if you hit your number).  Ask about 80% of the sales reps there, and they will tell you that this job is insanely stressful and will take over your life."

1921,HubSpot,Amazing place to grow professionally and have fun while doing so,2012-11-29,5.0,Too Many to List,"I learned a TON at HubSpot.  In fact, my time at HubSpot launched my career.  The executive team is very approachable, willing to listen, and offer advice.  Management in general is very transparant and willing to share the reasoning behind their strategies and solicit feedback.  So just in my day-to-day activity I was learning through my interactions with management.  

It's kind of like an Ivy league school where you really do get out of it what you put into it.  If you want to show up and do your job and that's it, that's fine and it will look good on your resume.  But if you want to get involved, solve challenges, work on cross departmental projects, and really grow professionally, then your options are nearly unlimited.  I know many people who joined HubSpot at an entry level position and very quickly picked up additional responsibilities and grew into a management role (which means they like to promote from within, so that's another huge plus).

Aside from the above, HubSpot has a great culture, cool people to work with (in fact I'm still very good friends with numerous people at HubSpot), and every day was fun and exciting.  It's one of the few jobs where I looked forward to waking up and coming into work.

You may be asking why I left if it was so awesome?  It was simply because another company made an offer I couldn't refuse (it was basically my dream job).  I was definitely reluctant to leave HubSpot and sad when I did.","Honestly, HubSpot isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a 9-5 job just to pay the bills, you probably wont be happy at HubSpot.  If instead you're looking to grow your career, learn alot, and aren't afraid to put in some real work, you wont regret your decision."

There are a few jerks, but for the most part 95% of the people there are good folks.","-No work life balance as a sales rep (IMS), even though the company touts the ""unlimited vacation policy"". This perk is not reality for sales rep who are faced with monthly sales quotas. 
-They also promote superstar sales reps into sales management too quickly, many of whom have no management experience, which can lead to disaster"
1923,HubSpot,HubSpot,2012-09-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great people, intelligent folks get hired here. Folks with a great sense of humor, lots of good schools represented. It looks great on your resume to have HubSpot on it, especially in the Boston area. Marketing is a great area to work in. Software can also be very good. Sales is horrible. Being an IMC is no fun.",Still no women in the leadership team. It is truly a boys club kind of place. Very political place. No Human Resources function. When you leave they write you off and can be nasty about it.
1924,HubSpot,Best and worst traits of all startups,2012-09-05,1.0,Services,"Very subjective pros: Beer fridge, frat house environment, East Coast pioneers in brogramming, work-related parties, work-related after-hours hackathons, work-related dinners, work-branded swag.","Take the reviews of HubSpot that suggest that hard work and enterprise are the path to success and advancement in context: it depends on the department and your management. That culture is not company-wide, and despite the rah-rah about transparency, most decisions are made behind closed doors, and most job/advancement openings are filled silently because someone pitched it directly to a decision-maker.

There's no infrastructure for advancement on merit if you do not play the office politics. If your management, especially your VP-level management, doesn't like you or your ideas, you're not moving. You don't have control over your own advancement unless you have some degree of suction with management.

Company culture reinforces that HubSpot comes first; you socialize through HubSpot, you eat at HubSpot, you play at HubSpot, you bath at HubSpot, you exercise with HubSpotters, you drink with HubSpotters. If this is a problem, or if you want a life outside of work that doesn't include HubSpot, company culture reinforces that there are tons of other startups in Cambridge, which is a very, very good point.

For Services, morale is bottomed out; people who are staying are doing so for the IPO or because they can get away with a level of achievement commiserate to their pay.

Don't join HubSpot for the options, don't join it for the culture, don't join it for the career trajectory unless you already know someone who knows someone already there. Please don't join if you're an introvert.

Join if you're an ace at office politics, if you can wrap any level of work in a nice presentation, or if you're interested in marketing or sales. Join if you don't mind promoting your employer and anyone your employer is affiliated with on your personal social media channels.

This is a marketing company, no matter what they sell now or decide to sell later--they will sell marketing to anyone. If you aren't interested in marketing, no matter what position you're applying for, no matter how far away from marketing you think you'll be, stay away."

There is a unique balance of a laid back attitude, where often times you do not even feel like you are work, while at the same time everyone is working extremely hard with one common goal in mind. You are surrounded by an extremely intelligent (yet humble) hard working group of people where no matter your place in the company you feel like you are on a team. There is a constant energy running through the place that leaves you feeling excited to be at work and that you are participating in something big. Open door policy does not fully capture how accessible everyone really is – all of upper management, including the CEO, are extremely approachable people who genuinely care about their employees. HubSpot is highly focused on career growth and it is not uncommon to see people try on new roles with full support/mentorship from their respective managers. I can’t say enough positive things about this place – it is packed with an amazing group of driven/friendly people and truly stands behind the “work hard, play hard” attitude.",The work life balance can be a little tricky but putting your full effort and time in you will definitely reap the rewards.
1928,HubSpot,Excellent place to grow and contribute,2012-07-10,5.0,,"If you honestly love major challenge, teamwork, innovating, building, working hard and learning a lot everyday- you'll likely thrive at HubSpot. The back of the company sweatshirts read ""We Bleed Orange"" (orange being the inbound marketing/ HubSpot brand color), and that is a completely serious statement. The team at HubSpot is absolutely dead set on making marketing better and easier, and the positive vibe of that mission is contagious. The HubSpot mission is really clear... and every employee truly has the chance to look at that mission- and help draw the next phases of the road map, which is just so rare. If you have an idea... you share it. If you want to try something, can articulate why it would be a good idea, and have proven yourself to be an A player- you'll probably get a fair shot at it. Seriously. You won't have any dull days.","If the above sounds like more than you are really in the market for... those pros could be cons! Yep- HubSpot is challenging, you'll have serious commitments to your team, you'll be expected to work really hard, and be willing to learn and grow. At the end of the day....  you'll say you really did something."

-Cool office space
-Free food and beer","-Absolutely no work-life balance. If you are looking to devote your life to something - this may be your nirvana. If you have friends, family, other hobbies and/or a relationship you care about outside of HubSpot, good luck maintaining that while working here. If you're not physically in the office, you're expected to be working at all times. Everyone acts like everything is life or death. It's inbound marketing software, not an emergency room.
-No structure. If you like to do your own thing and are very entrepreneurial, you may enjoy this. Policies and company direction can change day to day and you may be working in marketing one day, in product the next.
-No HR department. Good luck if you have issues with your manager.
-Unlimited Vacation Policy = No vacation time. In Sales you have to be there over a year, making your number every month to even get a week off. 
-No reimbursement/discount for parking or T passes.
-Insane turnover. The past year of acquistions, one in particular, has brought more change than HubSpot can handle. Many long time employees (particularly on the developer side) have left in frustration as the new world order came in and rolled over everything. Anyone who was critical of this was eliminated or left because they were so miserable."

- Exposure to startup culture, decisions, and growth stages of a business - there are tons of opportunities to learn lessons from guest lecturers and some of HubSpot's own.
- Management has bet the business on reinvigorating and building a successful product company - they cleaned house and are behind product and engineering 100% (it's very exciting)","- High expectations and not a lot of formal process or training programs in place for developers.

In fact the #1 reason to work at HubSpot is to experience first hand an executive team with a near flawless execution of creating one of the fastest growing companies and take it public.

HubSpot was also one of the more transparent companies I have known. Management did a great job of sharing the goals of the company and was extremely successful making sure the employees were aware of what they needed to do to help achieve those goals.","With a company so driven toward success, it became apparent that the numbers were more important than the people.

1935,HubSpot,HubSpot Engineering - Great Opportunity to Build Scalable Product,2012-03-21,5.0,,"- Very smart coworkers and management. Really sharp product builders at levels of building scalable systems, solid user experiences, and product design.

- It is a very ambitious company. It wants to build a broad, scalable product for marketers and become a big business. The product covers a large number of verticals (SEO, blogging, email, social, etc) that would be difficult for any startup to tackle. It means there is a lot to do and pressure to get things done (this is a good thing). 

- Young company means younger engineers can have bigger impact. 

- Extremely transparent company. I've never seen a company use a wiki to share as much information as HubSpot does nor have as open a culture. That combined with a very competent senior management means you get a lot of insight into the direction of the business.

- Great place to learn both in terms of technology & entrepreneurial thinking. HubSpot has killer marketing, strong sales, is building a growing SaaS business and attacking a new market. If you want to start your own company one day it is a solid place to pick up a lot of knowledge, including a crash course in inbound marketing.

- Helping small-to-medium sized businesses do marketing better is surprisingly rewarding. Many opportunities to engage with customers who are often thankful for helping their businesses grow.

- Nice office, good compensation, good equipment (new MBPs, ThunderBold displays), beer fridge, etc.","- History of some crufty code & product. Things have undergone a major transformation in the last 9 months, but there are still legacy components that have to be handled. 

- It is a growing company which means it is frequently outgrowing some set of processes and finding its way forward. Very little bureaucracy but coordination between groups is always a challenge. It would be a bad fit if you are uncomfortable with change."

11.       Every day I see something created by HubSpot engineers, sales peeps, marketing peeps, support folks and consultants that blows my mind
12.    It is a scientific, MIT engineered certainty that something awesome will happen in my life because I have worked for HubSpot","We work a lot of hours, it's no joke. It's also no joke to become the 2nd fastest growing software company in the country and we are all proud of it. You don't get there by laying back. If anything, the intensity can get tiring, but.. when you get too tired because you work like mad guess what happens.... YOU GET TO TAKE A VACATION.

When I see negative reviews on here about HubSpot, I kind of just want to shake the people that wrote them. Maybe I have had bad luck prior to HubSpot with difficult/unhappy jobs... but I don't think that's the case. I am a very grateful person. HubSpot isn't perfect, no job is. But, I always have the option of fixing anything that isn't perfect and am prided for doing so and in fact encouraged."
1938,HubSpot,A tale of two companies - I was happy for 90% of my time there and the last 10% was like watching a kingdom burn,2012-01-14,2.0,Developer,"Let me preface this by saying that I worked at HubSpot before and after a large disruptive shift in how the company perceived its employee pool.

The developer pool at HubSpot is still quite talented and there are some very good developers there, or what's left of them at least. On certain teams you can work with and learn from some great developers.

Company does actually let you take time off through its honor system time-off policy.","The last several months I worked at HubSpot could be gently called a witch hunt, as leadership decided they wanted a disruption in the company to reshape the development team into a specific mold - that mold being one of decisions driven more by impulse and the mantra of ""just do it"" rather than ""just do it (conscientiously)."" People who didn't buy into the new world order left, and others were unceremoniously terminated.

Team cohesion became very disjointed, it was very much like seeing two separate teams - those that wanted more conscientious change, and those that told the other side to shut up and do as they say.

I'd say if you're a certain type of developer - one who claims to abhor process and wants to produce prolific amounts of code which will then probably be rewritten multiple times in short order, and want your developer philosophies heavily mixed with a heavy side of uncertainty and frenetic chaos, you will fit well into the new world.

The benefits, for those that care, are very much what you'd expect from a start up. The vacation policy is the selling point, and you certainly won't starve on your pay, but the promise of IPO dollars is part of the package. There is no 401k match."
1939,HubSpot,A great place for young and hip professionals,2012-01-11,4.0,,"Hard working, smart folks...an air of 'let's have fun' at work....passionate and cutting edge thinking. Great location, too.","Looks like they are going through growing pains and frustrations at higher levels were getting hotter when I was there. Lots of freedom for folks to test things out can be a good thing, but w/out some some guidelines, some projects also turn out to be a big waste of time - for too many folks."
