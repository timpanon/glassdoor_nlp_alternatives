Highly respected Laboratory and attracts some of the most intelligent and talented people. The R&D magic they create and problems they solve instill pride and awe for those of us participating in their work.,"The support staff are treated awful!! Toxic management styles, terrible work life balance and the ""Good Ole boys club"" is very evident. They try to hide it but it is so blatant & toxic. The attrition rate is a testament to the facts"
1,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Good working climate,2022-04-05,4.0,IT Project Manager,Good benefits and a laid back climate,Laid back culture can sometimes mean no accountability for tasks getting completed
2,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Good Work-Life Balance,2022-04-03,4.0,Senior Embedded Engineer,"Work life balance, managers who actually care, good benifits","Low salary, understaffed, lots of misc. paperwork/auditing"
3,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Amazing Place to Grow and Learn,2022-03-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"Super smart people, impactful problems, challenging and engaging work. The best coworkers (they feel like friends)",Percentage based work. Filling up 100% with multiple projects can be a lot or not enough depending on the project.

5,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Good place to work, especially for early career staff",2022-03-28,5.0,Software Engineer,Strong emphasis on learning and skill development,Generally not as fast-paced as other companies. Experience variance is high due to a very diverse set of tasks and scopes of work.
6,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Cutting edge work, some major issues",2022-03-26,1.0,Biomedical Scientist,"Cutting-edge work, mostly government but close ties to academics at JHU too.  Good work-life balance (for most groups and projects).  Good vacation time and 401k matching is the best I've ever seen. Very smart peers that are not competitive and are willing to help you learn & grow.","Salaries are lower than peers (but I heard management is starting to realize that and address it).  Senior management doesn't really seem very receptive to full-time remote workers. Very hard to get patents for inventions - tech transfer manager only whines about not having enough money and having too much other work from her boss...when you do convince them you have a good product, they're not very good at getting it out there (my advice to staff still there is to try to get the Baltimore technology office involved because they know what they are doing.)"
7,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Make your career here if you possibly can,2022-03-24,5.0,Associate Professional Staff II,"APL sets the bar for great companies to work for. Their primary concern is delivering great work product to government sponsors, but they understand better than most businesses that they cannot continue doing that on a long-term basis without investing in their staff.

Professional development is expected and supported. If the skills you want to acquire are remotely mission-relevant, you will find APL management supportive of your pursuits.

You will find yourself in an environment where brilliant people are working on cutting-edge technologies. But if you have come to expect brilliant people to be bristly and unwilling to share their expertise, as I had, you will find that the folks at APL are overjoyed to talk about what they're working on and open opportunities to get you involved in things that interest you. There is a subject matter expert on staff in pretty much any area you can imagine, and I never encountered one who was unwilling to make time in their schedule to chat with me.

There is an institutional commitment to diversity that they seem to actually follow through on. They still have a ways to go, but there are people from a variety of backgrounds, both culturally/ethnically and educationally.

Finally, I appreciate the degree to which all staff are kept up-to-date on the strategic direction and success of the company. Management will keep you up to date on tasking strategy, productivity levels, capital improvements, and other details of running the business. At first, if you're like me, this will be too much information and you will not understand why you should care. But as you settle into your position, you will realize what a rare prize it is to know these things and be able to use the information to plan ahead for your work and your career. Paying attention to these presentations is also how you can get internal money to explore your own ideas—this is encouraged and rewarded at all levels of the organization.

You will work hard at APL, but if you are bright and curious and dedicated, you will struggle to find a more fulfilling place to work.","Despite continuing progress on diversity initiatives, the management levels of APL are still mostly old white guys. They are friendly and approachable old white guys, but it would be good to see more diversity at the top levels.

Management seems resistant to having full-time remote employees on staff, even where that should be possible for a particular workload. I'm not sure whether this is because their metrics show that these staff are less productive, but I think they will start to miss out on some of the best candidates if they maintain this stance going forward.

For me, the location was a bit of a con. Howard County is fine, but it's a bit sleepy for my taste."

With so much turnover, there are more career growth roles available than usual.","Upper management does not seem to trust that technical staff can work effectively from home or that younger generations care about APL's mission. There is a huge amount of tension that spills out into meetings between management and staff as a significant number of staff members simply find their home environment to be where they are most effective, while increasing their quality of life and safety during recent COVID-19 surges. Upper management telling technical staff to return to cramped shared offices during the omicron surge was expectedly terrible for morale, especially with the addition of tracking employees' return to office via badge swipes. Upper management is making the return to the office the hill that they are willing to die on, and results are showing increased turnover and decreased morale. 

Pay is a bit low for the industry, but staff would overlook it due to solid benefits and their belief in the mission (as they always have previously) if they felt trusted and empowered by management.

Typical cons associated with large organizations: office politics, red tape, slow to adjust."

32,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Work culture = toxic, conservative; promised work-life balance isn't true",2022-02-01,3.0,Associate Professional Staff I,"Pay is good if you have a PhD. Bachelors and masters make around the same starting. Salary increases are good enough in your first few years here, but then they only equate to inflation or less after that.

They'll pay for your graduate degree at Hopkins (or elsewhere). You can leave after, no strings attached.","The pandemic isn't being taken seriously by leadership. They once promised a flexible work environment with emphasis on remote work (since it had worked so well during the start of the pandemic). They nixed that and are forcing staff to be in a minimum of 3-days per week (but strongly encouraging 4-5 days), tracking our presence via badge scanning. The leadership is old, majority white, and majority male. Stuck in the past and harming the company's future by alienating their early-career staff (20s-30s) who are used to hybrid and remote work environments. The attrition rate in one of our sectors is 8% (increased by 4-5% since implementing the forced in-person presence and not shutting down operations in the slightest during the Omicron wave). This job doesn't care about your mental or physical health.

Tasking can be a mess depending on your group. You can be severely overtasked or undertasked at the snap of a finger. Burnout is common.

Emphasis on innovation, which can be great for fields that have a lot of ""invention"" going on. For others, it's difficult and you'll see a lot of reinventing the wheel, as to keep groups afloat with minor internal funding, in the hopes that a sponsor will fund an idea.

I'm a bit jaded as my experience here has been full of overwhelm and burnout. Group, branch, and sector leadership are failing their young staff, among others.

Little vacation time: 15 days for the first 5 years that you work here.
Little sick time: 7 days.
Location: Laurel, MD (boring suburb and a solid drive from both DC and Baltimore)

Demographics: very white, very male (both significant majorities) -- they will tell you the statistics during your onboarding. Most people here are moderate or conservative."

Shutting down debate, censoring folks. Claim to be all about integrity, but upper management encourges illegal use of charge codes and lying to staff, but never in writing.

47,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,be careful,2022-01-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits. Great people to work with.,"APL management actively discriminates against minority groups in its organization. If you speak up at all you will be fired.

APL fosters an environment of fear.

APL actively discriminates against its support staff. There are different sets of benefits for support or ""professional"" staff.

Career opportunities for technical staff are very limited.

Senior management is not interested in listening when concerns are brought up. They want issues swept under the rug to keep their image clean.

If you are part of any minority group (women, religious, racial) stay away from this place. I observed so much discrimination during my 1.5 years at APL it was truly shocking."
48,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Can be a fantastic place to work if you don't mind being significantly underpaid; note: covid vaccine mandate,2022-01-12,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- great work life balance
- very interesting work
- lots of variety
- great job security
- lots of opportunities to learn
- great benefits
- sometimes you get to choose the projects you work on (if you and your skills are in demand and you have networked)

The experience varies depending on what role you have and which Sector you are in (and likely even which group), but I personally have had a really good work experience here. I have enjoyed it so much that I have often thought that I would work here until I retire and the very sub-par pay was worth it. The work/life balance and benefits are great; the work is interesting and incredibly varied with lots of opportunities to learn; the job security is generally good (other than recent covid developments--see below).","- pay is not competitive with comparable government positions, other federal contractors, and not even close to industry.  Note: get any higher-level degree(s) before you start if you want to work here
- ""promotions"" do not come with any pay increase
- bonuses are generally smaller and much more rare than in industry (do not expect one every year)
- covid vaccine mandate (get the jab or lose your job)

This is not the place to work if competitive pay or advancement/recognition is important to you. 

APL does not really have an advancement track for technical leadership, and that combined with a matrixed management (both line and program managers) means that you have to go into management of some kind to ""rise"" in the organization. 

APL is not the place to work -- at least at the moment -- if a remote/strongly hybrid work environment is important to you post-pandemic. For some parts of the lab (but not all), even if you worked fully remotely since before the pandemic but live less than 100 miles away from the lab, you are required to come in a minimum 3 days a week. This policy is hopefully temporary, and does not apply to all Sectors. But it sure is a doozie for some people when combined with the twice-a-week covid testing policy for those who are not fully vaccinated (see below).

There is currently a covid vaccine mandate in place (for all employees, including fully-remote) and the way that APL has handled the whole thing has been very, very poorly to say the least. It's become highly politicized in my opinion and it seems like management has forgotten all of the Diversity and Inclusion training that they have been giving to everyone in the way that they are treating some of their employees.

Lots of good employees have either resigned, retired early, or been fired between the forced on-site and vaccine policies. I am still working at APL, but am appalled at the treatment of some of my colleagues. It seems very atypical of APL and I'd have never believed that it could happen like this until it did.

If you don't think the covid vaccines are the best thing ever, you may want to look elsewhere (or at least keep your mouth very, very shut). Don't count on a religious or medical exemption, though some (few) have been granted on a ""trial basis"" (which they can revoke anytime at their discretion). These exemptions were granted after keeping everyone in limbo for 3+ months knowing that any day they could be told that they have just one week to get the jab or lose their job. If you do get an exemption (or are waiting months for one), APL requires twice-a-week negative testing, and does not offer that testing on-site."

They really care about supporting you to be the best you can, via pursuing more education, leadership roles, lisetning to new ideas, exposing you to more work experience ,etc.

Compared to other giant organizations in the defense industry, it's way easier to move around and do different work or do different things, because they want you doing work that you are motivated to do so that we all can get the best results.

There exists a whole structure for any employee to come up with brand new ideas that APL will fund . And if you begin to show promising results they will continue to fund it even further.

This place just fosters improvement all around.

65,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Used to be good. Turned real sour.,2021-12-09,2.0,Research Engineer,"Before the 2021 covid vaccine mandates, APL was a wonderful place to work. Nearly everyone I talked to thought so. I thought so. They do a huge variety of extremely cool things across the domains of space, robotics, AI, medicine, security, IT, and more. Everyone is highly qualified and enthusiastic. Leadership is available to talk all the way to the top (I even sent an email to the top man once, and got a personal response.) There were some issues, but overall I could hardly have asked for a better company. I hope, if I start a company some day, to apply many lessons I learned from the management here.","Then the covid vaccine mandates hit. For most companies, exemptions were something reasonably considered and, if practical, an employee would be accommodated. Not everywhere, I know, but many places. APL, on the other hand, couldn't set their deadlines short enough or tolerate even the most benign exemptions. Exemption decisions took months, terminations were mere days after they _finally_ got around to responding (no ETA was given to anyone), and basically no accommodation was considered ""reasonable"". Fully remote employees were considered unaccommodateable. One employee offered to be demoted to an older role with active job openings to be easier to accommodate, and was denied. Numerous peers and managers were actively hostile toward the ""unvaxxed"", boasting in how little they cared about what happened to them (generally calling for them all to be fired without exception). Managers went around with social distancing sticks, poking and checking the distance between people. People who took the shots under duress, broken down in tears because they felt they had no other choice, were told that nobody ""forced"" them. Even vaccinated people who thought that their peers should be able to make their own decisions felt so appalled at the Lab's behavior that many felt they could no longer stay.

In short, in the past few months the lab has turned utterly toxic and has betrayed their core principles of integrity and inclusion. These betrayals are from both peers and managers, all the way to the top. I, and many others, look back on the past few months at APL with utter revulsion, dread, and gloom.

Woke and authoritarian ""leadership"" has overwhelmed all the good. It's such a shame. The executives will force you to attend endless training on inclusion, diversity and empathy. Yet they show know of these leadership attributes themselves. The director communicated very little with the staff throughout the pandemic but when he did it was almost always political. The pandemic has exposed the failure in leadership. They are giving staff denied religious accomodations a whopping 7 days after the denial to be fired. The lab desperately needs new executives that care about the staff. I thought I would begin and end my career at APL. Now I am actively looking for a better employer"

83,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Overall, great place to work and would recommend",2021-10-16,4.0,Associate Professional Staff I,"Work life balance, interesting work, flexibility on projects, good salary, and good benefits (retirement matching is unreal - 10.5% on 4%)! Overall, APL is a great place to work. Most of the time I had interesting work, and coworkers are generally great. The academic but meaningful nature of work is somewhat unique and something I really enjoyed. I would definitely recommend the lab. It's got helpful and smart people, interesting work, and treats employees with respect. They recently instituted a COVID vaccine mandate.","I wrote out a bunch, but do not let this deter you. Just listing out things I have noticed over the years. All jobs have pros and cons, and at APL, the pros far outweigh the cons. 

-Communication and transparency could use work, particularly with return to work policies. Sectors are setting policies independently, and policies are changed without informing lower level employees. Understand they are in uncharted territory but lack of communication is frustrating. Further, lab leadership was using bizarre reasons (stats about productivity and sponsor visits without providing actual numbers) to justify returning to work in-person full time. 
-Culture and policies can vary greatly by group (I had a good group so not complaining but worth being aware of). Can be annoying when you know people in other groups who have more flexibility than you despite doing similar work.
-APL is a gov contractor so you have to find work to cover you. Generally, this isn't a problem, but some projects will have sudden stops in work and some supervisors are more helpful in assisting staff in finding projects than others. --Matrix organization can be frustrating. Your supervisor determines your raise but may never have worked with you. 
-Lab places a lot of importance on technical skills, which is understandable, but soft skills (organization, management, budgeting) are undervalued. Sometimes someone who is phenomenal technically gets put in charge of a project, and the project is poorly run because they do not have good management skills. 
-There are other, smaller complaints - parking availability, kitchen/refrigerators for lunch storage and prep, area cost of living ($$$$), location (not a lot nearby), cafeteria could be better."
84,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,2021-10-16,3.0,Operations Researcher,"Working at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory was a great experience. I learned a lot about operations research and the operational naval domain. The working environment is first-class. And you are privileged to work with some of the brightest minds in your field. Furthermore, they were supportive and accommodating during the pandemic, creating a work-from-home posture, while continuing to serve the nation.","I decided to leave after they created a policy mandating that employees must be vaccinated for the SARS-COV-2 virus. While they accepted disability and religious exemptions, I felt that they could have better supported employees that could work remotely, and give them the option to be tested regularly. I understand that working remotely can be challenging in a classified environment, but I was able to obtain adequate unclassified coverage to work-from-home for one year. Furthermore, they provided one-month notice, and suggested that would be adequate time to find new employment. I would have liked a little more time, to be honest."

Mathematicians, physicists, engineers, computer scientists, and other subject matter experts collaborate to solve challenging problems. We have the option to participate in academic collaborations and to publish research based on the problems we solve at the lab.

The company is selective in choosing high quality employees, gives them a good salary and benefits, and keeps them until they retire so that expertise remains within the company. This makes APL stable, reliable, and innovative for both customers and employees. While working here you will feel like you are doing something good in the world. It is also a stable place to raise a family. It is completely the opposite of the cut-throat revolving door practices of other companies where hiring is run by Machiavellian third-party hiring companies.","The laboratory is located in between Baltimore and Washington, DC which is suboptimal for many employees causing some of them to commute from over an hour away. The reason is simple - the company attracts people who want to raise families and Maryland is not a good place to raise a family."

For the work you actually do and the expectations the hourly pay should be $3-$5 an hour more(especially considering they pay MSP 2-3 times what they pay APL Security just to sleep in their cars or watch movies). You will likely walk 7000 steps every night doing rounds if you are not manning a desk in a building. The OT is extremely inconsistent in complete contrast to what is said during the interview process, the revolving door of staffing leads to shift shortages and drafts so you will do 16 hours straight.

The work is more impactful than at tech companies and more interesting/diverse than at defense contractors. Good mentoring as well.,"Culture at the lab varies greatly depending on your sector and group, and it's hard to get a sense for how you fit into your group's culture until you start working there . Also salary is a bit lower than at defense contractors or Silicon Valley companies; however, the interesting work and status as an academic (versus defense contractor) make up for it. Finally, seems like salary increases gradually taper off after entry-level years; maybe this is best as an entry-level job."
103,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"If you are a fresh PhD hired for no specific project, you will have a bad time",2021-09-05,2.0,Senior Professional Staff I,"APL seems like a great place to work and start a career if you are fresh out of college and are interested in research, or if you are a fresh PhD in a relevant field (engineering) to pursue your own research through internal and external grants.","You are going to have a bad time if you are hired as a PhD or in mid career, with no particular project in mind. This is especially true in AOS. As a mid level, you are expected to lead on projects that can have no relevance to your background. Hiring strategy is awful and management has no idea what they are doing except fill headcount. This all has an impact on work/life balance, which APL has a reputation for but is slowly damaging."

I enjoyed the university-like feel with many clubs and employee groups, plus the maker space is amazing if you're into 3D printing, etc.

This is a great place to start a career. There's lots of opportunities to learn, lots of technical brown bags and training funds.

I feel that APL does make an effort towards diversity and inclusion. At least there are active organizations you can join, like Allies in the Workplace, African American Culture Club, Women in Technology, etc.

Work-life balance is pretty good and hours are flexible-ish. There's not huge pressure to work past your 80 hours per two weeks in my experience.","It's extremely difficult to get promoted from associate to senior unless you have a very proactive manager who's working to get you promoted. Unless you are fresh out of school, I would not recommend APL unless you get hired as senior staff.

Get ready to feel like you have to job search just to keep your job. Because of the nature of contract work, things are feast or famine. Scramble to find enough work to cover your timecard, or have more projects than any one person can reasonably handle. I have had colleagues have to take unpaid time off because there was simply no work for them. At least at consulting firms your time on the bench is paid!

Pay is so-so, probably typical for government contract type work. You can definitely get paid more in private industry especially for certain engineering fields.

As far as D&I, there is a lot of work to be done still, as women and people of color are still underrepresented especially the higher up you go. 

Finally, the fact that AOS insisted on bringing associate staff back to campus, despite the Delta surge, regardless of performance while WFH or family situation, was the final nail in the coffin to show where this organization's priorities are. Why on earth would I want to drive to another building so I can sit in front of a computer for 8 hours while wearing a mask when I can work from home instead?"

Sadly the leadership at APL if mandating vaccination and associated reporting. They have also slowly bought into the wokeness culture. It is truly sad to see a once great organization allow such a quick degradation of their culture and work environment.

Lots of projects to work on.,"They couldn’t be more unclear about salaries. You can get promoted, but you won’t get a raise. Basically just giving you more responsibility with no raise. They also hire people based upon personality and not qualification. What does that mean? That you will work with people who have zero technical background in their field. Expect things to move slow."

In my role within the AOS sector, the contracts we were working were updating every 6 months to 1 year. In addition, I can work on several projects simultaneously.

Putting all this together, I am NEVER bored with what I am doing, and I am always learning.

I also find that with my group comprised mostly of seasoned PhDs, the tasks are targeted toward providing the highest impact possible, leaving the government sponsors with new avenues of R&D.

Lastly, I very much appreciate that management really tries to keep me working exactly 80 hours / 2 weeks through the use of comp time.",The splitting of time across projects and continual changing of projects does have negative effects. The pace of work at APL is slow. Projects tend to drag on a month or two past their deadlines or the money spent on a project is larger than initially budgeted.

Highly dynamic, lots of super interesting projects going on across the lab, with the majority of them being interdisciplinary. So many (8000+) interesting people as well, not to mention awesome maker spaces (and a new building just completed for the R&D group). Access to so many resources, travel the country, highly competitive base pay with great benefits and absolutely insane retirement match (10.5% of base salary after only one year of service!), they'll pay for your bachelors, masters AND PhD with a long list of schools and programs to choose from, they have clubs, activities, etc. etc. The lab director has huge approval. People unanimously love APL and it really shows. There have been many times I've been working on something with a few other people and the conversation turns to ""all of the reasons we love APL."" It's truly an honor to work here.",Parking can be tough. It's practically a meme over here (although there is construction for expanding it as I write this).

Most coworkers are very book smart (I often felt like the dumbest person in every room, which is an amazing growth opportunity), although some people who can’t pull their weight have long tenure
Lots of teams have industry experts who have decades of experience doing the same thing and they’re very good people to learn from 
Pay is okay for a local company, but no where near highest paying for software developers","Poor career growth opportunities from management. I had to switch teams to actually grow into a bigger project otherwise I would have been stuck maintaining an abandoned legacy code base forever.
Management is much better at being hands off for senior staff than helping new grads establish themselves. My managers were never direct with me and it was really annoying, but I wasn’t experienced enough at the time to call them out on it and directly pry for developmental feedback.
I remember being in new employee orientation three years after I joined (because there was never enough capacity), listening to Ralph Semmel tell us that salaries aren’t going up in the industry so they can’t offer raises. This was the same week I received an offer for 3X my APL salary to work in a tech hub. The point is not about money, it’s that management butters employees up and tells them they’re the greatest thing on earth when in reality there’s an entire class of higher performing workers who would never consider working there because it pays peanuts. It’s disingenuous, and part of the reason why the ratings for APL are so high on Glassdoor because everyone is drinking the koolaid."

Additionally there is an emphasis on leadership development and innovation that makes working here fun. They are also very flexible on your work hours and were very supportive through the pandemic transition. They know that the staff make APL the place that it is.,"To get involved can take a good bit of extra time. It isn't your basic 9-5. All work hours are tracked for billing purposes, so when you don't have a budget to do something it either doesn't get done or floats into personal time. They emphasize innovation, but they don't provide a budget for it, so expect to spend more than 40 hours on stuff related to work a week."

There are a few key centers of excellence (Intelligent Systems Center, Space, etc.) that are worth working for if you can get in.","No hiring strategy; lots of bad apples get hired and wreak havoc on top projects.

Certain people at the Branch and Group leadership level have too much power and will attempt to take control of projects from technical staff. These senior managers often push their own pet projects rather than the technology and practices the rest of the world uses.

While work-life balance is generally good, it can be difficult to focus at work as you may find yourself working on a half-dozen unrelated projects at once, each with its own team and project manager. This becomes unbearable if the project or program managers like to micromanage, which they often do.

The skills you develop at APL are not always transferrable to industry. It can be difficult to find a new job as APL's name and history suggest you're working as a professor or low-level researcher. At conferences you can't network with anyone as your entire conversation turns into explaining what APL is."

-Decent PTO. As of Dec 2020, I believe technical staff new hires receive 7 days of sick, 15 days of vacation, 9 paid holidays, and 1 personal day annually
-Good people, professionally but also just as humans
-Good mix of senior and younger staff
-Lab-level leadership seems to genuinely care about the well being of staff and supports efforts to promote a healthy and welcoming culture at APL
-Good chance you can work remotely part or full time
-Physical location of the lab means no city driving and is close enough to Columbia/Fulton if you want nearby activities
-Social events at the lab, sector, all the way down to the group and sometimes program level
-Opportunities for further professional development (technical and soft skills)...training, conferences,  classes","-Salary determination is at the group supervisor level and the mentality towards raises is inconsistent across the lab. You'll get paid more in some groups versus others.
- Salary slope stagnates after several years. They increase the start pay for new hires without increasing the raise percentages for existing staff.
-Probably due to the academic affiliation, APL cares too much about GPA and postgraduate education
-Parking on main campus can be rough

There may be an area of interest that is typically done by the time you join a team.  You can build that from the ground up here.  Changing roles isn't a bid deal either.  You get as much opportunity as you want.  You can do independent research and get internal funding.  Education assistance 18 credits a year (dollar doesn't matter).  Looks amazing on a resume.  Other companies will offer you jobs you never worked before at high pay just because you worked at apl.  It is tough to find smart talent and everyone at apl is smart.  No deadweight like most companies have.,"The it department is the worst I have ever seen.  Don't use linux as your operating system or they will tell you they don't support linux (although it's on their site that they do).  

It is nearly impossible to get promoted to senior level.  You have to be a tech lead, bring in your own grants or get a PhD.  In order to become a tech lead you have to be on a project for a few years but our group has short term projects so how do you get promoted?  You pretty much have to invent something or apply for internal grants and get them consistently.  Basically things you would make much more money from running your own business.  Good for entry level or senior people but horrible for people in the middle of their careers.  Get your experience and leave.  Not a long term job for the middle of your career.

Work-life balance advertised as a benefit, but more managers pressure you to do (unpaid) overtime and weekend work. Health plan is sub-par compared to industry (even though it's associated with one of the premier hospitals in the world). Poor employee support in HR and EEO.

4. Stable job without the ups and downs of private industry (long-term government contracts make up the vast majority of the portfolio at the lab). 
5. If you do great work, you will have lots of opportunities to expand your impact.
6. Great work-life balance!","1. The majority of the work is government contracted, which means there can be politics that get in the way of engineering and science. The management tries its best to minimize those impacts on the technical staff, but the effects can still propagate. 
2. The lab has been growing very rapidly, which can lead to unintended consequences in culture. 
3. Parking and office space! The lab has grown too quickly and the facilities aren't large enough to accommodate. If you make it in after 0900, you might have to walk 15 minutes (or more!) from your car to the office. Be prepared to share an office with 2 other (even fun) individuals."

- work life balance (flexible work weeks, ~40 hr wks for some)
- retirement plan (matches ~10%)
- Interesting work
   - Diversity of work (missiles, to space, to medicine, to cyber .... all forms of engineering and sciences)
   - Cutting edge work (tons of research is performed)
   - Meaningful work most of this work is being done as either a check on industry or as a leader in a technical space to help guide the gov
- Job security: Business is good: hiring & been hiring responsibly for some time now and the company is more likely to try and help an individual improve than fire them
- Emphasizes & supports learning: many classes held on campus & provides 100% tuition coverage for Masters & PhD work
- The People: all seem really nice, you will see more people smiling than not on any given day
- Location is great: This will vary, but generally I think the MD climate is mild enough for most, the school system & general neighborhoods near APL are high-end (affordable for an APL employee, generally speaking) and safe
- Many other neat/nice things here (small bike ride share program on campus, free & open maker space on campus, several cafeterias on campus, etc)","Things APL could do better:
- Lack minor & random perks found at many engineering firms:
   - no free food or coffee
   - basic offices & equipment quality varies greatly: might have a very modern or very old setup
- Some work is not very practical or applied. You likely won't change the world here, but your work might get used by someone who does (elsewhere), etc. 
- There are many areas of expertise, but since this company is not one cohesive entity, you will find varying groups of expertise, roles, and work in general
  - Practical example: most groups these days have some form of software work, but there are very few true software development groups & expertise within the lab
- Too many people: Parking & office space is getting a bit crunched (but they are building several new buildings & expanding at a very fast rate)
- Compensation: it's lower than private companies doing equally interesting work (e.g. Google, Uber, maybe even a defense contractor like LM - tho your work may be less interesting and there are other negatives that come with those companies)"

Management cares about retaining staff members.","Matrix organization, meaning there are two separate organizational hierarchies, technical and programmatic. It can be confusing to navigate as a staff member, and it also makes the institution slow to respond to changes.

324,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Great environment for a non-traditional career path in science,2018-11-12,4.0,Principal Professional Staff,"Although there are only several dozen scientists among the >6000 employees, JHU/APL provides a great environment for those looking to have a non-traditional career path.  The project contributions made by scientists are very applied - often transitioned to end users in the field for immediate operational deployment.  While staff in each department/sector may have different experiences, most of my interactions with multi-disciplinary teams have been very positive.  Good opportunities for career growth exist, but require some individual effort and creative approaches.  Overall, JHU/APL offers a rewarding scientific career for those more interested in meaningful contributions than ""fame and fortune.""","Because JHU/APL is a government contractor (technically, a University-Affiliated Research Center - UARC), staff are bound by rules such as timekeeping and public release.  In our trusted role, supporting various government organizations, staff are required to maintain an unbiased approach and adhere to non-disclosure agreements.  Contrary to the traditional scientist approach, publications and conference presentations are not the driving force for career development.  Much of the most exciting work is not releasable to the public.  Hence, those looking for a spotlight on the national stage or the entrepreneurship excitement of starting their own business will not find a good fit at APL.  Similarly, it is not recommended for early career scientists looking for a traditional career path because of the publication limitations."

326,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Good for retirement-transition but risky for early career,2018-10-25,3.0,Professional Staff,"APL offers excellent benefit and flexibility in work/life balance.  It allows for parttime work (if you work for more than 50% you get medical and other benefits), and provides for unpaid leaves (even for traveling around the world).   As a part of the Johns Hopkins University, staffs have access to the JHU library with its collections and online resources.

For technical staff, APL is a low-pressure workplace with a rather flat compensation structure.  It maintains a collegial work environment.  Harsh criticisms are very rare, at least among the rank-and-file staff members.  

At APL, there is no pressure to ""climb the ladder.""  It is perfectly OK to work there for 20, 30 years without any promotion.  It is also quite common for low-level managers to step down and go back to technical work.  There is no ""cut-throat"" politics for most of the staffs.

APL pays much attention to diversity (now termed as inclusion).  Although it is still a white-dominating community, minority and women staffs get extra help in recruiting and career advancement.  The management is very sensitive to any issue related to discrimination, sexual harassment, or hostile work environment.  In addition to the line management and EEO, APL provides an ombudsman service that can guide employees to navigate the system and process.","The accountability is low both at the institution and individual levels.   Since APL mostly (with important exceptions in SES and AMDS) produces paper reports that with varying levels of impacts, it is usually not ""right"" or ""wrong"", often not even ""good"" or ""not good"".  For an entry-level staff, it is easy to get complacent and consider himself the ""expert"", without comparing his work with any competitions.  The shock comes when he needs to find a job in the ""real world.""

APL pays lip service in innovation and staying at the cutting edge of technological advancement.  However, the training investment is pitiful, less than Amazon's warehouse workers on a per-person basis.  APL does offer on-site Masters programs, free for the employers.  They are starting on-site Ph.D. programs, as well.  These programs are great for undergraduate new hires.  However, going to conferences, writing journal papers or keeping up with the literature require a lot of initiative and personal investment (i.e., doing things on your own time).  Currently, only a small portion of the staffs engage in such activities.  

Management proclamations notwithstanding, carrier development support at APL is challenging.  Since there is no real objective measurement of one's ability and productivity and the management has no accountability when they make the wrong promotion, carrier advancement at APL has more to do with personal relationship than with technical excellence.   If you are not recognized as a ""rising star"" by your manager, you can be stuck with what you are doing today for the next five or ten years, even if you do a great job and all project leads like you.   Theoretically, all managerial positions are open to anyone who applies, and all applicants go through the interview process.  However, more and more positions are given to those who are enrolled in the ""leadership rotation"" program, where members are assigned to a leadership position for 6 months without formal competition.  Such experience gives them a great advantage when they compete for the permanent appointments.  However, the rotation program is by nomination from your manager only, instead of open competition.  If you are not the lucky ones slated for the ""fast lane"", you won't get much help in terms of mentoring, guidance, and championing from anyone to advance your carrier."

330,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Hidden Gem,2018-10-02,5.0,Systems Administrator,APL is a wonderful place to work. They care about their employees and emphasize a work-life balance that isn't just lip service. The benefits are some of the best I have heard of and there is a lot of opportunity for growth if you work hard and make a good name for yourself.,"Timesheets are a pain and you have to constantly dole out in small increments what you are doing. There is a lot of overhead here here I feel like you're spending one hour of each day to recap the other seven between timesheets, budget codes, and entering tasks."
331,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,I Think I'm a Lifer,2018-09-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"I don't think I can ever leave the Lab; I can't imagine another place that I could work that would be better in any way compared to APL. There are so many opportunities for growth at the Lab and with the technical work, I am constantly challenged with hard problems. Because the Lab is so large, there is a lot of movement internally; so let's say you feel like your management was stagnant and there wasn't any upwards growth, you can apply to another position in another area of the Lab and get new opportunities. I've met several people at the Lab who decided to leave because of wanting higher salaries, but were gone for less than a year and wanted to come back, I know several parents that work at the lab, and the work life balance is unparalleled. AND THE BENEFITS. I didn't realize how amazing they were until I was telling my girlfriend about them and she compared my benefits to all 10+ benefit packages other places she's worked had. As an out lesbian, the fact that I can be out and not have it affect my work relationships is something I never expected or dreamed of. There is an LGBTQ+ group at the Lab who gets money to host many events during Pride month, which are all very inclusive. The director of the Lab even comes and supports the Pride events, during and outside of work hours! Besides events, there are other things the Lab does that makes it a place that everyone feels comfortable working at, including non-binary and transgender staff; for example there is a policy to gender neutral bathrooms in all renovations and new buildings on campus. As a default, the technical work is very interesting and it has direct impact on our national defense and aiding our allies. Overall APL is an incredible place to work and I am so lucky to have found my dream job.","The only con is that we need to fill out a timecard for the time we spend working on different budgets. This makes it difficult to want to do activities that are work-related and important, but do not have a budget. I understand that this is necessary because APL is a government contractor."
332,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Great place to make a career!,2018-09-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Extremely innovative/exciting work across many different areas (defense, space, healthcare, robotics and autonomy, AI, materials science, etc.) that has a positive impact on the world.
- APL is a research center, so the majority of the work you'll be doing hasn't been done before. You will be challenged to think critically, which will help you grow both personally and professionally.
- Incredibly smart and passionate people allow for a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive environment.
- You are encouraged to work on the things you want to work on, and your supervisor would be happy to work with you in finding tasking that is a better match for your interests if you're unhappy in your current role.
- Many opportunities to earn internal funding if you have an innovative/relevant project you want to work on.
- Continuous learning is highly encouraged and supported. You can earn a graduate degree (in a field relevant to your role) at no cost to you. There are also many training and development (both technical and non-technical) courses regularly offered at the lab.
- Flexible work schedules.
- Great benefits, including the best retirement plan company match I've seen.
- Many clubs/organizations to become a part of as well as organized social events throughout the year.

As an administrative professional I’m used to working with very high level managers. Everyone is very friendly, and it doesn’t matter what level you are. There’s also a very inclusive culture. This is the best company that I’ve worked for because the people here are just amazing! 

Flexibility: There’s no micro management here, and this was really new for me. They ask you when you start what hours you would like to work, and some people even choose to work late because they like to sleep in. I also work from home one day a week. It’s up to you to decide your schedule.

Benefits: Retirement is 2 for 1 matching! I’ve never seen that before. Also APL will put in free money into your retirement as well without you adding anything in there yourself. There’s also a bunch of additional things such as free education, 3 weeks vacation + 7 paid sick days + 1 paid personal day + paid holidays (includes day after thanksgiving as well)

Facility: Ok APL is huge. I’ve been here awhile and I still get lost. But that’s just me. Main “campus” is all connected, and there’s also additional buildings. They are building 2 more buildings and buying some more. APL keeps getting bigger. There’s 3 full service gyms, about 5 cafeterias, and then some.","I’ve been trying to think of some negatives, and to be honest it’s hard for me to think of any.

My first 2-3 years, principal staff members with 30+ years of experience took me under their wing and got me into programs that are now the foundation of my career.   

The lab has a lot of social events through which you can meet your coworkers and forge such bonds which will pay off long term, and an extensive self-reporting program through which you can toot your own horn.  Those who don't take advantage of these really huge opportunities are short-changing themselves.

The years in which my performance was 'average' by my own estimate, I was seeing a 4.5% raise.  APL rewards loyalty, and that is not common.  

Work from home is streamlined, easy, and not subject to extensive red tape.  When hardware is replaced, you can retain the old for travel/work from home purposes, dramatically improving productivity when you absolutely cannot be at the lab.  

Program management is very supportive of 'science project' type creative work that has potential to add value to the lab.  Operated both through formal grant programs that are well-advertised and informal support of program managers open to new analysis tool ideas for active programs.","Red tape rules for program management review of documents that require external distribution can result in good work staying inside the lab longer than it should, which can delay impact/notice.

359,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Allows you multiple ways to shape your own career under fantastic mentorship.,2018-07-01,5.0,Associate Member of Technical Staff,"APL allows and highly encourages you to adopt a large amount of autonomy. As long as you maintain good communication with your technical leads and supervisors, you can take initiative on almost anything that you think needs to be addressed on your project, without having to go through any tedious or bureaucratic justification process that is present in some other organizations. 

Management is receptive and responsive to staff who desire to shift their career in a different direction. Staff who feel unfulfilled or underutilized on their current project can typically find a new project to spend their time on in less than 6 months. Each staff member’s time is typically split amongst multiple projects to minimize the risk of any bumps or issues in a single project. Staff ask have a good amount say in how their time is divided amongst these projects.

APL also fosters a culture of continuing education and mentorship through several formal and informal programs. The lab will fund staff’s endeavors to take new classes and learn new skills, and has several programs in place to promote informal skill sharing between staff. Formal mentoring programs exist for mentees of all skill and experience levels, and management strongly encourages technical leads to act as mentors for the people working under them.

There is also significantly less focus on finger-pointing than some other peer organizations. When something goes wrong, the scrutiny is placed on the process, not solely the people involved. Newcomers and early career staff are given plenty of resources and people to reach out to as they continue to establish their skills, so that they feel confident in their efforts.","The onboarding process leaves something to be desired. They do a good job of giving you a broad overview of the lab and informing you about security and compliance issues, but don’t provide much detail about how the sectors and groups of the lab are broken down or the specific goals the lab is pursuing to achieve its vision (although both of these are explained more in periodic all-hands meetings). 

The lab also highly encourages people to pursue IRADs (Internal research and development) and other grants, but does not set aside much of the budget needed for people to collaborate and write proposals. The way grants are organized and managed can be confusing for newcomers at the lab."

This can make working on things your interested in complicated or impossible. (This culture dependency really depends which part of the lab you work in, not all parts are like this). 

Also, sometimes projects can be slow and working with other engineers can be hard to do.

This is a great place to work as a young engineer, but not as good for later careers.","You sign away the rights to every creative thought you have on or off of the job.  If you create the next generation George Forman Grill while on your own time, APL will own the rights to the invention.  APL restrictions on conflict of interest are very rigid.

My lead traded 3 years of my work on NASA's Europa CLIPPER mission away to get her friend a coveted job. She told me she would do anything to get friend the job she wanted even though the prime contractor said it was impossible. Next thing I know she gets the impossible job and my work is cut off from the project by the prime. It's clear my lead struck a deal to get her friend the impossible job. After that she made every effort to make my work difficult and unpleasant. When I took it to management they just kept saying we can't prove it so there is nothing we can do. They really didn't want to ask even a few simple questions. After that I just couldn't trust them and engage in more work that could be traded away.

It often seems like you have to be a part of some sort of ""white man's"" fraternity to become a part of management.  The pay is below average for the area, especially for the more experienced positions. Management seems disconnected from the general staff and to be to rearward looking. ""Lab policies"" at best are vague and at worst don't exist for things from overtime to dress code to supervisor approved absence which results in varied implementation across departments, branches and groups.

Over time the work has improved, declined and improved again as you'd expect for a UARC. There are opportunities for staff with any technical discipline to work on projects of their choosing, conduct leading edge research and gain proficiency in their field. 

The current Director seems to understand how to approach the 21st century for both work and staff engagement. He has created multiple incentive and innovative programs to engage staff - they are very well received. 

Overall, the work is solid, the pay is good (not great) and opportunities are plentiful.",The organization has tripled in size while i've worked here. I'm sure there is some management rulebook that defines how many managers are required for certain activities and numbers of staff and that mentality has been embraced here. We have multiple managers for nearly everything. There are managers managing groups of managers who manage...paperwork. The somewhat expected but annoying piece of management is many of them are not technically competent and provide limited utility to the projects they oversee.

The work is challenging and rewarding. There are not many places where you get to work on some of the most complex and challenging problems facing the nation. Compensation and benefits are some of the best in the industry (with some minor exceptions).,"Diversity: while there are some efforts to improve diversity throughout the institution, it is still low compared to other institutions. Achieving Work/Life balance is difficult, especially for parents of young children. Parental leave is currently limited to expecting mothers."
431,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Great Place to Work and Retire,2017-01-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work life balance is impressive compared to other companies. I regularly had to work 10+ hours, weekends, holidays, and called on vacation to solve issues in other companies. Where I work now at JHUAPL it is policy to not do this unless your in IT. If your in IT you have some extra hours but only if there are issues or your on-call. They do however reward those who work extra hours to get things accomplished or work on potential solutions. I look at working here in a way like Google with the freedom and ability to come up with innovative solutions. 

Benefits are past amazing and retirement contribution is far greater than anywhere else. Our family uses all the benefits we can and it is far cheaper than other companies when considering what you get in return. We couldn't believe what we could get with the little we pay. If you contribute 4% towards retirement they double and add a % based on your salary. This can be a lot if you spend most of your career here.

The freedom we have is incredible. They highly reward positive work ethics, hardworking people, and those that want to contribute. I have the freedom to provide recommendations and disagree with management which is not something most companies tolerate. You obviously need to do it professionally and respectfully.

There is ample opportunity for advancement. You also have the ability to stay where you are. Management where I am has a desire to ensure people are happy and work towards ensuring this is the case. Management even steers away from anything that results in weekend work as much as they can and even tells others in management their teams can't do something if it results in weekend or holiday work. This could be different elsewhere in the organization. It just depends on where you are and what you do.

If you have a good work ethic, professional in what you say to others and management, and offer suggestions or recommendations for improvement you will do well here. While no company or organization is perfect this is the best place to work and retire comfortably. I plan on staying until I retire and I am young.",There can be lots of down time but it is what you make of it. You have to have the vision to make your own work that is in line with the direction of the organization. Not a complete con but can be if you don't have the capability or desire of making your own work and prefer companies to tell you what to do then it is a con.

There is a significant population of aging staff whose experience is valuable but whose presence also stands in the way of progress and promotion at times.
485,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"as an employer, APL is a tough act to beat",2016-02-15,4.0,Principal Professional Staff,"The best way to describe APL is like what Winston Churchill said of democracy -- it's the worst possible system, except for all of the alternatives. Although it is not without its negatives, it's very hard to beat APL as an employer, particularly in comparison to for-profit defense contractors:
- The retirement plan is exceptional. Also, the difference in rules between a 401K (most companies) and a 403B (nonprofits, like APL) mean that most APL employees can put more pretax money into their retirement accounts.
- APL offers both leave and sick leave. People who complain about the amount of leave that APL offers have clearly not surveyed the alternatives -- most contractors offer just PTO (equivalent to APL's starting annual leave of 3 weeks) and expect employees to use it for both vacation and sick leave.
- The chance to do meaningful, and sometimes even exciting and different work. Projects change all the time, and if you don't like what you are doing, there are lots of opportunities to try to find something else within the organization. Sometimes I can't believe how lucky I am that I get paid to do this stuff. 
- APL recently did away with formal performance reviews. This is both a pro and a con. On the pro side, it saves an enormous amount of mostly pointless paperwork, and line managers are encouraged to spend that time coaching and mentoring their staff. On the con side, how well this mentoring is actually working probably varies around the lab. Also, now that there is no formal method of rating people, raises are highly subject to internal politics (more on that below).
- Although there has been a recent push to ""keep APL salaries competitive"" (meaning to our customers), and they are no longer really great, they are still pretty good. My advice to a new hire, particularly someone who is mid-career or senior, would be to get as much money as you can up front, because it's hard to stand out enough to get catch-up raises later on. This is probably true everywhere, though.
- Work life balance is generally very good. Very few people work insane hours, and those who do have generally chosen that path. It's true that some people can't work at home because all their work is classified, but if your tasking permits it, the lab is very open to flex time and partial work-at-home arrangements.","- The complaints about ""too much management"" probably stem from APL's matrix management organization. This means that just about every individual contributor has an immediate supervisor (a section supervisor), and a hierarchy above that (group, branch, and department/sector), as well (probably) multiple task, project, and program managers. I used to joke that virtually everyone I worked with was my boss. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can be confusing until you get used to it. 
- Virtually everyone at the lab is first and foremost a technical subject matter expert, so management is a mixed bag. Some managers rise through the ranks based only on their  technical skills. Some are hired from government or outside organizations based mainly on their political connections. As a result of both practices, APL has its share of truly wretched leaders. On the other hand, there are also some exceptional and even inspirational leaders at the lab. Like a lot of things, you either get lucky or you don't.
- I have been at the lab long enough to see a distinct culture change that appears to be radiating downward from the front office. We used to be as close to a meritocracy as you could find, but lately, internal politics and whose ""friend"" you are are playing more and more of a role --  if you are in the ""in group"" you will be favored for the more interesting tasking and a fast-track career. If you are in the ""out group,"" you will be quietly bypassed for the interesting projects, and may struggle for coverage.  I don't know where this trend will eventually take us, but it has reached the point where it obvious enough to be causing some angst among the rank and file. 
- It is not true, as some have said, that APL never lays anyone off. We do...we just don't make a big deal of it when it happens. Although APL management is probably doing the best job they can to maintain ""big picture"" continuity throughout the ups and downs of the crazy DoD budget cycle, we are ultimately as subject to the whims of government spending as any other organization in this line of work. At the less-macro level, if your project goes away, depending on your skill set, you may or may not be able to find work somewhere else in the organization, and (unless your immediate line manager is particularly on the ball) there is little that the lab can or will do to help you. APL has a very ad hoc system for matching tasks to people, and there does not seem to be any interest from higher management in fixing it."

Also, all the people in management positions are usually people who were in highly technical roles in the past.  They don't hire managers for the sake of managers.  This can lead to some less-skilled management structure, but there's value in the fact that the managers are highly technical and usually were in physics/coding roles in the same project in the past.

Also, their benefits are also pretty good.  Their 401(k) program (actually it's a 403(b)) is killer.","My biggest two complaints are:

(1) Very stingy they with PTO, which is thoroughly non-negotiable and starts at only three weeks for everyone. 
(2) Like most organizations they suffer from the problem that annual career growth and salary is capped and thus primarily tethered to where you started in the organization.  I worked hard for years trying to advance from Associate 1 to Associate 2 and get my pay onto a higher track, even with numerous recognitions in my work, and countless above-average reviews.  Then they hired a co-worker with less experience than me, hired right into Associate 2 with a higher salary.

The moral of the story is that the best way to advance in APL (and probably most other similar organizations), is to leave and come back.  It allows you to reset your trajectory within the system, and get a nice bump in your salary that could not have happened within the system."

523,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,The experience has involve a lot of professional growth.,2015-06-25,4.0,Postdoctoral Fellow,"The organization is in a convenient place. Specially, easy commute for the residents of Howard County. In addition, APL is located 30 minutes from Baltimore and DC.",The current challenges as any organization that is a government contractor is the ability of secure funding. Securing funding is becoming tougher as the time progress.
524,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Executive,2015-06-24,2.0,Management,Creative and dynamic work environment on the leading edge of technology and focused on serving the needs of the country,"New Director of the Lab and his new team are focused on cost and extracting every ounce of flesh and energy from the team. People use to matter here and now we are lower than ""meat"".  Benefits are being cut, programs revamped and seniority has become a joke!"
525,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Better Than Expected!,2015-06-23,5.0,Senior Professional Staff I,"I've worked in industry for about 8 years, and was extremely impressed with the environment that has been created here at APL.  I have never worked at a place that cared so much about a person's happiness, and encouraged them to enrich themselves through education","Not much that I can think of, this is the first place that I can see myself staying at for a foreseeable future"
526,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Associate Professional Staff,2015-06-23,4.0,Associate Professional Staff I,"Great retirement funds, there are many organizations to become a member of that spread across a large variety of interests","There is not a lot of personal interaction, collaboration between teams can be low at times, not a great environment for younger workers."
527,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Great place to work!,2015-06-22,5.0,Senior Professional Staff I,APL is probably the best place I have ever worked. I get to work on a wide variety of projects. I get exposure to new technologies on pretty much every program I pick up. I love the work.,I don't love living in MD but that's where the lab is.
528,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Solid place to work,2015-06-10,4.0,Associate Professional Staff II,"The biggest benefit by far is tuition reimbursement for part-time graduate degrees.  Many courses in JHU's Engineering for Professionals program are taught on-site, and the paperwork is pretty seamless.  You can get reimbursed for degrees from other institutions as well.

It's generally a low-stress place to work with reasonable hours and interesting work.  It was nice to be treated as a trusted partner by government clients rather than a contractor.  The organizational foundation of APL is the group, and my group was very tight-knit, with many social events.

Bosses are friendly and are genuinely interested and concerned with employees' career growth.","The performance appraisal process is cumbersome, and they transitioned to a quota system that ends up being political rather than merit-based.  Advancement rates do not seem uniform across the different groups in the laboratory.

It's also a place where your career can stagnate. Opportunities to advance are somewhat limited (they operate on a model of employees staying around for 40 years), and if you become the expert on one particular type of problem, you could find yourself doing that same thing for years on end.

The matrix organization leads to a middle-heavy bureaucracy in which administrative overhead is high.  There are layers of program managers and other middle managers that tax projects without adding much value to the work.  It's also an extremely stovepiped organization--there is little inter-group or inter-department collaboration.

Less important issues are that on-site cafeterias are overpriced for the quality of the food, and they eliminated the on-site library (although you can request books from other JHU libraries).

Not necessarily a con, but the culture is pretty conservative, which you'd probably expect in a DoD-related business.  When I was there, people tended to work there forever and management was dominated by older white guys.  That may be changing, as there were some younger folks moving into group supervisor roles.  Still, it's interesting in that it is a high-technology organization that does not really embrace change."

Retirement is great, 200% matching for the first 4% of your contribution, plus an additional 2.5% regardless.  Virtually impossible to get fired or laid off.  Job stability is rock-solid.  Employees with 0-5 years of experience will find this place to be great.  Employees with 25+ years of experience with a government pension (retired Military customers) will find this place to be great.","Horrible salary and raises (2% average).  Salary is based on the premise that you won't leave after 5 years here because of the perks.  They will pay to attract new talent, but then flat line you around the 5 year mark.  If you are thinking of coming here, make them pay while you can!  Demand a top salary at the offer table, as it will be your last use of leverage.
Employees with 5-25 years of experience will find this place to be a dead-end.  Other reviewers suggested age discrimination, but I really think they are just robbing the older established employees instead of raising rates or cutting benefits in order to attract new talent and perpetuate a dying, unsustainable culture (think pyramid scheme).  This place will be forced to change as the baby boomers start dying off.  (Sadly a lot of 70 year-olds work here...)
Promotion or reclassification does not come with a salary increase, but earns you the privilege of working harder.  With a lot of work you may float to slightly higher pay over time if you are tapped to be a manager, but at that point you might as well work in industry  for far greater gain."

Good work environment with offices shared with one other person. Good facilities and location.,"Poor line management in my experience; they don't care about advancement opportunities. Performance management system is new for 2015, based on the modern concept of frequent coaching rather than assessment of performance. No obligation on supervisor to take system seriously; on past and present experience my supervisor will ignore it.

No systematic approach to career growth. To get a new position within APL one has to apply for a posted opening and interview. Appointment decision lies mainly with the group supervisor for non-management or section supervisor positions, so is prone to subjective decisions by the individual. To progress at APL one really needs to find an informal mentor.

No information about salary scales. It is impossible to assess how good one's annual raise is from internal information. I have tracked my salary relative to the government's GS pay scale and have barely maintained my starting position in 2002 despite excellent performance reviews."

They have exceptional benefits, the pay is good, and the culture is very conducive to people with a STEM background.  Both my group and section supervisors have created a very friendly work-group where people can interact and learn from each other.  There is very little ""tribal knowledge"" and older engineers are very helpful to younger engineers wanting to learn.  I have never worked at a better place than the APL and will probably never find a better place in the future!","The APL is located in Maryland.  Maryland sucks.  There is nothing but crime-filled, dirty cities and dense forest.  If you like city life you won't like Baltimore, if you like country life you won't like western Maryland.  If you like hiking you won't like the Appalachian Trail, if you like mountains you won't like any of the ""bumps"" that Marylanders call mountains.  If you like cycling you will die, if you like going for relaxing drives you will be tailgated by some psychopath and if you like driving fast you will be cut off by some bumbling tourist who has no idea where they are going.  Skiing is out of the question, boating is also out (unless you love filthy Chesapeake Bay water).  I you don't have a spirit of adventure and just like throwing back beers with your buds while watching the big game, Maryland might be the place for you!

You can work on multiple projects, sometimes you have input on where you are placed(your work isn't necessarily limited to your group or department).

In my department there are not very many competent Software Engineers and many groups treat you more like a code monkey(making you build something for the ""real engineers"" to go ahead and use). APL, at least departments outside of AOD/Space, does not produce products but instead delivers ""design and analysis"". This means a lot of things are very screwed up and inefficient about their software development processes. You wont grow here as a Software Engineer if you are in the FPD/AMDD departments. Matlab is used to write full blown applications over years of development with GUIs and all, do you really want to be a part of that? That should make you cringe(if it doesn't, apply now!).


I've met talented individuals, but they were recent hires. My experience with most ""lifers"" has been disappointing. 


There are too many internal political fights between groups within the same departments over fear of having work stolen, this translates into headaches for people in the trenches just trying to do their job as well as possible. 


Unfortunately, nothing I do is cutting edge or even really all that challenging so the work is very unfulfilling.

Stack ranking favors giving raises to people who have more ""visible"" or ""glamorous"" tasking.
Some projects are horribly mismanaged, weeks of virtually no progress aren't uncommon for the worst of them.
Poor software practices across the board with many people writing software who are effectively taught as they go(Mechanical/Aerospace engineers) causes tons of headaches and slow progress.

Little fiefdoms protected fiercely from outsiders.
High expectations from middle managers with no consistent knowledge of the customer. The customer's needs were considered secondary to securing the next round of funding or securing a foothold in their spaces. I was told repeatedly not to be so forthright with my NASA counterpart; my job was to sell our technical position and our people to do a job, not to teach others the how-to or know-how.  I have some real heartburn with that, and I am glad I have moved on. Project Managers here are considered the necessary evil as bookkeepers to schedule and budget, but not respected for their technical input. That's a shame and a waste of good technical hands-on experience. The Space Department has a wonderful new building that they could not afford even before we moved in.  Feels like a mausoleum. Especially since the projects keep dying off in the current budget fiasco and good people are told to find work outside of the department or be shown the door."

Work is highly specialized at the associate level and you don't often find yourself bogged down with paperwork.  Much more powerpoint than word processing, so presenting your indepth analysis is not a soul-destroying essay.

Technical employees are encouraged, but not forced, to take on leadership and management roles.  Recently, APL has pushed for more innovation by providing actual funding for ideas and building a ""maker space"" lab to help build more of an innovation-oriented community.  Job stability is very  high.","As with any large company, you have to put up with irritating policies: for example, buying software, even the smallest productivity-enhancing tool, takes way more effort and time than you'd expect (government regulations, apparently?).

Disrespected by lab divisions as not a direct bill on a contract and TOO much micro-management by this department and Group Supervisor. If possible,  avoid these business areas.  For leave, just have a combined personal and sick leave PTO allotment, so sick leave is not abused.  

Even though APL is a prime contractor, large % of work is subcontracted out to large DOD Contractors, or government pass thru projects, leaving APL in an administrator role not the true designers."

This is a fairly easy-going place with great facilities. If you don't want to work hard, this is the place to be. It's very hard to get fired. This is where you want to be for your glide path to retirement.","The lab has positioned itself to be a ""systems engineer"" for DoD, which is tantamount to being the government's agent for approving contractor work well after the contractor does all the real engineering and decision making. The lab covers the butts of government bureaucrats who are even less qualified to make technical and acquisition decisions. Thus, the lab's work is not very impactful, involves a lot of Powerpoint, and is far removed from real engineering.

If you want to be a real engineer and develop technical expertise at building something, look elsewhere."

You have to work here for at least 10-15 years for your salary to match the rest of industry (if you're lucky).  The company is very flat, so whether you're a hard worker, or a complete non-contributor, the pay raises will be pretty much the same.  This place is a breeding ground for lazy old engineers because there's really no incentive to do work (it's very difficult to get fired).  The most value here is found in the first 5 years working here when you're provided a free master's degree from JHU if you so choose.  After that industry will offer a salary far beyond that which the lab is willing to pay.

Although the lab used to be a unique place that had unique solutions to problems, I don't believe that's really the case anymore.  Much of what the lab does is several years behind industry and at a much higher cost to the sponsor."

Internal research and development funds are scarce, the competition is stiff, and when you do get something funded, the amount of funding is relatively small. Compared to sister organizations, APL spends relatively little on internal research and development -- I have heard around 3%.

Management frequently expects a prototype or result in a number of months that they can sell to a sponsor. If the research problem you are working on takes more than six months to solve, you will encounter resistance from management even if it is central to the problems that you are supposed to be solving.

Build a prototype widget that a government customer will buy, and you are golden."

637,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,This is where the really important stuff happens.,2011-11-11,5.0,Senior Professional Staff II,"Lots of critically important, truly meaningful work happens here.  We build spacecraft bound for Mercury and Pluto.  We build gadgets that are taken to war zones as soon as we finish a prototype, with troops clamoring for more as fast as we can make them.  We invented satellite navigation.  And, of course, the coolest and most important stuff can't be described on an open web site.

Very good job security; the defense budget may go up and down, but classified work can never be moved overseas.

Excellent blend of the intellectual stimulation of academia with the immediate, real-world impact of a high-tech defense contractor.

True geniuses work here by the dozens.

In a few departments (though not all), you have shocking freedom to work on whatever you find interesting and can get funding for.  It's almost like being a freelancer, but with much better benefits.

Free Master's degrees!  Collect the whole set!  And the classrooms are just steps from your office.

Overall quality of life is very good.  There are lots of clubs and intramural sports.  It's super easy to switch from full-time to part-time and back again.  The facilities are fairly new, with two cafeterias, a gym, tennis and basketball courts, softball fields, and a fishing pond.  It's near cosmopolitan DC and Baltimore, but still out in the sparse suburbs where trees are plentiful, housing lots are big, and schools are good.","The good projects are not evenly spread.  There is really important work going on,  but not everyone is on such a project.  Some departments have a large burden of routine, crank-turning work that is frankly not worthy of this organization.

Talented junior people will not rocket to the top, especially not without a Master's degree or PhD.  It is possible for recent grads with a BS to advance, but it takes a lot longer than at, say, an internet startup.  We lose too many good associates because they get impatient with the pace of advancement.  The situation is better for those in mid-career with advanced degrees.

APL has historically been very technically driven, heavy on engineering and light on management, but this has been changing recently.  It is still possible to have a decades-long career as a pure techie with steady advancement and plenty of recognition and respect, but it isn't as commonplace as it used to be.  We need to halt the slide.

In the departments where you have freedom to work on what you want, you have a corresponding responsibility to find the money for it.  If you can find a sugar daddy, this is an awesome situation.  If you can't, it can be supremely stressful to come to work each day not knowing where your coverage is going to come from."
