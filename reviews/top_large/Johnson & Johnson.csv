412,Johnson & Johnson,J&J Fails at Being Competitive Employer in Bay Area & Robotic Med Devices,2022-01-31,2.0,Project Manager,"- Work life balance is pretty great. PTO, Family Time, and Holidays add up to around 32 days off per year. Also Summer Fridays (9/80 schedule between Memorial Day and Labor Day) is a nice option.

- The technical engineering staff working at the Santa Clara site are top tier. I've never worried about the individual contributors on my teams not delivering on their work promises.

- The Robotic platform being worked on at the Santa Clara site is unique enough, and despite it's current challenges can be a viable product with market space available.","- When risks are being communicated as having been realized, management says we need to maintain the schedule and that the conversations should be taken offline. No subsequent conversations are had and schedule stays behind. Then teams get frustrated that other parts of the organization are falling behind.

- Favoritism within organization means that program priorities have been determined by who's the favorite, rather than by which organization is most at risk or on the critical path.

- Management keeps saying that site attrition is stable, despite extremely tenured engineering and management talent continually flocking away from the company for other local jobs.

- Johnson & Johnson has selected management for the Bay Area Robotics And Digital solutions (RAD) sites who are woefully uninterested in doing what it takes to attract and retain talent in the area.

- They offered a milestone based package for Bay Area employees which was impossible to attain, then told the teams it was our fault for not holding up to our end of the deal during. JnJ then turned around and said publicly that the delay is related to the pandemic and global chip shortage.

- I was part of the Verb Surgical acquisition, and the culture shift between the two organizations was tragic. Under Verb we leveraged our Google connections to replicate that culture (fast, collaborative, fun), under J&J we've slowed down and have regressed our culture to match the staleness of big Med Device.

- When J&J acquired Verb Surgical, they cancelled stock options of employees by stacking the Verb board with J&J executives. They have consistently proven they will always screw over the employees in pursuit of a few extra thousand dollars."

Work\Life balance is entirely rile and manager dependent. Some roles are great and allow flexibility, others not so much. Same goes for people leaders. Before the announcement of the consumer sector spin off, there was a lot of rotational opportunities.","Where to begin….senior leadership doesn’t have a clue. They are so out of touch with employees it’s frightening. Open seating (no set seat, open focus rooms) is the worst concept of all time. Taking important calls from the parking lot or cafeteria is a common occurrence because there is no open space to meet. Most buildings face overcrowding. The new “JNJ Flex” work policy where there are 2 work from home days, one that is assigned to you and Friday is a complete joke. It’s not flexible at all and frankly it was a last ditch effort to keep up with other companies that were offer more flexibility. Don’t buy the hype. They say all Manager and Senior Manager positions are “eligible” for equity compensation, but that’s a lie. There’s almost always none left after covering all the directors and their guaranteed comp. Don’t be fooled, it’s not going to happen so don’t bank on it, even if you get an Exceed on your performance review. Any senior leader in the company worth a darn has left in the past few months and the spin out of consumer products is a disaster. Frankly, if you are thinking of join, don’t buy into the hype of a wonderful culture. It definitely was several years ago, but it’s gone down hill quickly. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a strong company that’s generally well regarded but it’s not quite what it seems."

Compensation is good.
Kind of ""golden cage"".","I've worked over 10 years in IT starting as a site manager. During this time i've seen a lot sharp turns in direction, strategy, structure, etc.
A lot of them didn't make any sense.
But the high IT management don't listen to a reason, they have their own agenda. It looked like they were progressing and moving on but it's a different story with IT people on the ground who do all the actual work.
Most of the IT and applications people that i had locally and in other EU countries have gone.
1. This not how you manage talent.
2. We all see this and understand how much the organization care about employees.
So, if you're in science or sales & marketing - all is good (more or less) and you will see a lot of good action.
All the supporting departments (IT, finance, logistics) - forget about having life time career in J&J.
You will have 5 or 10 or 20 years run - and at age 45-50 you'll be spit out by the system because of another dumb turn it took."

Despite your job title, years of experience, or education, if you are a woman under the age of 35, you are automatically an executive assistant. It’s genuinely appalling to see leadership openly delegating responsibilities between women and men with the exact same title and the woman automatically is asked to take notes or order lunch every. single. time. The daily sexism is so pervasive that it’s just a normal part of life at JnJ. Senior leadership is a boys club that openly throws around inappropriate comments and won’t think twice about escorting female colleagues by placing a hand on the small of her back. It is even worse for LGBT+ employees who, despite all the corporate newsletters on diversity and inclusion, live in fear of being outed to leadership. Many folks who are out in their personal lives assume a heteronormative persona in the office under the strict, unspoken “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy of senior leaders for fear of being passed up for advancement. Attempting to take your concerns to HR will do nothing but put a target on your back. The senior leadership not only turns a blind eye, but actively rewards this toxic behavior in managers. It’s profoundly disappointing that an organization of this size with truly innovative tech cannot protect or retain its top talent due to business practices straight out of the 1950s."

salary netto is far to be attractive and fair compair to some other companie on the market,then it's even more miserable considering the financial level of this big and old international company who got way more profit since Covid,the pressure on results you will get and type of users you will have to handle also don't worth the money offered,
the benefits of 4000kc are extracted directly from your netto before been converted into benefit on a card...so its a big scam!
The internal co-workers that need your support are way worst than any others non educated end users:
impolite,rude,impatient,insisting heavily,stubborn,giving you no consideration or thanks most of the time,acting like they are the only one in the world,not listening or reading properly,acting like half Gods or spoil capricious child, arrogeante,ignorante,intellectually lazy,dishonest,lying,almost disable,too assisted,missing common sense,missing social intelligeance and basic knowledge of their internal tools,unfair,ungratefull,totally under dependancy of others people to do what they don't want or don't know, when actually most of the time they should as these things they are asking, are in their work scope,they will be complaining,negociating,acting angry,treating to report you to your manager and doing, if the proposed resolutions don't fit their expectations meaning to say when it involve any single or simple action, efforts from their side.
Basically they come to you with their issue and expect immediate easy solving while barely providing clear explanation or historic of it,your investigation question will annoy them,they will hang up or disconnect if you ask to much question, so you will have to guess and deal with it as it is while they show no interest or involvement on their side to help solve their own problem,this support is like a laundry place where they drop their dirty basket or clothes and expect you to clean it for them most are unable to provide decent communication clean of mistakes and mispelling on mail and chat in any language,on the chat they will treat you like a half bot half slave under staff...the worst is that people you deal with are suppose to be capable and clever from their level of diploma and their major position in the company but you will quicky find out that these overpaid Pharma people of the West are just hijacking their salary and totally rely on people like you to perform every single part of the job they are not able to do and generously paid for, while you are the one who get low money,no real benefits or advantages unlike these people,above all that management pressure for the targets which is actually only what seems to matter to them, all the credo ethic speech on the induction day don't seem to apply for the half slave bot located in Prague,after a month and half your team leader will expect you to be operative in terms of knowledges like its been a 6 months you are on the job, while the users you are forced to support are in the company for some 3 years minimum and actually don't seem to know as much as you do..try to share your concern with management about the cold fact that their users really need training on how to behave and interact properly with a non artificial intelligeance and the management will pretend to listen while giving you pattern corpo templates as only answer...make you feel like you are the trouble and everything is fine as it is like it is in the company,salary not negociable so basically it is what it is accept it or go off fast...as the management don't even have the guts or people skills to fire you...J&J don't want to educate internal users neither paying you more for having to support been treated like a cheap under staff by the one you have to help.This kind of position have no value or future at all as an artifical intelligeance will perform such tasks in a very close future."

- Pay is pretty much industry standard, won't go above and beyond
- Great Training
- Benefits are pretty nice too. Get free contact lens
- Access to a lot of sites across the company and nice for marketing","- For such a big conglomerate, J&J is an incredibly cheap company. Don't expect big budgets or big investments for game changing technology. The company in medical device runs extremely lean. 
- Everything is outsourced: R&D, Manufacturing. It's extremely frustrating as an engineer. 
- J&J is where innovation goes to die. If you want to innovate and design cool stuff, J&J is not the place for you. There is so much red tape and stuff out of your control that it's extremely frustrating to try and do your job well 
- Quick Promotion path is only for a special group of people. Very hard as a lower level engineer to get promoted. 
- Problem with J&J is that it cares more about ""optics"", the appearance of solving a problem and how the company is perceived then actually fixing any root issue.
- I was shocked how little control that the Managers, Directors and VP have in terms of direction. Everything is dictated by the guy at the top Shlomi."

Lack of investment in R&D so all new products need to come through acquisitions or partnerships.

They tend to be so focused on trying to improve and set the benchmark across industry that they have not fixed based business issues. They eliminate associates when they have poor sales/don’t meet business targets, however then hire contractors to do base business work at twice the cost, but it’s acceptable because headcount was reduced.

- You learn a lot from your peers and management
- Company is old and diverse; creates many opportunities for improvement 
- Lots of change is always happening. You can be a leader in change
- They have been giving away free PTO days due to the current work environment
- Great benefits compared to peers, but compensation is lower","- You are inundated with requests and you have systems that are so outdated, it takes hours, countless emails, and meetings to get tasks done
- FLDP has lost a lot of it's value over the years to peers. You can see this through both the talent pool + management of the program. As a former FLDP, you sense how outdated and poor things are managed. 
- Culture is a bit toxic and dare I say 'fake'. We preach a lot of 'credo', but it is perfectly normal and acceptable for folks to work 8-8 or 7-7. Creates the expectation and isn't healthy for workers. Wish they practiced what they preached. 
- FLDP is not anywhere near its former caliber, has obvious mismanagement, and you are underpaid + grind hard. Some friends worked investment banking like hours. This is unacceptable. 
- All employees are generally overstretched"

Overall the mission and the credo is real - everyone can know they had a part in positively impacting over a billion people per day.","In Technology, there is either a 70% overlap in roles or 100% gap. Organizational management is atrocious. There is a constant feud between Business Unit IT and Shared-Services IT. I've been here for 11 years on both sides in 7 different roles, I promise you that previous assessment is not myopic. Huge amount of waste in the Tech Product Management lifecycle is extremely high. There is generally more people doing project management / coordination tasks on a project then there is people defining, designing, building, testing, deploying and supporting a product. I often have to go on ""status update"" tours (remember TPS reports from the movie ""Office Space"") every time something happens. Look this is a great company but the bloat is enormous. If you are someone looking for a pension after 40 years of working the same job 30-40 hours a week, this place is for you. After reaching middle management, it's extremely hard to move up further without spending the majority of the time in a political ruse. I came from their IT leadership development program...I think I'm 1 of 3 left in their original class of around 50...that's pretty common."

Once you’re here you’ll be surrounded by the best in the business, but to expand you’ll need a healthy combo of being amazing at your job and being on the radar of the right people. JNJ is made up of over 250 subsidiary companies. If you’re willing to play the game (Not lose your integrity, but hustle), and you lean into a the JNJ Credo, your growth can be exponential. And if you ever decide to leave (Why would you and lose out on that sweet pension?) you’ll be able to go and work almost anywhere else and command top dollar. Very meaningful work with opportunities for stretch assignments and talent development program. Company provides up to 20k for surrogacy.","No real complaints. The 401(K) match could be higher, but given the pension I figure it comes out in the wash. There are some teams that lack serious diversity, which is likely a result of the “Relationships” culture, but the company has made recent commitments to addressing DEI."

- People are (really) smart knowing when and where to take credit (up, down, front & back).
- People tend to rotate internally within 2-3 years. So there's no point implement perfect system or get the business process in place because they will be replaced/ revamped anyway. So the key here is knowing how to find enough credit and moved up the ladder somewhere else.

CEO talks a big game on D&I but everything breaks down at management level. Middle management sucks! They had so many reorgs they are running on bare bones with both people and dollar resources. They have affinity bias to hire and advance those that look like them. Senior leadership is too busy to manage their middle management. HR only worries about saving company from lawsuits. Employees of color have no support or advancement opportunities. Company tried to listen to its black and brown employees recently but failed to take any action because they are afraid of reverse racism and lawsuits. I wont encourage anyone to join J&J at this time.

Some don’t even get a response, and answers are rarely written down or recorded so you have to rely on management to not change their opinion.

3135,Johnson & Johnson,Mediocre Culture,2020-06-01,2.0,Junior Software Engineer,"-Reasonable salary;

-Good benefits, insurance; Fruits daily; 

-Share purchase; Onsite gym, doctor, etc;

-A few smart people to work with; Some people are friendly if theres no politics involved;

-Opportunities to work on large-scaled challenging projects;  Encourage workflow improvements.

-Activities, meetups, lunch and learns were supported. 

-JnJ has good company cultures globally. 

-Work-life balance - depends on projects

-Some courses and conferences organized by HR for graduates.

-It was once a great place with many talents and encouragement of learning and innovations, 
until controlled by the hypocrites. Management seems to be blinded by them.","-There are a lot of conflicts with other branches of JnJ. Colleagues outside the branch and contractors are sometimes kept in the dark about their status. 

-Office politics are everywhere. Hypocrites talk jives, goof around and take other's credit, but the management trusts them. Promotions aren't based on merits. Who attends training or conferences is base on how friendly you are with your manager, not skill needs. A lot of secret meetings behind your back, as well as gossiping and trash-talking; it is not an environment for earnest people who just want to work. After a certain time, an employee would either have to play the same game (I witnessed decent people turning like that over time in this toxic environment) or be targeted, bullied, have their merits stolen and eventually pushed out. It may be the right place to learn to play politics. Real talents wouldn't stay long.

-There is very little guidance and mentoring for junior employees; Low tolerance for learning curves. Junior developers are questioned on their abilities if they spend a bit longer to onboard. On the opposite, some particular ""senior"" developers really take their time learning on the projects or are never eager to improve.  With the name of ""Pair Programming"", they can simpliy cover the truth about their real level. It also happened once or twice junior team members were jeered during so called ""Pair Programming"".  

-Even though JnJ has a good company culture, the development centre’s culture is mediocre. Despite the emphasis on diversity and inclusion, it is hard to progress if you are a not a white male. It is not surprising to hear jokes on one's ethnicity, background, accent, politic views, etc. The recruitment process is opaque. Overall, there is a clear difference in treatment between white and non-white, especially Asians. 

-Performance reviews and goal settings are a bit confusing, and in the end, it depends again on your relationship with whoever review you.

-As a young female junior employee, I was harassed by a senior member for several years and bullied by his allies. My mentor (a white male) only asked me to resolve it myself and encouraged me not to speak up. When I finally decided to speak up, my mentor turned against me and revealed himself to be also part of the problem. I spent lots of time and money on mental counselling and therapy. 

Conclusion: my time at here was harrowing and exhausting. I ended up with serious depression problems."

This pushes a focus on training for existing employees and new roles for new hires coming in. 

Although your experience may vary depending on your team, I personally have found that all leaders are very open to new ideas and will push you for feedback based on your experiences. If you feel something can be done better - your feedback will be valued.

Work life balance is promoted heavily and there are flexible work from home days that help achieve that.",Difficult to get through the interview stages because of the number of applicants they receive. Additionally there are normally roles that open up that end up going to internal candidates - if they are qualified.

My overall experience has been a fairly good one, mostly because I strived with extra efforts to keep it in good terms. However, there were a lot of unethical, low level, discriminative leadership misconducts. The entire Global Procurement Organization in Zug is filled with ""leaders"" who are very good at burning out their peers or 3rd party service providers, bullying is absolutely normal, faking the daily work is again a norm, the only good thing for which I would give them a prize is kanteen networking and backstabbing. There is nothing great being part of a corrupt organization, promoting talent on back door politics and ivy league men's strategies. It looks and feels like a sinking sheep, the only aspect keeping it alive is poor data reporting (polished numbers) for the US C-LEVEL, a few long time Directors and VPs who are feared and that's about it. 

For anyone willing to join the Procurement Function is ZUG, I would advise networking with as many current employees, asking for their honest opinion, preparing with straightforward questions and be extremely pragmatic, too many times HR will sell you the grant package when in reality the role will work your mental of."

J&J has a terrible company culture. Mediocrity and incompetence are rewarded. Leadership promotes based on who they like, zero evaluation of employee's skills. Lots of paper pushers because talented people are ""threats"" to the middle management who are extremely lazy. HR protects managers and directors while using buzzwords to make it sound like they are inclusive and care about talent. Most talented engineers leave early career if they can - once you reach a certain mid career ""level"", it is hard to leave and so you are basically stuck.

Absolutely horrible management with a blame culture especially in the Finance COE Bracknell office.

Having been recruited into the company I had the intention to work and stay here for almost my whole career due to the size of the company however what came was the worst workplace experience I have ever had... The credo is just a marketing gimik.

The role I was recruited for did not exist when I started. Instead I was given meaningless work with projects that would never get off the ground and eventually make the workforce redundant.

There was a lack of professionalism and you would only make management based on the length of service so be prepared to wait for 5+ years before you are even considered a promotion.. oh wait and then its all about who you know and are buddies with.

My manager actually made up point blank lies to cover herself up as they could not deliver the work and obviously the blame comes down to employees. If you think of whistle blowing or raising the credo then think again because all management cronies have been around for centuries and would never take your side.

HR? What HR? Never seen it? never come across it? Never even had a exit interview?

There are some genuinely nice clever people there but are genuinely let down by the back stabbing culture."

Wash, rinse, repeat and you are on your way to the retirees winner's circle. Be sure not to rock the boat in your last 5 years of retirement and collect as many direct reports as possible because you will need to shave a few off every few years to make it look like you are being efficient.

Pays well
Hot-desking 
Work from home possible","The epitome of office politics. If you play politics well, you will thrive. If you detest office politics, don't think about joining - you'll drown. If you're happy keeping your head down and working years without much upward movement, you'd be OK. If you play your cards well though, you'd be promoted really quickly. 

No proper onboarding system. You're essentially thrown into the deep end of the pool and expected to swim - figure everything out on your own.  

Matrix system. Expect an insane number of stakeholders in every project - you'd need everyone's buy-in and please everyone. This makes things move incredibly slowly. 

Everyone wants to shine so everyone wants to start their own project. This leads to a mess of multiple meetings and projects that overlaps (and you start to wonder about the purpose of it all). 90% of my time sometimes an entire day is spent in meetings and telcons. 

You work in teams but beware. No one will give you credit for your ideas and your creation. People WILL take credit for your work. Don't expect recognition for your contribution. This in particular disgusted me. 

At the end of the day, NO amount of MONEY OR BENEFITS makes up for all these."

3510,Johnson & Johnson,Experience is based on the sector you are in,2019-10-06,2.0,Director,Compensation is good with annual bonus and long term incentives i.e. stock plans. Pension is rare in a public sector company and J&J offers one. There are some wonderful and talented people who are dedicated and passionate. Potential for some very good experiences but highly based on your manager and area of the organization. It can be a good company. Avoid the Medical Devices sector like the plague.,The CREDO is nothing more than some words carved in granite as most leadership ignores most of the tenants and act in direct contradiction of them. Employees are encouraged to speak up however it's window dressing as there most definitely will be ramifications for doing so. The culture in the Medical Devices sector is toxic and leadership is extremely poor. I can't speak for the Pharmaceutical or Consumer sectors however.  Leaders who implement failed strategy after failed strategy resulting in poor growth and reduced revenues just get shuffled around into different while they constantly cut lower level employees to compensate.

Its extremely difficult to work your way up through the ranks; and it may be better to leave and come back since internal experience carries significantly less weight than external. For example to be considered for a position, your paygrade can't be more that one or two positions removed from the one your looking at; regardless of what you actually do and your actual experience. You would then need to also already be (titled) in that position, since they only ""hire the best"". Which in there eyes would be someone who already has the experience and title; again regardless of internal needs or considerations. Its not so different than many other companies in this way; to help ward against nepotism. But that and the paygrade ceilings hurts professional growth. I've had several rotational bosses in a positions I would be eligible for except for my paygrade.

Good compensation packages when joining and on promotions.

Can develop your career to whatever you want. A lot of internal opportunities. 

Company does care about staff and plenty of iniatives and benefits.

The Credo, whilst the implementation is always reliant on the people you work around,  it's a great statement and the vast majority act and make decisions in line with it.","Such a vast enterprise it's easy to get lost. People tend to work in certain functions and move around often within the business. It can be difficult to get things done or find the right person. Having an internal network is essential.

Whilst there's plenty of finance roles, they aren't always the most stimulating of roles in some departments. Sometimes feel as if you're tech support as a lot of processes are standardised, automated or outsourced and you're there to solve the problems when they arise. Quite a lot of downtime outside busy periods but heavy workloads when it's busy. Whilst I enjoy my job and wouldn't change any time soon, it's nice to feel energetic about your role. 

Although salaries are generally good, annual increases aren't much more than inflationary even if you fully meet/exceed your objectives. This is despite rises being described as merit increases.

IT equipment really isn't as good as it should be. Laptops are really basic, slow and small. Very difficult to work on unless connected to wired internet and docked to a monitor. This makes it hard to work outside of the office."

It's easier to apply for an internal job if your not a JNJ employee...many times I was held back from putting my name in the hat for some job openings that I was fully qualified to do

Sometimes JNJ ""talks the talk"", but don't ""walk the walk"":
Example: JNJ openly says we are pursuing flexible work schedules, or additional Personal Days when they are attracting new talent, but when push comes to shove they say ""it's up to your manager"".  Because my manager didn't want anybody working from home, ever, my team never got to unless we were sick.
Example:  JNJ actively hires diverse talent from different education backgrounds for the overall , but  these once in the company enon-traditional hires are not given the same opportunities as those who have an MBA"

If you don't know about J&J's commitment to The Credo, I suggest that you stop reading now and go research it. The Credo lives in everyone I have worked with and is the driving force for all decisions that are made in the company. 

Benefits, work-life balance, compensation, very intellectually stimulating work, and opportunities at every corner. If the density of your work is great and the quality outstanding (that doesn't mean if you work 50+ hours per week) you get to choose what you work on and can pivot to new projects very easy. There is opportunity to travel in the IT sector which gives you the ability to network, connect, and learn about all of the different business units; you get to see how your work in IT is impacting the lives of millions.","Some might see this as a con, and thus why I have included it in this section. 

No one is ever given anything in life and the same goes about promotional and advancement opportunities. If you are not willing to put in the leg-work to manage your goals and objectives,  educational opportunities, certifications, etc., then you may find it difficult to advance in the company. I see this as an opportunity to advance one's self starting skillset. Advocation and self-starting are critical attributes if you wish to advance to senior leaderships. 

As with many large enterprise companies, there are politics at play. A good understanding of psychology can help mitigate this."

I do see a great growth trajectory, but I can see one too many getting stuck unless they dedicate their life to the company (50+ hour weeks). The biggest con is definitely the poor guidance/direction of what management wants you to do. Often, the resources aren’t there and people just want to stick to their day to day cause that’s already heaping amount work for them.

I will definitely not recommend to work for I2C / Vision Care. Management is so bad, and don’t care about employee.
Don’t expect any promotions, you need to be friend to Manager.
Despite to have received  2 warning letters an employee get promoted as this person was friend with his manager………
I have never seen such a management like this, basically you are on your own. 
As Management  in I2C are saying , you are just a number, and expect to do work for other position, even if you don’t speak language.
If you work too well, it will not be possible to move for you as you will be to important for your manager, and you are lock there.
You are not allowed to criticize your manager, or else your bonus will be lower.

If you so much as try and take days off when you need, or schedule hours off you will get some bad looks from management quickly, and coworkers who have been there for 5-10 years already that have been jaded by the terrible attitudes of the office.  As it is a service center, they expect to pay you extremely low Czech wages, not even near US or Swiss office salaries. Somehow the jaded workers at J&J think the current salaries are amazing. Trust me, they are terrible. With rising rents in the city and prices of food and or leisure activities rising, for the amount of stress and work you have to do for the company is not properly compensated for. Advice would be to get experience, get it on your CV and go somewhere else that has some realistic salaries and a realistic workload to actually enjoy life. Prague has extremely low unemployment rates. Do not be afraid! That 2-3% raise yearly? Roughly (900) Czech more. Nothing to get excited about.  Also - No Christmas bonus!!!!!"

Gives funding to small start ups to complete their experiments for potential partnerships in future.
Senior leaders are down-to-earth and approachable.

Established processes—you get your laptop and other needs on the day you start work. They have apps for almost every logistics, eg leave processing, reimbursements, travel policy etc","Many people who commented here are working less than 1 yr. I’d go for comments of employees who have been working/worked for at least 2 years. 
1) Not family friendly as what they claim to be.
-There’s almost no work-life balance as most people are overworked. Workload is not proportionate with manpower and the salary they give you. You’re left basically to do whatever you can to make this happen—if you can, then you get a pat on the back; if you can’t it means you’re incompetent and needs to be laid off. People who say otherwise are usually just paperpushers. 
- There’s also no daycare or any sort of support for working moms, or single parents.

2) HR is one of the most useless—onboarding is suboptimal and there are basically no projects that boost personnel performance or support career and development. This is all dependent financially on your dept and if training is not a priority or you have no budget then bad for you—you’ll never get training. You’d also think that in such a big company there are plenty of career opportunities—in truth its so hard to transfer roles and be promoted that you’ll just decide to leave for fear of stagnation. Most times they get someone from outside than promote from within. 

3) highly disorganized org chart—rather, there is no org chart haha. You dont know who is who and where is what that you basically dont know where to start liaising.

4) pay is one of the lowest in the industry—although they keep on telling themselves that they are competitive. This is the main reason people leave.

4) very bureaucratic and slow in decisionmaking. Most of your time is spent on meetings rather than project execution. Higher ups dont know how to do financial planning similar to other companies—they cut your budget and then later on ask you to spend the rest of the money mid 4th quarter—how can you possibly execute with a decent project with less then 2 wks planning and execution? 

5) there’s a lot going on about employee appreciation but in reality there are very little incentives."

You'll work with the most respected and recognizable brands in the industry from OTC to Medical Devices to Rx, this company has something for all backgrounds.","There is a high level of stress due to the increased work loads. Staff can easily pull in 60 hour work weeks with quick deadlines on projects. Sites are severly understaffed due to budgets. That seems to be a big issue - budgets are low and have been cut. We hear it at almost every town hall - budgets. 

With that comes layoffs and not backfilling positions. There are numerous rumors (use that word loosely as it can be meaningless) of more layoffs, sites closing, outsourcing and relocations. The promotional process is very tough. If you have an avanced degree above a Bachelor's you're protected and can advance easily. If you only have a Bachelor's degree, you'll go years without anything.  There is considerable bias towards who gets promoted by upper management, folks can easily feel unwanted. Also, recent graduates with advanced degrees will often come in at higher positions rather than somebody with more years of experience and a lesser degree. Overall, it's stressful. You're expected to turn around 9 projects in three days and don't you dare be late because if you are, it goes up the chain and you'll hear about it. Project management is terrible. Instead of staggering projects, they'll clump everything together and overload the same staff members. Very healthy."

Good salary, good benefits, although they might need now a revision up. People are generally competent, still too much dependent on CYA attitude at higher levels.
If you’re young and willing to make new experiences, it’s a good place. Networking is very important for your career though.","Being here for long, first time I am deeply embarrassed  by my higher management. Insisting in going through a path proven wrong already several times, using external companies that sell smoke (I don’t want to think it is done for personal or blackmailing reasons).
Lots of talk and talk, remove the best leaders and promotes the ones that sell better smoke, no attention to results and Credo (the survey will be fun this year).
More than a year to change the organization, talents are leaving and incompetent and arrogants stays. Decision are taken without consulting the base, that will have to pay the full price, leaving or working for bad leaders and with bad processes.
Promotions blocked, plans changed overnight, no clear direction and lack of guidance. The CIO should have the decency to leave together with half of his staff.  Who left maybe did for lack of result or for being against the current status and leadership. We miss the female EVP, that drove the growth till now and kept everyone in line, we seem like a headless chicken where people get accountability on paper without any interest or real involvement. All is left to few individuals that play their own interested game without really knowing what’s happening. This in all regions, especially after the hostile takeover of an IT division over another and having moved ‘dangerous’ and visionary leaders out of the way (not even the guts to fire them!)
For me, time to go after 15+ years, IT has become a joke for the business, I’m tired to listen to lies and deceptions and cover for complaints."

The people make or break a company and JNJ is no exception.  For the most part, if you excel, you get recognition and extra compensation.  

Benefits:

Healthcare benefits are on par with industry, but with ever-increasing deductibles and a massive push towards high deductible plans.

Pension plan, once vested, is 15% of total earnings paid out in a lump some upon retirement.

Retirement match is a max of 75% of 6% of your gross income (example, if you earn 100k and put 6% of that back annually, the company matches 4,500/yr).","Some changes (everything from policy to software) seem to be made for the sake of change, with little or no added value.  In the case of software, it is usually still in beta version when it is released.  Vacation time is not as rewarding as some other companies.  

As I said in 'pros', the people can make or break a company.... Apparently, it's impossible to be terminated for habitual under-performance and if you find yourself in a situation where your colleagues are slacking, don't expect anything for picking up their slack."

Promotions are granted only to those who are friends of managers. Other people do not have a chance to grow - knowledge, hard work, experience and degree are not valued in this department. As a result employees are not motivated at all, see no future and try to move out from I2C asap. The fluctuation in this department is very high.
Workload is very high, they give work of approx. three employees just to one. Even when it's obvious that more people are needed for the team, they do not hire more - behaviour of a typical SSC when they try to save costs. If you ask for help from a team lead you get literally no support, but jokes. As a result, employees are dismotivated, quality of work goes down, customers are frustrated, but management does not care.
If you try to express your opinion or complain - you are done, they do not want to hear anything negative, neither do want to improve things.
This department is ok. for people with no knowledge, no experience but with language skills, but just for one year, since no future and no way to grow.  If you stay longer, the workload will start to influence your health. Good professionals do not waste their time in this department."

After working in 2 another SSC in Prague, so far the best experience and fair salary.  Work is challenging, you are always busy, but overtimes is paid, home office is not limited, if your direct manager approves, you can work from home as much as you want, overtimes are paid or can be taken as compensatory leave. Flexible working hours are a great.","I don't understand how some people ended up in the management, they sat there long enough I guess. They lack leadership and people skills and often are even not able to advise in operational questions or decide something. Ideally you need to be independent, self sufficient and resourceful person, to function here. People get promoted to management based on being friends with higher level managers, not based on skills. I think it is easier on accountant/analys level, as there is attrition, you can get promoted to senior pretty quickly when you are skilled."

Stable long term employment.","The company is so large you tend to feel disconnected, or like a speck of sand on a huge beach. Hard to know who to contact for payroll or HR inquires or to even meet people on the campus since the organization is so large. Skeleton crew for some op cos, where they are understaffed and the employees are overworked/overloaded, and it's difficult for supervisors to get approved additional head count. Upper management is disconnected to supervisors and their employees. There seems to be a lot of effort for show and stating ""We Care About You"" but you don't feel like they genuinely do at all. You feel like just a number. No attempts to find out how mid level employees really are doing. As of 2017 there is non assigned seating, open seating floor plan where you have an assigned locker and unassigned desk, hardly any walls or privacy in workspace. Very small on site IT staff. Off shore IT staff for 99% of issues can be very frustrating."

4449,Johnson & Johnson,ITLDP Associate,2018-04-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The employees/leadership (known as the 'program team') governing the Information Technology Leadership Development Program (ITLDP) are, for the most part, great people who tried helping entry level employees with getting a proper fit for roles within different sectors of J&J. The program team often went above and beyond to help candidates.

Clothing relaxed.","The leadership outside of the program team (managers, sr. managers, directors, etc. of different teams and sectors) typically apply to be selected as a manager for an ITLDP candidate. If a manager is chosen they are then responsible for the development and work assigned to the candidate. However, often times these managers have so much work on their own plates and therefore never dedicate the proper amount of time to the candidate they are responsible for developing. Leadership is so focused on themselves and their next move in the company that they never truly give the time deserved to the entry level employees/candidates. In retrospect it is somewhat understandable given the amount of responsibilities some workers have. HOWEVER, don't tell entry level candidates (college graduates) that they're apart of some all-star development program when it's in-fact nothing but an illusion. 

Nepotism runs rampant through all sectors and all facets of the company. There are countless sons and daughters of leadership that work among everyone. Just when you think you've met someone who worked as hard as you did to get in your position you find out that they to have a relative who works within another department."

-benefits like home office, fruit in the office, Cafeteria, public transport contribution, language course contribution, after a year also pension insurance, free gym in the building
- international environment- lots of foreigners
- yearly increase of salary about 2-3%
- yearly bonus","-incredible fluctuation, especially I2C department, but also GL and Reporting - there is a reason why there are always positions open in these departments, workload is high, job is not easy, managers lack knowledge or people skills, mostly both, employees can't ask them anything 
- poor knowledge transfer, usually when someone leaves, new person starts later and gets no knowledge transfer from him
- fastly growing organization, too many newcomers, no one knows anything, people with some experience are required to do the most important tasks and teach newcomers for the same money, so they usually leave after a year or two for a better company
- low salaries, low chance for promotion if you are not a friend of a manager
- many positions will be transferred to Asia in next 5 years
- they act like everyone is replaceable, typical Shared service centre"

Was my case, our team was working as a completely independant unit (TL was there just for making jokes)
If there is a lazy/incompetent colleague do not even think of any complain or escalation....you will be identified as the trouble maker and get a warning letter and no annual bonus
Even if you are a hardworking employee staying within the company for years, forget to escalate anything
Their Credo sounds pretty good, but unfortunately, they completely ignore these ethical rules set by the company founders
Be aware of their policies, they pretend to give you a referral bonus, but you will not receive it in all cases, my and other people experience
Extra workload form your incompetent colleagues
Old softwares as working tools, tons of mistakes within invoicing which catalyses completely unecessary extra issues/workload
Lack of communication from the management
Instead of punishing incompetent TL or colleagues, you will be charged with the consequences of your escalation
As an example,our TL was not able to approve needed reimbursements, changes within the clients accounts always forgetting our emails-his manager solved the situation by asking his colleagues to approve our requests instead of telling him to do his job...
Last but not least, they will sent you working enviroment satisfactilnon surveys every week and guide you how to conplaim, but once you complain, you are done"

I had expat tax status thanks to my previous employer. When switching jobs to J&J, HR assured me that I would retain that status, and it was my condition for accepting the contract .  Sloppiness and unprofessional conduct (eg. missed form submission deadlines) from HR resulted in me losing my expat tax status permanently.  The extra taxes that I suddenly owed far exceeded any money that I earned during my contract with J&J. It was a loss making venture, so to speak.

Management never took responsibility for their mistake, in the end offering a small ""compensation"" of a few thousand Euros and having the gall to call it a ""courtesy"". I don't want to sound entitled. I am well aware that J&J was under no obligation to hire me as an expat, and that this entails extra work for them. But if something was agreed upon in ADVANCE, I would expect a company of this caliber to fulfill their end of the agreement diligently. Stupid me."

There is no actual HR. Just a online portal and an external company to deal with “situations”. Although, nothing ever gets taken care of. I’ve seen numerous employees in tears because of their work place environment and managers. The turn around is insane. They over work employees until they break and either quit or “move on”.  Managers speaking ill of their team and/or co-workers. Screaming at employees and even belittling them in front of others. It’s extremely shameful to see how toxic a small department is and that no one fixes it. The credo only holds value at corporate and to customers, but isn’t implemented consistently. There is no training anywhere and the managers don’t know how to be leaders. It’s only a matter of time until it all falls apart."

Passive-aggressive Culture:  People tell you that you are doing a good job to your face then give negative feedback during your reviews.  Also, reviews can be petty and biased.  When you are new, and you are not in the clique just know that you are being watched.   When the inner circle decides that they don't like you, they will find a way to get rid of you.

Not Organized: This group is in its awkward teenage years of development, so there are not a lot of established procedures and processes.  There is a lot of hurry up and wait with projects.   Some work can feel like busy work, and it is not clear what the outcome is supposed to be.

Nepotism:  Most people in the office are connected with their co-workers in some way (friends, old classmates, neighbors, etc.).  If you are not it the inner circle, you may be treated differently.  Upper management is an extreme example of this.

Not Collaborative:  The office is fairly siloed, there is not a lot of time and opportunity to find out what your coworkers are working on or to help them or have them help you.

Creativity is not valued as much as you would expect:
Although J&J Design is an internal design consultancy for all of J&J they are set up more like a production house (they crank out a bunch of work) as opposed to a consultancy which is involved in more strategic work.   So the focus is on cranking out work quickly rather than creativity and strategic thought.  The IXS (Insights and User Experience) Team may be an exception to this rule.  

Not that Friendly:  It took about six months for most of my coworkers to warm up to me.  As a minority, I felt like a second-class employee (despite trying extremely hard to fit in and connect with my coworkers.)

High turnover and Contractor Heavy:  About 40 percent of the staff are contractors.  During my time at this office, a lot of contractor's contracts expired during our hiring freeze (which is still ongoing).  So they had to leave.  So if you can, try to get a full-time role.   

Myopic Management:
Management is not able to see your full potential based on your background they just want to to do a specific job, and that's it.  Also, you can get pigeonholed pretty easily.

Flat Hierarchy:
Not a lot of opportunity for advancement.  Maybe a title change but not necessarily an increase in responsibility."

Performance appraisal is based on other people's judgement on you not based on your KPI and target achievement. You can achieve your target and your KPIs are all green. But you won't advance in your career if your counterparts are not happy with you. Conflicts inter-department are not solved nicely and the Managers tend to close their eyes to all issues occur at down level employees as long as the target achieved. No proper training or induction given for new employees to help them understand their role better.

Some smart and nice folks here to forge a friendship with. The other people are either passive aggressive or too stressed out.","Where to start?
Large company...Half the time the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing( but there will be meetings to try to bring together). 
Lack of true innovation or rushing to bring products to market and then see them fail because the company is so conservative ( cheap) in really putting $ behind launches. 
TERRIBLE cost cutting culture. I thought so much more of JNJ. This company is so cheap that I got tired of asking for my own BASIC supplies and just bought them myself. 
Meetings, Meetings, Meetings. See point above - There will be meetings about ideal, meetings about reality, meetings about plans, meetings about career progression. Nothing comes out of these meetings. JNJ loves to talk to themselves, create paperwork, unnecessary work ( TPS reports), no action. When things start to fail due to lack of action or funding, there will be more meetings about what went wrong...yet nothing happens anyway, just more meetings clogging everyone's calendar.
Extremely political company, advancement depends really on who you know, not what you know. Advancement is not encouraged as managers love to pigeon hold talent as long as they can. Work gets stale, people get frustrated unless they find opportunities to get known by the higher ups and work your way around a heavy political system that rewards the talkers ( see point above on meetings) , not the doers or the action enablers. You have to be a certain type to progress inside JNJ. Diversity, individuality hardly encouraged at this company"

5131,Johnson & Johnson,COE - Slave Driver Department,2017-03-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits and perks are good. Brand name which looks good outside and on paper,"The culture here is extremely bad. My interview with the Senior Director  was horrible which is the first sign that I shouldn't be joining this company. Apparently, he was given a copy of my resume which was printed out into 4 pages. He started rebutting me by saying that my resume was horrible. I am not sure who did that but everyone in the world knows that resume should be kept within 1 - 2 pages. If I have sent over my resume in 4 pages, I believe the HR will put my resume in the dumb. 

To make thing worse, he showed me his resume and was telling me how great his resume was as compared to mine. He started saying that he had an interview with APPLE and they willing to increase his salary by how many %. I was so turn off by him and that I felt he was very lonely and bored in his work which he used my resume as an amusement for him during our interview. 

I thought I am going to be rejected but somehow I was selected. To make matter worse, I was not joining the team which the hiring manager interview me in the first place. I was being put into another team which I never met the hiring manager before. 

It turns out that this manager was a newly promoted manager which never had any leadership or management experience. Things started off well until the training become like a surprise examination. You expected to know everything in theory by heart without any practical practise. 

When I seek clarification on the tasks that we doing, all we were told was to just do it like we some kind of robots. Even my manager is not able to explain why we are doing this process. It makes learning dull and feel miserable. To top off that, the manager is so competitive that he worked even if he is unwell. The only time that he took medical leave when he vomited during work. 

This is also a company that uses 4 different dataware house / software to do financial budgeting. Very highly likely to have data migration issues and lots of rework is required. 

APAC management loves to talk about big data analytics but never interested in investing in software. First time in my career, a CRM software is not used at all in this department. Extremely backward in technology. 

Worse off, the management enjoyed seeing the team work extremely late till midnight like it some form of achievement. Somehow I felt like a investment banking analyst working till late night but not getting investment banking salary. You can overhear the management saying work long work harder but when the US directors are here. They talk about scale fast and start small. Total opposite and contradicting. 

I was burnt out and quit at the end. It the most unhappy and stressful experience in my life which I am happy not to be part of it. When I quit, I was surprise that no exit interview is required. This just shows the attitude of the culture of this organization."

Generally, it all depends on if you have good management. I've seen lots of departments fall to poor leadership, because executive senior leadership is too removed from the day to day.

Decentralized structure = very little standardization. This allows for much entrepreneurial thinking-- there's no strict playbook. 

Flexible work arrangements and family-friendly policies make work-life balance a reality. 

There is a true spirit of collaboration at J&J. People genuinely care about each other, and want you to be successful.","Even business-critical, capital-intensive decisions are made using ""feelings"" at the expense of logic and/or hard data. If you are ruled by reason, this will be a huge adjustment for you. 

Your career is yours to manage, as there is very little formal career mapping or transparent succession planning in the marketing function. But this allows for creativity in career progression. 

The Company is attracted to re-organizations like a moth to a flame. Expect frequent professional whiplash, as strategy/structure changes almost annually. 

There is a shocking number of employees who leave J&J and come back due to displacement or slow career progression. A running joke is that you have to leave and come back on order to get to the level you want.

An over-abundance of internal controls above and beyond actual regulatory requirements slows decision making and stifles agility. This company is allergic to risk, so the same rules apply to determining the color of a shampoo bottle as a Phase III human clinical trial for a cancer drug."

I have 10 years experience on call center environment and I have never felt so bad and so unwanted working in a place. They gave me wrong information whenever I said something it was never taken into consideration, so much that one day I have to stand up and reminded them that I was there. I was 2 week with No computer, I got  my books for the Licensing almost 4 weeks later...but, their favorite got it a week after she started. 3 later another one started and then she got to use the simulator ;( after that it just went down hill. I say the manager doing some inappropriate touching of the Favorite ...like touching her hair once he passed behind her. doing things for her that it was not what you are not suppose to see in an office.

5. J&J tries their best to make their employees happy and healthy.
6. There are TWO gyms on site. They offer classes and even wash your gym clothes for you for FREE! They try their best to keep their employees practice healthy habits like eating healthy and exercising.
7. Everyone is intelligent and a pleasure to work with. J&J does a great job of only hiring the best and brightest people. When I worked there, there was no such thing as failure because everyone was so good at what they do.
8. Very up to date with technology","1. Way too many emails. It was pretty standard to CC everyone and their team/bosses to every email and you are expected to read these emails to know what is going on.
2. Way too many meetings/conference calls. I was an analyst and there would be some many meetings and conference calls that it would be hard to catch up with your work.
3. Very difficult company to get into because no one ever leaves. Everyone there has been with the company for at least 20 years (which says a lot about how great of company it is)
4. For me personally, I felt very underpaid as a reporting analyst for the amount of work I was doing"

Nettlesome is having no voice to the Brand Team which determines the message, since we are on the frontlines and hear the objections everyday, wouldn't it be incumbent upon them to at least give us a forum. It takes 5 years to become fully vested. I memorized the credo, to which much weight is given, but, I wonder how JNJ practices such as  Johnson & Johnson have been moving ownership of patents and trademarks to subsidiaries in low- or no-tax countries. This has allowed drug companies, as well as businesses in several other industries, to skirt paying U.S. taxes on sales of those products unless the money is returned home.

5760,Johnson & Johnson,Not a better company on the planet,2016-03-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Compensation/retirement plans are best in the industry and they deliver!  J&J has come up with a pension plan....that's not a formal pension plan. Once you reach Director-level, you are looking at a base plus a 20-30% bonus based on performance - can't beat a meritocracy. Long-term incentive plan is realistic and will remain in place: percentage of base salary in Restricted Stock Units that mature in 3 years - that is, you take approx 20% of your base salary divide it by the trailing 30-day average stock price to arrive at a number of SHARES of stock, not stock options. Take this year's number of shares of J&J stock and you can sell them in 3 years - that is a rolling plan of stock ownership until you retire - that's better than a pension plan if you take your long-term incentive money and invest it conservatively instead of spending it. Management at the Corporate Level and at the Operating Company level have been the best in the healthcare industry...for as long as anyone can remember. If you don't like your micro-environment, i.e. your current job function and supervisor, you can bid on internal jobs in over 20 divisions that gross over $1b top-line sales. Diversify the functional areas as you gain tenure and you will have your choice of industry-leading businesses to work in --- just stay patient for the right opening. I left in the late 1980's and have regretted that move - I lost a ton of ""retirement money"" in Restricted Stock Units.......and yes, J&J has a 401(k) plan with 75%  match -- your long-term professional and financial growth couldn't be better.","Don't leave, re-entry may be difficult."

Mediocre or average reps no longer last in this business - which is a good thing.  You will become very driven or be driven out quickly if you don't make numbers.

Control what you can control, get results quick and make it known to your DM, RBD, FSD of your career intentions and work hard and do the things you need to do in terms of taking on additional responsibilities but make sure you win Presidents Club at the same time.  You really need to do it all here.","Micro management of field sales reps looms large (even when you are doing well) in this highly regulated environment so you have to stick to a very limited ability to educate and ""sell""  in a way that is actually relevant to healthcare providers in most situations.  Many offices are NO SEE or Limited Rep access - lunch only, limits on number of lunches you can do, including no sampling in some cases.  Of course in sales, you are still responsible for meeting your call completion goals and objectives even if you cannot access the office or the doctor.    Often times it doesn't matter how good you are at sales it will come down to whether your drug is on formulary or not and if the office/physician likes you or not so building a super strong relationship with your offices is critical to your success.  This industry is still not stable in terms of a sales career.  Patent Cliffs come fast and if you are a me too drug meaning third in line or further down - forget it...

Most of the people there become life long friends b/c of their morality and the camaraderie created.  Health Benefits are good, Pension is still there, but not sure how long.  Pay is not nearly as good as it used to be when comparing to some of the other larger named companies out there.  Some of that is due to the unsettling and mysterious change in healthcare as well.","At the end of the day, I think J&J is still a good company overall.  However, certain franchises are suffering hugely.  Specifically in the surgical world that covers most of the general surgery procedures.  Growth and Revenue have sharply declined, so the response was to fold all the related sister franchises together.  That has not panned out well because they now have a huge portfolio that is quite frankly unmanageable and they now lack expertise in most of the coverage.  Pay has decreased and what has not is not likely to be obtained by performance.  It's like a slow moving large ship that takes too long to make any substantial changes.  They also refuse to listen to the managers on the ground floor and would rather pay some consulting organization to make huge sweeping decisions that are not welcomed and have not proven successful.  Find a company that is innovative and you will be successful."

The various Leadership Development Programs (LDPs) are very good way of being able to move around the company in the first few years of employment.,Sometimes I felt things were just a little too nice at J&J. There is definitely the sense that you are in a bubble sometimes when working there. Also after attaining a few promotions there is a lot of stagnation due to lack of job openings and positions in some departments and sectors. International travel as a young employee is almost nil.

Since it is 6 months long rather than a 10 week internship you recieve so much more responsibility and they really depend on you.

- Never did ""busy work""
- Opinions about the work and optimization proposals are considered and taken seriously
- Strong company culture
- Presentation skills, excel skills, team leading skills were all greatly improved","The primary reason college students apply for the finance/accounting co-op position is for a chance to be a part of FLDP.  Managers claim they want work life balance for their co-ops (I was kicked out of the office by 5:30 at times), yet the only 2 co-ops that received recommendation offers were the ones that stayed from 8am - 8pm. 
 
Overall, there was a huge lack of communication between what they were actually looking for in FLDP candidates and what they were claiming they wanted.  Recommendations are almost completely based on your personal manager's opinion of you, regardless of whether you worked with other teams and other managers.

I feel that almost everyone I have worked with is committed to doing the right thing for the customer.,My experience may have been very different from others.  I know the company strives for world class commitment but may point fingers which is not a world class reaction and tends to be a waste of time.  Deadlines tend to be more important than than the end result.

Good 401K match.
Lots of corporate perks.
Good work/life balance - although this tends to depend on what department you work in, who your manager is (some are ruthless & scary), etc etc.
Have a nice manager makes a world of difference in your experience. A good manager will help you grow.","The more I see, the more I understand about what's really going on behind the scenes.
Where to begin.....
- Tons of politics in HR. A ridiculous amount. They push ""deliverables"" and deadlines for projects and don't really care about the quality of the systems or data coming out. But be careful not to point this out, unless you want to lose your job.
- Politics rules everything. Everything in this company, or at least at HQ is about WHO you know. You will never move up without being in the favor of the right person. 
- It is insanely hard to move within the company. I don't understand why. 
- Recruiting processes take forever. This is a highly developed organization that is still so tied up in processes & semantics.
- Your manager really shapes your experience. That being said, I am lucky to have a very nice manager, but I have learned what managers you need to play nice with and tip-toe around. Other managers I know are ruthless & not great with work/life balance.
- Some departments are experiencing really insane changes. This creates high stress & chaos.
- Layoffs have definitely been more frequent lately.
- Salaries seem scattered. People that are more well liked definitely get higher pay & more recognition awards.
- Salaries not always reflective of your actual work experience & educational experience. Again, if you are well liked and highly sought out by a manger though, they will give you a great compensation package.
- Contractors are commonly treated like second class citizens. It's truly sad. A lot of J&Js workforce is comprised of contractors & they do a LOT of work. It is very hard for them to get hired on as full time employees & this seems really unethical to me.
- If you are well liked and play your cards right, you can get promotions. Meanwhile, other people that actually have the work experience & background don't get the promotions.
- This org is caught up in unnecessary processes. They lack a bigger picture focus and many managers are reluctant to think outside the box, simply because managers and directors have been there for 20+ years, have no innovative or outside perspective and only think what they think is the right way to do things.
- Higher management in HR is completely ignoring that a lot of employees are terrified of certain directors - this causes distrust in the organization. I can't get too much into this here.... but beware of the wolf in sheeps clothing."

As with all companies, the quality of the management varies greatly from region to region.  More concerned with the bottom line than employees or clients.  Minimal transparency in communication.  Decentralized management is akin to the wild west- poor communication and understanding of grass roots issues, very poor support from management and HR in terms of problem solving. 

They talk a good game and have good intentions but fall far short in most areas."

The CREDO is not applied to this area either. People get bullied, lied to, merit not recognized (not rewarded for hard work, years of service or talent), management is not competent, not open to ideas, suggestions or complaints. Ultimately people in the manufacturing area (especially off-shifters) are treated poorly by day-shifters and the rest of the company...etc. I can go on for a long time but you get the idea."
6549,Johnson & Johnson,Great place to work for contract opportunities,2014-12-04,4.0,,J&J is a very ethical company.

Benefits for Director and above are solid although are being reduced slowly over time as is the case with comparable competitors. Culture is cordially collaborative and nice. Company always tries to be fair with its employees. Our credo is still a strong shining beacon which guides employees actions.,"Don't be fooled by cordial collaboration. It's an exterior face. Politics and power plays abound behind the scenes. You just don't always see it or know about it.  Solid HR processes are used but easily worked around by outspoken management in power. At the end of the day, your success within the company depends on your immediate supervisor and whether or not you have a politically powerful advocate who can publicly support you."

Old timers in the higher positions grew up in J & J mostly, who do not have experience outside J & J. Old fashioned processes and very low understanding of modern methods & processes. Company grew by acquisitions. In spite of large R & D spend, very low innovations. A lot of wasteful expenditure with low level of accountability. If you are in IT, expect to be at least 10 to 15 years behind in IT Strategy, time & technology compared to other large companies. Lot of incompetent people at senior IT management levels, make ill-informed decisions with low technology awareness. Heavy dependency on external contractors for technology due to incompetent IT management people. Very difficult (almost impossible to get promoted) especially if you are good or outstanding professional since the middle & senior management feels in-secured due to their lack of current technology knowledge & awareness. Lot of over-staffing in IT & some other departments. Promotions mostly possible based on who you know & political connections within company. Silo based  approach to different departments & low collaboration across various divisions. Management only talks about J&J credo, however do not always follow it."

Global organization presents varied experiences","Middle layers of organization getting condensed leaving very little opportunity for advancement beyond the Manager level.  Highly political environment in which you will only succeed if you kiss up to those above you.  No need to remain loyal to the company as they have proven time and again they are not loyal to you.  
Also, with the elimination of roles, the workload has remained the same so get ready to work lots of overtime.  When I have asked management which of my tasks to prioritize, I have been told, ""they are all important.""  How is that for leadership?
Every function reports to different functional leaders so this is the place for you if you want to have no idea what the objectives are or the plan to achieve them.  The goals seemingly change weekly.  It is horribly run and I lost all faith in leadership.  They don't walk the talk.  They talk out of both sides of their mouth and you wind up with goals that are not feasible.  They sound really good though.  Ha!
Most of the role are largely thankless.  Despite putting in long hours and delivering against key projects, don't hold your breath for a pat on the back or a thank you.  
Your success is all about networking with the right people.  Even when they post a position internally (per company policy), chances are they have already selected the candidate for the role.  
If you align yourself with the wrong people and they don't succeed, get ready to go down with the ship.  I've seen it happen time and again."

After being in a role for 6 years, I wanted to try something else in the company, learn something new, and this desire was not strongly supported.  If a move was to be granted, it would be in a very similar role, so not much new learning would be gained.  Disappointing for a company who stresses developing their people."

The training received at J&J is top notch and a lot of other companies would benefit from emulating their practice in making employees perform better.,J&J was all about the customer and employee.

Cafeteria - On-site cafe allows for convenient and healthy dining at subsidized costs","1) Lack of training - ABMs are thrown into work immediately with lack of guidance and relevant training. It truly is a sink or swim environment and this can be discouraging.

2) ""Fit"" - The fit here is extremely subjective and opinions are formed early on. If your manager deems you as a lack of fit, it doesn't matter how hard you work or the quality of work you put in-- it simply doesn't matter at this point. J&J management is good at finding loop holes and ways of subliminally 'forcing' employees to leave.

3) Culture - A supportive, collaborative, ""family"" kind of culture is missing from J&J."
6596,Johnson & Johnson,Mostly about 'fit' rather than quality of work,2014-10-21,1.0,Assistant Brand Manager,"The salary (for a new graduate I was making well above someone at 25 out of school)
The 'name' (I was able to quickly find a new job after I left because I had J&J on my resume)","The hours (ridiculous hours- was expected to answer emails on weekends and at funky hours of the night)
The management (once they decided, and usually quickly, if they like your or not, you are either in for a rough or smooth ride)
Very cliquey (This is perpetuated by my point above, you either are a JnJ'er or not and your colleagues will react appropriately)
To my 2 points above, if you dont 'fit' expect to literally be set up to either quit or be 'asked' to leave 
Status Quo (dont question it, especially at ABM level, or you will be seen as not a good 'fit')"
6597,Johnson & Johnson,Better than most,2014-10-18,4.0,Senior Coordinator,J & J is better than most companies.....,"J & J has steadily gone down hill in employee satisfaction over the last 10 years.  It is a co that seems to lay-off every couple years then turn around and hire......seems to be a pattern.  Very difficult to move internally.....the application process is almost worse than applying to an external co.  HR is worthless, Recruiting even worse.  Complaining about unfair practices is a big mistake, nothing ever done by HR and then management finds ways to make your life miserable. Arbitrary ratings, one boss likes you---you get a stellar rating....the next one trying to cut the budget, gives you a lower rating (and thus saves money on salary/bonus structure)."
6598,Johnson & Johnson,The Dysfunction Starts at the Top,2014-10-17,1.0,Sales Representative,"It is truly challenging coming up with one pro as it's one of the most dysfuctional companies and that dysfunction starts at the top. Executives and management are unethical and got promoted for their unethical and illegal activty which is an active business model within Johnson & Johnson (example: Janssen/Risperdal company had to pay $2.2 billion for illegal kick-backs an off-label markeing promotion). Despite that, many of the employees (sales reps) are truly a team and  are ethical and hard working but those employees get passed over (or purged)  for those willing to play by the JNJ rules often times differ from the actual law, as noted and supported by the DOJ fine.","Management is unethical and their actions are often illegal where they encourage employees to engage in unethical and or illegal activity.  Johnson & Johnson management manipulated facts in order to manipulate employees into misrepresnting products to physicians and the community. An employee questioning the manipulation or unwilling to engage in illegal or unethical activity on behalf of Johnson & Johnson may encounter intimidation, threats of job loss, and retaliation.  HR is not there to protect the employee but rather the company and the shareholders."

Each year, the Company conducts a credo survey of all it's employees, and the anonymized results of that survey are made public, and addressed accordingly.  It's very effective.","Leadership within IT should stay focused on the long-term welfare of it's employees.   Employees are a very long-term investment, and should be viewed as such."

I was truly happy to enter the office every day and it was mainly because of the great people I worked with.,"The technology is surprisingly basic. Everything is done from scratch off of excel.

Due to the companies size and growth it leverages a lot of different information technologies and also provides you the ability to try and move around within any of the 200+ J&J family of companies.,"Due to J&J being a large enterprise fortune 50 company many of the IT projects move very slow and require cooperation from various groups to be successful.

Very poor decision making processes, very poor oversight of key decision factors.  Too much politics and too much over analysis.  Lack of empowerment for mid-level managers (Directors/Sr. Directors/VP1).  Tight-knit clique of old-boys have their own exclusive decision making activities outside of the rest of the team who is doing all the work.  Lack of trust has emerged among the general employees because of the overly sensitive, political atmosphere that permeates the culture in the global organization.  Talent management is almost non-existent.  Senior leaders pick favorites, and the rest of the folks get virtually no professional development or guidance for career advancement.  Senior leaders for GCSO have zero leader presence.  Even when they are physically present, they have low impact.  They are much more interested in hob-nobbing with their management and trying to network for their own next roles, As a result, people don't really trust one another.  Most employees are hunkered down just trying to make their pay, do their job, and make it to the next day.  However, the smart ones who want to really make a difference are either stifled or simply get out.  A few good ones remain, but are utterly baffled by what is going on around them.  A pattern of employee survey results over many years reflects these sentiments very strongly.  It's really unbearable."

However it is totally disregarded by the management on a day to day basis and discussion or creativity is actively discouraged. Anybody questioning the status quo is shown the door. Just as leaders of a personality cult use mind games to control their minions, the J&J senior management would deny departmental meetings ever took place and those who dared to question any unethical action were accused of not following the Credo!"

Work life balance is not good since you have to be available all the time and also work most of the weekends and holidays (attend congresses, seminars, business travels, product training meetings).

Leadership of the design group in particulate is concerned much more with their own individual power, influence, and prominence than with the team or with furthering excellence or creativity, and considers staff, the many contractors, and outside agencies as disposable elements in their plans. Little opportunity for growth or advancement and little ability or effort by management to mentor and develop team. HR group as in many companies is unfortunately not your friend. Design office leadership is emotionally unpredictable, lacking in real vision and creativity, though puts in a strong and in my opinion misplaced effort to maintain a presence in trade publications and press, and to maintain image to executives."

Not really interested in original thinking from employees.  Year after year SG&A cuts has left everyone scared that it's only a matter of time before you'll lose your job.  Credo says employees must have a sense of security in their jobs; we don't.  In fact the credo is just a sheet of paper the company hides behind to feel morally superior to other corporations.  The company still rests on the laurels of the way the Tylenol scare was handled DECADES ago.  THAT company was definitely morally superior to the J&J of today.

Most managers are reasonably accessible (though it can be a part-time job to pursue meetings with executives and senior managers).,"Niche professions are often sidelined and there is no way to advance one's career outside of people management. Culture of aligning on decisions - even the smallest ones - diffuses accountability and responsibility, and can slow product development to a halt. Upper management seems always to be looking for the next step up, not across the org and acros their own teams; this is to the detriment of the business. The culture of innovation is upside down: thought leaders, or people with the word ""innovation"" in their title or department name are the innovators, but no one else."

The overall J&J organization is extremely complicated and matrix'ed, so that many finance roles have extremely high job demands and non-value added complexities to work through.  The company never rests, and many individuals work very early in the morning and very late into the night. Frequently arrived to work in the morning with an inbox of to-dos from the night before.  Creates pressure to work late consistently and at a very high callibur or fall behind. 55+ hour works weeks were extremely common, even though the organization preaches work-life balance.  From my impression this was more of a finance problem than other functional areas.  Would not recommend working in finance if you value having an outside life."

Had a very inexperienced manager who needed to be told how every report and document worked and after spending hours with her explaining something she should already know she would go to upper management and say we were not being ""efficient with our time."" Completely ruined the first business job opportunity I had, was extremely unprofessional. Johnson and Johnson is also over a billion dollar company, when the recession was real bad one of the first cuts they made was saying Co-ops could no longer be paid for overtime hours. For a college student $19/hr is a handsome fee, especially when every single week you're working about 50 hours and those 10 hours are time and a half. Making $19/hr was no where near what entry level employees make, we were paid less than anybody and we got overtime taken away. Any hour over 40 would not be compensated at all. At the end of the 7 month co-op there were over 10 seniors in college working there, not a single one was offered an interview. I was not a senior at the time. These people worked so hard, stayed overtime when they weren't being paid even though we all took night classes and didn't even get an interview.

They covered medical/dental/vision and allowed you free use of the gym at the facilities which included group exercise classes as well as free weights, cardio equipment, etc.  In addition, if your faciility did not have a gym, then they offered you discounts for public gyms in your area. You also got a lot of cross functional exposure and experience.

The company also had numerous team building and community service events which helped build team and personal moral.  J&J also participated in blood drives and offered very nice incentives to donate.

There were also numerous opportunities to move around and advance with the company both domestically as well as internationally.","In order to keep up with work demands I often worked a full day at work then brought my laptop home and worked through dinner/night. I also logged on during weekends to answer e-mails that came in during the weekends. I didn't like this at all but it's what was required in order to meet demands and get a good rating.

J&J is talking a good talk about making some changes, being more focused on customers and retailers, and game changing innovation.  The reality is that most of senior management and a solid majority of the rank and file have been there their entire careers. Their openness to change or any outside perspective must be J&J-ified and sold across unbelievable levels of the organization to even be understood.  You'll spend most of your time in meetings aligning on tactics (that they call strategies) and will still find down the line that no one was on the same page.

It is pretty hard to tell if you'll fit in this culture through interviews and J&J itself couldn't verbalize their culture to outside candidates.  However, I would say that change agent and innovative personalities should probably think twice about J&J as a good fit."

7271,Johnson & Johnson,Great place to work.,2012-04-05,3.0,Senior Analyst,work life balance.  great place to learn.  great people to work with.  learning experience.  many different work opportunities.  innovative.  complex.,managment needs to hire talent that is in line with the credo of J&J.  We seem to hire people that do not stay long and it takes forever to get them up to speed.
7272,Johnson & Johnson,Sinking Ship,2012-04-05,2.0,Associate Financial Analyst,Flexible work hours and easy to take time off.  Great benefits.,"J&J has an incredible reputation to the outside world as a great company to work for both socially and personally.  People think the compensation is ""competitive"" and believe in the strong sense of corporate responsibility and the Credo J&J follows but that is all.  The compensation is competitive but the hours expected are exorbitant and do not reflect the time commitment management expects you to work.  J&J is floating on their reputation alone and eventually, that to will sink.  

The growth potential with in the company is almost non-existent but i will say, because of its reputation, its a great place to start out.  Other companies truly believe that J&J's finance dept is a leader in the work force which is a great scam to play off of.  Use it to your advantage! The development has gone down the drain because of the limited growth potential and corresponding competitive nature.  Managers are mostly concerned with their own improvement and individual growth potential of their reports are drastically weighted but their reports ability to help them get ahead.  The concern for the general good of the company is out the door."
7273,Johnson & Johnson,Wonderful company to work for especially balancing work/family,2012-04-03,5.0,Senior Sales Representative,Balance of work/family and compensation,new management a bit inexperienced

7276,Johnson & Johnson,Wonderful place to have an impact.  Very proud to be part of the Company.,2012-03-21,5.0,,"Credo, excellent company.  The company values their employees and treat them well.  J&J really lives the credo and employees are proud of the impact they are having on improving patient quality of life.",Being part of a large organization increases the buearocracy that leads to slower decision making.   The can make it frustrating at times.

The Call plan is really the only business plan that the company can design and it is not accurate
Sad to see such a big company with so much potential limit itself with old ideas and not innovate"
7280,Johnson & Johnson,Johnson & Johnson IRDP Leadership Development MBA Program Experience,2012-02-24,3.0,IRDP (International Recruitment Development Program),"Good package
Opportunities for International Assignments
Family Friendly culture
Great hiring practices
Focus on Ethics
Focus on Diversity
Training Opportunities","I was a participant of Johnson & Johnson MBA Leadership Development program IRDP for around three years and can give a very objective advice to anyone interested. As listed in Pros, J&J IRDP is great in many ways but has lots of issues in the long term. IRDP is a global initiative where they encourage local subsidiaries to hire MBAs. J&J has few MBAs internally so they need to hire MBAs to make J&J look good in annual reports. However, J&J is a sales driven company and almost all senior managers in local subsidiaries started as medical sales reps and then made their way up. Some of them don't even have college degrees but have decades of J&J experience. These old timers don't believe in this whole IRDP practice and IRDPs are always seen as outsiders within their organizations. When MBAs are hired, there is almost always no mention of necessity of sales experience but in couple of years, they are asked to work as a sales rep and then make their way up like reps. It is like J&J saying that your MBA and great work experience means nothing to us and you will have to start in sales from the same level as some nurse who just moved into medical sales. Sales experience is important but it can be given in short assignments instead of expecting MBAs to spend 3-4 years in field sales. Most IRDPs leave the organization at this stage (between 2 to 3 years of joining the company) and it is very rare for an IRDP to make it to general management. In my organization, only one guy made it to a GM from over 80 IRDPs hired in 10 years time-frame.

J&J is a great company to work for if you intend to work there for life. Great benefits and good culture but certainly not for MBAs. If you want to take life easy, work for J&J and lifetime employment is guaranteed even if worked 10% of your MBA potential but expect to spend 10 years as a Product Manager and then a few years in sales before you move into senior roles."
7281,Johnson & Johnson,great place to work and learn,2012-02-22,5.0,Medical Representative,johnson & jonhnson credo values,non availabilty of 4 wheel for field force
7282,Johnson & Johnson,Great company to work for - not to exciting but solid company,2012-02-20,4.0,,People have been around for a long time - and job security is good so there seems to be less politics.,Because it's a very large company there is not always room for innovation or new though and sometimes you can feel lost in the pack
7283,Johnson & Johnson,A company who cares about their people,2012-02-14,4.0,Senior Account Director,"Actions are driven by the credo.  Even in hard times when lay-offs are prevalent, employees are treated with respect and given resources to help ease the transition.","Too big and too slow to take action.  Excessively driven by compliance and creative ""out of the box"" ideas are not welcome."
7284,Johnson & Johnson,Positive,2012-02-13,4.0,,"Solid benefits, philosphy of life-work balance very important (but depends on your management)",question the fairness of true professional opportunties and growth
7285,Johnson & Johnson,Brand Manager - Women's Health,2012-02-13,4.0,Brand Manager,"Strong systems in place to help with structure on how to launch new products. Very supportive environment with strong expertise in each of the field including supply chain, trade marketing, account management. Collaborative team culture, good training with strong opportunities to take on new challenges. Great benefits with an emphasise on work/life balance. Enjoyed working with very talented members and experts. This is a great place for training and FMCG/ all round marketing as the company truly trains the staff very well, across all hierarchies through training days, off site training/conferences and internships with agencies.",Too many processes and over complication due to the need to go through all steps in a process. The company was understaffed in certain areas and there was over-conversativism in J&J. The company can be very political at times with strong influencing skills needed. The company is very inward looking at times and not bold enough to try new types of marketing. Often the company doesn't share enough amongst its marketing team and with the global team. Also there is inefficiencies in J&J in regards to the manual processes such as approvals and invoicing which waste a lot of time and these repetitive tasks can actually be streamlined or outsourced. The company also lacked strong pipeline of innovative products so it couldn't stay competitive in market.
7286,Johnson & Johnson,"Good experience, but like high school on the inside",2012-02-07,3.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"- Great company
- Great pay and benefits
- Very intelligent and competent employees
- Promotes work-life balance and flexible work arrangements","- Lots of restructuring (i.e. layoffs) over the last few years
- Very ""cliquey"" inside... it's like high school or Survivor
- Difficult to get promotions within finance, except from a few specific roles
- Office locations are in the middle of nowhere (not great for single young professionals)
- Used to have the ""small company feel, big company impact"" that they preach so often, but due to all of the restructuring this is no longer the case. It's just like any other major corporation."
7287,Johnson & Johnson,Very stressful.,2012-02-02,3.0,,One of the best reasons to work for Johnson & Johnson is the benefits package and large pay scale that can be achieved with this company.,"The one downside of working for this company is the fact that they are so large you feel as if you're just a number. Also, the particular plant currently employed does not have their act together whatsoever."

7295,Johnson & Johnson,Not so great,2012-01-24,2.0,,It is a big company that has big company perks which include a pension and on site daycare.  Overall the benefits are a bit above average.,The company is always reorganizing and there is absolutely no security.
