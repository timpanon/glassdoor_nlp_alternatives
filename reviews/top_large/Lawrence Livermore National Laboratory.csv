They have a great benefit package for their full time employees, and typically, a decent annual raise if you perform well.","The learning curve is very steep in many groups and sometimes the experienced members within the group are dedicated to other priorities or might not have any knowledge/experience of the systems you're working on. So they tack on a lot of responsibility with minimal support.

The training can be somewhat disruptive, and though it is a safety based culture, the first month or two on the job will mostly consist of either sitting behind a computer (CBT) or in a classroom environment. Typical trainings have a yearly renewal cycle."

Everything is a pain that is disguised under government bureaucracy, but really it’s the people who sit on raw data that they don’t have the skills to work up for over a year, it’s the people who think that scheduling things the next day or a week in advance is too soon, it’s the people who say they are going to come in and get things done but don’t, it’s the severely outdated procedures and long lists of things to do to get simple tasks like off boarding done, that makes everything SUPER slow and SUPER frustrating. LLNL has a lack of people in the middle of their career for a good reason; there’s all the people who have been there forever and there’s a bunch of new talent that gets lost after a couple years… and there are very good reasons for that dynamic."

Salary increases are very low percentage and based on comparisons to other employees in your job classification, not based on employee performance.

100,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,A world class scientific institution with plenty of bureaucracy,2021-12-15,4.0,Scientist,"In high performance computing, lasers, high energy density physics, and energetic materials, LLNL is a world leader.  It is also a major contributor in many other scientific areas with leading experts and strong university collaborations.  

The work is generally interesting and engaging and funding has been reasonably stable, although this varies by division and program.   If you can develop a relationship with sponsors and programs this can provide the long term stability for ambitious research plans.

Work-life balance is good.  Salaries are ok, but the lab is slow to respond to rapidly changing market conditions.

The lab's approach to COVID-19 has been about as good as any institutions as the lab has tried to protect the workforce from both infection and the ever-changing directives from D.C.","LLNL is managed by a private company, but is tightly controlled by the funding agency NNSA.  This relationship has not always been healthy and this trickles down to infect the culture within the laboratory.  

In particular, the lab has a low-trust environment where the focus is on compliance and bureaucratic hurdles.  This has created a risk-averse culture.  The consequences for failure to achieve a milestone are high, so goals and scientific standards may be lowered to the point success can easily be claimed. 

Career and salary growth is limited.  Raises average 2-5% a year when outside the lab, comparable salaries may be growing at twice that rate.  This creates incentives to take management positions, which are few.  Management opportunities are rare and can be very competitive but selection criteria is vague and the ""friends and family plan"" is often suspected.  

Employees are often micromanaged and given little authority.  Instead of empowering employees, the labs management approach is a condescending lecture on leading by influence where the employee can be blamed if they cannot obtain management approval to acquire needed resources or build programs."

On the diversity and inclusion side, there is substantial representation of women in many key leadership position and up-and-down the hierarchy.","Internally funded program work proceeds at a breakneck pace. There's a certain amount of dissonance between needing to meet program milestones, which tend to involve very specific tasks that are important, but don't lend themselves to publishing, and the laboratory's desire that it's staff have a substantial scientific profile through publication and society visibility. The two things don't actually mix well, and lack of performance in the latter category can act as a substantial roadblock to promotion.

Also, the programmatic work has a very corporate feel, and the deadlines tend to be unforgiving. There seems to be a workaholic culture that is superficially discouraged but implicitly promoted."

143,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Best Job I've Ever Had,2021-08-31,5.0,Intelligence Analyst,"You're probably thinking all these reviews are skewed by 3 month interns and postdocs voluntold by their supervisors to give a review so please allow me to throw in perspective from someone whose done a few roles here from environmental engineering to national security research, from O&B to DTED to GS. This is the first place I've ever worked that I genuinely believe deserves a 5 star review. No one here will ever make you feel bad for using vacation or sick days. I never get calls to come in on weekends or stay late. Sure there are days where an extra effort is needed to get a project done but 60+hr work weeks are nonexistent here unless you personally want them to be. In over 6 years I have yet to meet anyone here who isn't intelligent, thoughtful, courteous, or helpful. Anyone will seriously stop whatever it is they're doing and go out of their way to help you with anything you need expecting nothing more than a smile and a thanks. I'm sure it probably exists somewhere around here but I have had zero experience with ladder climbing back stabbers. Leadership actually cares about your career goals and will help guide and get you there. If you get bored with what you're doing there's plenty of other departments to shift into. Having multiple career changes over your time here is not uncommon at all. If you feel like you want to give leadership a try just speak up and before you know it you're a team lead with training lined up to prepare you for being a supervisor. If you're feeling overwhelmed by being surrounded by PhDs and super scientists then by all means go get a masters or your own PhD, fully funded and $0 out of pocket if you do it right and listen to the educational assistance team. About 6 years ago when I was looking to apply at the lab I found a little YouTube video showing a day at the lab, following a newspaper clipping as it travels to different points through the LLNL campus. It goes through the main cafeteria and rides on a bike basket and you see some of the big experiments going on here. Its corny with stock cutesy music but its surprisingly accurate, adorable and made me want to work here. Look it up if you're thinking about applying or have an offer in hand but waiting on the basic background checks before you can start and it will give you a little smile. Not everyone is able to have their own office but there is a very anti-cubilcle, anti-open-office mentality and for the most part,no matter what your role is, you will be treated like an academic professional. I cant speak for everyone at the lab but for myself this is the most job security I've ever had outside of military service. There was a time back in the '08 nastiness where a lot of layoffs happened but all I can say is that when COVID first struck and companies laid off people to make ends meet, LLNL kept everyone fully paid on authorized leave (not counting against the normal accrued paid time off). No skipped paychecks, no lapse in benefits, nothing except the overarching message of stay home, stay safe, your job will be here when you get back. The work we do here though is what makes it all worthwhile. We don't kill ourselves trying to make stock holders happy by making cheaper faster widgets or cash sucking apps. The work we do is real scientific research and/or has direct impacts on national security. Most days I go home very proud of my accomplishments and the part I played in the great game. You most likely wont get rich working here. It's not all greener grass, there is stress and frustrations and you will have horrible days just like any other job. But, you will be home for diner. You won't have to sacrifice time with your family to advance your career. You will have time for your own hobbies and interests. You will be treated like a professional adult and your opinions and ideas will matter.","A long time ago a lab director working with a dwindling budget had the brilliant idea of saving money by cramming the worlds brightest minds into portable trailers as permanent office space. Sadly a lot of those trailers still exist. A lot of the real buildings are also sadly overdue for some major renovations. Recruiting or encouraging the worlds brightest to stay here can be a challenge when there's birds nests in the high bays or water damaged moldy ceiling tiles in the hallways. The previous and current lab director have thankfully taken notice and there is a grand plan for trailer removal and building construction. Its going to take a while and in the mean time it can be cramped quarters depending on where you're working. There is a plan and it is getting better. 
The bay area is expensive. If you're coming from out of state with an offer in hand and you say to yourself wow I cant believe they're going to pay me this much, please take a breath and actually do your research. I am extraordinarily well paid for what I do compared to my DC counterparts but just about every last cent gets snatched up by CA taxes and life. Rent/mortgage alone can easily eat up 60-70% of your paycheck leaving you with a one bedroom apartment and a futon if you're not careful. 
Things do move a lot slower in here compared to the rest of silicon valley. Don't come in expecting to shake the world with your edgy hoverboard startup business mentality. It's not entirely a bad thing however, and the government just wants you to check the right boxes on the grand checklist before you accidentally order a $100,000 piece of equipment. Make your case for what needs to get done and it will happen. Just learn to be patient with some things.
Getting a clearance (especially an SCI if needed) takes FOREVER. you will annoy your coworkers by having to be constantly escorted places or when they have to pause conversations and wait for you to leave. You will feel like a burden to everyone until the glorious day you get the email that your badge is in. Things are getting better and it doesn't take the multiple years it used to but still takes a significant amount of time to get a Q. Just do your time in the cooler and as long as you didn't lie on your security questionnaire you'll be fine. We all had to do it. Use the time to work on a degree or just be productive however you can. There's plenty of unclassified work to noodle on.
The benefits packages are all pretty good so this is mostly a dig at Kaiser. Kaiser is the primary option for lab folks and they are great if all you have to do is a check up once and while or the random broken bone to set. Good luck if you or anyone in your family has any chronic issues. They will give no end to excuses why everything is your fault, they cant help, and you should probably just die because it would make everything easier on everyone. That being said though I think that's pretty much every big insurance company in the US now and the premiums are actually very reasonable. I think I pay something like $170 a paycheck for full coverage for me and my family. Maybe a little more than that now but my point is overall its not a burden compared to what some other companies will make you pay."

The lab is managed in a smart way, PIs and leaders (all the way to the top) regularly communicate with employees. It feels like the perfect mix between a university and a big corporation (without the cons).

The Lab gives its employees the flexibility and the ability to carve out their own work and pursue work that interests them, provided that it is in support of the mission.","Very bureaucratic. Sometimes hard to get things going, especially if they are out of the norm."
256,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Great place to work - love that fitness opportunities on site and great salary,2021-03-03,5.0,Assurance Manager,Love that LLNL offers a fitness program onsite - this helps me stay active and healthy. Food onsite is a pro as well. I think the salaries are great - I came from the UC system and my salary doubled when I came to LLNL. Lots of opportunities to move around within LLNL so you keep your same benefits. And we were able to afford a house within Livermore so my commute is about 1 mile. I was also able to get a little bit of flexibility with my schedule just by asking and I think with COVID this will be even better offering more flexible hours onsite and at home.,"You don't get the perks you hear about at Google, Apple etc. and the pension is not as good as it used to be, plus no medical in retirement."

276,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,It's advisable to at least consider alternative options – there may be better choices for a higly qualified candidate,2021-02-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,They often do actual research and science on an acceptable to decent levels. Can publish some papers and interact with smart (but overworked and overly-stressed people).,"Software quality is generally sub par;
Administration is overwhelmed and inefficient;
Everything happens really slow;
Excessive bureaucracy;
Maladaptive environment;
You may or may not be provided with means (like a workstation or a laptop) to do your work. It's generally considered your problem and you may need to ask/beg and push people for that, even if you have the funding for that;
Overhiring postdocs, while funding is unstable, which makes it harder to obtain more stable positions. If you are willing to start a normal life sooner, you'd better look elsewhere;
Overwhelming daily life: while you have too many meetings, you need to find funding/projects, while fulfilling your regular job obligations and also writing proposals which take a lot of time and effort but have high uncertainty. While this is normal in research, this is exacerbated by the fact that a lot of funding opportunities may (or may not at all) receive answers right before the start of the new fiscal year. This forces people to scramble to find something to keep their salaries;
Neurotic environment;
Employer generally provides very little support. It may leave you feeling used and possibly thrown out;
It's government funded but everything is managed by a private company, which cares about its profits, liabilities, image, and extremely about its interests. You can be thrown under the bus easily;
There is a lot of words and you are presented with a niceish facade, but underneath it's much more rotten, mismanaged, and unstable;
They are mostly talk and no game. For example, if you plan to have children and build a family, you can find better benefits almost anywhere else. Childcare is extremely expensive, and you don't receive benefits above the minimal requirement by law;
Living in an expensive area (the Bay area), where there are higher-paid jobs available;
Office space is of a very low quality;
The lab is a place that cannot figure out how to properly set their AC and ventilation. You will get freezing air blowing at you all day in the winter and also would be willing to walk out in the sun in the summer to get some heat in your body and defrost;
Benefits are below industry standards;
High levels of narcissism and you need to be careful with people's egos;
It may happen, surprisingly often, that the work (code or paper) you worked on gets forbidden from publishing by the lab for no good reason (everything being completely open and only general science in the paper and probably even something already being public in your dissertation);
It's not a good place for foreign nationals. It is to be expected but also: while the lab has some special status and abilities to help foreigners with visas and green cards, they are quite reluctant. They would keep you as much as possible on the lower level of status, probably to reduce people's freedom in looking around for alternative jobs with better payment (once they have a green card and more opportunities open up)."

There is a certain pride in knowing that your work is not simply to make more widgets to sell to the masses.

There are many positions here that (still) allow you to make a livable wage in the San Francisco Bay Area--maybe not on the bay, but certainly within a ""reasonable"" commute. Home ownership for may be out of reach, but you can certainly still raise a family and save while living comfortably in a quiet neighborhood.

Contrary to what many have heard, you do not need a PhD to scrub the toilets. There are many positions here that are in support of the scientists to turn concepts into reality. These positions are competitive, when compared to the private sector, the Lab does pay market or higher.

Work-life balance is excellent, even for a large company. The same can be said for benefits. More importantly, if you have established yourself as someone that truly wants to learn, and have the capacity to do so, many of your colleagues and supervisors will be more than accommodating.","The primary negative aspect I have identified is the rate at which things happen at the Lab. Some of this is understandable--security sensitive positions need additional vetting. Other times, and more commonly so, it is simply complacency from long-standing employees that are simply not aware at how quickly business moves in this century. There is still a bit of a ""this is always how it's been done"" mentality--more pervasive in certain groups than in others.

Maybe the decor is in need of a change--there are still a handful of buildings and offices that could easily double for a movie set from the 1960's era.

Depending on which division you work, you may feel stifled in your progress. Someone with a start-up go-getter mentality can still flourish here, but not at the same rate as in the private sector."

It has a positive and open attitude towards new hires, development, innovation, diversity, and work/life balance. The work being done is fascinating and everyone works to make sure you feel part of a team. No matter what group/division you are in, there is always technical challenges to overcome (in a good way).","The lab is adverse to change, especially at the site-wide level. Some processes imposed at the lab are outdated and need to be revised, but management can be challenging to work with in this regard. There has been a shift to update to this decade, but it is a slow and challenging process. Nothing happens fast.

2. Ideal place for someone with a specific skill that is not present in the lab (and thus not seen as competition).","I enjoy learning. My passion for learning motivated my decision to earn a doctoral degree in physics. When I started my professional career as a postdoctoral staff member at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I soon realized that opportunities to learn at work were limited. In fact, I discovered that expressing my own opinions was often received with hostility. At the start of my professional career, I was not aware that I would experience a period of growing pains as an early career professional.

I was hired on as part of a succession planning initiative at the Lab. The individual who I was to work under was to retire within five years. I quickly learned that he had a traditional perspective on leadership and operated based on a command-and-control methodology. Any feedback I would provide was poorly received. Worse yet, my response was to comply. I lacked the communication skills to defend my position assertively and respectfully. I began to withdraw. Eventually depression immobilized me, and I needed to seek out professional help to stabilize my mental health. I had reached the limit of my capability to manage the situation effectively and needed new tools and skills to succeed. I was held back by my compliance. Luckily, my passion for learning motivated me to seeking training in project management and communication. These courses have helped me realize my fear of conflict and the need to manage this fear so I may advance in my career. 

Recently the lab conducted a culture survey and acknowledges above average levels of aggressive and passive aggressive behaviors. The lab is seeking ways to address it's cultural shortcomings."

367,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Great place to work,2020-09-20,4.0,Electronics Technologist,There is a big variety in the work that you get to do.,The work can be extremely slow.
368,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Not Impressed,2020-09-20,2.0,Engineering,"Pay and benefits are reasonable for the area. Although cost of living in the Bay Area is insane relative to the rest of the country, it gets slightly better and more affordable the more inland you go. You have to live east of Livermore (less desirable) but you can survive in the area if you are coming from out of state and looking to buy a home.

Lab will typically assist very nicely with relocation pay, benefits, etc., at least for salaried positions. Also, the lab (at least my specific work group) was pretty good about supporting training opportunities as long as they were relevant to your job.

If you live in Livermore or the nearby cities, your commute isn't bad and accessibility to the mountains is a plus (3 hours to Yosemite/Lake Tahoe, etc.). BART in Dublin will take you into SF in a little over an hour.

While I did not work in R&D, the lab truly works on unique and interesting projects (NIF, dark matter, etc.).","Safety Culture seemed very lax relative to the nuclear industry and other high hazard workplaces. 

Examples: signs everywhere ""requiring"" the use of helmets when riding bicycles, yet probably 80% of riders do not/refuse to wear one. Paging systems in facilities were used for the most mundane and non-emergency/critical reasons. There are times where you might hear a page every 5 minutes, if not more often, and 99% of the time it was simply someone wanting someone else to call them. This results in so much background noise that you tune out pages and will not pay attention to the ones that actually matter. Essentially no practical/hands-on training required for access to radiological areas, which is insane. The list goes on.

Current Lab Director has some of the worst public speaking skills I have ever seen for someone at such a high level position. I could not watch hardly any of his talks or videos unless his words were prepared due to his consistent stammering and ""ums"" and ""ahs"" every 3 seconds. It truly amazed me someone can get to that position without being able to string together a complete, coherent sentence without fumbling about with their words.

So many people in my work area would constantly complain about California, politics, etc. Quit your job and move elsewhere if these things bother you so much, but the constant complaining is useless and spreads negativity. 

Silly social media style internal website results in ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" wars on postings, arguments and drama created within said posts, and the lab having to remove commenting half of the time. It is literally Facebook for lab employees, and it is pretty toxic and unproductive (like the real thing).

Finally, and this is not a con for the Lab,  however, traffic and quality of life in the surrounding Bay Area is terrible. For ""affordable"" housing you have to look east of Livermore and into the central valley area, which is much less desirable than the Bay (much hotter, horrible commute, crime is pretty bad, etc.)."

All this process is understandable, worth the wait."
387,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,I've chosen to stay for decades in spite of many career opportunities elsewhere.,2020-07-31,5.0,Scientist,"I started at Livermore in 1999 expecting to be here for a few years, complete a post-doc, and then move elsewhere. Although great career opportunities have arisen at other institutions, I've repeatedly concluded that the grass is greener on THIS (the LLNL) side of the fence. I love working here for the scientific research that can make a difference for our nation, for the collaboration with the colleagues, and for vast capabilities and opportunities within the laboratory! I also appreciate our rigorous scientific culture, where we are challenged to be the best, and our contributions are valued. I feel that over the past two decades, although a large campus, the institution values my contribution and has invested in me in various ways, including sending me back for additional post-graduate education (even though I already had a PhD) to help me in my job assignments. Now that my managerial responsibilities are increasing, I hope to maintain these values with the next generation!
Great weather (although a bit warmer inland here in the summer than towns closer to the coast), Livermore is a relatively uncrowded suburb on the eastern edge of the San Francisco Bay Area.","At the outskirts of the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley, cost-of-living is relatively high; although we probably get a bit of a salary bump compared to other national laboratories, the extra in most cases does not quite account for how expensive it is here, especially in a hot economy.
Along with being rigorously scientific, unfortunately, we can be rigorously governmentally bureaucratic as well. Patience is not only a virtue, but a necessary skill at LLNL. Conversely (may I list a ""pro"" in the ""con"" section?) being careful and pedantic about, for example, safety and hiring, means that we have a solid safety culture and we have thoroughly vetted the talent that lands here at LLNL. Productive, collaborative, scientifically sound employees that start here generally seem to have long and fruitful careers rather than experiencing the revolving door of the tech industry at large.
Also, this is TOTALLY my opinion only, and depends on federal funding cycles, but we've had quite the hiring spree over the last few years... and we're probably a bit past the apex... LLNL highly values expertise and experience as well, so new hires might encounter over the next several years being in what have been typically though of more junior positions (i.e. post-doc-like, early-career staff, and entry-level engineering) for a longer duration than what many have experienced in the past..."

They did, and I'm so proud to work for this company that not only has an incredible mission, but that truly cares about it's employees. I will most definitely want to work here until I retire and I have 15 more years to go!","They did not allow a lot of folks or hourly employees to work from home until the shelter in place orders came into effect. A little behind in the times for a company to still believe that you must be there to be productive.

402,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Great Working Environment,2020-07-02,5.0,Postdoctoral Fellow,"I have been at the Lab for a year now and I have been routinely surprised by how willing my co-workers and mentors have been to support me and my colleagues in both our immediate work and in our future career development. I have not yet been turned away from a request for a conversation, or been told that someone was too busy to meet. As an example of this collaborative, team-oriented environment, I was working on a non-essential clean room tool that wasn't working and asked for some help from the person working near me. After he couldn't fix it, he asked another colleague and within 15 minutes there was a team of 5 scientists, most of whom I had never met, who dropped everything to help try and fix the problem. I am positive each of their work was much more critical than fixing the tool, yet the ethos of the Lab permeates even these small aspects of the culture.","There are a lot of administrative hoops to jump through, particularly in the name of safety, security, and budgeting. On at least one occasion I've though that a particular set of rules to promote safety were so cumbersome that they incentivized less safe workarounds. Specifically, the training to deal with chemical waste (essentially a rubber stamp on how to fill out forms) took place only every other month and, due to repeated schedule conflicts, I could only take it 8 months after arriving. The stopgap was to either 1. ask a colleague to help dispose of the chemical waste for me, or 2. store the waste as an ""active"" chemical until I was approved to properly dispose of it, even though I had been working with comparable benign chemicals for over 5 years prior to joining the Lab."

The lab is so big I sometimes feel like a kid in a candy store browsing for different opportunities in areas I never would have a chance to explore otherwise. While there are huge projects like NIF, there are hundreds of small 2 to 6 person projects which is really a sweet spot for group creativity and individual freedom.

Work life balance is great for the most part, but the demands of the job are heavily influenced by what project you happen to be working on and there can be ""crunch"" times due to deadlines. However I don't see anyway around this and if you don't fit with the project and/or people you are working with you can easily change projects and have a whole new experience without ever leaving the lab.","Ridiculous rules and restrictions passed down from high level federal government. Even though it is 100% legal in California (and sold in stores down the street,) cannabis will get you immediately fired with out wiggle room for the lab to do anything about it. Also depending on what building/area you're in you may not be able to bring in your personal cell phone. The lab tries to push back on these laws sent down from on high but usually fails. Both of these restrictions really hurt hiring top young talent. It boils down to the fact that you could literally be on the verge of curing cancer but you'd get fired for eating a product containing cannabis (even by accident!)"

In addition to the amazing research in many areas and the commitment to our country, the Lab values it's people and provides the ability to balance your work and your personal life. They not only provide benefits that have given me flexibility over the years, but they have many diverse programs, groups, talks, exercise classes, and the list goes on. Working at the Lab is like having an extended family. People genuinely care about each other...perhaps because we have a common goal and value our country. Safety is a priority and it's not just talk. People genuinely look after each other. There are also two sites. The Livermore Site which is commonly known and Site 300 which is remotely located just outside of Tracy.","I am not a fan of the commute, but it's much less of a commute than most people are traveling these days so that is a matter of perspective.

410,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,A good place for a meaningful career,2020-07-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"First, I like knowing that what I'm doing matters. My particular work might not be all lasers and supercomputers, but knowing that what we do at the Lab matters makes what I do feel worthwhile.

I feel that the lab values me as an employee. 

Management is flexible and interested in working with employees. I'm not expected to be at the top of my game all the time; management understands that people have heath issues and family to take care of, and this is reflected both in policy and in management's behavior.

As a policy, the lab encourages personal and career growth. I've specialized in a very specific branch of software development; I feel secure in the knowledge that if the lab moves on to the Next Great Thing, I'll get the training and support I need to make that leap.

Employee groups are friendly and welcoming, with active members. Community outreach is encouraged, and if you need time then management will make that happen, too.

Repeatedly, I've felt like the lab sees me less as a means to an end and more like an investment.","Some facilities are aging, and that can show in some buildings. There's a lot of new construction going on, and (more importantly) old buildings are being replaced. I'm happy that this is being rectified, but it's going to take time."

Of the laboratories that I have worked at or collaborated with in the last decade, LLNL is by far the most intellectually stimulating. Proximity with Silicon Valley high-tech industry is key. Work-life balance is taken seriously, encouraged and integral part of the organization's values; not just something that management says because it sounds good.","Working at a facility affiliated with the federal government always comes with much bureaucracy and lots of training for everything.

This is a world-class institution and my colleagues and I regularly rub shoulders (inside the Lab and outside) with the world's leading people in any number of fields. You can reinvent yourself every few years, diving into new projects, new technical areas, working with new teams of colleagues. You can grow your capabilities in many directions. How much can you handle? :)","This is a large and complicated institution, and understanding how and where you fit can take a long time. Getting to feel like you know the place and are a valuable part of it might take a few years. Being a government lab it is subject to strong, volatile and irrational political winds from the top, which can be disheartening. And of course, the bureaucracy takes getting used to. If you get hung up on trying to make sense of it, you'll only be frustrated.

Management understands that employees are their most valuable resource.  

Ability to change jobs within the lab once you're in.  

Most people are easy to work with and genuinely want to be helpful.  

Reverse commute if you are magically able to afford to live in one of the major cities.  

They've done a really good job taking care of employees during the COVID shut downs.","Low pay relative to Bay Area Tech unless you're a PhD they really want or you are related to/buddies with management.  

Way more nepotism/good ole' boys (and girls) club than I expected.  I have definitely run into people in positions they shouldn't be in or positions that provide very little value and don't need to exist.  

You'll probably never get much more than the standard pay raise regardless of how you perform.  You will probably also never receive a legitimate performance review.  Most managers are technical scientists/engineers who were promoted to manage people while keeping their other job(s) and aren't proficient leaders.  

Benefits are standard-ish for new hires (actually less than what I've had at other companies).  The lab used to be run (owned?) by the UC system that had a sweet-heart pension that older employees were grandfathered into.  It's now operated by a private company that bids for the contract.  

I don't believe management understands younger employees' situations in regards to recruitment/retention.

Intensive onboarding process

Strong talent pool. LLNL seems to have a larger pool of eager applicants to select from giving them  the ability to not just take anybody with a pulse and the ability to fill out an application.

Casual, and even fun, working environment most of the time. Huge variety of work and challenges, both on the scientific and the operational side of things. Very satisfying to work somewhere that truly focuses on important missions as opposed to latest quarterly earnings.","Lots of bureaucracy and resistance to change. Lots of employees have been here 20 or 30+ years, so you hear a lot of ""but we've always done it this way,"" and ""it was better back when. . ."" But from what I can tell, some of that is starting to change - slowly, but it's changing."

A very hospitable and genuine management within the OCFO.  The benefits exceed silicon valley: the work/life balance is great, healthcare package, they don't burn you out chasing that profit margin, competitive pay, etc...",The security clearances/background checks keep your life a open book....but it's understandable when you work for a national laboratory.

If you love R&D activities on high tech activities, this is the place to be. Upgrading facilities and infrastructure create a great working environment. Management encourages innovation. There are lots of opportunities for growth as there is a large percentage of the workforce that will soon be retiring.","One of the drawbacks at time is all the red tape involved in government sponsored work, but in the end you can work through it. The only other issue is the location being in an expensive area to live, and most people have to commute through the CA traffic, but it is California."

As a software engineer, you won't have deadlines or stress.","There is a giant gap between older employees and younger employees at the lab. Something like 50% of the lab is hitting retirement age in the next 10 years. To prepare for this, the lab is hiring a lot of new grads ahead of time. However, all of management consists of the older employees. Very biased. 

Not pay for performance AT ALL. The lab says it's salaries are merit based. In reality, everyone receives somewhere between a 3% and 4.5% raise every year and your raise depends on a million other factors that have nothing to do with your performance."
555,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Great Career for a Scientist,2019-05-30,4.0,Staff Scientist,"It is a pleasure to be a part of something so important as advancing science and technology for national security purposes. The work is extremely challenging and has the goal of maintaining the safety of our country. There is a lot of room for a person to grow to their own natural intellectual and productivity ceiling. If one can demonstrate flexibility to learn quickly and work on a different things, then the management can help align your work with your interests. The salary and 401k benefits are higher than average for the region--for 401k they give 3.5% plus match up to 6% of your contributions. The work conducted at this facility is truly at the leading edge of science and technology and some of the brightest minds in the country work here. 

There is flexibility to set your own schedule, which is one of the most important perks a company can offer a professional.","They are quite limited in what medical and dental plans they offer, though I do need to add that for the most part I am satisfied with my plans. My primary concern is that my child needs braces and I will pay for a large amount of it out of pocket because there is only one PPO dental plan offered and it has a low annual maximum. The good medical plans are quite expensive; it seems like I shouldn't have to pay several hundred dollars per month for decent healthcare through a group health plan.

As a scientist, my biggest issue with working at this facility is that I am frequently required to do someone else's job before my own scientific work can be completed. There are huge overheads that go to pay administrative and human resources staff, but some tasks will go undone. As the ones responsible for the work getting accomplished, the scientists are often responsible for bridging these gaps to complete tasks that others are already paid to do. This occurs on the order of a few hours per week.

For parental leave, the laboratory does not do anything outside of what is required of them by the state. Some of the competing technology companies in the area offer much better leave packages."

I grew up in the SF Bay Area, but I've traveled all over the world (mostly for my job at LLNL), and there are few places that rival the combination of natural beauty, mild climate, and societal diversity of the Bay Area. The compensation and benefits are good, and the employment environment has been very stable, even through major fluctuations in priorities in Washington.

Told I'd be promoted far too many times, by managers who seemingly lied because I've been stagnate in the same classification for 20 years.    I've begun to believe my dedication has not been worth the sacrifices made.  In the beginning I felt a sense of pride working here, now I have come to the conclusion that I would have been better off working in my home town for less money, because the balance between time away from home and compensation is far lacking.

Safety is another key plus. It is taken extremely seriously here. You will never be asked to do something unsafe to get a job done on time.","One of the very few cons is that things happen slowly at the lab. Sometimes that's by design, but sometimes it's because of the red tape. When you learn to sit back a bit and enjoy the slower pace, it does become a bit less frustrating."

629,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,A place where you can do awesome work *and* have a life outside of work,2018-09-20,5.0,Computer Scientist,"I'm a bit over a decade into my career here at LLNL. During that decade+, I've been able to work on a wide variety of things from computer hardware, to software development, to team leadership. My colleagues are generally excellent: they work hard, their egos are non-existent, they're interested in building great stuff as a team, and they're as willing to learn as they are to teach.

I get to work on projects that push the frontier of high performance computing. The fact that some of the world's most powerful supercomputers are just downstairs from my office is simply amazing. That I get to help, in my own small way, push that frontier forward is the opportunity of a lifetime.

And, not only do we push the art of supercomputers forward, but there's tons of amazing, world-altering science and engineering occurring here at LLNL. The Lab's catchphrase is ""science in the national interest."" And it's true! When I think about all the world-class scientific discoveries which I indirectly support, I'm consistently blown away. I love my iPhone, but the work to help create the next-generation smartphone pales in comparison to all the scientific discoveries and breakthroughs occurring here at LLNL.

As wonderful as the work atmosphere is, I'm also able to have a great non-work life. I'm able to be home each evening to have dinner with my wife and kids. My weekends are family time, not extra work time. Schedule flexibility is pervasive (for example, the AWS schedule that gives me every-other Friday off is quite nice). And I can afford to live in the same town where I work: there's no soul-crushing commute wherein it takes me 35 minutes to move 10 miles on a jammed freeway.","Cons — doesn't every organization have them? The Lab is a large organization. Sometimes the gears of progress grind more slowly than they should in surprising places. For example, it takes a looooong time to get a new computer for your office.

Being that this is a quasi-governmental organization, there are various restrictions in place that you might not experience out in private industry. There are no stock options, no exceptional account-busting bonuses, no compensation for volunteer work, no kegs with fresh beer at the end of the hallway, or other types of perks that you might expect at a Google, Apple, or other typical Silicon Valley enterprises. But, the fact that I get to see my family at a reasonable time at the end of every day more than makes up for the lack.

Another con is that Silicon Valley is close by; the companies there love to poach Lab employees. This can be difficult. It's hard to see a steady stream of my fellow colleagues get enticed by the large salaries, free lunches and dinners, in-building massages, and other Silicon Valley enticements."
630,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Making the World a Better Place,2018-09-20,5.0,LLNL SQA Manager,"Some of the brightest minds in the world work here, doing their part to make the world a better, safer place.  They are also some of the nicest people I've ever met, and I get to be a part.  Sometimes work can get boring or overwhelming - like anywhere else - but even in those moments, it is good knowing I am doing something worthwhile for others, not just company profits.","Sometimes things move slower than we like, and high security means we can't just do whatever we like, but the restrictions are reasonable and the Lab works hard to make them not onerous."
631,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Great place to work,2018-09-20,5.0,Software Developer,"Surrounded by smart, capable and hardworking people.  Amazing world class science and world changing missions.  Really good benefits with various forms of insurance and 401K match.  Changing career directions is very easy, I started as an IT support person, worked through a lab-sponsored bachelor’s degree (that part was not easy, work and school) and then changed jobs to become a software developer.  There are multiple directorates that are effectively their own company, so moving between groups within the lab is easy and benefits do not change but it feels like you just got a fresh new job with a new group.  Amazing amount of lunchtime groups you can join, I alternate between Yoga and Martial arts, but there are dozens of others (archery, photography, meditation, disk golf, organic gardening, the list is long).","Clearance process is onerous and time to completion is totally unpredictable. Took about a year for my clearance to come through. It only takes some people a couple months, and others it can take years.  My job had lots of unclassified work I could do while waiting but some jobs don’t; I know a couple people who left the lab because they felt completely useless while waiting.

Dependence on government funding means that congress' mood and presidential policy can deeply affects your raises and job security."

633,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Excellent Work-life balance,2018-09-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Good work life balance: better than most places, but could still be a little better
- 15 vacation days a year
- Low people Politics, no backstabbing.
- People generally try to help each other
- Both Senior and Junior Management are very approachable and open to input, 
- Management makes a lot of effort to hear, gather and value your feedback.  
- The Site Director (CEO) even has brown bags with rank and file employees to hear feedback!
- Management is attentive to our needs and gives us everything we need to do our jobs
- It's a Better location relative to other bay area companies.  But, even here, housing is still 500$/sq foot!  So any location outside of CA will be much better
- Salaries are roughly equivalent to other companies in the area.
- Excellent 401K
- Everyone gets an office of their own, wow!  And an office phone of your own.
- Beautiful campus with a lake, benches, trees and wildlife, sometimes even right outside your office!  Geese and rabbits too!
- Free filtered water in some buildings, free faucet water in others
- Some people can stay here for very long periods 10+ years or even 50+ years!  This place will be loyal to you, if you stick with them for a very long time and earn it.
- Medical insurance is not too bad.
- Lots of interesting talks to go to, if you like that sort of thing
- Yearly 5K run event for HOME.
- Depending on the group your in, SE may face less beurocracy than a full software company (less code reviews and meaningless check-in processes).  This leads to greater development efficiency.
- about once per quarter there's an ice cream social or something like that.
- Super easy parking on base
- Bicycles and taxi service available to get around on base.
- Great equipment: software engineers get 2 monitors and a laptop
- Occassional free lunches once per month for new members via the NEIT group
- Free yearly biometric reports: blood pressure, blood work, etc
- Hackathons once per quarter, have free coffee, snacks and Pizza
- Full time ergonomist will come by and make sure you have a good chair and computer setup
- Excellent wifi and internet connection, nice and quiet work environment
- Smart and knowledgable coworkers
- Research oriented software has requirements that are more flexible
- Low number of users for your software which helps decrease stress
- Leads and managers often bring in donuts and bagels for everyone, paid for with their own cash.
- Due to ""need to know"" policy, there is Below average overcommunication, not too many meetings.","- Bay Area has huge Housing problems that can't be fixed.  You better think long and hard before you decide to move to the bay area or anywhere in CA for that matter!
- Lots of substandard tools used: Outlook, Jabber, Bamboo, etc.  Jabber has a terrible UI, has bugs, won't let you paste output into the chat, etc.  Bamboo is particularly painful.  These tools often fail and are a pain to use.  You can't change away from any of these tools because it's all they will allow.  However, for tools like IDEs and things that can run on your own computer, you may choose the very best tools.  They don't like any hosted tools in the cloud: Gmail, Google docs, etc.
- Security sometimes used as an excuse for Technical debt and substandard software development practices (this will vary from group to group, of course).  Security concerns often negatively impact productivity.
- Paranoia is rampant
- Extreme security practices mean you'll need to type your password in at least 20 times per day(i'm not exaggerating) and it can NOT be automated.
- need to change your passwords often and it's almost always a huge pain
- You will spend a lot of time doing extra work due to security concerns and overcoming obstacles related to security
- For research done at the lab there's 240% funding overhead!  that doesn't include all the security obstacles any researchers must overcome.
- Funding/Work can dry up and you might need to find other groups to join in order to keep your job.  So, Long term stability doesn't seem to be option for everyone
- Early work stability (first 5 years) aren't nearly as stable as I thought.
- You may need to work on several projects at once because there's not enough funding for you to be on just 1 project.
- Things are always changing: tech stacks and technologies
- Enormous variety of technologies used: every team uses a completely different tech stack, which makes it much harder to ramp up, if you're going to another team
- Getting a clearance can take 3+ years.  You will spend dozens of hours completing this paper work.
- Administrative training: LTRAIN, a couple dozen hours every year
- Stack Ranking.  This sucks because it stresses everyone out and puts a lot of pressure on people.  Although, I believe it's not nearly as bad as most other places that do this because you don't get laid off for being at the bottom
- Performance review is much more stressful than it needs to be.
- Although the pace is relatively slow, the workload can still be high because you get placed on multiple projects at once.
- The local cafeteria on base has very short hours: lunch is only open for about 60 minutes or less.  You need to be really on time, if you want to eat.  Sodeka the cafeteria provider has an exclusive license with LLNL which means they can't add more variety.
- You will need to be very careful about your driving.  Getting a speeding ticket can get you in trouble at work.
- Gotta protect your badge.  Loosing your badge can get you in big trouble.
- No onsite pictures and no usage of any camera functionality on your phone on base, no pokemon go, no facial recognition login.
- Disruptive building speakers: lots of frivolous chatter about testing.  Sometimes this can happen 2-5 times within a few days, then there might not be any tests for many weeks.  Almost seems like trolling.
- Since all the services are hosted locally, they can be unreliable.  
- Old computer with a broken microphone
- minor: like most places, the printers and projectors sometimes dont work."

Work here is easy going and *most people are friendly and congenial - not all stressed out. There's also a lot of smart and interesting people - geeks, nerds, engineers, scientists, artists, you name it. Very diverse.

Dress is very casual, as casual as one can be without being ""sloppy.""

Vacations and sick leave come easy; benefits are cheap and comprehensive.  No one expects you to work on holidays or when you're taking time off for whatever reason.

Job duties are very clear, methodically laid out, and there's plenty of time to complete tasks.

There are many groups here and opportunities to explore other kinds of work.","I come from the insane profit-driven, high-tech corporate world where ""urgent"" means urgent and everything is a 24x7 / 365 emergency. I get here to the Lab and find I've hopped from a speedboat to a tugboat. Here, it's procedure and policy *before results. Results are good, but you need to follow protocol to get there no matter how long it takes. 

That said, getting things done can drive a person up the wall because of delays. Management here works in terms of weeks, months and quarters, rather than hours and days. To get tasks fully completed requires layers and layers of reviews and approvals. Don't wait on anything with bated breath.

Honestly, if this were my first job out of college, it would ruin me. I'd never be able to go from here to the crazy world I came from and keep up. In another couple years I will have fully acclimated and then I can give a 5-star rating.  :)"

Also, Job descriptions are often vague and don't always reflect the composition of the interview panel or their expectations for a particular role.

Cafeterias are inferior to the Argonne cafeteria (but is much better than LANL's).

Having worked in industry and at LLNL, I can say the culture at LLNL is more likely to make you feel good about your work and those you work with. People tend to work here for life, but never get bored. That is because there is an emphasis on learning new skills and on education. It is also because employees are not pigeon holed into using just a small part of their skill set like in industry.

I feel used and underappreciated for the amount of work I contribute. It is not fair to be breaking my back and stressed over completing other people's jobs for positions that are waiting to be filled while not being compensated at that level or receiving any benefits whatsoever -
 just because I'm only an ""intern"".  I always go above and beyond in every task I'm doing, not just to make a good impression, but because I actually care about what I am doing, however I guess it does not matter much to anyone at all.

The Lab, especially the organization I work in loves an antiquated ways of doing things and you cannot really question why, it's just the way things are done.  What is the point of compiling  statistics when they aren't put to use to improve processes? You would think that the Lab would be more welcoming of innovative ideas, but as the lowest rung on the ladder who sees how things are done firsthand, you don't really have a voice. That is pretty frustrating when you see areas where things can be improved, but you can't do anything about it. 

Also, a definite lack of diversity compared to the rest of the Bay Area -  I don't think they emphasize or even discuss diversity and inclusion much at all (except  on the Newsline), which is really important for workplace morale to have an inclusive environment."

Everyone gets along with everyone in the group and all strive to achieve minimum downtime and shortest possible return to full operation of the systems we monitor and maintain. The systems we maintain are constantly changing, as older systems are retired and new systems are installed. This requires all members of the group to stay on top of things and the group facilitates this by providing training about our ever changing work environment.  The shift leaders go out of their way to support the employees that work on their shifts by being advocates for their team members to upper management. Upper management really appreciates the job that we do and the group and many members of the group have received recognition for their efforts in various ways - cash bonuses, certificates of recognition and the like. All in all it is a very wonderful place to work, in spite of all the challenges we have to meet on a daily basis.","Some of the support staff, especially in the area of technical support, have no clue as to the extent we have to be able to bring up monitoring tools.

I've found that LLNL provides many different employment opportunities and many mentors willing to help you navigate the nuances of the work place. I've been able to participate in the affinity groups and many outreach programs that LLNL advocates this has enriched my career immensely and has provided me with at network of co-workers and friends. I have found LLNL to be pro-family and have worked with me on many seasons of my life to ensure I have a good work-life balance.,"I have been fortunate to have excellent supervisors and mentors for a majority of my career. However, there could be more leadership training and supervisory standards to ensure there is equity across the laboratory."
710,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Work/life balance and the biggest computers,2017-10-19,4.0,Computer Scientist,"If you want to work on multi-disciplinary scientific problems of national importance, there's no place better. The world's most powerful computers are sited here and we are constantly challenged to apply that raw power in meaningful ways. There is always something new to research or simulate. You can work a 9-5 schedule, or put in lots of overtime and get rewarded proportionally. People tend to have long careers, so there is a willingness to invest in training. You can move around to many various areas or stay in one place, both are acceptable. There is no salary negotiation, since the annual review process tries to be fair to everyone. Promotion is almost always from within. For many of these above reasons there are more women, even in management, in technical roles than comparable private-sector employers. (Not that there are huge numbers of women, but, for instance, I once had a female direct supervisor and the three levels above her.) Health insurance is excellent and affordable. Since it's located further out than the most expensive parts of the Bay Area, it's possible to buy a home in town. Lots of people bike to work.","The wait for clearances is routinely 18 months or more (The Washington Post says an average of over 15 months, don't know where the management is getting this 12-13 number). However, LLNL has no control over (or visibility into) that process. Many areas of basic science, such as lasers, seismology, computer science, etc. have some connection to nuclear weapons work, if you find that objectionable. Salaries are lower on an absolute basis than the private sector, though the per-hour rate, especially if you factor in commuting and benefits, is competitive. No stock options, obviously. Because of the weird management structure, we get most of the restrictions of being federal employees with few of the benefits of being, technically, private sector contractors. So no federal GS steps or cost of living adjustments, but also no pension or TSP (thrift savings plan). Getting hired in the first place is difficult unless you have very high-level technical skills or know someone involved in the hiring process, you must be a U.S. citizen for most jobs. There is a fair amount of training, not nearly as much red tape as I expected at the level of individual employees. Once you get into management, it is pretty bad. There are 250 separate Department of Energy policies, orders, and mandates that LLNL must adhere to, and all of it is subject to auditing for compliance. It took me hours and hours of work, and probably a solid week from my administrative staff, just to get one off-site collaborator approved for computer access. And then it has to be renewed (somewhat less work) every year. If you just want to write code or do science, the burden is minimal. There is lots of LLNL-specific jargon."

-post-docs also have a Post-Doc association which is awesome so you can meet other post-docs around the lab and not just the ones in your specific field","-the lab is trying to do a better job at expanding their diversity. 

-It seems that the Engineering Recruitment team is selective in which university career fairs they choose to attend because they know what schools they want to hire from and which ones they don't.

They will travel far distances to look for talent, yet choose to forget there is also talent closer to home. I guess those schools aren't ""good enough."" 
It is a shame because those students also want the same opportunity to be at the lab. Who wouldn't? It's a cool place to work."

The lab cares about its people and continually tries aims to provide the flexibility for a meaningful work-life balance and a healthy lifestyle.

As an early career employee, it is quite inspiring to know that everyone is a part of the bigger mission towards national security, no matter their position. 

There is a culture shift in progress due to the large quantity of employees heading for retirement and anticipation for an influx of new hires on the horizon. Exciting times ahead!

The alternative work schedule (AWS) is amazing. You can either work 9 (9/80) or 10 (4/10) hrs.  per day in order to receive a day off work. This is ideal for anyone who needs to schedule any appointments or enjoy a long weekend. This option definitely boots morale and the same amount of work is accomplished per week - win-win! However, this is permitted in some areas and not in others based on their work assignments - be sure to ask if its an option during the interview.

With a company this large, you can always find your next passionate role due the wide range of projects and divisions available. If you ever feel stifled within your current role, there are so many opportunities to develop your career. There are many 'matrix' employees who reside within one organization but are matrixed to another organization on a per project basis. There are handful of new postings each day due to the outflux of retirees so keep your eyes open.","Coming from a high paced, external company and joining a government-affiliated company, it was a culture shift! My day-to-day slowed way down due to the variety of processes which felt unproductive at first. It took me about 6 months to adjust to the speed difference. However, I am sure that some areas were quicker and faster than others so this is just my perspective.

With the 'Pro' culture shift that I mentioned above, there is a con of some resistance and uncertainty. Culture changes tend to make people nervous but ultimately we can work through that. If someone asks 'why', some folks don't remember 'why' and that to me is a prime moment for process improvement.

Like anywhere, there are GREAT managers and then there are the managers who were never taught. During interviews, I strongly recommend you ask questions about their management style to make sure you will receive the support you need."

They haven't caught up on things like telecommuting. Housing prices in the Bay Area are SO high. Most people have significant commutes in bad traffic, which could be somewhat alleviated with a reasonable telecommuting policy. But for the most part, it isn't permitted.

Salaries have not kept up with industry in the tech fields. Housing costs here are so high, even with a lab salary you could be easily outpriced. 

Benefits used to be much better. For anyone coming in now, the pension is long gone (though the 401k and match is very generous). Health benefits are pricier and not as good as what is often offered out in industry. And your yearly raise, if you get one at all, could be easily wiped out by that year's health insurance cost increases. Downside of working somewhere where the average age is so high.

There are a lot of retirements. Big brain-drain. The lab cannot (or will not, sometimes hard to tell) hire fast enough to take advantage of the knowledge of those leaving. The hemorrhage of talent between retirements and turnover in tech  positions (commutes and comparatively low salaries are big contributors here) is painful. Those that are left end up doing more and more, resulting in burnout and then more departures. 

Inflexible policies. Flex time? Good luck with that. Tele-Commute? Funny (see above). Need some time off? Hope you have the vacation time accumulated (and you can track down all of your bosses to approve it), or you can take leave for an approved reason. Good luck finding someone who can help you figure that out. You really want to avoid working with the Benefits or HR department, if you can help it. 

They have great programs as far as health, working out, specialty classes. Good luck getting the time to participate, especially if you have a family and a commute (constrained time). And the latter two are not free. 

Job stability isn't what it once was. Overhead costs are so high that it's harder for projects to hire as many people as they really need, and money is often unstable. 

You CAN go find another project when you want to, but most don't make it easy to do. Projects get very insulating, it's hard to find out what else is out there. 

Frequent reorganizations that don't actually ever seem to improve anything."

The lab pays very well and you get great benefits even as an intern.,I am a young woman and I often felt very uncomfortable with the men I came into contact with. There were several men that worked in my building that were at least twice my age that would stop by my office even though they were not in my group. I never got any direct solicitation but the way the looked at me and the things they asked me made me extremely uneasy. Several would ask if I had a boyfriend or about my personal life and I don't think that is very appropriate. I also experienced this in the cafeterias and eventually stopped eating there because the older men made me so uncomfortable.

As a business professional it's amazing to be able to support R&D in the national interest and work with so many brilliant scientist and engineers.

785,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,More like industry than academia,2017-01-24,3.0,Postdoctoral Fellow,"Salary for postdocs is much higher (double) than academic postdoc salaries. 

Work-life balance-- with a few exceptions, most people work regular hours and don't work on weekends and evenings (unless they want to).

There are several internal recognition programs, and people seem to be given recognition for contributions. Most folks here seem genuinely happy to see others at the lab succeed and win awards.

There is a large internal funding program, where postdocs have the opportunity to be PIs. This program is supposed to be free of politics so that new ideas and investigators are given a chance, but in my experience this isn't always the case.","Since the lab was privatized, it seems to run more like a company than a university, which was a disappointment to me as I was looking for more freedom in my research. There is a billable hours system, which constrains the amount of time you can spend on different projects.

Although it's now some kind of weird government- private company hybrid, they do get a lot of federal funding, so there are no freebies (company swag, food, car washes, childcare services, gym, etc.) like you would receive at many other Bay Area employers. 

There is a LOT of bureaucracy. Sometimes I feel like I spend more time figuring out the protocols and rules for how to do something than I spend actually doing science. Safety classes are burdensome and being in compliance with the many safety checks and protocols is a significant time sink. Some administrative folks seem to relish wasting the time of scientists in order to CY(their)A.

In my experience, human resources was not only not helpful, but actually confused me about the benefits available to me. I had to do my own research on the benefits that I was eligible for and figure things out for myself.

For new hires, the clearance process has become a significant burden. My security clearance application has been submitted for over a year and I haven't been contacted to begin the process for the investigation. Given that others have waited at least 6-9 months after their process begins before receiving a clearance, it seems unlikely that I would receive mine by my 2 year anniversary with LLNL. Without a clearance, you are fairly limited in what types of projects you will be able to work on.



Food options are very limited. The cafeteria serves mainly salads and burgers, with few ethnic choices available, and is priced like an airport restaurant. There are few restaurants within driving distance for a 30-45 minute lunch break (options include Taco Bell and Carls Jr.).

If you play it right, you can do research like being a professor, but without the teaching and administrative duties (though you will lack the unending cheap graduate student labor), but of course you need to find your own funding. Alternatively, you can do more directly programmatic work, and have constant steady work by trading away autonomy. You get the best of both worlds, AND can switch between the two! (Talk to your manager first though) PLUS you get 33% of the royalties from patents!

Director BIll Goldstein is cool. He's a real scientist who keeps it real, and doesn't B.S. when it comes to admitting real problems.","Red tape -- but once you understand that the purpose of the red tape is not only to obey a plethora of federal laws, but also to increase the security (physical and information -- something lacking in many companies these days), then it's possible to accept it (or at least wade through it efficiently).

Being tied to the fiscal year (Oct-Sep): money is saved up until the end of the fiscal year (in case Washington does something nuts like a shutdown), which means that you get underfunded, and at the end of the year suddenly a lot of money is up for grabs. Would be fine, but you not only have to spend it before the end of the year, but all items you purchase *MUST ARRIVE* before end of September. Makes buying big ticket items with long lead times hard, so spend big early!

884,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Great place to build a career,2014-12-16,5.0,Computer Scientist,"I came hare first as a student, then I was a postdoc for a year, and I've been research staff at LLNL for 4 years now.

The thing I love most about working here is the people.  I work with incredibly smart, motivated people on a daily basis, both in my field (computer science) and out (physicists, chemists, and other scientists).  I get to work on some of the largest supercomputers in the world, and I get to have an impact on the design of parallel applications that run on thousands or millions of processors at once.  There just aren't that many places you can do that, and there are fewer where the experts in the field are right around the corner.

The problems LLNL tackles are not only interesting, they're important to national security, which makes them more fulfilling in a lot of ways.  Saving the world from asteroid attacks?  People here are working on that.  Exploring new states of matter and new ways to build predictive simulations for it?  That too.  Working in High Performance Computing will expose you to new fields and directions you just don't get out of a typical CS degree, and you'll gain valuable experience by working on projects like these.  If you're not as interested in mission-driven science, LLNL supports lots of basic science research, too.

If you are planning to build a career here, you should know that LLNL is a great place for entrepreneurial scientists.  If you are interested in building something, and if you have the drive and motivation to stick with it, you can come here, start your own project, and build a team to pursue your vision.  As an example: many labs do not allow postdocs to apply for their own funding, but at LLNL it is encouraged.  Postdocs can apply for internal Lab-Directed Research and Development funding (LDRD), and once you're staff, you can pursue a number of external competitive proposal calls from the DOE Office of Science.  There are also opportunities to get long-term programmatic funding for your project, if it turns out to be successful.","It can be difficult to figure out exactly how the lab works.  If you're the type of person who comes in, talks to people, and asks a lot of questions, you'll quickly learn by word of mouth.  As far as documentation for new employees, or a road map for your career, well, the lab's not so good at that.  It's up to you -- the lab rewards initiative, but if you don't have a lot of it, you may quickly find yourself lost.  The lab is working on this with efforts like a recent ""Lab 101"" course for early career employees.  They take you through the funding landscape and the national priorities that drive the lab.  

Everyone at LLNL is busy, and hiring is slow.  It's often hard to staff a new project if you get it funded, but the lab is working hard to change this, with more pipeline hires and fewer administrative hurdles to jump through."
885,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Great place to do research while maintaining life-work balance,2014-11-27,4.0,Postdoctoral Researcher,"Good work environment, great work-life balance, decent benefits. If you want to do the kind of research they do at NIF or need super-computer muscle then this is one of the best places to be at.",It is a national lab so there is a lot of friction and red tape.

There is amazing diversity in the work that is conducted at the lab, which gives employees plenty of opportunity to try something or learn something new... All the while working with some of the smartest people you will ever meet.  The atmosphere is more collaborative than competitive in most areas of the lab, which is essential to making some of the great things we do everyday possible.  The culture at the lab is also very supportive of work life balance, which is important to myself and my family.","The lab has been around for a long time and there is a lot of tribal knowledge that can be hard to understand at first. We are also required to comply with many different mandates from many different organizations, which can fell like a lot of red tape at times (but a good understanding of the system and how it works can make this manageable)."

Livermore the town is a lovely place, exactly what you would want from a wine country area.","It's a government lab, so there's a lot of red tape and oversight.

Many of the top rated people are so far away from top notch it is astounding."
893,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Five years in, still my dream job",2014-09-06,5.0,Computer Scientist,"I'm coming up on the second year after finishing my postdoc.  My title is nothing fancier than ""Computer Scientist"".  I have no stock options, no one drops by to give me an in-chair massage, and I have to pay for my own snacks.

However, when I was talking to my director about how I'd be evaluated going forward, she had a simple answer:  what was the impact I had, both on the wider field of computer science and the lab's mission.  

Within that remit, I've been given as much freedom as I can handle and significant, ongoing support in competing for resources.  When I'm able to acquire resources (and that's not been a problem so far), I'm able to hire brilliant student interns and postdocs, buy equipment, and get significant time on some of the largest supercomputers in the world.  I have access to research staff at Intel, AMD, IBM and Cray, as well as to the physicists who are trying to squeeze as much performance as they can out of our systems.  I can attend the conferences I need to, whether foreign or domestic.  And best of all, I can see the results of my research percolating back out into the community.  

If I were at a largish company in Silicon Valley, I expect my research would be far more practical (and much more aligned with corporate goals).  If I was in academia, my work would necessarily be far more theoretical, as I wouldn't have ready access to the big machines.  At the lab, I have the best of both worlds.

On a more personal note:  the people I work with are generally world-class researches in their area, and really nice.  While there's the usual stress of competing for funding, we don't tend to compete against each other, so there's far more camaraderie than most academic departments.  I'm finding out that the phrase ""no one has tried that before"" tends to follow me around, but I've never had a good idea dismissed out of hand.  

In short, I bump up against my own limitations much more than limitations imposed by the lab.  As a scientist, I'm not sure I could ask for a better employer.","""Nimble"" is not a word I would use to describe the lab.  There is quite a bit of process in place, and trying novel approaches tends to run headlong into that process.  I'm learning, though, that being persistent, friendly, persistent, responsive and persistent does eventually allow new science to be done, and subsequent ideas do tend to get implemented faster.  

The support staff we have tends to get cut first during downturns, as it's difficult to quantify how much time the scientific staff lose in dealing with budgets, travel, etc.  That said, when I've asked for help, I've gotten it.

I'm mostly supported by ""soft money"" and that's not going to change anytime soon.  This does constrain how far out I can plan things like hiring, and it does focus my efforts more on winning the next grant rather than making software people will actually use. 

At a higher level, the Department of Energy is currently favoring fewer, larger projects over many smaller ones, which makes it difficult for younger scientists to get the experience they need to eventually run large projects."
894,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Great place to start a career, but no reason to stay too long",2014-09-06,4.0,Computer Scientist,"There are many smart people working here in many fields.  Entry level pay and job stability and strong.  The equipment you get to use, computers, science experiments is top notch.  Benefits are overall very good with a high 401k match, good insurance options, twelve paid holidays and more sick time than most people can use.  The problems to work on are hard and interesting and cutting edge in the field.  Overall these are very strong plusses and are mostly the big things.  Also, the funding situation is looking up right now with the lab not able to hire enough people quick enough (see cons) to fill open positions.","Many of the best people leave mid-career due to better pay, funding issues (erratic) or advancement opportunities elsewhere.  While pay at the entry level is competitive the cost of living in Livermore is steep and flatter pay scale and slow salary adjustments for rising employees encourages this.  While it used to make sense to stay if you had a pension now it is more worthwhile to spend 5 or so years learning a lot and moving on to greener pastures if you are really good.  The result is while retention is good for mediocre or good people top talent gets poached.  Many buildings are falling apart and maintenance of them is slow, compartmentalized and not always prioritized well.  Vacation time is on the low end and takes a long time to increase, plus with older employees on the pension things feel very two tiered in terms of benefits.  Then there is the issue with government running things so that you can be penalized for not spending all your money in a year, if something happens in Congress it ripples out etc.  Also, HR and hiring are slow."

The problems are interesting and feel important.  Sure you can burn out on anything but there is a ton of interesting work at the lab.
On that note, the lab has so many projects going on that if you need something new after a few years you can find something fresh to re-invigorate you.
Finally the pay is pretty decent for the area.  Yes you will get more money at the big companies further west, but the cost of living around the lab is way more in line with lab salaries than with other companies.
Final advice, if you are a fresh grad and can grind for a bit, go to one of the big companies and make some serious dough.  If you appreciate work life balance, want to spend time with your family, and want a decent quality of life, this is a great place.","When it comes to software engineering the lab hasn't quite figured out how to define career paths yet.  They have a classification system worked out but it is only a few years new at this point and they are only just starting to define and coach employees on how one would get a promotion.
Being a government funded facility, we are at the mercy of the federal budget.  When stuff like the government shut down happens, or salaries are frozen for federal workers, it affects us.
The frills and niceties of other companies are non-existent here.  Here are some examples: when taking someone on a lunch interview, the lab will not do the courtesy of paying for your interviewees lunch, you have to pay out of your pocket;  Many buildings have cramped hallways and not so nice bathrooms (not gas station bathrooms, but not nice bathrooms); Many buildings have only basic custodial services, i.e. you'll be cleaning the fridge out yourself."

You are forced to do all sorts of unnecessary online training, I assume so LLNL can't get sued or something later on.

Technical people are promoted instead of people who want to be managers.  This leads to a variety of problems, most notably that they don't have time/interest in managing.  If they control funding/money and have deadlines of their own, they have little interest in your interests in job mobility and career development.  The word ""fiefdom"" culture has been strewn about a lot.

In my division, someone was promoted on their technical merit despite the fact they did not actually want to perform managerial activities (e.g. writing performance appraisals).  So a new layer of management was created beneath them to accommodate the situation.  In any other company, this would be considered complete insanity, but for some reason it makes total sense to the management here."

Livermore and the surrounding area is a nice place to live meaning minimal or no commute.  The work here covers a wide range of topics so it is relatively easy to move between projects.,"The working conditions are horrific.  Buildings and offices are unmaintained and uninhabitable.  If you are a software developer you will spend all of your time cleaning up ill conceived code written by PhD Physicists.  Software professionals are not given control of the development of major codes.  Hence, the opportunities for advancement or even for visibility of a computer software developer are extremely limited.  For the past 5-10 years the Lab has been rudderless.  There is no clearly articulated vision or direction.  As a result the Lab has been on an accelerating downward trajectory.  The layers of management and stifling bureaucracy make getting even the most mundane things done a major effort.  I have personally needed to walk 1/2 mile to find a functioning color printer.  The performance review process is more or a beauty pagent than a real performance review.  There is little connection between one's ranking and ones productivity."

The pay is also on par with tech companies in silicon valley, the benefits are great, and I've never seen a better 401(k) package. Livermore itself is a great city to live in.","Security can be stifling. When I started, it was a solid month and a half before I got the full access I needed in order to do my job unencumbered. The first 4 months of my assignment were spent in a different building from my team until my security clearance was processed. These are natural parts of working for a national lab, but it was frustrating at times, especially considering the non-classified nature of my project.

A final issue is that upward mobility can be difficult depending on your group. The lab has an abnormally large number of employees who have worked here for decades, and they tend to be chosen first for promotion regardless of skill."

There is a lot of flexibility in working hours and it is possible to achieve a wide range of work/life balance.","Funding is very dependent upon government agencies (DOE, DoD, DHS, etc.) that have had major internal turmoil lately.

Perhaps that's brilliant thinking-out-of-the-box. Perhaps not.

OK serious cons: the annual personal appraisal/review process is time consuming and agonizing for all involved. And, has almost nothing no connection with your annual raise (for years in which Congress permits this). Everyone at LLNL (even upper management, I think) knows this -- yet the insanity continues.

Some of the best computer scientists in the world work in Livermore Computing, and will help you write or optimize your codes to run efficiently on the biggest supercomputers using the latest technology.  Very strong scientific culture, with frequent seminars from both local researchers and invited guests.  The salaries are quite good, with much better job security than you'll find in industry.  (Not absolute, but far less uncertainty.)

The Lab also encourages work/life balance far more than almost any other comparable job.  People exercise, leave at a reasonable hour to spend time with their families and have generous vacation and sick leave (including family sick leave) benefits.","The bureaucracy can be annoying at times, particularly surrounding travel.

This wasn't much of an issue in the past, but with budgets contracting everywhere it's becoming more common that conference travel is denied based on slim budgets, so you can ensure that doesn't happen to you by saving up this fund for those occasions. ;-)","This lab has been 're-organizing' their efforts to centralize on stockpile stewardship and associated science. Younger scientists/post-docs working in areas which are not aligned with these goals risk getting shed along with their group from the lab as it contracts.

980,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,A nice place to work.,2012-09-04,4.0,Computer Scientist,"The best part of working for LLNL are the smart Co-workers. It's a pleasure to work with really brilliant people that want to help. 

LLNL also provides  a sane work-life balance. They expect you to work hard while you are there but at 5:00 you should go home and live you life. If you have a family or a life outside of work this is a  good place to work.",LLNL is slow to change. While this consistency is sometimes a virtue at other times it will drive you crazy. There is just too much management. This layers of management tend to make policies that stifle innovation and efficiency.
981,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,25 Years at LLNL,2012-08-10,4.0,Technical Staff Member (Engineer),"- Salary. 
- Flexibility in work schedule. 
- Good basic benefits. 
- College campus like working environment.","- Sometimes oppressive and silly security/safety rules. 
- Employee services not on par with other high tech companies in the Bay Area – the Lab use to have a large swimming pool, softball fields and Lab sponsored clubs. 
- Move to “for-profit” contract structure with federal government for operating the Lab, and loss of University of California academic “not-for-profit” culture and replacement with industrial business culture. 
- Little of the profit made by the new company running the Lab is put back into the Lab facilities or passed on to employees. 
- Many new senior and middle managers brought in by the new company are from socially/politically “conservative” regions of the country and do not like the progressive/liberal values held by many of their employees."
982,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Not Great and Not Horrible,2012-07-22,3.0,,"- Excellent health/retirement benefits
- Salary OK
- Tuition assistance (with approved application)
- Variety of projects to work on","- top-heavy on management
- have surprisingly seen males condescend to females in various settings especially around knowledge/experience
- incompetent managers promoted based on politics/managing up/networking/longevity rather than proven skills and experience
- a lot of infighting between groups for resources and budget, internally competitive environment, management groups hostile and negative toward each other"
983,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Changed a lot over the years,2012-07-19,4.0,Administrator,"Ability to change careers, benefits, competitive salary, exercise classes/facilities.","Management stifles upward movement, salary freeze, inconsistent promotion of worklife balance across the Lab."
984,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Big Science,2012-06-17,4.0,,"LLNL allows a scientist to accomplish big science surrounded by resources and incredibly knowledgeable and committed people.  The lab gives you a lot of room to grow and explore new ideas, and the support structure (in most cases) is very strong.","You're working for the government, so all the benefits that may come from working for a private company (frequent bonuses, team building, etc) are nonexistent.
Bureaucracy and politics abound (e.g., if you want a promotion, you're more likely to get it by threatening to leave b/c you have an offer from somewhere else than from the merit of your work)."
985,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Pleasant life/work balance,2012-05-05,3.0,Systems and Network Senior Associate,"Good retirement compensation (401K, 9.5%-11.5% contribution of pre-tax salary) Many projects to work on. Some are very fascinating. Very relaxed environment.","Far-too relaxed environment. Very federated. Groups working at cross-purposes. Poor career advancement by way of committees of people that don't know you, strange."
986,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Very good for student internships and fellowships,2012-02-28,4.0,,"The SEGRF and LSP fellowship programs at LLNL compensate well, and are great for students that want to pursue large-scale research problems.",Working with classified materials can be an difficult for student-employees.
987,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Only OK, but barely.",2012-01-21,3.0,Computer Scientist,"Employees are mostly treated fairly and with respect, at least on the surface.

Flexible working time. 

Lots of collaborations with other DOE labs and universities.

Competitive salaries due to the pressure from Bay Area IT companies.  Maybe the highest pay among all DOE laboratories. 

Benefits are also above average. 

It is an OK place serving as a jump board to land better opportunities elsewhere.","No bonus. No real incentive to keep employees doing great job.

Layers and layers of intrusive  security rules , no gmail, no facebook, no incoming email attachments.  

Life for foreign scientists from sensitive countries can be tough. Too many red tags, no off-site email access to name the least.

Horrible immigration policy, HR forces new foreign national hires to take J-1 visas instead of H1-B visas. No sponsorship for green cards even for staff scientists converted from postdocs.

Facility is ridiculously aging, mostly shaky trailers not even with enough toilets for employees. 

Uncertainty of federal funding makes most scientists spread across many projects to reduce risks (eggs in many baskets). But this causes too many context switches and work overload. 

Overhead is so high that scientists cannot include each other in collaborative projects. They even outsource to universities or other cheaper labs as a workaround.

Absurd ways by management to cut cost by reducing A/C temperature during Winter, reduce water facet flow speed to save water, etc."
