126,LinkedIn,"A toxic, career-destroying mistake",2022-02-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some smart people, and apparently the cafeteria food is good. Above-average benefits.","These are just the highlights:

1) My recruitment was a straight-up bait and switch. I was promised a role that did not actually exist, both in formal and practical terms.
2) LinkedIn does not have teams so much as it has reporting structures. IC work is strictly solo -- there's no pairing, there's no collaboration, there's rarely even code review. You will not have any opportunity to learn from your colleagues or build meaningful things. I cannot stress this enough -- LinkedIn is by far the most isolating, disempowering place I have ever worked.
3) Decision making is strictly top-down. Your work is assigned by your manager. Initiative is not rewarded. Credit is not given.
4) You will not build transferable skills. All the internal data infrastructure is proprietary and outdated. Skills you bring from prior roles will have little value here, and skills you gain here will have no, or even negative, value when seeking your next role.

It was clear within a week or two after joining that I had made a terrible mistake, and I left within a few months. I feel terrible for my colleagues that are still stuck there. At the IC level, many people feel trapped, and some don't even realize how bad they have it because they are so walled off from what the profession can achieve. I have had a heartbreaking number of colleagues reach out after I left just to hear stories about what it's like to collaborate in DS, because they've literally never even been told that is a thing. Many have been with LinkedIn for years.

Additionally, it has been brought to my attention in confidence that there are very credible and widespread allegations of abuse and discrimination on my former team. It is not clear that they are being addressed."

218,LinkedIn,A truly toxic leadership culture within the Global Customer Organization,2022-01-26,1.0,Manager,"As a global tech company, it has some great benefits like health care.","I'll start by saying not all eggs are bad, there are some good folks in amongst the weeds. However, I have never worked in an environment that is so toxic among managers and leaders on such a consistent basis that eventually, you begin to believe that you are the problem. You either conform to their way of thinking or you fall into their 'not a culture-fit' category. The sheer fact that this phrase is mentioned on such a regular basis tells you it's more of a cult LinkedIn has than a culture. A lot of senior leadership have climbed the ladder within the company and as such, they have severe impostor syndrome where they crave to be right all the time and view peers as competitors. I've worked for companies that celebrate employee suggestions to help the company get ahead of the competition but as LinkedIn has no real competitors, that element is missing as LinkedIn. Instead leaders view their peers & colleagues as competitors & threats to their role so instead of having a truly collaborative environment, you end up with this horribly toxic culture where everyone is out for themselves and that just eats away at any confidence you have. The most shocking part about all of this is, that no matter how many managers & leaders submit their internal feedback about this horrible culture, nothing, and I mean nothing is done about it. I've found out the hard way that speaking out about the company culture in a non-positive way is not welcomed at all levels, including the global HR level. My biggest regret is staying with LinkedIn for as long as I did and it's only now a year after leaving the company, I realize just how terrible LinkedIn was to work for.If you are a leader thinking about joining LinkedIn's global customer organization team (GCO), do yourself a favour and explore other options and don't get sucked in with the perks and benefits. It should be illegal to sell such a positive culture to potential candidates when in fact it's the opposite."

222,LinkedIn,Don't believe the hype,2022-01-25,1.0,Sales Operations Manager,"Global company, tech culture, free food, flexible working, generous parental leave, DEI efforts/emphasis","Linkedin has a habit of hiring people into roles they're overqualified for and then keeping them there.

In my case, I flagged to Linkedin that I'm overqualified for the role that they offered me but HR and the hiring manager insisted that I was coming in at the right level and over time convinced me to join.

Shortly after joining my hypothesis was confirmed: I am indeed overqualified for the role that I have. I bring this up to my manager who then agrees and says that I should have been brought in at a higher level. 

But then he refuses to make any changes as he chooses to hide behind ""HR rules"". He suggests that he will advocate for my promotion instead based on the fact that I was brought in on the wrong level and have been performing at a higher level (something that is widely acknowledged by all my Sales partners).

But then a few weeks later he got back to me saying that there is no accelerated promotion timeline for Linkedin to correct their leveling mistake. Which is infuriating because the company has acknowledged their mistake and agreed that I should be paid more.

This is a common problem at Linkedin - from talking to coworkers I know that I'm not the first person that this has happened to.

Half of the Sales team is being poached by competitors who offer 50%+ more in pay. HR doesn't care - they just shrug and say ""we have a good culture"". But how good is the culture really if you're not paying people properly?

Due to long hours and low pay, there is high turnover which is very disruptive to the business, which then means that anyone who remains on the staff has to work longer hours. It's a vicious cycle."

Clients are very engaged and you are treated as a strategic partner rather than a vendor.
Good work life balance.
Good benefits.
This is a good place if you don't care too much and just want to go to work with some nice perks and a have a fairly easy job.","Very toxic culture. Managers turn a blind eye to bullying and nasty behaviours, I witness multiple people being bullied and leaving LI in tears during my 6 years. 
Big focus on appearance rather than results. People are incentivised to spend time on self-promotion rather than driving business results. Smooth talkers are seen very favourable. 
LinkedIn is an easy sell. And whether you have good results or not are often down to luck. This has resulted in some very mediocre people getting promoted and as a result you have bad managers."

You get a base pay, and when you work with your sales partners to renew the accounts, they get most of the credit. It's very training plan focused Customer Success, honestly not sure how this role adds value. Leadership should look at rewarding the Customer Success team and giving them a more strategic role."
364,LinkedIn,Trust is gone,2021-11-19,1.0,Sales Manager,"Spoils employees with perks, gym free food etc.","Making over 1,000 people redundant at the height of the Covid19 pandemic whilst still reporting record profits and significant growth was a poor decision.

LinkedIn would rather you spend 90% of your time fighting internally to get order forms created than hustling to create new pipeline. Do you like tickets? You’ll be creating and responding to tickets from 9am to 8pm each and every day. The process is out of control. It’s is incomprehensible how hard it is to get pricing and a final order form. Something that should take 15 mins takes 3-7 days because rep autonomy & access has been taken away. There has been so much change that it’s causing mental health issues for the majority in Enterprise Sales. Executive leadership clearly thinks our products sell themselves. We’ve moved our post sale customer support model to self serve. This puts insane pressure on the AD’s to find ways to help our customers, yet we don’t have full access to their accounts. I cannot recommend making a career change into LinkedIn sales with so many issues standing in the way of helping your would be customers."

They preach diversity and inclusion but really you have to fit into their box of leverage and leadership and not thrive at being your own identity. It’s tasks to check the box in leadership and leverage that reps crawl over each other to get these marks to get to their next play.

487,LinkedIn,"Great company with an amazing mission/vision, but urgently needs better systems and processes",2021-09-21,4.0,Client Solutions Manager,"This review concerns LMS only.

Pros of working in LinkedIn Marketing as a CSM:

-I strongly believe (without detracting anything from the others) that LMS is by far the most interesting BU to be in at LinkedIn, experiencing tremendous growth and essentially propelling the company’s expansion. Digital marketing is also an increasingly important industry, and to work at the best B2B platform does come in handy in terms of experience
-the job is complex, challenging, multi-faceted, which means you’ll rarely get tired or feel you’re not learning anymore (I only started feeling this around my 2 year mark, but there is so many opportunities to move horizontally).
-in normal non-Covid conditions, you’ll be able to travel to visit clients for a good amount of time, something I find to be the most exciting thing about the job
-LinkedIn’s perks and benefits in Ireland are difficult to match - holidays, paid shutdown, education reimbursement, yearly allowance, WFH expenses, equipment and days off, and most importantly…
-food, food, food.. impossible to describe how good their food is","Cons:

-my experience trying to move horizontally and across countries into another role with LI was probably the most disappointing thing that happened during my time there, and the single defining reason why I left. Without going into details, let’s just say “Talent is our number one priority” goes down the drain more often than not
-the lack of properly working systems and processes. Such as, first of all, an actual CRM - again this is only related to LMS. Then - a properly staffed Sales Ops team - they have 4 people covering hundreds. The very questionable and lax “rules” by which revenue and accounts are assigned AND can change hands is something straight out of a nightmare, and not something I would have expected from a multi-billion dollar company. Personally, the first 6 months, apart from furiously trying to learn all there is to know about the job (fun fact - it’s impossible - this will teach you to be happy with the unknown, which is actually a positive) I spent a considerable amount of time trying to get used to things that just made my jaw drop on a daily basis. After 6 months I just got used to putting out the fires caused by this astonishing lack of structure and just smiled sadly at new joiners experiencing the same
-while a lot has been done to improve CSMs’ standing in the business and to put them on a level with AEs, there obviously continues to be a divide"

- nice office
- good healthcare
- good perks 
- barista onsite
- flexible working hours (to a degree)","- no real internal promotion or progression opportunities (jobs are pre-determined to a degree even though it is claimed that the best people get hired for the jobs)
- mediocre (middle) management telling their teams the company line without real transparency and follow-up and managers not backing up their team members
- information overload that you need to work through after hours to stay on top and in the know
- depending on the team you join you are risking work life balance and can expect long working hours - it is kind of an expectation to work in an environment that is understaffed but to ensure all work gets covered and done
- ongoing major changes and scaling efforts leaving teams overworked and in a muddle of new processes that do not always work and creates ways of in-efficient working
- in-efficient tools, bad processes, lots and limited resources to get your job done in normal working hours
- no real customer centricity
- amazing and talented colleagues leaving 
- teams operate with limited resources and when someone goes on PTO there is no back-up as everybody is already at capacity and the workload will await an employee when returning from leave often with more pressures"

Possible to take a lot of off time, like 1 day off every month, two shutdowns in year and managers being really chill about taking extra time. If you do your job you can take 5-6 weeks off easily in a year.","Engineering bar is pretty low. Company has a really bad developer experience. You spend most your time trying to figure out issues around tools, wait ridiculous times to build your code, with some teams you wait forever to get your code reviewed. It's 2021 and this company is just switching to git. Gives an idea.

Career track: super slow unless you have a manager that will fight for you. Most staff engineers are bad engineers, they will never find jobs outside or never find a staff role. However inside linkedin it will take forever to get to staff.

Refreshers: The worst. And I say that one more time, the worst refreshers ever. Your manager will give you a 100k refresher that will vest in 4 years for killing it at work and tell you ""nobody ever received this much"". Don't believe the HR when joining, they are not telling the truth."

You're collaborating with some of the most thoughtful, kind, and creative peers, all while gaining a tremendous amount of knowledge of LinkedIn's business lines. The leadership team deeply cares about guiding the associates to be their best professional self and present ample opportunities to hone your leadership skills. I'm quite confident I will learn a ton as I transition into a full-time sales development role.

Compensation for a rotational program straight out of school is generous and above market (nothing outrageously competitive, but quite decent). You're given a base salary and a variable component, and the quota is completely fair and achievable. Your total compensation package (401k, PerkUp, signing bonus, time off) is outstanding.","What's cool about BLP is that you have an opportunity to choose 1 of 4 pathways (SaaS Sales, Media Sales, Sales Analytics, Non-Quota). While you don't have full control over which path you pursue due to business needs, you certainly have the capacity to make your luck happen by demonstrating your interest in a specific pathway.

That said, the one downside to BLP is that you don't necessarily get job exposure to these pathways prior to choosing. Instead, everyone goes through customer operations (which has been beyond fruitful to learning the products) before selecting their path. While there are plenty of guest speakers from different parts of the business and opportunities to learn what a day-in-the-life is like, it would be SUPER cool to actually have exposure to these pathways as part of rotations to just get a taste of what something like, say, analytics would be."

Earlier years, LinkedIn hired a lot of execs from more traditional enterprise software and hardware companies like HP, Oracle etc. These leads brought the political and hands off culture from their old workplace to LinkedIn. The other thing that comes with hierarchical is definitely office politics. This can be seen from the top all the way down to the bottom. Career progression is also depending on which side you are on, how powerful your leads are instead of looking at individual work."

Building relationships here truly feels authentic and there are multiple ways to progress your career.,"I've had unpleasant experience with our internal recruitment team when applying for new positions. There is a lack of communication and they seem overworked which results in a poor experience for applicants.

There is also a high level of talent that applies to work here and applies for promotional positions. I had to take a massive pay cut and a lesser job title to get my foot in the door."

* There is a culture of ""build everything in-house,"" so the tools-related skills you learn here won't be useful in the rest of your career. Imagine you work as a carpenter and suddenly after changing the company you work for, they tell you that they don't use hammers or nails, they use combobulators and whizbangs, and every standard tool you've acquired skill in has a unique replacement in this organization. So you spend 2 years or more of your life getting good at combobulators, whizbangs, and whatchamacalits, then you leave the company to resume your career as a carpenter elsewhere. What do you think you gained from your time at that company? Atrophy. Atrophy is what you gained. You are now less skilled at using a hammer and nails. What's more, the world of carpentry has since developed new techniques and industry-standard tools that your peers are pros in and you've never heard of them.
* Learning these internal tools is painful. There is no standard to documentation. It's all kept unversioned, outdated, with low discoverability in old wiki pages. The only way to confidently learn the tool is brute force -- asking on Slack channels or email lists, inquiring if a snippet you read on the outdated documentation is still current, mixed with actually checking out the tool or project and just reading the code.
* There are two kinds of SRE teams at LinkedIn. Those that engineer tools and those that use these custom-engineered tools. If you are on the latter kind of team, expect to spend all your time configuring these custom combobulators and whizbangs, or doing migrations from OS to OS, kernel to kernel, java version to java version (yeah, they're still transitioning off on-premise infrastructure that's managed like pets, not cattle)."

- Hiring Managers are true partnerships rather than order taking like an agency or other companies 
- For any recruiter, you will grow in how you think with data driven decisions and how to leverage information for closing candidates/Hiring Manager relationships, and opportunities to join projects for the LinkedIn Recruiter tool 
- Your teammates will be your best friends","This is hard to say, but needs to be addressed:

LinkedIn is a company that prides itself on being compassionate, to use Jeff Weiner’s word specifically. Unfortunately, for the recruiting org, there has been a mass exodus after the 2020 layoffs. The main culprit being the culture shift. 

Ex: getting promoted is extremely difficult. This last year after lay-offs not one recruiter was promoted, but a Manager was promoted. Anyone who was targeting to get promoted has to wait another full year.  Favoritism is a real issue here. 
 
Ex: While you will be told it’s unlimited vacation, any time off outside of the company shutdowns is not encouraged. 

Ex: there are quarterly surveys asking how to be better, how your Managers can be better. Despite feedback, nothing is ever done to rectify any alarming issue. But you will always be told how to be better, no matter what. 

Overall issue: LinkedIn started out as a welcoming company with a start up mentality. Now it’s more of a grind company with a “clique” energy and you’ll find yourself saying how great it is, but also feeling like you’re never enough. Personally, I’d rather work for a company that is honest about the work expectations and long term agenda."

2. Weird cult like culture where you're forced to conform, 30% of your time is spent in self-promotion and creating visibility for yourself and this comes at the cost of customer service.

3. The middle management is not inspiring, and adds very little value. 

4. The workload has increased significantly with no correction in pay. 

5. Lots of changes in the org with attrition in senior leadership is a cause for concern, 

6. Very limited growth opportunity, most of the customer success managers are stuck without any place to go because the skills they learn at LinkedIn are not transferrable to other companies and roles."

- I will always be grateful to have started my career at a well-known tech company that has always experienced growth","- Absolutely horrendous management of the pandemic situation, first with the redundancies and now with the rights of expats working from a different country. 
- HR is incompetent and threatens employees to follow rules that go against common sense and government regulations (for example: ""If you do not go back to your country of employment you are fired"" even if that is against the country's entry rules). 
- In general, pays below market for a lot of positions.

1035,LinkedIn,"Great culture, exciting work and great leadership",2021-02-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Compared to many other companies in the bay area, LinkedIn is one of the few that deeply cares about the people who work here. There is a strong focus on employee well being and talent within the company. This is now the hallmark in the industry for being talent first.

With the public announcement of LinkedIn moving to Azure, there is an exciting pace in the infrastructure and the product domains. The company is also constantly innovating with the product, and there is so much more they can do.

Linkedin's portfolio is growing to multiple new areas as the social engagements for professionals become more and more focused on online interactions. This means that there are amazing opportunities, that only LI can offer.

Leadership at LinkedIn (managers, sr managers, directors and above), are drilled with empathy. There is a relentless focus on talent and people, and sometimes this can be hard on the management, but they enjoy the fruits of it all: trust, loyalty and excellent relationships with their teams. Big names like G and F aren't able to do what the leaders at LI have been able to. The commitment to diversity is real in all aspects. You are heard for your thoughts and ideas, and not for who you are or where you come from. Respect and humility flow through the veins and arteries of the company. To everyone outside of the company, this almost seems like a weakness, but this is one of the magical strengths of LinkedIn. It all begins with the right leadership.

Individual engineers and others contributors like program managers, finance managers, and so many others (no disrespect to anyone not mentioned here), are the secret sauce of the company. People are extremely smart, and driven. Everyone is ""in"" it together, which is a very LinkedIn way to put it. Career progression is fun when even peers are invested in you because there isn't a notion of 'me' or 'you.' Mentorship is promoted across the company, and structured sponsorships are becoming available as a new means to enhance prospects and not just skills.

Overall, an excellent culture, great people and good challenging work.","The largest flaw in the company has been the overly conservative approach. Like the entire engineering organisation slowed hiring last year, which was a knee jerk reaction. Some prioritization helped, but leaders from different organizations still couldn't see how to help other areas and partners. The silver lining is, that people listen and do something about what's being said, but it needs to be more proactively approached. Being conservative with spend is good business sense, but not all the time.

There are many more minor flaws, but the only other challenge for an individual joining the company is to be able to get used to the technology and systems. There's a lot of technical debt, and while there is an organization focusing on the base platforms and tech, the velocity to reduce technical debt to be able to get new individuals productive has been slow. This has crept into almost all areas of the product, and is not a unique challenge for the company. Once again, the industry in general has this problem, but LinkedIn can certainly do better."

1086,LinkedIn,"Great place to learn and cut your teeth, but don't expect any career transitions",2021-02-13,4.0,Relationship Manager,"Best in class training. Managers really do prioritize you and want to develop you. They set our quotas too high one year and people weren't hitting, so they dropped them down for the reps, but had to keep them high to hit the company goals for the VP's, so the management literally took a hit on our behalf. My VP also didn't have an assigned desk and would just pick a random desk to sit at and when he wasn't at meetings, would talk to us and get our honest opinions about the product and would talk to us about what was working and what wasn't. Very awesome guy. Awesome pay and benefits. Quotas are fair and there's built in relief if some completely out of your control doesn't go your way (like a merger). Great processes in place to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and we're incentivized to work with other business lines so all of LinkedIn benefits. Also lots of learning opportunities in terms of classes to take and ERG's you can join. I have never met anyone who isn't willing to sit down with you for lunch if you asked to schedule something. That being said, it was hard for my team to leave their computers at lunch and they'd often worked through lunch which sucked for team bonding. But also really fun team bonding every quarters pre-covid. LinkedIn also does a great job living it's culture and values to an extent. You're measured not just on how well you do the job you're hired to do, but also if you're contributing to the larger success by creating leverage and acting like a leader. I love that there's an expectation that you will contribute more than just showing up, doing your job and leaving, and instead are expected to help those around you and you're held accountable for that.","RM is a really tough role though. The AE's go home early, but you're inundated with emails and you're constantly having to straddle between acting like a CSM and acting like a sales rep. Unless your account is big enough to get assigned a dedicated CSM, you're on your own, so you really need to figure out how to scale things and only focus on the clients that will get you to your number. There's also a lot of rules in place when it comes to moving around, unless you can get a manager to really champion you (I have seen one person skip a level and jump straight from SMB to Enterprise, and I don't know how they got to do that). You can only move laterally if you want to switch business lines and you need to be in seat for at least a year. Which means if your business line has no openings for a promotion, you can't interview for a promotion in another business line. You can to move over to that other business line in your same position (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise), be there a year, hopefully perform well and then if there are openings, you'll be able to promote. Additionally, while the company touts transformation, it's a giant behemoth now. Unless you've spent a year proving yourself to a manager in a sales-adjacent role, most people aren't willing to take a chance on you. Don't think that by getting your foot in the door by getting a job at LinkedIn, you'll be able to move around. Because LinkedIn has become a top employer, they can get top candidates for low level roles. For example, for an entry level data science role, despite extensive knowledge on the product and having taken some data science classes, I was told ""why would we hire you when we can get someone with a Masters degree in this?"" when I knew multiple people on the team had started with my same background merely two years before. They also had an entry-level Product Manager position that was specifically for internal employees and specifically for people with non-typical backgrounds, so I applied. I did not get an interview because ""there were people with more relevant experience."" They ended up hiring an engineer. Wasn't the whole point that you were looking for people with non-typical backgrounds (ie, not engineers)? If you want to do something sales adjacent, you could do CSM or Sales Readiness, but that's about it. If you want to move over to marketing, you'll need a filler job in between and probably a year before that working on marketing roles. You will get best in class training at LinkedIn, but don't expect to get an opportunity to do something you're not already doing. Come for a cushy job and nice people. Also had a bit of a toxic sales team thanks to a few personalities and a manager that played favorites. But from my understanding, my team was unique in that experience, so I was just unlucky. Could have switched to another team, but didn't want to start the potential promotion cycle all over again. LinkedIn's also trying to walk the walk when it comes to diversity, but honestly leadership is still old white men at the senior level. My manager all the way up to the global head was all white men. There is some diversity sprouted here and there and they were working on it, but I'd love to see the actual numbers because just looking around it didn't seem to be a huge difference."

- The company culture is excellent
- Work/life balance is great
- It's a safe place to learn new things, try new roles, etc. without fearing for your job
- The cafeteria and coffee bars are great (pre-covid)
- Compensation is good – not the best but definitely in that top tier of bay area employers. It might be the best value though, if you consider the culture and work/life balance. I'd rather work at LinkedIn than get paid a little more to work in a snake pit. :)","- From a career development perspective, try to get on a team doing infrastructure work, especially backend work. Even as a top performer with big projects under your belt, the job responsibilities of a front-end feature developer just don't check the right boxes for a promo.
- From a day-to-day perspective, the development tools just aren't great. Mobile infra doesn't meet the needs of developers, working with them can be challenging and certain areas are notably buggy. Even company-wide infrastructure like crash reporting and continuous integration is slow and unreliable.
- If you are considering offers, know that LinkedIn doesn't do big stock refreshes like some other big companies in the area.
- The on-call process is stressful. The apps are just too big and have too many contributors to put a single developer in charge of everything for a week. There are enough developers that you aren't on call very often but the flip side of that is that you never really get the hang of it and things are slightly different by the time you do it again."

The company also offers incredible compensation and amazing perks!","The way Ryan and the C-suite handled the diversity issues was disgusting. All talk, no action. Very fake. Listen to your very small pool of diverse employees... they want opportunity equally and equitably, not just because they are from a minority group. They/we deserve that. Leadership made it uncomfortable for all. 

Additionally, the lack of compassion from the c-suite and senior leadership regarding the layoffs was honestly quite shocking. It was inevitable and understandable that it happened, but Jeff would have never allowed it to be done the way it was. Why did we all wake up to a middle of the night email and a post on LinkedIn to the public from our CEO? You respect our employees but not enough to handle it inernally first. Do better. And then to share that it was not based on performance. So tell me... what was it based on? Favoritism by the Director level... that is it.
In a nutshell... this company is fake. If all you care about is comp and benefits, this is the place for you. But they do not practice their values authentically."

Many managers are extremely competent and want you to succeed.","LinkedIn HR management has been a disaster in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic : 
Very slow and limited communication (we heard in end October that there would be WFH until July 2021, whereas our peer companies had communicated this several months ago).
All Dublin based employees are forced to work from home from their country of employment, with very little consideration for employees with families abroad. No case-by-case review.
Leadership team doesn’t understand that 85% of its Dublin-based workforce are not from Ireland, and telling them that they can’t stay with their families does not align with the wellbeing of their employees.
Many employees left LinkedIn because of this mismanagement. A serious lack of compassion and empathy, especially considering that former CEO Jeff Weiner heavily promoted the term “compassionate leadership” - looks more like a marketing initiative than anything else. 

LinkedIn was built with silos: no clear understanding of who makes what kind of decisions in any given departments. Severe lack of strategic coordination between various departments (sales, marketing, public policy etc). It makes it difficult to try and shape new country-wide ideas, unless you sit at the very top.

This feels more like a Microsoft company than a LinkedIn company. 

Some managers simply lack professionalism and don’t seem to take their work seriously."

1411,LinkedIn,Leaves a lot to be desired,2020-10-25,1.0,Enterprise Relationship Manager,Unfortunately nothing comes to mind,"Cautionary tale...

Do not join LinkedIn if you have any real world experience as you are just trading time for money, with no value added to your skills 

D-grade sales managers who lack knowledge, professionalism and industry experience and management skills; incompetence breeds incompetence
In my time there, I did not learn anything from my role or manager with the exception of what kind of manager I do not want to be

Sales targets are highly unrealistic and tone-deaf to what is happening in the world and with clients 

As the product is highly discretionary (despite what they will have you believe) means a majority of sales do not achieve their targets and therefore overall pay is significantly below expectations

Negligible contribution from cross-functional partners i.e. CSM, marketing etc. means the sales is a one-man/woman force - you will shoulder the burden for everything despite paying for the existence of multiple support departments

Below market pay combined with intense stress, toxicity of environment and lack of career growth and learning opportunities means the role is only for those that are desperate"

The culture also strongly encourages craftsmanship so you get to build things the right way without hacking around to meet deadlines.","Because LinkedIn is already such a big player, it faces similar problem as other big companies. Things are slower because there are more process and almost everything you touch affects a bunch of other teams so migration efforts become super challenging.

1450,LinkedIn,Best company in the Bay Area to work with,2020-10-05,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"– Amazing culture, probably the best (– I have worked at Amazon, Apple, Intuit, Adobe, WalmartLabs, Google. Also interned at Facebook. Facebook culture is second best)

– LinkedIn lives by its values. Specially “members first”, that applies to employees too. For example if you plan to build a system that gave points to how frequently someone responds to queries - one may think this will increase productivity. But in LinkedIn’s ecosystem, you can’t build this. Because it shows “someone is better than someone else on something (responding queries)”. This is not allowed and promotional evaluation are purely positive, without comparison

– You cannot even accidentally prove someone else wrong, or bring them down. People from Amazon/Apple joining LinkedIn may take time to adjust to this

– Consistently Best food in Bay area. And good variety

– Unlimited time off. If taking more than 3 weeks at a stretch, only then you need approval. 3 months Pat.

– Amazing Open Source aptitude

– People trying to micromanage, and/or play politics, are automatically corrected and tuned in by strong Company culture, in less than an year. Some may try escaping by changing teams every year, but that becomes evident soon

– Lots of T-Shirts.","– Subjective: Your contribution to open source and product, both, will be rewarded more if working exclusively on the product (i.e., in the Apps team). But if working exclusively on the infrastructure, you really have to go the long mile. Because Open Source contributors are in abundance and they are all super skilled. Literally 1 Principal engineer on frontend infra in the whole company. 

– Company wide Rest.li (API) and Ember framework (Frontend) pretty much standard. You can choose different tech. But limelight projects build on these only. Although, that is changing slowly, but verrrry slowly."

Enablement / Training Programs
Access to global network 
Culture (for the most part)","- Lack of product diversity (Marketing / Media business) — about 5-10 years behind the industry curve 
- Go-to-market pace: product releases are slow as molasses and those that do launch are feature and functionality based vs tangible new products to market. 
- Internal systems and sales productivity tools are underutilized. Be prepared to work out of a lot of manual spreadsheets instead of a CRM for running and forecasting your business. 
- Overemphasis on operational process and underemphasis on actual selling and selling tactics 
- Sales Management. Many of the managers in the LinkedIn Marketing Solutions business are not sales managers. Former Ops and management consultants are hired to be “sales managers” and do not have field selling experience.  They will force operational process down your throat to the point where you forget how to sell because you spend 75% of your selling time writing the book on it. 
- Lack of hiring diversity and exclusivity. LMS senior leaders brand themselves as diversity and inclusion advocates when in actuality they will keep hiring internal candidates from their inner circle who walk, talk, and look, and think just like them. If you make one mistake, it will stay with you throughout your time with Linkedin marketing and you will be branded as such until you suck up to the next shiny new manager in line who submits to group think because that is in fact the only way you will get promoted. They will use Leadership, Leverage and Results as “performance evaluators” but the truth is these “levers” are subject to your manager and how they think about you or have been forced to think about you at a certain moment in time.  These metrics could push you out or spun up to promote you. 
- Takes years to get promoted if you are not part of the “inner circle”"

1507,LinkedIn,Couldn't have been happier in sales!,2020-09-10,5.0,Account Executive,"LinkedIn has a knack for hiring brilliant, motivated and mission-driven people. I've loved the relationships I've built since day 1, and am so grateful for my time in seat. Every decision the leadership team makes considers and reflects LinkedIn's core values, which everyone respects and takes pride in.

LinkedIn makes you feel so supported in your endeavors, whether it be starting a side project for your team or employee resource group, or wanting to find a path for yourself outside of sales (e.g. moving over to Customer Success), and the level of training and resources offerred is unparalleled. 

Sales quotas are quarterly and tough but fair, and though results matter, you're also measured on leadership and leverage (meaning how you take your successes and skills and extend them out to your greater team or org to drive impact).

You are not micromanaged on your metrics, hours worked or sales process, and can be very autonomous if you prove your success. With this, finding the right manager and team is essential to your happiness, as teams tend to be close and love to build their own team culture.

If you are looking for a great strategic sales role that is focused on the customer and you can be surrounded by talented and kind people and feel rewarded for your work, LinkedIn could be just the place for you!","There is a degree of nepotism in the hiring process, whether it be internal or external candidates. 

For externals, LinkedIn loves referrals so if you are applying, it is highly recommend you get referred in! 

As for the internal hiring process, the best way to get promoted is to spend time getting to know the teams and manager - Without this, it is hard to succeed in getting promoted or hired onto a new team. It helps you find the right team and culture fit which is a plus, but it also can lead to bias, making it harder for a more qualified candidate to get the job at times."

The rules are made globally and no consideration is made for minorities (for example the work from another country policy is tailored for European citizens and employees from other regions of the globe were ignored in the process)

Reps pay the price of managers' mistakes. Managers are protected despite mistakes and reps have no protection and no one to talk to .

The biggest issue with Linkedin is the lack of transparency . There is no clear departments or representatives to talk to in case you are victim of an injustice or just simply to give feedback.

I was personally victim of an injustice and my manager and the head manager told me that there is NO ONE to talk and they ignore who would be the right person to speak to . Quiet shocking for a company that has tousands of employees around the world.

During the redundancy process, no clarification was given regarding the selection process. The management failed to answer most of the question and concerns raised."

The environment here is so fake and overly enthusiastic that it comes off as insincere.  Don’t ask why or challenge the status quo as it’s looked down upon and you’re told that maybe LinkedIn isn’t the place for you. Half of the positions internally are so lofty that I’ve often wondered hole it’s even a real position. And if you don’t fit in with their cult-like personality don’t expect to be accepted.

The company offers great benefits.,"WLB DOES NOT exist as many people have mentioned here. Maybe it's org specific but in my org people work 12 hours a day.

The managers are among the most incompetent ones I've seen in the industry. Because of how the promo process is structured, many people can tick the boxes and become a manager. The managers aren't helpful to their direct reports and constantly expect ICs to do everything by themselves with no support. 

This results in toxic team culture where teammates don't act as a team but are individuals competing against each other."

Both of those are great things when used in the right capacity, but we were a little obsessed. Also yes, we made efforts to make the company more inclusive during my time there, but the leadership team would frequently pat itself on the back while completely unaware of the pervasiveness of the cultural ignorance of the company."

LinkedIn has charismatic senior management and invests in its employees.","Let's tone down some of that charisma! To be fair, it is a professional social media platform, but it can feel off-putting to employees from more diverse backgrounds."
1672,LinkedIn,Diversity and Inclusion....the question is for whom,2020-06-08,3.0,Sales,"While LinkedIn touts their famous diverse and inclusive culture, I have found it to be woefully exclusive. Here's my story: two weeks after I took the job, a co-worker of mine who has been with LinkedIn for years said, ""you can be anything you want to be here but you cannot be a conservative and I wouldn't tell anybody else besides me that you go to church each week"". Was I shocked? Nah, not really. I get it and we all know about Doug Jones and the Alabama senate race, so I wasn't expecting the last of conservative bastions here at LinkedIn. I also did not expect that I should have to hide my political or religious beliefs and I was a little surprised that I was warned about it. I mean, isn't that what being inclusive means? Doesn't that mean that I can worship Buddha or Allah or a golden calf in my backyard, naked and howling at the moon and be comfortable with people at work knowing that? I asked that of my co-worker, the guy who warned me about LInkedIn's diversity, another conservative in hiding. He sighed and said, ""you could pick any of those to worship. Just don't say anything about Jesus."" If you are a minority, particularly a gay minority, LinkedIn will welcome you. If you vote for Trump and you still like Billy Graham.....not so much.",Lot of time wasted on snowflake BS.

Really it's difficult to complain very much about LinkedIn - as an employer they're better than 99% of places out there.","As the company has continued to grow, there has been a bit of erosion in the culture which used to feel much more strat-upy (even though when I joined there were over 11k EEs) and creative. It is starting to feel like working in any other big company, which is not always a bad thing but won't suit everyone."

1686,LinkedIn,I would not recommend LinkedIn as an employer,2020-05-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The company culture in 2015 was great.,"LinkedIn promises a culture of empowerment and diversity with catching phrases like 'Take intelligent risks' and 'Act like an owner' in their career website, however, my experience with this employer did not live up to that standard. It was tainted by what it seems as a bureaucratic culture where managers centralised decision-making and were unresponsive to questions. 

During my tenure with LinkedIn, I sensed that my managers were unaware of the corporate social responsibility standards held against the company, which seem to promote balanced work life among other benefits. However, it appears that employees constantly worked until late hours without clear management guidance or direction. 

As a result of this approach to management, no matter how hard or well employees worked their performance evaluation would still be subject to managers' expectations rather than an objective process to review their achievements and shortcomings, creating space for biases to creep in.

In relation to work flexibility, this did not seem to exist on my team. My managers centralised every aspect of the work as opposed to allowing me to choose methods or techniques. Nor they assigned me ownership of issues. The centralisation of work significantly reduced my enthusiasm and satisfaction with the employer.

During interactions with Human Resources, I sensed the professionals therein were unaware of the high standards of ethical and philanthropic expectations that I held against LinkedIn due to their talent acquisition program. Moreover, HR seemed to listen to corporate gossip rather than verifying facts.

If you value work flexibility and transparency, I would advise you to find other companies that can reach higher levels in these areas."

Aggressive/passive aggressive behaviour especially on the senior HR leadership team is common practice. 
Decisions in HR are often based on personal opinion and internal politics rather than in the best interest of the Company. 
HR knowledge is extremely poor. 
People are hired into senior HR roles based on who they know rather than what they know. 
Self preservation amongst the HR team is key - at any cost! 
Staff turnover (and pay outs) are exceptionally high across EMEA - management in the States don't want to know or care. 
Legislation is not adhered to in the majority (GDPR, etc). 
Staff welfare is not a concern. 
Performance management is an absolute joke!
Culture and values are promoted but in reality are not adhered to or practised-it's all for show and incredibly fake. 
Cult-like mentality fostered and promoted 'you've made it, you're IN'; 'It's harder to get into LinkedIn than it is to Harvard' etc etc.
If you do not conform to the mentality of the clique, you are quickly sidelined and bullied. 
Creativity, new ideas, etc are not welcomed. Be prepared for a lot of lies and a lot of cover ups! 
Little to no development opportunities.
Employees are told to promote LinkedIn constantly via their respective pages - which is monitored. 
Professional etiquette is non-existant and one of the worst I have encountered. If you want to get Linkedin on your CV for a stint, go for it. If you want to learn, grow and develop within HR don't join this team! 

PR for HR across EMEA is exceptionally poor (but not surprising given the calibre of management)"

1714,LinkedIn,Great way to ease into your sales career,2020-04-09,5.0,Business Leadership Program Associate,"LinkedIn's culture is everything that I hoped for and more. By spending about 6 months in the rotational program, you are able to ease into sales by learning about the different business lines and teams before jumping right in. The rotations also set you up for success in terms of learning the products that you will be selling and getting exposure to different departments. The BLP Cohort becomes like a family and you are able to grow with a diverse and impressive group of individuals. The day to day work of the role is not stressful, and you should not have any problems attaining your quota. The work/life balance is amazing - fun activities every week and only 40 hrs/week of work allowed.","Some of the work in the rotational program is very tedious. When it is time to transition into Sales Development, you are chosen to be on a team without much opportunity for input on which teams you prefer. 
Not a Con for me, but everyone should know that this program is a sales funnel meant to grow talent for the sales organization. It is not encouraged to look at other roles outside of sales at LinkedIn. 
There is no encouragement to exceed your quotas for your day to day in-role; only to take on leadership opportunities outside of the role."

-As cliche as this may sound, the culture is the number one reason. From top-down, every day I see leadership and people below be genuinely good people. I have never had so much trust in leadership. They set the tone for the rest of us and it's a good tone. I especially see this during the pandemic and the incredible, people-first mentality everyone has 
-Incredibly generous benefits from compensation to everything else. The OTE may seem much lower than some other tenured sales positions but if you're good at your job, you can make a lot. Good behavior is very much rewarded
-The product - I feel so passionate about what we are doing, how we are doing it, and it makes me feel like I am actually helpful clients by selling. It's such a good feeling to have that. We have so many different solutions we can offer clients that make our job truly consultative. I am sure there is more to come!!
-I am currently reporting to the manager I have ever had. I don't think this is unique. LinkedIn is incredibly selective in who they hire and promote to leadership roles. I know I would feel similarly with other managers 
-A stable company owned by Microsoft. Feels nice to be here when the world feels unstable; the even better part is our company is doing everything  possible to help clients and the rest of the world during the pandemic 


I could probably write a novel on here but if you hear positive things, it's because it's true. Most of the reviews before me say really similar things. Before accepting the job I talked to a lot of people and they all confirmed what I had read. I can now say the same",I have never worked for a really large company before and didn't realize all of the red tape and inefficiencies that may come with it. An example of this is how we handle renewal protection.  No place is perfect
1719,LinkedIn,LinkedIn Dublin review,2020-04-04,4.0,Account Executive,Great culture and benefits! Dublin office is amazing and is a great place to start your Career in sales. Évolution is possible every Year or 18 months if you achieve your targets,Results can vary a lot depending on the Line of business where you’re working. LinkedIn learning is a Very challenging with almost no marketing support and unachievable target if you work on SMB or Mid Market
1720,LinkedIn,Great company values and work/life balance,2020-04-02,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"Best company I've ever worked for in terms of values and work/life balance. Great perks, competitive pay, and is respectful of people's personal/family life. Able to work remotely when needed.","Very dynamic work environment that takes time to adjust if you've worked with more mature companies in the past. Petty politicking and nepotism depending on your team as middle-management tries to empire build. Lack of experience in middle management as they try to handle business changes and growth. Hard for someone who is seasoned in their area to learn from inexperienced managers. In that respect, growth is limited because managers don't know how to grow their high-performers which will eventually leave because if you can't learn from your manager, then perks and good comp and benefits will not be enough to stay. Alot of time spent hand-holding younger employees who don't know how to problem-solve."

1740,LinkedIn,Not the company it use to be,2020-03-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Work with talented and driven people. Pay used to be great and can have 400k plus years.  Get lunch catered.,Middle line managers are inexperienced and for the most part yes people. They are continually raising quotas and lowering kickers resulting in many tenured experienced reps leaving. Pay is average. The company is run by sales ops and sales leaders have little impact on numbers and do not push back. Morale is bad at least in the Chicago office as majority of the teams are not hitting. Cross-functional and sales managers have no accountability and reps are the ones to go. I use to recommend people at LinkedIn but no longer think its a place to make money.

When you first join LinkedIn you feel like you won the lottery because everyone is nice and you have good perks.","For sales: really bad senior leadership across most of the organizations due to hyper growth and inexperienced leaders getting promoted too quickly. On the surface the culture seems great. But the longer you stay, the more you realize that most people are stressed and unhappy and it takes you a while to realize that you’re extremely stressed and unhappy too. Frequent and pervasive comp mistakes."

1750,LinkedIn,Account executive,2020-02-28,4.0,Account Executive,Amazing work. Good value to clients,No new innovative ideas by the management
1751,LinkedIn,The best company and employer you can ever imagine,2020-02-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Open, happy, work life balance.",Spoiling its employees so that many of them think all businesses work in this way.
1752,LinkedIn,LTS High Growth Relationship Manager Review,2020-02-27,2.0,Relationship Manager,"The people from the executive team down to entry level employees are, for the most part, very nice and exceptionally bright.  

LinkedIn is very gracious in how it treats its people and they prove this real time given the generous work life balance, on site food services, plentiful company paid holidays along with unlimited PTO.  

As someone who has a financially dependent family member for healthcare, I am incredibly grateful for LinkedIn's stance on medical coverage options and what they cover.  While most assume healthcare is standard these days, LinkedIn truly does care for its employees and helps take the burden off those that have special health circumstances within their family.","I should preface this with the general headline that I was misled during my interview process which created a negative first experience with my management team.

The interview process seemed standard: role play, 1 on 1 interviews and panel interviews.  I was rather surprised when I was lucky enough to reach the offer stage, that I would be reporting to a manager I had very little interaction with throughout my interview process.  I should have pushed back further on this but I truly valued the company itself as an employer I want to work for and figured I could make the situation work.  

The challenging part for me is trying to balance a long term career path at a company where I am fully support the vision and love the people, but have come to resent my manager and organization for the position I have been put in.  Some operate well in an environment of fear based management, I am not one of those.  Again, had this been clearly communicated in my interview process I would have rejected the offer but was misled on the culture along with who my direct manager was.

Additionally, I have grown increasingly disappointed at the lack of career interest from my manager and working with me to put a success plan in place to progress my career in a way that aligns with my goals.  Instead, I have to fight for time with my manager who would prefer to live out of salesforce all day and doesn't value the concept of human interaction which is strange given I am a sales rep who interacts with people (externally and internally) as part of my core job on a daily basis.  

Somewhat comforting is that I am not alone in this belief.  In 1 year at the company and this organization, I have witnessed a handful of people leave who have started after me because they too were lied to as to what the job entails and who the manager is.  This does not impact me directly, but I am sitting here puzzled as to how I was ""lucky"" enough to end up on a team where morale is near 0 while we're at a company where everyone seems so happy and grateful to be part of.

I would highly encourage anyone considering the opportunity to join this team or company to truly push your recruiter to confirm upfront who the hiring manager is for sure.  I understand that unknown circumstances can pop up and organization changes happen frequently; but I also know I am not the only one getting tricked into working for a manager that no one wants to work for because they cannot lead by example or bring the best out of their people.  

I was also sold on the tenure of leadership, only to find that my manager, and those on the same management team are comprised of first time managers who barely have more experience than the actual reps; some have less relevant experience yet still found a way into management.


Lastly, in the 4.5 quarters I've been part of the team, they haven't hit once.  While most sales leaders probably inflate the team's performance to candidates, this team is definitely not achieving 110%+ as was told to me during my interview process.  What's worse is that management does not shy away from hanging performance based plans over your head if you don't conform, even though 70% plus of reps are not even close to reaching plan.  Perhaps a revaluation of quota, accounts and go to market approach is needed prior to ruling by fear."
1753,LinkedIn,Great Company- Terrible Org to Work In,2020-02-26,3.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,The company is great and talks a lot about skill development and opportunity. The company culture is great.,"The Talent solutions org is quite political. No one takes action, everyone just brainstorms. There are too many cooks in the kitchen and constantly changing processes without clear communication. Projects are consistently half baked without any follow up."
1754,LinkedIn,Wokrked for over 4 years full time,2020-02-25,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,Excellent company culture and the previous owner founder is just beyond kindness and humbleness.,After the acquisition by LinkedIn things did massively change which is probably normal given any transition or acquisition.

I am inspired every single day by this team. The involvement and support from senior leadership is unheard of and the workshops and constant 1v1 for professional development throughout BLP is a testament to how much LinkedIn wants us all to succeed and believes in us. This company has many amazing things happening. The best is yet to come. 

The BLP Management and Leadership Team are extremely dedicated to this program and take feedback exceedingly well and make change all the time. I can't say enough good things about this program.

Nobody knows who are GCO at LinkedIn itself.  Recognition is in quantity over quality,  effort is not recognised in GCO (everyone is just a number).

If you are someone in your late 20s to early 40s, you will enjoy it for a bit but you won’t learn much and it will reflect as you interview for roles that require proper experience.

Relatively easy sell as sales are only competing with their own online linkedin products. There is no solution selling as the company is just selling their “member ship database” in 3 different formats. As a result, too much free time on hand.

2 groups of leadership. Experienced hires from legit tech firms who are enjoying the no stress environment and can’t be bothered to do anything since they made it.

After awhile you see how poorly trained some of the middle management it.

It's difficult in many orgs to get promoted. Lots of work to do, but little reward.

The recruiting and hiring process is SO LACKING. I've applied to several internal positions, and each recruiter I've dealt with knew absolutely nothing about me before speaking - and I mean nothing.

We are treated and respected as adults who will get their stuff done and the results show. 

The benefits? Far and away the best out there - better than any other tech company from what I know. 50% 401k match up to annual federal max (so after a year, combined nearly $30k between your max/company contributions).

Budget is allocated so managers can do a team building activity each month, and travel is easily had when needed.  There's also a big focus on personal development, and I did transform as a leader while I was there, taking advantage of in person and virtual training, speaker series, and learning from managers and senior leaders.","After several years at LinkedIn I started to see  the ugly side for what it was. I saw how e-staff seem ""amazing"" in front of a crowd but are often arrogant jerks if you actually have to work with them. People cower around senior leaders trying to keep them happy and there is a lot of deferring to the most senior person in the room. I also saw good people get pushed out and overly-political and ruthless people get promoted (though I say that having been promoted twice while there LOL). 

When I left it had become way too bureaucratic,  too political, and too fearful (crouching in a protective position vs. innovating and actually ""taking intelligent risks"").  Also don't join LinkedIn unless you love meetings - the company value of ""Collaboration"" means no one is empowered to make a decision until you get a dozen people on board, requiring 30 meetings to get there. It can be collaboration at its worst.

Most of those round of Sr managers are shockingly clueless and power mad.  2/3 of the Directors/Sr Directors in SRE are below average, so make sure if you are going into SRE you hire on with the one good director.  Ask around to know who that is.  Everyone knows.  Don't take a job with the badly led teams.  you might think it'll be fine, but it's not worth the facepalm blisters you'll have."

2005,LinkedIn,Needs leadership  and sales process maturity,2019-04-18,2.0,Relationship Manager,"Revolutionary product, great office space, very very diversity-minded","A lot of management should've left the company when it grew from a start-up to a corporation. Their lack of experience shows and is only compounded by high school-like bonding/favoritism of individuals off their teams. Be ready to join many pointless happy hours to become well-liked by your manager... or suffer being handed a bad territory of accounts. 

If you're an experienced salesperson, it may not be the best company. The company is product-centric, not sales and service-centric. Means you will spend a lot of time working around the nuances of administrative tasks like billing issues, contract creation, customer service (virtually nonexistent Customer Success team), navigating the outdated CRM process, creating client presentation collateral (subpar product marketing team), broken dashboards, etc. 

The best way to be successful is get a lucky account/territory that is bound to grow a lot or simply put your head down and take ownership to work through all the sales productivity gaps. Important to note that there is a ""sales productivity"" team, but nobody knows what they do and there is zero way for the sales organization to provide feedback to help improve the very apparent issues. 

Overall, if you want to have flashy Instagram posts and free beer on Thursdays, LinkedIn is an amazing place to work. If you're a salesperson seeking a fulfilling, sustainable career, it's best to search elsewhere."

3. Hiring process can be frustrating to outsiders (i.e. candidates trying to get into LinkedIn).  It is extremely hard to get hired by LinkedIn, super competitive.

Be patient, yet proactive (recruiters have been known to forget to follow up with candidates regarding 'Yes or No').

2047,LinkedIn,Great Company. Not a lot of opportunity,2019-02-28,3.0,Account Executive,Best benefits across the board,"The Company:
This is a high turnover company.  Account Executives are constantly in and out with no way to move internally. 

In  the last year I have seen 6 very skilled sales people leave due to high quotas, poor leadership, and not being able to move up in the org. Every team from time to time will have a ""plus one"" on their team. This person is there to help the team while another person is put on plan for not hitting their quota. While this is set up to be a learning role it ends up being a reminder that someone is there to take your spot at anytime. 

Account Executives did make a lot of money when quotas were attainable, but with the Microsoft Acquisition quotas went up  and more people were hired. This created less opportunity for everyone and it doesn't look to be slowing down.  

The Role: 
This role is a Sales Development role primarily. You will spend most of your day prospecting out of an excel doc. 

The sales process is easy. The tools sell themselves and you just need to find the people who can afford this solution. 

Leadership: 
There is a a lot of time put in to learning and developing. If you are lucky to have a manager who has been here a while you will get a great learning experience. If you have a new manager this is going to be much harder. Most of the people who have left have had new managers who weren't properly trained to develop people or work with them.

The Right Fit: 
Currently in Sales Development or SMB sales and killing it. You are used to a high quota and a transactional sale. Maybe you have some customer service experience as well. This will come in handy as you do need to hand hold clients and get them using the products correctly. You are not looking to move up while at the company and know going in that you will have the same role for as long as you are here.  Expect to make 80K/ year all in"

Completely acting against its values and when you ask about those values the response is the bullying. HR doesn't want to involve in anything, it is all managers decision. Firing people just before their probation period ends withouth any explanation. And extending probations is a trend now. HR is constantly sharing anonymous feedback about employees to the management secretly. Nothing is kept confidential. Favouritism is the key to success. Over looking managers and harassing acts are welcomed.  I can't understand how it became that bad and unwanted in the last couple of years.

Management supports this child like environment as it gives the the feeling of power and doing good. sad thing is they foster an environment of hate and discontent among the real workers. Turn-over is very high even at top management levels. This is a very political in its daily culture. You either are a complete yes person are you go no-where very fast.

2086,LinkedIn,Best company I've ever worked for,2019-01-13,5.0,Relationship Manager,"You get amazing benefits - wellness allowance, shares at Microsoft, subsidised health insurance for you and your family, onsite gym and free classes, free breakfast and lunch every day. I work in sales and one of the other benefits is that every year, they send all sales people overseas to their regional sales kick off. 

Generally, I feel like management is very good at listening to feedback. There is a culture of providing and taking in feedback and engagement surveys are run every 6 months or so. After the results are in, there is time taken to review it and share it with employees (at the company, regional, local and team level). Honestly, an amazing place to work!","The base pay isn't great but when you factor in all of the benefits you get, it works out."
2087,LinkedIn,"Great company, retains culture with scale",2019-01-13,4.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"- Culture has scaled with the org because of great leadership
- Benefits are pretty good
- Lot's of smart people to learn from
- Continuing education encouraged","- Some questionable hires in the past year, less inspiring people
- Pay is very average, could definitely be paid more at most tech companies in the city. You make much more money working for one of the American offices even when comparing it to the cost of living in each city
- Although benefits are good, in Canada you're given much less than the US based offices. For example, no unlimited vacation (actually very little vacation, only 3 weeks), the US offices actually shut down the 4th of July week as well, services like massages etc. not offered in Canada
- Sales effectiveness is not super effective. Not great sales training in general, tasks more so just waste your time
- Internal movement is very difficult and extremely time consuming"

My team is pretty small, but strong and growing. We have a lot of influence across sales, eng, and product, which is great. Really happy to be on this team at this time.","Not necessarily a bad thing, but sales and marketing seems to trump tech at LinkedIn. If you're not sales or marketing, maybe take this into account. 

Also, while the culture is positive, it can be a little alienating to people who aren't ""rah rah"" types. 

Not the most diverse workforce. People are great, but there's a general frat bro/sorority girl vibe in my office."

Somewhat open culture.,"Competition within the company can foster innovation, but it has been taken overboard. There are tens of overlapping projects, few of which are maintained, all of which were originally designed to replace all the others, and yet none of which can be removed or replaced. The IT team largely lacks effective leadership, and has a three-month horizon (anything that will take longer than three months is automatically squashed as being impractical, will never get done, etc.).  There is no overall view of goals, or where things are ultimately headed, other than ""break things, get stuff done, and have fun."""

- Benefits are great. Free healthcare, food, unlimited PTO
- Top talent; very smart and engaging professionals
- Industry leader with sizable market share
- Beautiful offices with snacks, great conference rooms etc.
- Incredible mission statement and enterprise wide supported objective to provide economic opportunity to the entire global workforce
- Top of the line senior executives. Jeff Weiner may just be one of the best CEOs in the country

Sales Productivity Operations:

- Front line employees (Associates, BPMs, etc) are incredible people. Smart, easy to work with, collaborative and goal oriented
- The ability to streamline and improve the sales experience is a leading edge position
- Horizontal in nature therefore you are exposed to several LOBs and other sales focused teams","LinkedIn:

- From a talent and recruiting perspective, the company is overly focused on individuals with brand names on their resume... Many talented professionals are ignored because they didn't attend a certain university or work at an industry leading firm prior. Additionally, there appears to be a very large emphasis on hiring young and avoiding older applicants
- Young, aggressive and somewhat political. You'll never escape corporate politics, however due to the target recruiting demo, political posturing and in-authenticity is fairly prevalent as young professionals are looking to make big moves early in their career. Major power brokers are usually people who are able to navigate the political landscape seamlessly which typically requires a person who is unafraid to self promote while stepping on peers in the process. In addition, self recognition is encouraged and creates a weird, tacky non stop elevator pitch that you see bleed over onto the platform
- Over diversified product. Way too many irons in the fire which dilutes the effectiveness of the product which provides a platform experience that is 'meah' when it should be revolutionary. The focus seems to be oriented towards a jack of all trades master of none approach
- Pay is slightly below mean for the industry

Sales Productivity Operations:

-  Poor leadership. Whoever established the Sales Productivity Operations (SPO) org (still very new org) appointed leaders with pedigree and really impressive resumes. Unfortunately EQ and leadership abilities were completely overlooked. Point of fact, one key leader has had countless HR complaints and has weekly coaching sessions on how to better connect with people... At this level, these skills should be table stakes, not something you have to coach and coax. Interactions with some of the key leaders range from 1 on 1s with eye rolls, frequent interruptions, excessive phone usage while others are talking, laughter at suggestions, belittling in front of peers and micromanagement to the Nth degree. Put simply, the key leaders inside of SPO are a complete nightmare to work for. When you tell people who you work for outside of the org, the reaction is typically the same - empathy and offers to help facilitate inner company transfer.
- Toxic environment. As a result of the leadership, Product Managers are not encouraged to think or act independently. Strategy and execution are both dictated to you. Retention reflects the environment as the org has trouble keeping butts in seats longer than 6 months. As an example we had a top tier Senior Manager who decided to leave after 6 months, mainly because they were miserable working for SPO leadership.
- Over reliance on the consulting skill set. Since SPO leaders have top 3 consulting firm experience, there is an over reliance on getting people in from similar a background. As a result, it creates an echo chamber and a superficial problem solving modality - throw it on a slide, use some of that sexy consulting jargon and move on. Thought and strategy that approach the root of an issue or objective are not encouraged. This in effect, impacts the output of a diverse workplace as it does the opposite of what is intended - creates group think."

2103,LinkedIn,Great Company,2018-12-23,5.0,Client Solution Manager,Very good company to work with,"No cons as such, everything is great"
2104,LinkedIn,It is a disservice to give anything less than 5 stars.,2018-12-22,5.0,Account Executive,"To start, I should first mention that I have never written a Glassdoor review for any company I have worked for, but I had to make an exception - you'll see why.  Before I begin my review, I should first give some background about how I landed at LinkedIn.

I quit my previous job out of sheer disgust of how poorly run an organization it was.  It was a company that had leadership with poor transparency, an antiquated product, and a poor career growth outlook.

As I was considering my next step, I found that I had two job offers at the same time: One from LinkedIn and another from a startup.  I spent hours and hours going through Glassdoor reviews of LinkedIn, weighing the pros and cons of joining a large company vs a smaller company.  At first, I was leaning heavily towards the startup- it's the dream isn't it?? You get in when it is a small size, get promoted more quickly as the company grows and cash out big.  

That's the dream at least. Although I plan on joining a startup one day, most of my friends who are currently working at a startup will tell you that the reality is that most startup careers don't follow that journey, for one reason or another.  As I approach my one-year mark at LinkedIn I look back at my decision to join LinkedIn as the single greatest decision I have ever made in my entire professional career.  Period.

Why?  Let's start with culture. This is a company that has, despite its large growth in headcount over the last few years, SOMEHOW managed to maintain an extremely positive, friendly, energetic, and downright FUN culture that is BETTER than most startups.  It goes SO strongly against the stigma of a mundane, lifeless, corporate vibe that I always incorrectly assumed engulfed companies as they get larger. Boy was I wrong there... End of quarter is literally amazing.  I closed a deal, spun a wheel, and won my entire team a round of mimosas.  On my way back to my desk I passed a cart with people handing out food and blasting celebratory music.  

Second and most importantly:  When you join a startup, your growth is limited, for the most part, to the effectiveness and competency of the one VP/manager you work for.  When you speak with LinkedIn employees, you will constantly hear talk about how incredibly high-caliber and intelligent every employee and manager is that works there.  LinkedIn is selective.  And the sales managers at LinkedIn are legitimately some of the best sales minds on the planet.  More time-tested managers, combined with world-class peer talent means one thing:  more readily available collaboration to bolster your personal and professional growth.  

Third:  Perks.  The treatment I receive makes me feel like royalty.  I get a freshly catered, free breakfast every day, a freshly catered free lunch every day, an in-house barista who makes me an amazing latte every day, and a kitchen stocked with literally everything.  Oh and I forgot - FREE health insurance.  Yup. FREE.  In addition, $2,000 EVERY YEAR of flex dollars you can spend towards wellness (gym memberships, personal trainer).  LinkedIn always has your back and has you covered...  And I can also tell you that when you get treated like a serious professional, you start working more and more like a serious professional. I can go on about the perks, but I think you get the idea.

Fourth:  Best-in-class leadership.  Witnessing this has been such a relieving contrast to the poor leadership I experienced in my previous company.  Leadership does everything right.  If there is a new policy they make and they hear negative feedback, they make adjustments and do so transparently.  When things are going well revenue-wise, they use it effectively to boost morale.  If there is a stretch of things not going well revenue-wise, they remain positive, they remain professional, and they always succeed in helping us keep the bigger picture in mind.

At the end of the day this is a company that does everything right.  Their attention to achieving excellence in every last detail of every part of the business, from culture to operations to coaching to feedback loops to employee recognition - is unparalleled to anything I have ever seen.  Shame on anyone giving LinkedIn less than 5 stars.","My biggest hesitation in joining a larger company was stagnated career growth.  I was worried it would take me years and years and years to get promoted compared to a startup.   Biggest irony, fast forwarding one year, is that I could care less.  Why?  Because of all the reasons outlined above, I am so focused on being better at my current role and continuing to grow, my title is the last thing on my mind.   I'm not seeking a promotion because after being exposed to so many talented reps, I realize that I'm not ready!  And that's fine.  Makes me wonder how many unqualified people in startups get promoted even when they have gaps in their selling abilities, and then teach newer, impressionable reps suboptimal ways of selling as a result...

In approaching my one year mark, I have not been promoted, but I haven't viewed that as a con.  Longer promotion time is what you sign up for when you join any larger company, but what is considered a ""con"" to some people, doesn't really matter to me."

My review is solely on interviewing this year to return where I unfortunately had a very poor experience. I was brought to final round for a similar role to the one I was previously in, I felt that the interviewer had already decided not to hire me from the beginning of the interview based on my previous numbers in my last few months as an employee. This was something I was transparent about from the get go but he had not bothered to look into until the very end of the process. Phrases were used such as 'why aren't you considering x or y employer' ' Do you not think a role in X might suit you better, less stress for you' ) Basically hinting at the fact that I am a working mother. I was really disappointed by the interview and felt I didn't have a chance at all to sell myself or speak on the other areas of my experience.

Company care about your personal development too, got monthly INDay, and lots of learning sessions randomly for you to attend. 

Yes, and we have a gym built in office with free classes during office hours! 

Colleagues and managers are very friendly, they are very open mind and willing to listen. Team work is a key, you can’t survive in LinkedIn without your team. Because relationship matters!",Can’t think of any right now.
2155,LinkedIn,A lot has changed (and not for the better),2018-10-23,2.0,,"Pros largely revolve around the benefits Linkedin provides: 
- Great benefits ($2K for wellness-related expenses)
- Amazing 401K matching 
- Pretty good food","Cons largely revolve on what may make your day-to-day hellish: 
- Bad work/life balance: this largely depends on what organization you're on. The paid products/infra teams tend to have better work/life balance than the free consumer app teams. 
- Lots of mediocre middle-management bloat: Linkedin clearly promotes people who have been at Linkedin for 3+ years to prevent them from leaving. Unfortunately, these people usually fall into one of two categories: (1) cares about you and means well but puppet of upper management or (2) only interested in management for their career growth and don't care about yours. 
- Extremely top-down culture: leadership pushes their ""vision"" and promotes mercenaries to execute exactly how leadership wants. This is particularly true within the free consumer app teams, whose ""vision"" generally consists of copying one of 3 apps: Reddit, Facebook or Instagram. 
- Sexual assault: heard of it happening by middle-management. Enough said."

Since Microsoft acquisition, mid managers have become power hungry and annoyingly political (something that i've seen change over the 3+ years i've been here). Managers are getting promoted NOT based on how much their team likes team, or how much they contributed, but on how much leadership likes them."
2157,LinkedIn,"Amazing company, difficult industry to sell  in.",2018-10-20,4.0,Relationship Manager,"LinkedIn is a phenomenal company my life completely transformed solely because of the growth and money I made while here. I made lifelong friends and family at LinkedIn. I believe LinkedIn has the best of intentions when it comes to the Employee Resource Groups  that promote diversity and inclusion. Overall the leadership is incredible and Jeff is an inspirational leader. I loved that LinkedIn was always thinking 5 steps ahead and always thinking about how to innovate their products.

Amazing benefits and compensation! The benefits across the board were incredible from 401k, stocks, health, wellness and perk-up, as well as mat/pat leave.","-While innovation is wonderful, you can't forget about the products that got you to where you are. I don't feel that resources were adequately aligned to older product lines in the talent solutions space. Constant site outages and product issues with Recruiter and Jobs.

-Quotas are ridiculously high and difficult to hit especially in the talent solutions space. There are HUNDREDS of competitors and though LinkedIn has a great product, the competition is gaining traction. This should be accounted for in quotas. Be prepared to sell against a lot of companies and to lose budget to newcomers like ZipRecruiter/Muse. 

-You will maintain the same book of accounts which is great for building relationships with customers however your quotas will still rise even if your book is tapped.

-There is no work life balance, too many product trainings, middle management is wishy washy and there is little to no consistency across the board with performance standards.

-Tenured upper management resigned consistently the last few months I worked there which to me was concerning. There was no room for them to grow and the culture changed from what it once was.

-Lots of red tape since being acquired by Microsoft but thats to be expected."

We realize we are lucky to be granted the ""right"" to work remote but we are your top performers, maybe we should be treated like it. As you grow and your family grows you should be able to work remote and be supported the best way possible. 
-Raising quota's so high that a majority cannot hit will cause you to lose alot of employees over the next 3-6 months. You change quotas to be higher but you can also lower the quotas when you realize something is off."

Lots of opportunity for penetration in a competitive market (especially smb and mid market)","Like with any organization, there are weird cliques. I had the unfortunate experience of being told verbally I was working for one person, and then after being given a verbal offer was transitioned to work for a woman that is legitimately a miserable human being. From day one, condescending, eye rolling, telling me it was an awful / weird onboarding experience. From there it was essentially “working me out” as they call it in big tech. People talking trash about me to my face or in code right next to me. Lured me from cushy gig at a competitor with RSUs and cash sign on, only to give me a 46/100 on a sales simulation I had already done twice to get hired. Totally subjective, made it very clear they thought it was a mistake hiring me during the very first week. “Open honest direct” is a part of the culture, yet it was more or less sarcasm, condescension, and high school antics for me for 90 days. Family first, relationships matter etc, yet some cat lady who doesn’t know how to manage people, who walks around looking like she hasn’t slept in a week telling me “this isn’t for everybody” daily. She was in the office maybe 10 times during my “tenure” there, yet this is an inside sales job? 

Awesome company, just make sure you vet out your manager. Lesson learned!"
2169,LinkedIn,Not what it Used to be - Dublin Office,2018-10-05,2.0,Senior Account Manager,"LinkedIn always used to be and promoted internally as a company where you could start at the bottom and grow out to be a in a leadership position no matter what market or line of business you worked for. Given that you perform well and you are generally considered a good employee ofcourse.

Some perks are great like perk up and the free food but the rest can be tedious and time consuming to use so you'll end up not using them.

The people at LinkedIn got their basic needs like food, water, etc. covered so they are very friendly and kind and happy to jump to the bar with you for a brew and help out on the work floor if you need help.","Today, there are incredibly bureaucratic rules and policies that make it difficult to get promoted and grow in your career. You could be stuck for 2 and sometimes 3 years doing a job you don't enjoy doing and have outgrown because you have to be in your role for a certain period of time to move ahead regardless of your performance or skills.

If you start in sales development, like one of my colleagues, you need to be there at least 2 years to get into a sales role regardless of your market or performance. When you are a Relationship manager or Account executive you are also required to be at least 3-4 years in your role to get promoted from Associate to Senior RM/AE regardless of performance or skills. Of course in the meantime the pressure is massive to get high results and also contribute through L and L which is an internal KPI - basically doing work for the management that they don't like doing or are too incompetent to do instead of actual value added to the organization.

After 6 years if you are lucky and 7 - 8 years of going through the aggravation of being in the company far away from home, where you go from Sales development if you are unlucky -  all the way to a senior relationship manager or senior account executive, you finally made it and can experience first hand how difficult it is to go through the politics of getting into a leadership position:

Internally, 90% of the time, LinkedIn promotes Irish natives into markets like the Nordics, Spain, Italy, Africa, Benelux and France across all business lines as the Irish natives know each other well. DACH doesn't even have a single German speaking manager. The Irish natives also seem to deserve leadership roles regardless of knowing anything about the market or the language and since these are internal promotions they naturally lack leadership skills. Externally they hire a few native language speakers that are usually just smart enough to follow orders and old enough to never care about moving upward and thus no threat to the Irish management.

Most people that are not from Ireland, for this reason leave within 2 years as known by HR and if LinkedIn is lucky, it takes them a bit longer because it's difficult for them to get a better paying  job back home. The stress, lack of development and high expectations and crazy rent prices still make them leave eventually though."

If you are Asian or Caucasian, it's very likely that you'll experience the same reverse discrimination I faced during my time at LinkedIn. I sat through countless ""diversity"" talks and felt increasingly excluded from LinkedIn's hallmark ""inclusive culture."" At LinkedIn, there's a stark difference between invisible diversity and celebrated diversity. The celebrated diversity here is race.. the invisible diversity here is socioeconomic status, sexuality, academic background and age. LinkedIn will shove a narrative down your throat that encourages you to feel immense guilt and shame if you're a ""privileged race."" News flash, being Asian doesn't mean I'm automatically privileged. 

Not surprisingly, this leaks into your opportunities for great projects and promotion. I was told by management to underperform towards my quota-carrying role because it promoted unhealthy competition against less privileged teammates - in that case, salary me and I will happily underperform.

Speaking of salary - don't expect to make a high one here. They consistently underpay the market because they want ""people who love LinkedIn for the opportunity and not the money."" I'll never forget the number of entry-level hires that told me they were working Uber, Taskrabbit, or depending on their parents to afford to live in the city."

The BLP-GS program is a reflection of LinkedIn's great culture. It's a glorified corporate summer camp, full of bonding activities and events.","The BLP leadership team wants to attract top talent around the country. However, they do little to retain that talent. The BLP program scams college students every year, promising interesting projects and career development. This program is glorified sales funnel. The recruiters will tell you that you have the career mobility to work for a non-sales team and even convert full-time to marketing, operations, or talent strategy. However, this is less than 10% of each class. You'll be pressured to move into a sales team for a full-time offer as well as threatened to be moved unwillingly to Chicago (their sales hub). In Sales Development, you'll do the same thing over and over, 100+ times a day, every day. All the Sales Dev associates are extremely burnt out, bored, and unengaged. The only thing that keeps the sales machine going is LinkedIn's larger company culture. The compensation reflects how much the company values you... and most associates are supported by their parents because they cannot afford SF rent on the salary. If you want to keep great, top talent... give them interesting projects and the opportunity to have a meaningful impact on the company. BLP knows they can no longer recruit from top universities because these graduates almost always find better opportunities elsewhere. They've started to look at lower tier universities to increase their retention."

- Flexible work schedule -- a lot of managers do not sit in your office (obviously, depends on the organization you are in) so they are flexible about WFH as long as you are performing your job
- Salary is decent (not the most competitive or the highest.... but it's offset by all the perks you get from the company)","- For a company that is in the talent business - helping people find jobs -we are really bad about internal movement to different organizations/roles. It's extremely difficult, and there is no bias towards internal candidates. They essentially want someone who already has done the job vs looking at transferable skills and keeping talent at LinkedIn. It's a real bummer, as this is a key reason why great talent have left LinkedIn to pursue their dream job at competitor companies that were willing to ""take a chance"" on them.
- A lot of ""high performers""/""high achievers"" have left the company, so the leftover employees are mostly there just to do their job and go home. Not that this is necessarily a CON - but just something to point out. If you are looking to really learn and grow - fast - this is not the place for you.

Most sales managers should at least know the value proposition of the products you're selling. These managers don't, and they focus all their time on finding their own 'next play'.

A lot of great talent is also leaving the company because of limited mobility. Don't expect to get promoted quickly if you're beginning a sales career at LinkedIn. It's a big organization now, so you'll have to wait your turn and compete with 20+ SD reps for 1 AE/RM role."

- very sales driven (if you like that environment)","- a lot of the culture and values are just on paper and not really followed through by all
- a lot of politics between teams 
- a lot of hype on how internal career opportunities are promoted and encouraged - but no real evidence that these really take place even if you are a high performer and year in and out you are delivering - there is little to no support if you are working for the wrong manager or in certain areas of the business which do not offer many opportunities at all 
- a lot of bureaucracy and manual processes to be able to keep up with your work
- in client facing roles you have to prepared to handle a lot of ambiguity at times
- individual teams can suffer under mediocre management
- a lot of ad hoc requests from management to provide additional information and input at very short notice - making re-prioritisation necessary frequently and can make you feel like you can never really get a good structure in place
- workload in teams can vary significantly and as a high performer you rather get overstretched than supported (making it feel like you are punished with more work rather than be praised for the great work you are doing)
- there can be quite a bit of favoritism (certain people get all the high profile projects, key clients and stretch assignments) in well established teams that can make feel other team members feel less motivated."

I have worked at other tech companies and I can say that this company spoils their employees with some really great perks and there are a few things I like about working here such as:

-Amazing health insurance for my family
-PerkUp credit to be used annually on a number of pre-approved items (gym membership, massages, child care, home cleaning)
-Free breakfast/lunch/snacks 
-Opportunities to travel (if that's your thing)
-Women in management positions 
-Working for a well respected brand 
-Discretionary time off
-Awesome maternity/paternity leave policy
-Pay is above average","The downside of working at LinkedIn is that I quite literally have to sacrifice my work/life balance and sanity for the perks mentioned above.

-Onboarding did not prepare me at all to work at LinkedIn or my role
-Very little training for new hires. You are thrown in and expected to just figure it out.
-Poor communication across teams in multiple offices
-Long hours (although they will blame it on your lack of time management)
-My particular team is incredibly difficult as a working parent 
-DTO is nice but missing days does nothing but hurt you
-Even when I am not working, I'm constantly stressed about work
-Everyone made a big deal about InDays when I started as a day that you can take off and focus on the theme of the month but my team does not participate.
-My role is more of a sales position than a customer success position
-Doesn't feel like there are many opportunities in the Chicago office to grow

The culture on my team is very different than what I have heard at large at LinkedIn, which is unfortunate, as I feel like I have a very different perception of the company. From my first week of training, I felt that coming here was a mistake because I was forgotten about and not prepared to do my job.

I left a very enjoyable job that did not pay as well to come to LinkedIn and it feels like I have given up my peace of mind for more money. Not a great feeling."

2427,LinkedIn,Didn't realize how good it could be (spoiler alert: it is GREAT),2017-11-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Daily I realize that there is nothing I dislike about working at LinkedIn. I've worked here for more than a year, and each month gets better and better.

The leadership is obviously so invested in every single employee and the greater impact we can make on the world together. No matter which global office I've walked into or whichever global coworker I've met, the culture feels the exact same throughout.

Flexibility and growth are gospel truths here at LinkedIn. My manager knows exactly how I feel and exactly what I hope my Next Play is, and I know they have my back. They're also super transparent in celebrating people's wins--whether promotions, lateral moves, or even transfers to a different company in a higher position. We care about the people, not just the output.

The people I work with are the best part of LinkedIn. Even with remote team members across the country/world, it's easy to develop deeper relationships with them, and we know how to have fun during and after work hours. 

The perks that LinkedIn provides are designed to make us successful, not just bribe us. Yes, the food is OUTSTANDING, but it's not just to keep us in the office. I actually see more people taking the time to sit down with coworkers and enjoy a meal now, than before when everyone would just eat at their desks.","It is a global company, so there are always silos that can be hard to break down when working on cross-functional initiatives. But once we realize there's a disconnect, I've been impressed with the steps taken to solve communication for the future.

I feel really bad for contractors who don't  have access to the same great perks/benefits that full-time employees have. I wish that there wasn't that imbalance!"

Great Brand to work for, should help you get another job in the future","Only as good as your last Quarter, can hit your year early the minute you start tanking they'll be onto you 

Management are sometimes Sheep, just Yes Men. 

Promotions go to the wrong people most of the time, complete brown nosers. Who waste everyone elses time doing projects just for them to look good with no real outlay. You could be a subpar rep just dragging yourself across the line but if you someone's best mate you'll go far. However I'm sure that's not unique to LinkedIn but so omnipresent here. 

You can try get on with hitting your number but you'll have to do all this extra stuff that isn't in your role to look good

With the Takeover,  trips like GSK have been pulled which is understandable. Rumours of commission structure changing so reps make less money. 

Fixed Salary is way behind other SaaS Vendor's like SFDC/Docusign  

Made do ton's of trainings that are irrelevant 

No Autonomy in the role like before, everything is micro managed like your a child.

If you've a bad manager you're going nowhere, they've give some sales roles and sales manager roles to people who haven't sold anything in their life and frankly haven't a clue how to help you."

2460,LinkedIn,My Perfect Next Play,2017-10-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When looking for my next career move, LinkedIn was an obvious choice.

The leadership team does a great job of keeping the employees informed of what is going on including opportunities to keep learning and growing in your career. I feel I have the space to make decisions and improve things. I'm extremely grateful to be at such a great company that values investing in employees. 

Learning is an important aspect here. Offering us free access to LinkedIn Learning, teacher led courses and InDays, days give back to employees participate in company sponsored events or to take the day and spend it as you wish. 

During my time here, it's tough to find any cons. The benefits package was competitive and includes ""wellness"" money for reimbursement for gym memberships, massages, dog care or childcare. The offices offer breakfast, lunch, dinner (at some locations), snack, coffee, gyms, happy hours, game rooms, band rooms and I'm sure plenty of others that I am forgetting or have yet to explore.","This being the largest company I have worked for, as I have ramped, it's still challenging to navigate who does what, who you need to connect with to move projects, etc. There's a lot of process to get up to speed with, but I have seen my manager and others give new hires time to digest all the information and continue asking questions to process it all. 

Getting things done and clarifying roles and responsibilities can be slower, but again makes sense for a larger company.

LinkedIn has some great products, but a lot of immature sales people that do not have a lot of street experience.  It shows.  The other thing is communication.  A friend of mine applied at LinkedIn.

-- Pay is good, as per and slightly better than market wage. But if you compare with a slightly smaller company, you will get paid more.
-- Great office and infrastructure
-- Free Cabs and Gym","-- Lot of politics, as usual in large companies
-- Red tape and Backbiting
-- Slow growth, you will grow faster elsewhere in smaller companies and will also get paid more but the cushion will be gone, if you decide to trade with it.
-- Puppet HR team as usual. Don't expect anything different compared to Indian IT sweatshops. They will do surveys and other drama but all of that is just political show

The GCO and the customer service team is not one of the best places to work though. Dysfunctional and crumbling middle management, no innovation and no learning opportunities. Makes it difficult to advance your career since you would be stuck doing the same thing everyday and will get blunt overtime. Do not join GCO department and move out as fast as you can. Managers will ensure you taste hell.

They will give you fancy titles every 6- 10 months so you will feel you are growing,  then it's easier to retain you with the same pay. They will also modify your job title so that you aren't able to market yourself easily.

But these things are common in all companies and you really can't blame them. There were some layoffs and people were fired recently before Microsoft acquisition, so join with caution."

Working overtime during monthly and yearly close sometimes even 10+ hours in a day 
Promotion based more on filling the place of the person higher up who left than on performance. Sometimes people promoted 6-8 months back got promoted again.
Salary is low for the current market and the yearly increase is almost nothing
Too much difference in knowledge and communication between the teams - some teams help each other while in others people are struggling. 
The analysts in the on-site projects are treating the ones in the Prague office more like ""helpers"" than like equal colleagues not sharing all the insight on the project and not inviting them in all the calls. 

Overall it's a good start for a graduate - you have the possibility to earn quite a few things, not only process related but also how to manage time, however not recommended to stay more than one year as nobody is appreciating the commitment."

2628,LinkedIn,Senior Software Engineer,2017-04-23,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,The only pro is above average compensation.,"Managers are very good at lying. Whereas Uber's negatives can be easily seen at its surface, LinkedIn's management are masters at underhanded tactics, and at crafting a positive facade on the outside. I think the key considerations for managers are plausible deniability and what they can get away with.
Highly political and high stress level, both of which create an unhealthy work environment with lots of finger-pointing that are often accompanied by lies and distortions. The senior management, especially Jeff Weiner, have little idea of what is possible and reasonable, so their management technique is to squeeze the employees until the people or the software etc break. This is the reason for the above average compensation, because many people would otherwise escape as soon as they can.
Extremely hierarchical company, with little respect for rank-and-file employees. Managers are unjustifiably assumed to know better, and obedience is expected. There are a few teams with good managers that shield the engineers, but what I describe is the general culture. Instead of rational and thoughtful discussions, throughout the company one often hears the conversation-stopping reason: ""this is what Jeff wants""."

The managers in my team are very difficult to work with and they love to command over their people. The direct managers spend more time gossiping with each other and managers of other teams. They either spend time traveling or taking photographs. The M2s sit in a corner together all day doing nothing. It's better to have one of them instead of two as they both are together all the time doing the same thing. Senior Manager never comes to office but when he comes he is at the smoke zone. Lots of feedback is provided in skip level meeting but there is no action taken. Everyone on the team is frustrated but no one has the courage to talk since we are snubbed if we voice our opinion.

A lot of ego despite the internal propaganda that there isn't.  I also found LI  to be highly political and not focused on creating the best results.  Senior leaders in the US including the CEO and his immediate team simply are not great business people (look at profitability over 10 years - and Lynda, the latest in a long line of gaffes) and focus too much time on their image within the company and externally.  I've personally encountered racism and gender bias and when it was raised to HR, some action was taken however nothing ever came of it and no changes were made.  To be fair I think there are some great teams at LinkedIn, however these are not the norm and what you will likely experience, should you join LI, is a dysfunctional environment where it is very difficult to get things done and make a substantial impact.

There is also a transformation program that allows eligible employees to shift their career trajectory altogether and work on/acquire a different skillset from the one which they started off with.","The company has lost some of its start-up feel with a bigger bureaucracy in place and as always, there is a lot of politics in play here (not unique to LinkedIn though).

Reputable brand.  Some managers are great. Flexibility to work from home (but this varies widely depending on your managers' personal philosophy). Experience here will get you further after you leave than when you're there.","LinkedIn's culture has become less culture and more cult as time has gone on.  If you don't ""fit"" with a team and attend every little post-work happy hour, you won't get ahead and will noticeably be ostracized.  Middle managers are promoted based on personal relationships or the school they attended more than their performance or qualifications and are largely parrots of what the Directors are telling them to do with very little ability to affect real change.  Summer Interns nearly exclusively come from Ivy League schools for no reason, despite a mission to empower youth and provide opportunity for everyone.  Internal mobility is not as prevalent as they would lead you to believe - many internal opportunities are never made available to current employees or end up being given to external candidates with little explanation why.  They claim to be a ""members first"" organization, but the every day free member rarely if ever came up in conversations about the future of the business or all-hands as time went on.  As they grew, I watched LinkedIn turn into a typical corporate bureaucracy with roadblocks and red tape at every turn to get things done.  Business seemed to shift to care more about the bottom line than the member or customer.  The salesforce is all extremely young which heavily weights why LI's ratings continue to be so high because it's often someone's first job, so of course they're going to think it's great to get free food and ride scooters. It was extremely rare to see an employee over the age of 45 or so. While they do have diversity and inclusion initiatives, this sometimes seems to only exist to be able to report on it rather than truly caring about diverse thought and experiences."

Free food and snacks, good parties, company wide trip to Vegas etc. Generally - the people at LinkedIn are awesome and you will meet a number of friends for life here.","Below the very top level - generally poor quality management. The reality is that LinkedIn offers a great working environment but doesn't pay above the industry average so doesn't attract the very best managers - for ambitious ones it is more a good place for them to get on their CV then move on to a well paid role in another tech firm. 

Account exec role isn't structured to do large deals - you do one deal and pass the account onto a relationship manager. Companies more often than not use a first deal to test the solution on a small user group. Causes much frustration amongst AE's as they put a lot of work in for a small deal - then a year later a less experienced RM takes an order (often after very little effort or customer interaction) for a much bigger deal and gets all the credit.

The Account Exec role is very hire and fire. In the time I was there a number of AE's got terminated in their first year (often for missing one quarter of target, or simply because their manager didn't like them). No Relationship Managers (or sales managers/directors) were fired in that period - it is a much easier and better role - although not fulfilling if you're an out and out salesperson that wants to do deals - they generally just process renewals and the quality of salesperson in the RM world is much lower.

Lots of uncertainty with recent Microsoft acquisition - culture will almost certainly change for the worse and who knows what kind of place LinkedIn will be to work in a year."

I truly respect Jeff and his Team, but not the managers in Bangalore location. GCO is the worst group to be a part of. You will need to kill you self-respect in order work in GCO. The company has very good values, but no one follows them. During the skip level meetings with HR and Directors, they would ask us to be open, but when you give open feedback, you'll be under the worst manager's radar. You will be targeted all the time. I've seen a lot of good people leaving the company because of the managers, and their worst behavior. 

There are a lot of gossip mongers on the floor, and if someone doesn't like you, you will be unnecessarily have to face the consequences. In fact, I was one of the victims. My manager has ruined my career, and forced me to resign. I tried escalating this issue to Akshay, but I thought not to waste my time because people doesn't know the meaning of honesty. There was no exit interview. If your manager doesn't like you, you will be treated very badly at the time of exiting the company. I was humiliated too on my last working day.

My manager who has ruined many lives is still in LinkedIn, and leading a bunch of inefficient people. People has no guts to complaint against her. 

Jeff, please save the sold talent which is wrong hands in Bangalore.



The close associates of director, and the managers would get promoted. It is not a place for talent."

I was with the company for three years as they went through hypergrowth and doubled their headcount in Asia within two consecutive years, and was fortunate to move through different roles and worked with amazing leaders (managers), mentors, and colleagues. The culture was great, benefits were top notch in the industry, and I woke up everyday feeling a great sense of pride to go to work.",I honestly can't think of any!
2846,LinkedIn,Some good people but uninspired company.,2016-09-05,3.0,,"- Great benefits
- Brand name
- Talented IC's
- Your work has huge scale
- Good company to learn communication practices and strategy","- Unambitious in projects and hiring
- Unambitious with overall company goals
- A lot of upper management seemed like a large echo chamber. Big on phrases and methodology, small on execution and imagination.
- Low salary for big tech co's"
2847,LinkedIn,Sales,2016-09-05,4.0,Sales,"Excellent vision, Strong US leadership, strong on culture, and flexible work hours, social employees","US is where the power is, no P&L decision making outside US.  Becoming a larger company with processes and harder to move quickly"
2848,LinkedIn,"Overall good culture, great benefits",2016-09-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Transparency, great benefits, good compensation",Controllership dept is a mess. Too many immature and young workers there that back stab a lot. Managers are supposed to keep confidential information confidential but they don't. Interesting to see that this team got to be so different compared to the overall LinkedIn culture.
2849,LinkedIn,Bad Maternity leave experience,2016-09-02,2.0,Product Manager,Free (and generally great) food. Smart colleagues. Lots of mandatory fun events like a company wide chili cook off and team offsites.,"There is a lot of implicit bias at LinkedIn. The gender ratio is pretty balanced at low levels, but the opportunities for growth are still limited to a boys club. 

One effect of this is that I have never seen anyone in the product management or product marketing orgs have a good return from maternity leave. When these women come back, they are put into less visible and less interesting roles...or in one recent case, pushed out of the company within a year of coming back. These are capable women who are seen as non capable by the senior leaders the minute they announce their pregnancies. As a true example, when I announced my pregnancy to my vp he replied ""congratulations... I think."" 

There is a lot of lip service around the length of leave and benefits to new parents, but the biggest benefit is to go back to a job that you care about and...I haven't seen that happen."

Amazing food, free gym / fitness classes, monthly InDays to do anything you want, inspiring CEO, lots of support available to interns, fun intern events (Disneyland trip, paintballing, speaker series, etc.), amazing culture, good pay, sooo many perks, the list goes on and on...

They house the interns in the same apartment complex so it was really easy to meet other people, hang out after work, etc. This summer made me feel so spoiled; it felt like summer camp! I was worried that all of the other interns would be the stereotypical ""CS nerd"" type but that was certainly not the case. You can tell LinkedIn focuses a lot on culture fit and that is apparent in their hiring. I think the intern program is the perfect size. They keep it a little smaller than some other large tech companies which means more of the interns can get return offers. LinkedIn invests a lot into their intern program and it is very apparent.","Gained weight from all the good food!

Best of all is what LinkedIn provides.  I never would have ended up at LinkedIn if not for my LinkedIn account.  I am proof that their product works, for free even.  I do not carry a premium subscription but it didn't keep me from being sought out by recruiters on a regular basis.

- Some good talent still remains in select teams, very scarce though
- Once a company that retained great talent, though not anymore.","(Review applies mostly to engineering tracks)

- Extremely political. Rising in the ranks depends on who you can brown nose. Not merit/output based. If you have ambitions that you think you will work very hard in your first couple of years and get to a respectable position, this is not your place at all. At this point, unless you really want to cruise through and rest&vest, this is not your place.

- Mid-management have no vision of the products they lead, teams they manage. For most teams, that is pretty bad. For infrastructure managers, this is suicide. Yet since it is more imperative to actually make buddies with upper management than actually deliver something, these people do get hired and promoted, and you watch in shock.

- Talent leaves very fast due to aforementioned reasons. Extremely heavy brain drain at this point, especially on the infrastructure and engineering tracks. A previous review from last year said B players hiring C players. At this point, it is more like D players hiring H players. The level of interviewers dropped dramatically, and the hiring bar has been lowered so much just to be able to keep staff on some of the products.

Big companies like LinkedIn, Google, and Facebook hire contractors to do the grunt work and they're basically considered as the working class of the company. Most contractors work hard to become permanent meanwhile most full-time employees don't do much just to fly under the radar. Sad to say at LinkedIn that is exactly what happens if you're a contractor. There are no promises to extend or convert unless you kiss up to the right people. It's all politics at LinkedIn and you will work on a project that goes into a black hole or never become anything. Full-time employees are encouraged to expand their horizon, present their ideas, and do whatever their heart desires but only to be shut down by budget cuts. It is not all rainbows and butterflies at LinkedIn, most people stay because of the perks but in the end working day in and out for free ice cream? definitely not worth it.

Some of the managers in Content Review team and trust and safety treats women in a very disrespectful way. They micromanage them to a great extent where women cry on duty because of the illtreatment. An organization of such a stature is doing such things and there is no one to hear the story of the contractors who work day and night because they are made to work so. Contractors are asked to do night shift  without giving transport. At night they switch off the AC and nothing is available except water. Contractors suffer a lot and when they want to discuss about their issues they are fired immediately. It is a trauma for every contractor who work there.

We are expanding and gonna double our headcount at the Dublin office from the current 1000 to 2000 ppl by end of next year. 

Definitely a recommended career change for anyone who is multilingual and who can deal with a fast-paced, growing and international corporation-environment. 

I can honestly say that LinkedIn is very competitive, your choice whether you focus on the core job or push yourself and totally own your career by taking and identifying global projects and constantly learn new skills. 
With Lynda and the great training opportunities internally progress is really up to you and depending on your time management skills and work-life balance management. 

There are thousands of new positions internally and the company always prefers internal applications/referrals. 

The competition is huge though, so if you are a challenge chaser you have to make sure that you constantly exceed expectations and so that you can progress. 

Managers are pushy in terms of getting the real best out of you and help you develop, doing so by not micromanaging you. 

Definitely not a startup any more as there is massive hyper-growth in the Dublin office (EMEA HQ with new office in progress), but managers are fortunately still very open to suggestions regarding any reasonable process-,workflow-,even core job changes in case you have a plan in place how to maybe pilot a reasonable responsibility change within your team first, then if it's succeed, even globally.

So be honest and constructive, act like an owner and do take intelligent risks and never stop learning. If you remain to be committed and motivated along the way, the hard work will be appreciated and ROI guaranteed. 

Transformation is very welcomed but you are the only one who is really owning your career progression. The opportunity and support is there for you.","- hyper-growth 
- Work-life balance is poor in AdOps and most of other departments as well
- can be extremely fast-paced and so requires very strong pushback skills if you want to prevent yourself from burn-outs
- middle management sometimes lacks on having adaptive management styles
- Can be too pushy and very challenging 
- High expectations but lack of real positive feedback if you succeed in your core job. They want more than that --> transformation plan, action plan, skills development, global and mandatory projects needs to be taken on for promotion. 
- Doing just your job won't be enough to thrive here"

The clarity around the value that we create for society above and beyond financial performance is truly refreshing.

We have a great team of people many of whom I consider real friends. I've met colleagues coming from all across the world and everyone shares the same friendliness, intelligence, and sense of purpose no matter where they come from.

Our business is uniquely diversified across multiple dimensions: B2B and B2C, social media, mobile, providing solutions for HR/marketing/sales/education needs. I get to work with companies of different sizes in different sectors and learn a ton about how businesses operate. The sky seems to be the limit in terms of where I can go vertically within my current function or laterally into other parts of the company.

Free breakfast and lunch every day is hard to beat, along with free snacks and beverages, ping pong, video games, pool, not to mention all the wellness activities like yoga, meditation, etc. 401k matching is as good as it gets, health benefits are covered by the company if you're single. Very little to complain about with regard to perks and benefits.","The ever-increasing size and complexity of the business means it can be challenging to figure out who is responsible for what, or where to find out the specific piece of information you need. It took me a while to figure out what all of the titles and roles actually meant.

Our core business model is fundamentally different from those at what are generally considered to be our peers, but it does feel like Google and Facebook have been more effective at keeping up with the continuous product iteration necessary in this age of Internet / mobile / social media enterprise.

3011,LinkedIn,LinkedIn Really Cares & I Love Working Here!,2016-03-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"LinkedIn really cares about its employees. Many employees have the idea of ""culture"" and ""values"", but I don't know if there is another company that is really guided by these principles day in and day out at every level of the individual contributor and management chain. Everyone is extremely approachable, even the CEO! You are able to walk up and talk to a Sr. Staff Engineer and ask questions about something even if you are a new college graduate.

LinkedIn is very much not a top-down company. High level initiatives and goals can be decided by the higher level management, but features and products come from the people that work on them. Everyone is encouraged to speak their mind and give their own opinion about anything, even if it is a product or service that you don't work on. Your opinion is valued. 

Your performance is evaluated in a matter where working well in a team and making your team output better is rewarded. It never feels like it's you vs your coworkers. We are all on the same team, trying to achieve the same goals. 

The perks are awesome! I believe we are the only company to now have a full week company shutdown for July 4th as well as the holiday time shutdown. Also, we now have discretionary time off (unlimited vacation days). We have incredible, healthy, free food, fantastic facilities, and an amazing music program! Bottom line: LinkedIn cares about its employees and really listens to feedback and actually makes changes according to that feedback!","LinkedIn says that it very much values craftsmanship, however thus far it has shown that it values execution more.

LinkedIn does an incredible job proving to it's employees how important we are in making this entire thing happen. Things that are covered: food, drink, gym memberships and healthcare. Fringe benefits include a very flexible opportunity to work from home (assuming you're doing your job), a ""lifestyle"" allowance that ranges from being able to buy Soul Cycle classes, to having a dog walker. Honestly, it's a bit unbelievable- but mostly amazing.","Sometimes I feel like I'm left scratching my head in regards to career progression in a way that I still don't fully understand. People are held to different standards, promotions happen for some and not others, despite the ""others"" out performing and also upholding more internal values of the company. 

I've seen someone put on a performance plan for hitting below their annual number (in sales this is typical) but in the same breath, saw someone promoted with an even lower percentage of previous year achievement. I still have no idea how that works. 

There are also departments that are literally ruining the client experience (Billing). I just keep thinking ""the soup truck down the street never screws up my payment for yummy chicken noodle soup, how in the hell does one of the best/biggest companies in the world mess up payments for our clients?"" -- perhaps I'm just not keen to the intricacies of back end accounting and billings, but it's honestly the worst part of my job; having billing nightmare conversations with clients."

Every LinkedIn employee is smart, collaborative, and easy going. I love coming to work every day knowing my colleagues are bringing their A-game with no drama. The leadership is awesome, and they take their cultural values seriously- they aren't just motivational posters on the wall.

Also Jeff. I'm just an IC, but Jeff is the kind of leader everyone wants to follow. The vision he sets for the company is big enough, and the empowerment cascades from above. He delivers his communications with transparency and authenticity. Even at the IC level, I can see how my work relates to our mission.","Typical big company problems, knowing who to talk to, being proactive on finding the right stakeholders for various product lines can be difficult.

I love the management philosophy of Leadership, Leverage, Results. Early on in every position, the employee is asked ""what is your next play."" The company is always looking to determine your next role and opportunity.","LinkedIn hires on pedigree and age. Most managers are under 30, directors are under 40, and anyone over 40 is a rarity. Important positions will be staffed based on the university the employee graduated from, rather than work experience. Sales process is being created by recent Ivy League grads who have never sold. Some sales and service director positions have been filled with individuals who are extremely smart but have limited to no experience selling and retaining. The attitude is if you are smart, you can lead any team no matter if you have zero experience doing your staff's actual trade. 

The millennial focus is highlighted in many aspects of the culture. At the 2016 global sales organization meeting, messaging was all about ""you are the best-of-the-best"" and that LinkedIn would not be successful without the individual job you do. Top performers were highlighted in front of thousands of employees. As the employee came to the stage to receive their well deserved award, videos of colleagues commending them were shown. Interspersed among work-centric kudos, the awardee's parents were shown in the videos congratulating their child and stating how proud they were of them. For a non-millennial, it was weird to see their parents congratulating their kid in a work setting. But this is also a company who holds Bring Your Parents to Work Day."

Good fun / social events","LinkedIn suffers from what others on Glassdoor have called a 'cult like' belief in its mission to help the world's professionals. This belief is drilled into people from day 1 and any deviation from the script is met with disapproval. 

Middle Management in the London office is/was poor. I suspect this may be down to the legacy of the old guard who have very generous share options and as a result don't want to rock the boat.

In LinkedIn Marketing Solutions - the sales team are king. If you are not in the sales team, you are there to service the sales team. This as you can imagine leads to a lot of resentment.

In the past year, LinkedIn made a concerted effort to bring in more seasoned professionals to address the process and systems gaps.  The culture doesn't embrace the processes required to mature and move to the next level of strategic and operational sophistication.

Interesting problems to work on","""Old timers"" who have grown up with the company rule the roost and get promoted over and over again without an apparent clear reason, and there is a big gap between how they experience LinkedIn as a workplace vs how newer employees perceive it - little effort to bridge the gap and instill trust and loyalty. 

The company comes first, before it's employees, and it is ""not the right fit"" for an amazingly large number of newer people... This is in spite of the mantra about supporting personal transformation... Please look inward, LinkedIn, because there are many amazing employees with whom you have missed an opportunity to cultivate growth and mutual benefit, and who have left actually feeling demoralized.

Some disrespectful behavior from management in high positions (yelling, scoffing, sarcasm, bias of the ""privileged few"" who are out of touch with the masses, blaming, and other CYA behavior) is left unaddressed and continues on and on - the employees leave and the managers never improve.

Words and actions too often do not match, e.g. ""I really want this to be a group decision / solution so please provide feedback and input"" really means ""Here js my plan already formed by me and now I want it executed, I expect you to support it and bring solutions where needed, if you can't solve the problem yourself then you are part of the problem so get out of the way.""

Expectations are oftentimes unrealistic given the current organizational growing pains, again please empower and support your employees to succeed...

It's a fend for yourself environment and leadership does little to set folks up for success 

General lack of empathy from management and luck of the draw whether you have other strong partners to help you succeed.

Strong bias to protect and reward leadership and maintain the status quo without actually driving towards progress to really help the company succeed.

""Act like a startup"" mantra helps the company move fast but results in too many disparate silo-ed groups, with too little process which is needed in order to succeed at scale by supporting collaboration and leveraging each other's learnings"

Plenty of great things to do if you can budget your time well enough to do it.","Senior Engineers are not held to a consistent standard for both hiring and promotions.

Feedback to any leadership is met with hostility and retaliations.

As far as who we work with, we have a superb staff and a great team, we are still the same as far as being bought out till now. They haven't changed our culture they have added to it. I love this aspect.","What matters most is money in my paycheck. They told us they pay in the 60th percentile of other competitive positions. This is false, we are under the 50th percentile of others in our industry and management just tells us we aren't truely ""x"" position because we don't do what others do, knocking down our skills and saying we are paid competitively per the job we do."

I didn't realize LinkedIn actually walked the walk on employee satisfaction and the benefits are pretty amazing. Love how many holidays have been added and how much the management team and company overall respects what people's opinions and asks.

Everyone can recite most of the LinkedIn values by heart. The Executive Leadership team is extremely transparent and inspiring.  The company is filled with smart people who are striving to build a top-notch product.  And don't forget the endless perks.  Employees are treated very well. Free breakfast/lunch/dinner at cafeterias that are comparable to high quality restaurants. Even the break-rooms are stocked with healthy snacks. Free shuttle from SF. No paycheck deductions for medical/dental/vision. One day a month reserved for side projects/volunteer activities.  I can go on and on. The pride just oozes out of each and every employee.,"401K match wasn't the best.  A load of talent has departed within the last couple of years (old-timers who's stock options have fully vested), which can potentially impact the culture. Can be a little cut-throat due to ""stack ranking"" system, but it also promotes healthy competition."

The leadership for the Tools Engineering org is pretty bad. Many days have been wasted fiddling with some of the development tools.

I've found LinkedIn refreshing in terms of the value placed on no-BS communications.  I've seen it from the truly searching, honest posts by company leadership on diversity, down to the level of my specific manager who tells it like it is with no corporate doublespeak or hedging.

- Sales organization that is focused on the long-term.  Sales professionals are actively encouraged to avoid short-term money grabs and instead work to build long-term, value-adding relationships with customers. These values are lived, not just written on paper and ignored as in most organizations.","- Support for sales is ever-changing and so there is a feeling of onboarding new strategic partners.

They really live up to their mission of creating economic growth for the entire workforce globally and do much to improve each day.  The LinkedIn for Good program is fantastic supporting non-profit organizations through discounts and matching employee donations.  InDay is amazing and a chance for reflection and giving back to the community.  Speaker series blows my mind with great talks that are open to everyone typically.  Benefits are the best I've ever seen.  And the CEO seems really genuine and down to earth.","I had to knock off a star because as a remote employee, I do sometimes feel disconnected from the greater company.  The concept of remote employees still seems new at LinkedIn which is a bit shocking.  The other challenge is the sheer size of the company sometimes makes it difficult to know who to reach out to for things...and of course does make for some bureaucracy."

Transformation is one of the things that we value so much for people here that it is inspiring to see the transformation of myself and those around me as we spend more time here.",Not too many cons I can think about.

I am free to decide the path for my carrier. I am free to decide the path for my project and at any given time I feel like i have a lot of support from my manager and coworkers to achieve my goals. how cool is that. Employees are seen as great assets to the company and they are well regarded and respected by the upper management for what they bring to the table and for who they are. I can and in fact have walked up to a VP or senior VP at their lunch time and started a conversation and have talked to them about my work and ask for help or guidance without any hesitation. sometimes I have lunch a table or two down from the CEO of the company and exchange greetings. they have always been interested in what i had to say, as an employee it makes me feel like I am part of something bigger and my contributions no matter how small count and I am getting appreciated for what I do. its a great feeling. the culture has always been something I have talked about proudly with my family and friends with. Linkedin has grown in size but somehow we all have managed to keep the startup culture alive and well. I particularly enjoy our nurf-gun fights and bicycle races and flying our drones inside the building. A ton of activities are available on campus from the music room to pool table to arcade and guitar hero and other games. collaboration between us is also something I like. Linkedin also knows that employee wellness is very important, after all healthy mind is in a healthy body. I enjoy going to gym on campus and attend Yoga classes here too. breakfast, lunch and dinner is here. no need to step outside the campus!! Like I said, every day it feels like I am home.",My drive is a bit long and since I have to pickup my kids sometimes at odd hours I have to drive and the commute can be a bit annoying.

They do an amazing job at hiring wonderful people who create an incredible culture and make coming to work fun every single day. Career development is one of the main priorities at LinkedIn, and often managers judge their own success by how many of their reps they can get promoted to their next ""dream job,"" which I think it pretty unique. 

There are also opportunities to move, or visit, different offices which I think is really cool!","This isn't really a con, but the company is continuing to grow at lightning speed, which can naturally make some of the ""start up"" feel get lost and expectations grow really high. That being said, the culture has remained as strong as ever. 

I'm in the sales org, and we aren't the highest paid sales people in the tech industry. I personally think the perks (free lunch, free health care, etc.) makes up for that, but it's good to know as an outsider."

Limited opportunities outside of the global sales organization in Chicago. If you want to do other types of work, you will likely need to move to the Bay Area.

Not only from a perks standpoint, but managers are incentivized to grow their team members and direct reports to push themselves. Whether this is taking on additional responsibility, presenting in front of management, or coming up with new ideas for a product, people are open to new ideas and takes them very seriously.

- Awesome culture! inDays and events help really cement LinkedIn's commitment to connecting the world's economy. I helped mentor a youth and followed his journey throughout the college application process (and he got in!). You can literally make a difference, in and outside of your job description.

- Perks: Now standard for silicon valley enterprises, but little bonuses like credit for massages/gym memberships. Free food, benefits, a kick-ass 401k plan, and more.

- Career: Since it's a career focused company, managers are more or less open to transitions between functions provided you have done extra work to make your next logical step in your career happen.","- Since LinkedIn's member base trails a bit behind FB and TW, LinkedIn feels like it's playing catch-up at times.

The managers really do help you succeed in life and not just at this company.  I have never had a company be so excited about my personal and professional growth.

The benefits are also amazing.  With now two weeks of company shutdown throughout the year and unlimited vacation it is very easy to get away.  They also have a very competitive 401K, stock purchase plan, and health insurance policy.","The only downside I have seen is that outside of the bay area the available positions are mostly sales or service.  Therefore, if you are looking to do strategy, marketing, or communications you will have to go to California."
3130,LinkedIn,Love my job!,2016-01-21,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"The position I'm in is great because it's customer-facing, primarily via email. Since it's mostly through email, I get to listen to music on my headphones most of the day. 

The perks are amazing - I was able to get a major surgery nearly entirely paid for by our insurance plan (which I don't have to pay for since it's just me). They genuinely care about your well-being, offering fitness classes and sponsoring events related to wellness. 

The culture is warm, positive, and downright inspirational. They want their employees to succeed and grow, so I feel like the opportunities are endless here!","The only cons I can think of if you're looking for a job here is that they're VERY selective about who they hire. I've recommended many people for positions here that didn't get an interview, so make sure you're keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date and interview skills in shape."

3132,LinkedIn,Still seems too good to be true!,2016-01-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Extremely smart and talented team, Leadership models culture and values. The focus on culture and values is amazing - I've worked for many companies that love to list how they are all about ""team work and collaboration, etc etc."" but  never actually give time or resources for those things to develop. From monthly InDays to our All Hands meetings to how our managers structure career conversations, LinkedIn truly provides opportunity for the cultural tenants we have on paper to come to life.","I feel very spoiled working here! Having a hard time thinking of cons. As we grow collaboration across offices becomes more difficult, but management is great about supporting and encouraging this sort of collaboration when they can."
3133,LinkedIn,Customer Success,2016-01-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is an amazing company with a strong culture and brilliant people. The mission, vision, and values are clear and everyone around you is focused and motivated. The benefits are the best I've ever had (breakfast and lunch, onsite massages and manicures, beers every Thursday, tons of snacks and drinks, reimbursable wellness expenses,  401k matching, etc) and you always feel well taken care of if not completely spoiled working here.",This company can feel huge and fast paced. If you don't take the initiative to meet people and take charge of your own impact you will feel lost and overwhelmed (you may even feel this way if you are the biggest extrovert).

3135,LinkedIn,The Best of Silicon Valley,2016-01-21,5.0,Senior Relationship Manager,"It's rare to have a company culture that is as evident in practice as it is in theory. This is an exceptional company and work environment, in the top echelon of tech companies in Silicon Valley for how well employees are treated and valued. Not just in terms of benefits (unlimited vacation, transportation paid for, cell phone bill paid for, $500/quarter of ""wellness"" budget per employee, 1 day recognized per month for professional development).","Can be political, though this is not unique to LinkedIn."
3136,LinkedIn,Most incredible company I've had the pleasure of working for,2016-01-21,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"LinkedIn is really all that you think it would be. I have never been more supported and challenged in my life. You are given enough freedom to prioritize your accounts how you see fit, but if I need help with anything, I also have a great manager who listens and will step in any time should I need him to. 

Aside from the daily duties of my job, there are countless opportunities to build relationships (one of our core values: Relationships Matter) with coworkers. I listed some below:

- Beers for My Peers (happy hour in our speakeasy every Thursday afternoon)
- Ping pong, pool table, Xbox, PlayStation...
- Friday afternoon movie screenings, complete with snacks 
- Free ranging scooters (what's better then a kick and a push on the way to a meeting)
- Subsidized excursions out of the office (I went hiking/wine tasting last fall and it was glorious)
- LUNCH for free! We have a cafeteria on every floor with free food. I love food. 
- ...Well, I could continue this list on and on...but you get the idea. It's pretty cool.

What I find the most cool though it that any value or cultural initiative that LinkedIn says we're behind - we actually take actions that support what we say we support.

The people here are incredible and the only way to describe them is to say.....every time I meet a new colleague, someone from a different team...they are the coolest person I've ever met! They have passions and stories and great personalities. We collaborate and learn together. And ultimately we succeed together. 

Basically what it all boils down to is that I love working here, and you should work here too. We always have lots of openings, so check 'em out!",Not a ton to add here at all.
3137,LinkedIn,Employee Friendly Company with Core Pillars!,2016-01-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Best reasons to work for the company are Culture, Values, Benefits, Transformation. Here's a company that believes in giving back to employees through Inday (1 day a month) where we're encouraged to either participate or engage in activities that are truly transformational (professional or personal standpoint). Moreover, the culture at LinkedIn encourages folks to take ownership/responsibility/accountability and intelligent risks and set a transformation plan. As a working mom, I have the necessary work life balance where I can grow/transform myself through work but also spend quality time with family.",Folks who like things more structured and like being directed may struggle here.

3146,LinkedIn,Starting my career with Linkedin,2016-01-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"Linkedin has an amazing NCG program. Recent grads will benefit from their onboarding resources and ""Startin"" program. My team is excellent. The average age is very low (~25), and the work environment is relaxed but driven. Linkedin is extremely focused on career growth. My second one on one was all about how to start on the promotion track and grow as a dev.","Poor work/life balance. There is pressure to work long hours, not necessarily because the company expects it, but because everyone else does."
3147,LinkedIn,A Great Place to Grow,2016-01-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Outwardly, the LinkedIn site and associated properties is a place for people to connect to new opportunities and to learn new skills. Internally, the company values are consistent with the mission. There are opportunities for training. As an engineering manager, more than half my team received intensive mobile development training. There are frequent tech talks and less formal lunch and learns. Employees attend conferences and speak on panels. We have OKRs which are quarterly stretch goals, many of which focus on personal growth, that everyone is accountable for.","LinkedIn is a large, distributed company. There are time zone, distance, and communication issues that are typical with any arrangement like this. The great thing is that there are very smart, dedicated people building tools to making collaboration easier."

LinkedIn's culture is very strong and actively works to make sure it permeates the entire org. While LinkedIn is becoming more hierarchical and static, there is still plenty of opportunity to make career moves, including horizontal ones.","Depending on the role, hours can be long, but that correlates strongly with the level of importance of your work and responsibility placed on you. Given that it's been several years since LinkedIn was a true startup, stories of rapid career progression are much fewer and farther in between. 
Like with other tech companies, lack of diversity and inclusion is a large issue. LinkedIn should be a leader here given it's unique position in the market."

Our culture tenants aren't just something written on the wall but a value that is practiced and discussed regularly. Although we've grown so rapidly in the three years I've been here, management has been able to keep our culture strong. Health and financial benefits are great, too!","While I think the company is great, each person's experience will be different as teams, managers and coworkers are still comprised of individuals with their own personalities. I've experienced politics and people ""play favorites."" However, I suppose that's bound to happen in any organization. While we practice ""transformation"" here at LinkedIn, I also think we're a very bottom-heavy organization. It's great to see, and know, that we promote from within, but the company would also benefit from bringing in strong leaders for the organization to look to and learn from."

LinkedIn CARES immensely about their employees. Their perks are out of this world. From the AMAZING free food (breakfast, lunch and dinner) to 50% match 401k program, ESPP, RSUs, comp, perkup, I could go on and on. There is no doubt in my mind that my company truly cares about my well being.

LinkedIn also provides us with the opportunity to grow and transform as a person and as a professional. I have never met a community of co-workers who genuinely want to invest in each other's careers and provide their wealth of knowledge so frequently. 

LinkedIn's Mission and Vision are the core of the company. It is rare that a whole company truly believes in the mission and vision. It's also a plus that LinkedIn is trying to change the world for the better and provide economic opportunity for EVERY member of the global workforce (all 3 billion of them!).

From the free food, to the amazing opportunities given on In Day, to the ultra fun and friendly staff; LinkedIn has far surpassed my expectations of what working in tech would be like. I have had more opportunities to learn and grow both professionally and personally in my short 6 months working here then I have ever had. The food is world class and delicious everyday. The Speaker Series that have been offered to the employees are so enriching and add so much value to my life. I even got to meet one of my heroes, Deepak Chopra. The culture is incredible and really makes LinkedIn very unique to other companies. They have an outstanding music program which I am honored to be a part of. I am even a member of the LinkedIn a capella group, InTune. It is such a blessing to be given the opportunity to preform with such incredibly smart and talented peers.

Employee opportunity and growth is a major focus of leadership and management. You are empowered to be open and honest about your career goals, what you like to do, what you don't like to do and where you want to go. If you aspire to be in a certain role, management will help you get there. 

Leadership is incredible. On the few occasions I have engaged with C-level leadership in a small group setting, I have never felt a sense of hierarchy. They are warm, they listen, and they truly care about the happiness of their employees and the altruistic vision of the company. 

We as a company aspire to do things that better economic opportunity across the world. It's a grand vision that each and every employee feels passionate about contributing towards. You can see it in the decisions that are made, the conversations that are had and in the way people here approach their roles.

Instead, I am being catered to in more ways than one (career growth, internal training programs) and being paid to learn at the same time. The benefits are amazing and I'm working with the kindest, smartest, and talented people ever. I am most grateful for all the friendships I have made here.

The coffee is so good it's a distraction.
3229,LinkedIn,Insights Analyst - a nice stepping stone but not where you want to be for long,2015-12-27,3.0,Insight Analyst,"Great work life balance (at least for the projects and tools team, for the client facing team, it's bone crushing hours). The location of the office is very convenient. The team's culture is great, very positive, supportive and optimistic. Team lead and managers lead with empathy and are very open to feedback.","Within the org that I was in (GSO - Global Sales Org), salary for technical individuals are capped at below market, so eventually most technical people go to other companies after a few years. The senior management has a very ""old corp"" culture when it comes to promotions (""pay your dues"", ""let's not set a precedent"", ""we'll talk in a year"") that is based on age and tenure rather than skill. The management structure also favors MBAs managing technical teams, so the technical ICs have to teach their managers, while not getting meaningful feedback and support. This I believe was unique to the GSO and not a problem for other parts of LinkedIn. 

Career path was another problem. There's a very low ceiling within the GSO for an IC. You'd hit that ceiling very quickly and will have to make the decision to either be a manager, or be an IC with a capped comp even though you are providing more value year over year. Within the GSO, management is the holy grail (a bit like old corp) for many people, and because managers don't do IC work, some ICs try to learn how to be managers by getting other people to do their work. It's a talker's culture within the GSO, not a doer's culture. There are more meetings than war room sessions. People sit down and talk about execution, talk to stake holders, looping in everyone but their grandmas, and then get the poor IC who is the lowest paid person at the table to slug it out. Management often take credit for that work by representing it to senior leaders without crediting back to the IC. 

Morale was a problem on our client facing team because their managers are very much ""yes men"" serving the sales teams, that means the client facing team has to work all hours, have surprise quick turn around projects, and are faced with management practices that are contrary to LinkedIn's core values (such as a manager saying ""I'd be careful about your professional image"" when a teammate voiced concerns about being verbally abused during a meeting). 

The senior leadership also has an ineffective way of dealing with talent competition. The comp package seems to be tightly regulated and capped below market, it is fairly easy for competitors to swoop in with what seems to the candidate as amazing offers. The management's response to this has been to create uncertainty with the new position, and attempt to offer delayed rewards (we'll promote you in a year) - basically anything that doesn't involve in materially making good on a better offer. The person leaving will be subjected to repeated meetings with their manager and their superiors to question the candidate's intent, whether if they were team players, and whether they'd want to let their team down. All in all, not a great way to try to win someone back, and makes them more determined to leave."

Also, LinkedIn is known for spamming non-members. Unfortunately it works and there doesn't seem to be a better way to get everybody on board.

The engineers who like to design and create products are leaving the company in droves now that growth seems to be tapering off. The folks who are still around are more into ""leadership"" and ""mentorship"" than doing real work. This creates a vicious cycle where the engineers who like to push stuff take on more and more and eventually realize that they might be better off at a startup.


All in all the things which made linkedin great fun place to work are going away. I think it might have something to do with the fact that are profits are miniscule and continuing to eke it out at our size is a challenge for current management."

Very slick PR, Transparent Communication and respectful collaborative culture on the surface, willing to optimize and scale now. Great potential if it can convert tests in other addressable markets into additional significant revenue streams to their main cash cow Recruiter products. Can either become an even bigger success story in its market regarding world domination and expansion like a Facebook, a Google or Amazon or be the next Twitter or Paypal (Layoffs/Restructure).","Despite 10 years of existence, still relatively young since IPO a few years ago and still immature regarding consistency, predictability and accountability.  Not as great for more senior and experienced profiles as for Millennials to develop themselves (Very limited training and opportunities). Still struggling due to lack of focus and prioritization to grow other total addressable markets like CRM and L&D despite acquisitions and new product initiatives. Still a small town internal mentality, quite passive aggressive, hypocrite culture backstage, where people are very consultative but will do whatever they want afterwards leading to redundancies and complacency, still clinging fiercely and proudly to being scrappy over and over again, which at 300K revenue per employee only they should rethink moving forward. Lots of Operators focused on doing things fast and furious even it means scratching and redoing the same over and over again, but very little strategists -except at the very top- with big picture and collateral damage effect skills willing to do the right things right first time.  

Paradox of 70% of Individuals having a year or less in the company, among them lots of millennial, meaning talented but young with limited experience and expertise, when 80% of directors and up have been promoted from within over the years so lack of diversity of thoughts, making it quite hard to enter their circle, get alignment on new and/or different ways and often facing a very polite and very politically correct but ""been there done that mentality""."

We have no true competitors so we aimlessly wonder. Trying anything and everything. Everything team feels an inch deep and a mile wide.
3312,LinkedIn,Great company with potential but bad culture holding it back,2015-09-15,2.0,,"LinkedIn is a great place to work for those who are just out of college, in the early years/ stages of their career. At this point, one enjoys the various benefits the company has to offer like InDays, days that are organized around a theme such as giving back to the community etc. Other benefits like Free food, gym etc.  Other pros include: decent 401 K match at 50% of your annual contribution, which is 9K USD for 2015. Health care, dental, vision coverage etc. are what you would expect from a silicon valley employer of repute. Finally, you will get a look of admiration when you tell people you work at LinkedIn, generally good for your profile. Work life balance also manageable in some groups, it was crazy times in 2012, but 2015 is much better. You can work from home when you need, some people do more routinely than others, and it is fine.","People seem to think it is a nice place to work with an amazing culture, an opposite of Amazon, while really, it isn't. It is worse, because Amazon does not go around touting its great work culture ,where as for LinkedIn, there is a pretense of great culture, almost cult like, which starts the day of your interview. You will hear all the buzzwords and phrases from the very start. Things like ""act like an owner"", ""relationships matter"" etc. will roll off your tongue easier than your name!

Pretty limited growth opportunities for those with 5+ years of experience. Also, hard to move up if you are not friends/ ex-colleagues with the boss or haven't gone to to a Ivy league school. Your senior management will likely not respect you unless you are a Ivy league or Top B school grad or have worked at McKinsey/ Bain etc. Very very true esp for the sales org. If you have worked for Google or such companies before, that helps too. 

There is a sense of insecurity among line managers and mid level managers, which prevents them from promoting the best talent and instead promoting the ""yes men"". Standing out is difficult. If you've drunk the kool aid and are not hugging every second person you see, you might not be able to move up.

Also, the other review about the top leaders group being an ""old boys club"" - they couldn't have said it better. Spot on. It is a club that only takes people like itself. Another thing you need to do is to act like you are 18 and at your first party. You will see a lot of jumping around, dancing around in sales offsites etc. If you are not a party animal and not good at pretending to be one, be prepared to feel left out. 

Another issue is lack of collaboration across functions. Most leaders and groups are seeking success for themselves and in the process, the bigger goal does get overlooked many a times. It is hard to act like ONE linkedin, very hard.

The culture seems to be better for some groups, so do check with someone on the internal side if you can before you accept an offer. I have heard of great leaders across all groups - sales, product, marketing etc. but also pretty bad ones. So, some research will do you good. 

Overall, it has been a positive learning experience, but can definitely do with better culture, which always starts top down."

Also, with rapid hiring over the last few years LinkedIn really had the opportunity to diversify its mix of leaders and employees vs 'more of the same' backgrounds that were hired or promoted. It's difficult to innovate without fresh perspectives."

They hire some of the most interesting, smart people and it's really amazing to be a part of a company that is making an impact on the world.",The young hires can be a bit annoying and immature.
3351,LinkedIn,Don't work here if you have any mental illnesses,2015-07-30,1.0,,"Honestly, the cons absolutely outweigh any of the pros. Read my cons section further to gain insight into this. They give you a great salary, flexible work hours, and they feed you, but it means nothing if in the end, they kick you to the curb for having depression.","I worked here as an intern for two summers, as well as a contractor, and also offered a full-time position, which I accepted. I was supposed to graduate in summer of 2013 and start work shortly thereafter. However, I've been a long time sufferer of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I missed my summer graduation date and instead graduated in December of that year, due to my health issues. I informed my former boss about my health issues, at which point he reduced my illness to being ""sad"" (demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of depression) and then proceeded to tell me that my full-time offer was rescinded.

This company encourages a lot of physical health, and will even have pee color charts hanging in the bathrooms to tell you what healthy pee should look like, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help with mental health (unlike Google, which has programs specifically for mental health, because unlike LinkedIn, they actually understand the importance of mental health). I still have friends that work at LinkedIn, and they inform me that they are STILL doing nothing to this very day to assist with mental health.

This is a company that will pepper you with gifts, treat you like a king, and make you feel like a part of the family, until you share that you have mental illness. I literally got care packages sent to my home while in school, with hot cocoa and LinkedIn travel mugs and sweatshirts and other absurdities. This company understands how to basically mess with your mind, but not help it.

If you are a software engineer, and you have mental illnesses (you probably do, we're a wacky bunch), do NOT work for this company. They won't help you, and they will just kick you to the curb if you let them know of your situation. Go work for Google instead, since they actually help you AND understand your mental health issues.

This company made me learn that honesty is really not the best policy. Thanks for that, LinkedIn.

TL;DR: Company treats you like a king until you show mental health problems, they do nothing to help those mental health problems, and instead kick you to the curb. Do not invest your talents here, go to Google or Twitter or anywhere else, really."
3352,LinkedIn,Awesome place to work,2015-07-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great perks, great people, great learning environment. Without a doubt LinkedIn is doing a fantastic job at transitioning from a startup to a true large corporation without losing its culture.

Decent internal mobility options.",Was not given a lot of agency on initial team placement. A lot of friction between teams: working on projects that require help from other teams can be miserable and stressful. People don't answer their emails. There's no company-wide documentation standards so you have to find where other people sit and physically go ask them for help with the bad code they wrote.
3365,LinkedIn,I believe in the future of LinkedIn,2015-07-15,4.0,,"Strong mission, culture & values.  Smart motivated people (in Sales, which is what I am in) who work hard, have fun, and are very team-focused (nice change from other cut-throat sales cultures).","Getting bigger, more political, harder to keep on growing as fast as we have been."
3366,LinkedIn,OK place for a starter,2015-07-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Well known brand, company benefits, the product itself.","A very young workforce. A lot of 20 something year olds who are in their 1st job and completely lost in wonderland. all fun all day, sometimes childish. They take everything for granted and will have a wake up call when they work for a non internet company. The culture is a bit creepy as you can read in many reviews, but its true. They keep expressing they are a start-up, but they have been around for 13 years! and they use too many buzzwords. hyper growth, leverage, leadership. Not surprised the company is not making any money. They have their employees focus on side projects which have nothing to do with work, but show ' leadership'. They take out an entire day per month for that. If you are a client, dont expect anything done until next week. 
Furthermore the only good place is talent solutions, this is the only product that works and  where the money is made for the company and for the sales reps.. the other divisions have often people with limited knowledge combined with arrogance, especially outside of the Dublin office (e.g. London, Amsterdam, Paris). Last but not least, their processes and internal systems are extremely slow and can be a real showstopper for clients and will give sales teams headaches."

If you ever get the opportunity to interview here, do yourself a favor and study up, because you will NOT regret it","This isn't really a con, but it's something to keep in mind: because LinkedIn is so good at creating an awesome work environment, some employees tend to get too comfortable.

3374,LinkedIn,Sales Development Specialist,2015-07-01,4.0,Sales Development Specialist,The company lives and breathes culture.

Inspiring and transparent leadership and a great HR team who truly cares for every single employee. Awesome benefits, perks and delicious free food everyday! 

You bring home happiness... and you can also bring your home to work! Work life balance is not encouraged... work-life harmony is!

Ultimately at its core, there is a distinctively different and very strong sense of culture and values at LinkedIn which fundamentally holds the entire company and its employees together. You'll have to experience to believe! It's a wonderful thing!","This place can be very rough / challenging if one is unable to find a fit into... 
(1) the strong culture and values
(2) getting stuff done (fast!), knowing how to have fun, dreaming big

(4) being open to changing and transforming oneself for the better

Middle Management's weakness is very apparent now that leadership is required to motivate sales force.

Name Brand Company for your resume","The title really says it all. This is a boys club and it's easy to tell when you look at senior leadership. What once used to be a start-up, fast and nimble work place has become a political, lumbering corporate machine that's lost it's way. Starting with old products that fail to evolve to the ridiculous quotas that don't make sense, LinkedIn is on the decline.
If you weren't one of the fortunate ones to get options pre-ipo and make your millions to then be jet set around the country to build 'collective tissue' then be prepared for the corporate ringer and to work your way up the ladder tier by tier. (unless of course you went to school with one of the sr leaders and they're hiring you). 
Coming on board as a Relationship Manager? Good luck! Quotas are hilariously high but the mission has been accomplished! Saturate the market, push out the talented hunters and keep those who are content enough to move to the Relationship Management side until they realize they're way more valuable when they leave and can spread their wings.
Wouldn't be a fair review without mentioning middle management. They're a joke. Just look at their profiles and see how many people are in roles they are far from qualified for. And with new layers of sales being created every year, the bar continues to be lowered! There are literally, 5-6 layers of managers until you get to a director level. I'm not exactly sure how many layers there are anymore but it's a ton."

LTS sales in certain regions may struggle in terms of career growth, and you are expected to do much more with limited resource support.

LinkedIn is never lacking of talent in sales field because of its strong employer branding. Getting talents is easy for LinkedIn, If you are seeing a job being posted for a while and not filled, it only indicates the position is not urgent, recruiter doing pipeline or hiring manager is fussy. 

LinkedIn treats sales well with benefits but the growth opportunities are limited. During interviews you will be told stories like internal promotion or so-called ""transformation"", probably also ""young, energetic employees's fast growth"". Such chances happening lesser and lesser, although the company is growing quickly, most hiring managers prefer to give opportunity to candidates with more years of work experience or MBAs, rather than providing chance to internals who want to learn and grow. I did not see many promotions and transformations happened - comparing with a few years ago the company is no longer flexible in terms of giving internals opportunities. 

If you are about to get an offer from LinkedIn as sales, ask recruiter the following questions:
- what is my level? (In certain regions, they lower your rank and even you are experienced sales, you may find your level is the same as junior sales in US who only has 3-4 years of working experience) - this impacts your internal opportunity and future growth path.
- what is the expected growth for my territory? Besides the effort I am putting to grow revenue, what are the supports coming from LinkedIn to help the territory grow in order to achieve the desired result? 
- Is my quota or account growth ratio reasonably linked with the market situation?
- how many people in my team are making number?
- in the past 6-12 months, how many people in this team had been promoted or having a career transformation?"

Jeff Weiner is a visionary leader. 

New emerging divisions (Sales and Marketing Solutions) have enormous growth potential. 

I started my career at Google before working at several startups after which I joined Linkedin. The people here are, in my opinion, of a much higher personal caliber than those of Google. An enormous part of why I love working at Linkedin is the people, and it's clear a huge emphasis is placed on cultural fit during the hiring process.","I love the ""tour of duty"" concept, but it does not appear to have carried over to the sales org."

I went to LinkedIn specifically to advance my career, making it very clear when I got hired that my biggest fear was doing the same thing I had previously done. LinkedIn poached me, so I thought the hiring manager would have realized they couldn't expect me to do the same thing for a year. 

Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened, so I left a year later. Ad Operations is notorious for this in the industry, but it is especially true at LinkedIn. It seems exciting because LinkedIn is an awesome company with very smart people, but it has also grown far too quickly to give real career opportunities to the majority of employees. Many in my department either leave the department or company in order to find their next step. Senior titles aren't really different. They need to seriously reevaluate their advancement structure. 

The middle managers also aren't great. They don't have enough experience to really help support the ICs and are also very lacking in their ability to have career conversations or provide training. Leadership also had a lack of professionalism that I don't think is right to talk about here, but made me lose a lot of respect for the company. 

Big picture - The company is a great, exciting company to work for. I would recommend working here, but not as a Campaign Manager to anyone that has experience in it. Great for a first job, not so great for a second or third."

It's hard to get your foot in the door but well worth it, even for a short period, because you'll learn a lot and it looks great on your CV.  Excellent pay.  Global opportunities to work out of offices abroad, even temporarily if your job allows.  All meals, drinks and snacks are free.  Great social activities.  High calibre staff. If you have a great manager then you'll possibly be there a very long time.","Workload expectation were excessively heavy.  Consensus was, you were expected to work beyond your contracted hours.  leaving on time at the end of the day was frowned upon, even when you'd managed your workload.  Repeatedly extending work hours beyond your contract actually dilutes your equivalent hourly pay significantly.   Living to work instead of working to live is not for everyone.

Because of it, I understand how each team contributes, why each is important, and how I can optimize to be a better contributor myself. I feel encouraged to grow, but never pressured to over exert myself. This is a company that preaches and practices good work-life balance.","I do feel like there is ceiling at LinkedIn, but it is one that is at any established company. It saddens me to know that if I want to make something more out of my career like break into a steady high level 6 figure range or make a few million dollars, I'm probably going to have to move on to a different company."

- Very open to making opportunities for yourself - your manager won't help you, but if you can make the connections yourself, do it!","- Poor management and director level leadership
- Mismatch between compensation and work expectations between groups
- Regularly hires managers externally than promoting ready and eager analysts from within due to over-valuation of an MBA and management consulting experience from the big three (Bain, BCG, McKinsey) despite them NOT being that bright or having people management experience"
3541,LinkedIn,Transformative experience,2014-09-12,4.0,Sales,"All of the previous comments about the food and the perks are true; they definitely take care of their people. The HQ is beautiful, and the new offices in Sunnyvale make you feel like you're at a ski resort. I also can't recommend the leadership highly enough; Jeff Weiner is an inspiration, and the other execs are all driving towards a shared vision. The culture and values of the company are held in high esteem and they're felt throughout the organizations.

I had the opportunity to see, meet, and interact with some of the most intelligent and successful people I've ever been around -- both other employees and people from the outside. LinkedIn brings in great guest speakers. The employee experience itself is awesome. 

I also am now able to use the LInkedIn name to do pretty much anything.

I was part of the Global Sales Org, and while LinkedIn's not slowing down any time soon, it's not for everyone. It's easier to sell LinkedIn products because of the name recognition, but the sales culture needs work.","Theres an IV-drip of Kool-Aid in everyone's arm within 2 weeks of joining the company. You will likely be called out for disagreeing or bringing up any major changes. This gets tiring after a while.

The Sales org as a whole has good leadership in Mike Gamson, but the more down the ranks you guy the more egotism and BS you'll run into. 

Also, don't expect meeting 100% of expectations to be even remotely close to enough to get you anywhere. Not only are the expectations high, but there will be people who are working twice as many hours as you, getting in way earlier, and achieving the same things, and thus looking better than you. There's a culture of working long hours even after the sting by the department of labor, and there were no managerial efforts to curb this. In fact, during meetings people would be praised as ""rockstars"" for being the ""earliest to arrive"" and the ""last to leave.""  little work-life balance. Oh, you'll also be underpaid if you start in Sales Development.

They also have a trend of hiring a ton of really smart, motivated people from ""target schools"" (read: Ivy League and Stanford) and then not really giving them with anywhere to go after their first year or so. I can see this ultimately leading to frustration and burn-out."

Colleagues genuinely care about each other and will do everything in their power to help each other. The learning curve has been steep and I have enjoyed every second.

3563,LinkedIn,Genuinely thrilled to work here!,2014-07-23,5.0,Site Reliability Engineer,"So, there's the obvious stuff: tons of high-quality free food and beverages, excellent compensation, great benefits, etc.  Let's get to the more interesting (and really, more important, stuff)

- Pretty much everyone around is a friendly, down to earth human being.   I feel like I can talk to my manager openly and frankly without any BS.  That's the biggest perk in the world.  VP level and above regularly interact with individual contributors.  While there is a hierarchy of authority, I honestly feel like the management above is there to help me when I need it, not to dictate to me and abuse my work ethic.

- Besides the free food, there are lots of nice little company-sponsored events and things that happen.  You can get professional development training easily.  Your work schedule is generally pretty flexible.  There are lots of little things like this that add up to really make you feel like LinkedIn actually gives a **** about its employees and doesn't just few them as automatons to work until they burn out.

- The pinball machines, arcade games and ping pong tables are nice but the real key is that people actually PLAY them.  I've worked at startups where they had games like this, but everyone was always too busy working themselves into the ground to every actually use them.  If my boss walks past me playing pinball in the middle of the day, neither of us is going to think twice about it.

- Despite the fun atmosphere, we do work hard and in general everyone is passionate about the work they do.  This can lead to long hours for some, but in my experience thus far, long hours are something chosen on an individual basis.  It isn't expected of you, nor are you looked down upon if you take care of your work and leave the office at 5.","Despite the great culture, there are still a few individuals who are difficult to work with -- the same you'd find at any company.  I'd say percentage-wise, there's far less of them at LinkedIn than I have seen other places, but they're still there, standing in the way of progress or taking shortcuts or any of those things that aren't constructive.

My impression is that work-life balance can vary highly between teams.  I've had a good experience, but I think there are others for whom it's a little more of a struggle."

Work life balance = good. 
Each business @LI has a different culture. Depends on who the leader of the business is and the leaders they have hired. Also think HQ has a more positive culture than the sales offices. 
Interviews are dead easy. One reason there have been alot of bad hires.","Culture and values are for chumps...at least in sales. They're a way to keep individual contributors in line. Leadership defied values regularly in my business. It's well-known that integrity is not something this leader cares for. Team leads contacted HR, but HR blew them off. Don't think this is an issue across the company, but it's a major issue in my team. 

Not the best and the brightest here. Compared to the other major tech companies...LI people are just not that smart. Take a look on LI at profiles of the sales people who work here and you'll see. The comp is also average because they can't afford to hire the best. It's also one reason for the amazing reviews. It's a great job for people who don't have a shot at working with and for the best so they're thrilled with what they get at LI.

LI is behind on product innovation. The product is usually a copy of whatever FB launched a year ago.

If your dream is to be a big company that is changing the world, this is the place to be. You can have a life outside of LinkedIn, which is great. It's also not as cult-like compared to places like the big G, which is a huge plus if you're a normal person. 

LinkedIn changed my life. Depending on where you are in your career and what you want, this may or may not happen to you as well.","Open, honest and constructive is the LinkedIn way...unless you actually suggest things might not be that great or that there are problems. If you do, you'll find yourself labeled as ""negative"" and a ""complainer."" So much for feedback being a gift. 

There is very little upward mobility in Talent Solutions these days. Great opportunity for those starting out in sales, but If you're more experienced, you'll run out of options quickly. 

Middle management is the weakest link. Another review mentioned ""they wouldn't be qualified to run a McDonald's"" - while that's pretty harsh, I'm not going to say that isn't far from the truth. Front line managers are great at parroting back the company line on issues, collecting your forecast, and asking ""how can I help?"" - with a few exceptions, very little value was ever added by a front line manager.

Great benefits package.","I second what others have said about career opportunities outside of Global HQ in Mountain View / Sunnyvale. If you want to do something other than Sales, you have a steep uphill battle ahead of you. And anything outside of teams that directly support the Sales Organization is out of the question.

LinkedIn is a very Engineer-driven company, so most decisions are made without input from other teams or clients. And most roles outside of Engineering pay below market standards, but this is softened somewhat by an overall strong benefits package.

It's a young company, so retirement benefits flat-out suck."
3594,LinkedIn,Best company and culture I've ever been a part of.,2014-04-27,5.0,Recruiter,They provide great opportunities for growth both personal and career.

LinkedIn had a lot of growth in 2011 and 2012. 

They tends to hire people over qualified for the roles/positions they are trying to fill and promote long standing individual contributors that have been with the company. Doing this has caused some problems when teams have a lot of senior individual contributors reporting to junior management. 

LinkedIn's Sales Organization, especially Talent Solutions, is over grown with limited opportunity to move up in the company. You will see employees running to other parts of the sales organization since there is no growth and they are trying to find their own career path.

Management always listens to open, honest and constructive feedback, but they never do anything about it. Employees have OKRs each quarter, giving managers only enough time to work on writing feedback on employees for each quarter.

The company is starting to split with so many offices. (i.e. San Francisco, Mountain View, New York, Chicago, Sunnyvale, etc.)

Recognition and awards goes to Sales Org most of the time and frequently.
3598,LinkedIn,Best job of my career,2014-04-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"Pros:
* Good positive culture. There are a good number of bright, passionate, hard working people who want to kick donkey (hey, glassdoor, don't complain about my bad language w/out telling me what words offend your delicate sensibilities) and will work together to do so. 
 * This is silicon valley and work life balance is a struggle at any company but, I think LinkedIn offers a good balance. People work hard because they are passionate. Stepping out in the middle of the day to go to an event at your kid's school is totally fine. Yes, many (most?) people check email or work from home in evenings but leaving work at 5 or 5:30 is also pretty normal.
* Some of the  older reviews (which I read when I joined) talk about politics and infighting. I think that may have been somewhat accurate when I joined but now I feel that there is genuine good culture of cross team collaboration. Things aren't perfect but they are good. 
* Professional development. They want their employees to have ""transformative experience"" in their time at LinkedIn. It's cheesy but that actually has been my experience. I think this is more than lip service. They offer one day courses on things like presentation skills and I recently took a formal (and high quality) 7 day training on a technical topic. 
* Good management. Lots of complaints about managers in the older reviews. The problem was that the company was growing quickly and promoting from within (which is fine) but not giving these first time managers any training or guidance. I'm not a manager but I'm pretty sure they now take this very seriously and mid and lower level managers are given training and guidance. My manager is a vastly better manager than he was a few years ago, I don't believe he accomplished this w/out support from the company. 
* Hiring good people. We have high hiring standards both technical and attitude. Some earlier employees were and still are awesome, some not so much. Hiring was revamped/formalized a few years ago and quality of new hires has gone up and been more uniform. 
* This really is a plus: a couple of people who were awful were discretely let go. This is great for people who aren't awful. I respect and appreciate/management for doing this. No this isn't chilling or scary in any way. It's healthy. Good people attract good people. Bad people repel good people. 
* Perks. I don't care about this type of stuff much but LinkedIn is next door to google and competing for the same employees so there are a lot of free creature comforts. (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, snacks, occasional massage, etc.). I'm pretty confident LinkedIn is not as over the top as google, but it is over the top enough (Kombucha on tap).
* LinkedIn always says ""members first"" and they mean it. That said, the data they have access to is impressive. They know more about your company than your company does.  They know where everyone at your company worked last. They know about their skills. I can't believe that this data is anywhere near being fully exploited.","Linkedin is not perfect but I have a hard time coming up with anything serious, but here goes: Not everyone is great.

Linkedin does not value the project or program manager role, and there is a heavy bias to engineers are all that matter.   In engineering, there is roughly 1 program manager to 50 engineers and you are treated like a ,general dogs body.  If you enjoy doing admin work, this is for you.

Business is moving forward so quickly that the supporting functions are sometimes lagging behind and trying to catch up without all the proper processes in place.

Great Benefits.  Great work/life balance.  Good spirit and culture at the meta level . . .,". . .  however, that doesn't trickle all the way down to the rank and file.  Company has gotten so big that Politics rule the game.  Not a true meritocracy.  If you are a sycophant and walk and talk like the duck they want you to emulate, than the doors will fly open.  If you don't ""Walk the Line"", you will not be given the keys to the kingdom; even if you are the top Sales Rep with the best Quota achievement.  Folks who have never made their Quotas, but have held the party line and played their politics masterfully have rocketed up the ladder.  Where Folks who have been at the top of the board, but have not done a good enough job ""kissing the ring"" have been passed over, or pushed out the door.  
Still a GREAT company and opportunity.  Just be aware of what you are getting into.  This is the most Political environment I've ever worked in.  If you are a savvy player, than you will do well.  If not, then you might meet some frustration.  In which case, I'd suggest you beef up your political game if you really want to move your career path along.
Also, way too many levels of management in the Sales Org.  To the point that a lot of the middle management have no way to contribute meaningful value to their team really (try as they sincerely may)."

HR and Management do an excellent job evaluating candidates' cultural fit during the hiring process.

Work/life balance - In general, managers are not focused on ""face time"".  They trust their employees are doing what they should be and evaluate on performance, instead of politics. Hours are very fair. The only trivial challenge with work/life balance is that the perks and the people make you not want to leave the office.  I am excited to get in the office every morning and have to force myself to leave in the evening.

Employees - There is not a mean or self-centered person that works at LinkedIn.  They don't get hired and if they find their way in, they don't survive.  While many of the employees are former athletes and highly competitive, one of the main aspects we are evaluated on is how effectively we help those around us to succeed.  This makes for a collaborative, innovative sales culture.

Comp and perks - Overachievers are compensated fairly and the solutions that LinkedIn offers its clients are quite impactful, so salespeople do not have to swindle and deal to achieve their goals.  Free catered lunches, a plethora of snacks and drinks to choose from, ping-pong, foosball, team outings... these perks are just the icing on the cake.

At this company, I truly believe that the leadership really wants to help people globally enhance their lives not only professionally but personally.

I started at LinkedIn almost 3 years ago before we went public and the company has done a great job of keeping a ""start-up"" environment.  This can sound kind of cliche but it is fitting in this case.  

Also, the people at LinkedIn are incredible.  I never run across anyone that I just don't want to work with.  Everyone is down to earth, smart and wants to make a difference.  The company also gives you opportunities to do different things which is not always the case at other companies.  Managers genuinely care about you as a person and what you are interested in, not just hitting the bottom line.

LinkedIn also strives for people to have a work life balance.  Many companies say they do, because it is politically correct, but at the end of the day, LinkedIn delivers on this.

I can't say enough good things about the company and it is a wonderful place to work for people in all fields and experience levels.",I haven't experienced anything negative at LinkedIn

Since being here for a year and a half, I've had many opportunities to enhance professional and personal development.  My co-workers are great and I enjoy seeing them on the days that I do come into the office. 

One of the best things, is my manager. She is not only interested in the work I do, but is also interested in helping me balance my workload and have a healthy relationship between work and home life.",Smaller offices don't get all the perks of being at the headquarters office.
3669,LinkedIn,Lofty ideals muddle by the inadequacy of people,2013-11-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"LinkedIn has a very compelling mission objective.
Thanks to their ideals they often bring in great people who likewise demonstrate caring.

LinkedIn definitely believes in training and often times will allow you greater resources to improve.

LinkedIn does a hell of a job of getting people new to the company really excited and mobilizing these people to speak their praises. (Note how long most of the glowing review have worked at LinkedIn).

They best way to describe LinkedIn's culture: ""We are a bunch of workaholics who like alcohol.""","Bad manager's.- Thanks to LinkedIn's hypergrowth we have promoted a lot of new managers who are just candidly bad. 

Switching of standards- I believe this orientates its self around bad manager's many times, they will say one thing and measure by a different standard then what was communicated. Leading to complications, also i have witness managers stop their team members from being promoted, when a hiring manager wanted said teammate. 

Lastly, the hiring experience at LinkedIn could definitely be improved."
3670,LinkedIn,Personal development is genuinely encouraged,2013-11-12,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The management embraces great values — and don't just pay lip service, but really mean them. Amongst these are:
• take intelligent risks — it's ok to make mistakes and learn from them, much better than not having tried
• transformation of self — realizing that LinkedIn probably won't be your last job, and hence helping you become ever better at what you do, to improve your future career when you eventually decide to move on
• valuing talent highly — recognising and rewarding good work","Willingness to adopt new ideas varies across the organization — some departments are awesomely dynamic, others are more resistant to change."

3672,LinkedIn,Great culture and coileagues: the best company I've worked with so far,2013-11-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is a true ""people company"". Of course it is a sales driven company as many internet companies have to be now to be competitive, but either employees (most of them) and senior managers walk the talk when it comes to culture and values. The culture here is indeed the reason why I keep working for this company: it's a culture that appreciates feedbacks and listen to them, making changes either in the products and in the processes; it's a culture where ""transformation"" is not just a word but something that is promoted internally. There's no fear to talk about career opportunities either inside or outside the company and no managers will stop you in a role or in a team because you're performing well where you currently are now. Also, it's a very horizontal company: there are many chances for employees to meet MDs, VPs and Directors, and they are eager to have conversations with them because (I think) they know they often are ""the voice of the client"". A part from the culture, other reasons why I enjoy coming to work every day are the company reputation (it's always nice to work in a company clients love!), the products that I genuinely find innovative, the benefit and the perks (free canteen with great catering choice, free snacks, tea, coffee, etc., chair massage, gym with free classes, medical and dental insurance) the fast paced environment (things change very fast, it's true, but I never get bored and I feel changes are possible) and the hyper growth that can bring to career opportunities worldwide, and eventually the fact that, even if it's a big company, we still know each other and the environment is still kind of a start up (especially in the Sales offices around the world, where there are a few employees and lots of ideas!). In one example, once a year we still get together from all over the world for the Global Sales Kickoff, and this is a great occasion for us to network with each other, hear US management talking about how they see the company going, feel part of a global company.","Even though a fast paced environment can be exciting, it is tiring as well.. At the end of a Quarter, you can feel ""empty"" for how much you are tired! Most of the employees work a lot and this can affect their personal work life balance: even if the company keeps on repeating us to take care of it, I find sometimes practically difficult doing it. In addition, in LinkedIn things keep on changing (i.e. processes, rules, points of contact) and it's hard sometimes to meet your goals and numbers you committed for in the first place. Another con is that sometimes we have the feeling that the company is sometimes too US-centric and that target could be adapted to the different markets and related maturity."

Benefits are great: free food, sport (gym), and a number of other perks. Another part that stands out is InDay where you get to work on a particular theme that is announced once per month. Some days it could be volunteering, another it would be to team up with a different department to craft something interesting which could potentially be a part of our site.

A very positive vision in the company - just love the fact that we are part of it.","Throughout the time it does seem a bit that the company is getting the corporate feeling.

The people here are generally very smart and great at what they do so it's usually very easy to find someone to help if you have a question.",I would say the biggest downsides are typically associated with any large internet company going through rapid growth - new products and versions are constantly being iterated through so things are in a state of flux.

We are very well taken care of! Between the food, events, fitness opportunities, and activities, there's never a dull moment. The LinkedIn Speaker Series are terrific. Music and artistic abilities are valued and promoted.

Benefits are mostly good, 401k matching could be better. Can't beat the ESPP.","Keep in mind, a lot of the reviews you'll see here are from new, or newer, members of the corporate workforce.

In a nutshell, being a 10 year old company doesn't mean you should act like a 10 year old.

Tall silos; turf wars; gossip and rumor mongering; lack of management experience and support; and counter-culture actions and attitudes. People are allowed to ride roughshod over each other and there is a strong culture of fear in some groups. Support is non-existent to those who experience this. It sounds trite, but I also haven't met many genuinely 'nice' people. They all seem too busy trying to prove themselves.

The famous LinkedIn culture is inconsistent. Speak with most teams, or just read the reviews here, and you'll see glowing ones about the LinkedIn culture. Just realize that it does not permeate into all groups at LinkedIn. We are not treated equally or fairly, as some would like to claim. And that can happen anywhere you go, sure.

Be very careful when accepting a job here that you read into the lines of how people describe the group, each other, and their management. I saw red flags but chose to ignore them. When you can't get a clear definition or answer to a question, you should know there is a problem. Unless you're a recent college grad .. in which case, you'll have a blast.

I've been at LinkedIn for 2+ years and the culture has gotten better and better during my time here.  LinkedIn is at a crossroad between our start up roots and the multinational enterprise that we are becoming.  As a result, there are many characteristics of the company such as the hacker/innovative DNA that are very much like a startup while at the same time we have the luxuries and infrastructure of a mature company.

The company does a very good job making sure the first couple months employees are shown what an amazing company they are working for, but the moral and happiness of employees who have been here for 9 months or longer is INCREDIBLY low and the turnover rate is high (management does a great job keeping this out of the media's attention).

* Pains in growing culture: culture is slipping and there is the start of a few too many attempts at minimizing the pain with middle management bureaucracy. 

* Too many product folks building too many things not necessarily aligned to the company goals: there's more then a few projects being built for the sake of engagement. The bigger picture is not apparent internally and for sure externally to the actual LI users.

-Opportunity.  Linkedin is moving at a very fast pace, which opens up opportunities internally to transform your career.
-Perks.  Beyond the standard tech fare (Kitchen, Scooters, flexible working), Linkedin emphasis inDays to focus on passions outside of work.",LinkedIn is a fast moving company. The positive is that this allows for personal growth and opportunity.  Not everyone may enjoy a faster paced environment.
3758,LinkedIn,It keeps getting better,2013-11-11,5.0,Account Executive,"One of the best things about working for LinkedIn is that I always feel as though I have access to our executive team.

This company is ideal for entrepreneurial types, i.e., people who thrive on taking ownership and the effort that doing so requires. It's a meritocratic environment with phenomenal people, benefits, and culture. It feels like there are no limits to what the company can accomplish at the macro level, and what individuals can accomplish at the micro level. And because most people I interact with share that optimism and sense of opportunity, the organization will continue to kick ass in the marketplace.",talent dilution in certain teams

I regularly wonder if it is possible for a company to be more enjoyable to work for. Everyone talks about the perks (free food, great compensation, a work-life balance that is heavily encouraged), but those are just the entry level perks for any serious Bay Area employer.

Employees from support roles to executive management work with integrity and honesty and execute day to day through open and constructive communication. However you will always find a solid balance of humor and fun in any office and a strong involvement with community support and employee development and education.,Very few.....But the 401K Match could be better.

Company has a good vision, wants to do good in the world, and treats employees very well. The overall company mood is upbeat and optimistic. Minimal bureaucracy, strong focus on just getting the job done. Great communication from upper management.

3780,LinkedIn,LinkedIn believes everyone can find their DREAM JOB- even their employees!!,2013-11-11,5.0,Recruitment Product Consultant,"The word 'culture' is thrown around a lot these days... but I can honestly say I've never worked at a company that has a better culture than LinkedIn. Every employee, from senior leadership down, lives and breathes our VISION (Create economic opportunity for every individual), MISSION (Connect the worlds professionals to make them more productive and successful), CULTURE (Transformation, integrity, collaboration, humor, results) AND VALUES (Members first; relationships matter; be open, honest and constructive; demand excellence; take intelligent risks; act like an owner)!

In my opinion, having a 'dream job' means waking up every day excited to go to work. I feel that way at LinkedIn because of the people I work with and the opportunities that I have to positively impact the lives of professionals. I've never worked harder in my life, but I've never wanted to work so hard for a company. And the reason for that- LinkedIn provides the best environment for pursuing dream jobs!! Both internally and for the world's professionals. And I love it!!",Our company is in rapid growth mode- so there is not a ton of visibility across teams (yet)- which leads to duplication of efforts and an inconsistent external message (sometimes).

This company really knows how to build great products with huge potential to help locally and the world.  That's a good feeling.  The foundation of culture and morals is high.  People act as if they're an owner in something special and that resonates from the top down.  It's great to also work with really really smart people.  Everyone is a superstar in their own way and not a lot of bloated egos and aggression.","pay is somewhat low compared to many companies but the pro's outweigh this point for most.  Only when you get older does this become an issue but the company seems young so maybe it outgrows this or is ok with people finding better paying jobs later in life, sometimes feels like a startup (which is good also).  There are lots of process and product gaps that need to be developed so sometimes you have to figure things out on your own.

10.) Opportunities to grow 

I've worked at a company in which management never learned my name. (I was there for a year.)

I've worked at a failing startup. (That was tough.)

I've worked at a lumbering, giant corporation. (Ideas? Forget it. There's other work to do.)

Brilliant people who share the same missiona and vision. It is fast paced and it is something I thoroughly enjoy but like everything else, it is not for everyone. If you are looking to make a clear difference and learn from some of the brightest professional's around then LinkedIn is very much an opportunity to consider. Each day is different and it has been a fantastic experience so far.","As I said, it is not for everyone. It is a hands on role and you are given a lot of responsibility from the outset.

3858,LinkedIn,"Politics, politics",2013-10-17,3.0,Sales SMB,"Like most employees I do love working with LinkedIn, but it saddens us to watch the organisation's cultural values of integrity and flat hierarchy succumb to internal politics. A prime example is the recent flood of over-enthusiastic reviews here on Glassdoor, all posted within the space of a few days, following some very negative reviews just before the month of October. Convenient... When CEO Jeff Weiner, highly regarded by all employees, visited the offices, the entire building was repainted, cleaned and employees were told not to approach him personally and any questions were vetted beforehand.

Working at LinkedIn is exciting and challenging, but you will be putting in the hours.
Your salary won't reflect your skills, only which territory you happen to be stuck with. This sadly cost us some valuable team members. Out of a team of exceptional, stellar sales people, perhaps 10% can expect to hit annual target.

There are some fantastic perks, like free food, entertainment etc, and you are almost guaranteed a great career post LinkedIn, but we'd love to see some changes put in place soon.","Work-life balance, compensation good but not fairly distributed, politics, politics, politics."

Our company culture & values are amazing and I couldn't feel better about working at such an ethical & rewarding place to work. Within the sales org, you will never find anyone who isn't incredibly smart or incredibly ambitious. As someone who's worked at other sales orgs, the caliber of people that work here will challenge you to step up your game. Everyone here was a top rep at their previous org.  Despite the high level of talent, everyone is super helpful & team oriented. It's a great thing as sharing your secrets with others forces you to up your own game to stay ahead. My career has truly transformed being at LinkedIn, and I couldn't recommend working here more enthusiastically.","Our back end sales ops organization is broken, billing in particular but order mgmt and tech support need major help as well. For a company of our size (really any size) even simple tasks take an outrageous amount of time to complete for our ops team. I've been at LinkedIn for 3 years and as fast as our other teams have improved and scaled, sales ops has gotten worse at the same accelerated pace. Our back end sales systems (SFDC, Oracle, etc.) were poorly implemented and their neglect are a large part of the problem as well."

5. Fantastic leadership team - both at the executive level and regionally","I joined LinkedIn when it was still in it's infancy in Dublin and have seen it quadruple in size since I've joined. This brings it's own issues. 
1.There are now more layers of management
2.There are less transformational career opportunities - previously it was ""common"" to be promoted every year this process is now MUCH SLOWER
3.There is more bureaucracy and processes
4.It's more difficult to get to know people"

Many companies boast about work-life balance but very few actually make it happen, LinkedIn has been that and so much more! My favorite of it all? The InDays once a month when everyone in the office takes some time off work and come together to do something as a team.","I work in a regional office, and just as a lot of global companies (or companies on the path of globalization) work hard to find their foothold in the fine balance between giving direction, communicating that, and getting feedback from what works / what doesn't work in local markets - LinkedIn struggles with that too.

Free lunches.,"Less than desirable culture in Singapore. Middle management are clueless, very political and offer very little assistance in growth and development. 

Note to sales people: Don't join LinkedIn Singapore if you want to make some money. No one hits their target. Not because of a lack of talent, but due to unrealistic goals in a ridiculously small assigned territory."

I've been at LinkedIn for over 3 years now and during that time, we moved from several office bases to accommodate our growth, and we're now at our shiny new set up in the West end that we are all proud of and enjoy working within (Free, food and beverages, gym, health classes, great facilities, events, ""InDay"" every month which is a chance for us to take time out to work on an individual or group project that is of interest to us, along with great people to work with).

3906,LinkedIn,Living and breathing the company values,2013-10-10,5.0,Sales Manager,"I have been consistently impressed with the way employees internalize and act on the corporate values at LinkedIn.  It is so rare to hear people integrate discussions about the values into everyday conversation, but here it is what everyone lives and breathes.  It's a growing, good-sized company that still acts like a start-up (in a good way).","Decisions at LinkedIn are driven by influence, so it's extremely important to know the right people.  That can be a challenge for new employees who need clear processes, because so much is shared by word-of-mouth. It can be daunting because it's not often clear who is responsible for what. Luckily, virtually everyone is approachable and responsive. The positive aspect to the flat organizational structure is that it's easy to implement changes quickly."

3908,LinkedIn,Transformational,2013-10-10,5.0,Accountant,"I started to write the Pros for working at LinkedIn as a bullet list, and then I quickly realized that this list can be very, very long. The only way to summarize it is one word - transformation. Being here, I have transformed not only my career, but also myself as a person. Besides getting to do the job I love, I have developed skills and relationships that I will carry with me throughout my lifetime. More confident - check, public speaking - check, get InShape - check, take pride in what I do - check, of course. From inDay speakers that challenge the way you think, to company all-hands that provide amazing insighs, you feel like you're a part of a game-changing culture and company.","As the company is growing so fast, employees are challenged to keep up. It's a pro for me since I embrace change, but the perception depends on your personality."

Most advancement opportunities occur at west coast offices.
3911,LinkedIn,Best place I've ever worked,2013-10-10,5.0,Director,"Open, collaborative environment, lots of energy and innovation, lots of great people willing to share insights and knowledge.",The only real con at this point is the effect of rapid growth and integrating new people into the culture of the company.

It is a culture that celebrates excellence and nurtures success. Leadership is transparent and open, and inspires to achieve rather than manage to a metric.

3926,LinkedIn,"Employee focused, Member Focused Company",2013-10-09,5.0,Project Manager,Dan Pink said that Autonomy and Mastery are the motivators for ground breaking success . At LinkedIn this is exactly what you get - the ability to be self directed and act like an owner,Since the teams are distributed sometimes it can lead to mis communication. But this is true for any global company in the market today
3927,LinkedIn,"The Place to have fun, learn and build awesome products- this place defines employee friendly.",2013-10-09,5.0,Technical Program Manager,"- Benefits

Excellent benefits and good employee engagement.,2013-10-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Employee engagement, Health & Well-being, free foods and snacks, RSU, bonus. Really good culture and values. Love the ""In"" days every month which is a nice break from the day to day business.","Lack of red tape (I know!!), playing catch up all the time, no clear vision. The ELT need to part with some control and appoint somebody in EMEA who can make decisions based on local policies."
3929,LinkedIn,There is no better place to work in our industry.  LinkedIn rocks!,2013-10-09,5.0,Regional Sales Manager,"So many, but it's really about the culture: transparent, innovative, hilarious, heterogeneous--a magnet for the very best and brightest out there. There is as much focus on creating a great environment for sales as well as engineering, in New York as much as Dubai as much as Mountain View as much as Paris.  There are strong career possibilities, with a great promote-from-within reality.  You hear around here that LinkedIn likes to transform the trajectories of peoples careers--and you see it happen every day.

There's a remarkable focus on making quick, informed decisions.  Most work out, but inevitably some don't.  Around here they use the phrase ""Next Play"" regularly--as in, ""It broke?  What can we learn?  Great.  Next play.""  That's a really wonderful gift, and I love that about LinkedIn.

There are maybe a small handful of employers that pay better than LinkedIn, and even fewer that offer better perks.  Food Truck Fridays, free lunch every day, on-site massage, Pilates classes, ESPP, 401(k) match, top-of-the-line healthcare...the list is long, and the thoughtfulness is apparent in every detail.

Lastly, I would say the best thing about working at LinkedIn is the satisfaction of being proud of what you're doing with your time on this planet.  Yes, it's a business, but there's a profound impact this company is making on the world.  Almost everyone I work with feels the same way, and it is a sense that is as palpable and ubiquitous around here as the blue In square.

Advice to candidates: network your way in and have a great profile.

But really, it's a phenomenal place to work.  They'll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.","Sometimes LinkedIn could embrace the concept of Few Things Done Better a bit more than it does.  Not everything is perfect.  

You'll have to get used to the idea of working for millionaires.  There are quite a few folks that made it rich with the IPO, and they're all around you.  It's never in your face...but it slips out when you hear people talk about their vacations, homes, cars, etc.  Not a place for the easily envious."

Management is top notch- some of the most talented execs in the Valley. It's an honor to interact with people like Jeff Weiner, Reid Hoffman, Deep Nishar, Allen Blue, etc., etc., etc.- people that I would pay to hear speak at a conference.
I've heard stories for years- before and during my time here- about how LinkedIn products positively impact people's lives. It feels great to be a part of something that has a profound impact on many people's lives. What LinkedIn does matters.","The company is growing rapidly, so things aren't always clearly defined. If you don't like an agile work environment & company, you may want to consider a bigger, more static company. I thrive in a dynamic environment. However, some people don't."

The growth has been crazy and things are fast and loose as we figure out new space and continue to execute. I love working with so many people that are also working their dream job. You can feel it when you come to work each day. There's strong encouragement for employees to seek transformation and continuing growing.,"Need to improve on streamlining the organization as we grow. Also compensation will become an issue.....our competitors are circling like sharks at sea waiting for us to lose sight of what makes LinkedIn the coolest company to work for.....its employees!

Incredible perks and benefits, including but not limited to a giant cafe built at the Mountain View headquarters that has incredible food everyday, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  We also have a gym on site, and classes offered throughout the day, like yoga, crossfit, zumba, morning boot camps, and running trails.  We have bikes on campus, can work from home whenever you want, work whatever hours you want, take as many days off as you want, free massages once a month, beanbag lounge, video games, ping pong and foosball tables, guitar hero, and rock band for entertainment.  We also get full insurance benefits paid for, and 401k matching as well. 

Once a month, we get ""IN"" days where we work on something other than our regular job that helps our career advancement.  

I can't stress enough how incredible it is, my team and boss are really great too, which always helps.  Even though we can work from home as much as we want, I prefer going into the office to see everyone and experience the LinkedIn culture.  

LinkedIn is super organized and efficient, it really is a great place to work.",The ONLY con I have is traffic coming into work at the Shoreline exit off of 101 North.  I know this has nothing to do with LinkedIn nor is it their fault in any way.

I have worked at LinkedIn Dublin and that's a total different story. The positive side of LinkedIn Dublin:
Initially they could hire the best of the best. So real smart people to work with and learn from. However, this is changing as a lot of good people have left and the company is getting a bad reputation as an employer. 

Another plus is the free food. It's really good food. 

And there is a decent onsite gym you can use. I like it.","Let me repeat what I said at the start. LinkedIn US is a great place to be. I have worked at LinkedIn Dublin and that's a total different story. Here is why I left Linkedin Dublin: 

A cult like culture that nobody really likes and wants to admit. There is too much B.S. and empty buzzwords. For example as a sales rep they say you're evaluated on ""leadership, leverage, results"". That is a lie. When it comes to the evaluations they only look at results. 

Horrible sales territory. Linkedin is good at over hiring for specific countries because they know that certain individual sales reps will never make their quota.  

Ridiculous sales targets. As inside sales you have to bring in way over half a million dollar. 

The relationship with the field sales reps is close to hatred. Field reps stealing your accounts is a normal thing. And the worst part is that your managers in Dublin don't do anything about it. 

The field sales reps are generally of a lower quality than the inside sales people because Linkedin does not have a strong employer brand in most European countries outside of the UK. 

And in general senior leadership in Dublin is of a very poor quality."

4037,LinkedIn,"So far, so amazing!",2013-10-05,5.0,Senior Manager,"Strong values that guide decisions, team is highly motivated, competitive comp and perks. 

Three things that still amaze me: 

1. There is a biweekly all-hands meeting. At how many companies with ~5,000 people is there a meeting where you have access to the CEO this frequently? It's a great way to ensure people know what's going on and have a chance to discuss issues.

2. inDay. One day a week every month to focus on personal or team development. It's something that is NOT directly related to your day-to-day tasks. There's a recommended theme each month, but you have a lot of leeway to do what you want to do.

3. Focus on health & wellness. There are healthy choices in the cafe and food choices on all floors. Everyone's dietary needs are taken care of (dairy / gluten intolerance, vegetarian / vegan, etc.). There's a website with exercise, diet and health resources. You can earn points by exercising, eating well, taking the stairs, etc. to get free swag.","A ton of new folks so it sometimes takes a bit longer to get answers.

Also, the gyms at both Mountain View and Sunnyvale are way too small. Yeah, this will be fixed when Sunnyvale is built out and we have a new 20,000 sq. ft. facility. In the meantime, it can get pretty crowded at peak times."

-The Product: LinkedIn as a product is best in class. I am so proud to work for a company that boasts such a stellar product.
-The Cafe: I don't work in headquarters, but when I do have the fortune of working in MTV - i am BLOWN away by the quality of our cafe. It is GOURMET and the team is lovely.
-Commitment to transformation: The leaders of our company are committed to providing you as an individual employee a transformational experience.","We are growing so fast that sometimes things seem a bit unorganized and overwhelming.

4053,LinkedIn,Most amazing experiance EVER,2013-10-04,5.0,Marketing,"The company culture is awesome and there is a contagious energy in the offices. LinkedIn gives their employees an extraordinary access to a world of thought leaders and professionals that speak to us and answer questions. 

Senior management has a level of transparency I've never seen before and will take questions from any employee for clarification.

The company actually encourages employees to follow their passions and look for other opportunities in the company to leverage their talents.

I was underpaid at my old job, so I got roughly a 60% raise after stock and bonus was factored in.","Very corporate- less than you might think, but more than you probably ideally want.

4061,LinkedIn,Best company I've ever worked for! (and I've been working since the 80s),2013-10-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Values and vision not merely on paper; they really infuse every discussion, every initiative, every day. VERY savvy leadership means we can plan to be around a while, and they treat us as owners of our work and our company as a whole. The people here are crazy smart and most really, truly love what they do -- every day it's hard not to be impressed by workers' efforts and compelled to bring your best. I come from the non-profit sector and have worked for few corporate entities, but I find the values at LinkedIn are steeped in wanting to do good in the world for all people who work or want to pursue opportunities to live their visions (I've personally witnessed this value integrated seriously in work at LinkedIn many, many times) -- I can feel great about the work I do at the same time that I get to experience the benefits of working for a hot corporation. It is rare that even the most junior employee is not recognized for her contributions or successes; employee recognition is like water here. I never really expected to work at a company that has so much integrity, not only internally, but also to prioritize the users' experience, comfort, and protection. It's kind of amazing to work in the Internet industry and not feel like a Silicon Valley cliche: LinkedIn breaks the rules -- in the best ways -- of how new technologies can change lives of real people by holding to solid values and long-term vision. I'm proud to work here.","Smart-growth approach means we often work with less to do more at scale, so pace can be challenging; unlike other self-imploding Internet ventures, we don't throw heaps of warm-body minions and venture-capital money at every effort without ensuring financial support or tactical recruitment of the best and brightest, so there are times when initiatives take off with too few hands on deck. Often the people most involved in working on a project at a granular level have to also manage the project at a global level -- we need more experienced project managers to handle the broader efforts. Emphasis on projects and engineering and brilliant data science leaves us with basic, central administration to help with the most mundane, annoying, and hard-to-figure-out details of the work place."

4070,LinkedIn,Smart people working hard and having fun,2013-10-04,5.0,Analyst,"Everyone is incredibly sharp. LinkedIn is at a great place where it can be selective and attract very smart people, but it doesn't have the arrogance in its culture that is commonplace at Google. I think a lot of this has to do with the company's leaders. There is not doubt that LinkedIn leadership wants to hire smart people, but the culture fit aspect is just as important. I also think our leadership team does a great job of keeping everyone excited about our mission. Connecting the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful is a pretty cool cause to get behind.","Every stranger you meet has an opinion about what LinkedIn should be doing with its product strategy and is more than willing to lecture you about it once they find out you work there. It's not that I don't care, I just have zero input to product strategy and don't like being attacked when someone doesn't like a new feature."
4071,LinkedIn,"Smart people, hard problems, freedom to innovate and time to enjoy life",2013-10-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"The people working at LinkedIn continue to amaze me with their sheer ambition and intelligence. We are constantly solving difficult problems and developing software that is on the cutting edge of large scale distributed systems (most of that software becomes open source which I also appreciate). I love how much my manager cares that I am always doing something that I am passionate about. Should I ever find myself in a position where I am not happy with what I am doing, it would be a simple matter to switch to another team. Perhaps my favorite part about LinkedIn though, is that I feel completely comfortable leaving work at 5:15, leaving me with plenty of time to work on my own programming projects or personal hobbies. Sure there are some people who work long hours and work on the weekend, but they are not the norm.","Coming in as a new college grad, I actually had kind of a difficult time finding other people my age to become friends with. The average age of LinkedIn employees tends to be between 30-40, which I do appreciate since I have a lot to learn from them, but I'm not exactly going to go out clubbing with them. Other than that, the only complaint would be the pace of growth--it's hard to establish good processes for developing and deploying code when the people you work with are constantly changing and increasing. Lastly, considering how quickly LinkedIn is growing, their on boarding program leaves a bit to be desired. I only had three days of lectures, largely about things that were actually pretty irrelevant to my job."
4072,LinkedIn,"Great perks, great mission: helping people get jobs.",2013-10-04,5.0,Associate Web Developer,"One of the only companies to offer me a higher salary than asked instead of haggling, cafeteria serves 3 high-quality meals a day, and what the CEO is most concerned about in business is ""managing compassionately.""  On top of that, you go to work everyday knowing that you're helping people connect and find economic opportunity.","Like any Silicon Valley company, the 40-hour workweek is a relic of a bygone era--although I see higher ups sometimes go to bat for people being able to go home at a decent hour or take a vacation without work emergencies cropping up."
4073,LinkedIn,Love,2013-10-04,5.0,Sales Development Specialist,"The people are amazing, the product WORKS, it's about the needs of the clients not just selling everything and anything you can.  The culture is so supportive and invested in the growth of their employees.  It's absolutely the best place I've worked and I don't feel the stress of a normal sales job that I'm used to feeling.  I'm incredibly happy.","I had to take a step back in my career to come to LinkedIn as compared to other young sales companies they have much more talent and experience on their teams.  It was a tough decision to take a pay cut and start closer to the bottom, but it's been beyond worth it."
4074,LinkedIn,"Good people, good intentions",2013-10-04,4.0,,The employees here really do believe they are changing the world.

Despite dysfunctions in various organizations, the company's outlook is healthy.","I worked in Global Sales Operations for 4 years, so this perspective is unique to that.

Long hours are expected; don't expect less than 45-50 and often 55-60 near the end of quarter. Do not expect management to honor work-life balance by default. Most rank-and-file employees that support Sales work long hours. 

There is dissonance between stated values and actual working values; for example, a commonly spoken mantra is ""members first"" -- yet there are few member support options other than email (no phone center) and LinkedIn is embroiled in a lawsuit concerning spamming new users' contact lists because of an unclear and confusing user experience.

No clear path of promotion for many positions in GSO.

Much of the advertised ""company culture"" excludes parts of the company outside of Mountain View; there is no true ""hackDay"" and ""inDay"" outreach. This leads to ""Two Companies"" syndrome, where one side lives LinkedIn culture and the other doesn't have opportunities to participate.

Middle management is ""dog eat dog"", incompetent, and highly political, which has led to a lack of collaboration between departments and a promotion of the idea that you're on your own."

2) The potential of the company is also hard to ignore -- we're on a trajectory to do great things and the market agrees (as reflected in our stock price).","1) There is a failure to foster and grow talent, leading to high churn and dissatisfaction among tenured employees. I've been here for 3+ years and have been vocal in my desire to expand my role and grow my career. We lack the internal structure to support employees like me who want to stay at the company but need guidance on where opportunities may lie. So people either get frustrated and leave or simply stay to fulfill their vesting period and get increasingly disgruntled in the process.

2) Inconsistent culture and work/life balance: I have only experienced the Marketing team where employees struggle with being overworked and unable to enjoy the ""fun"" aspects of working at LinkedIn. Other teams like engineering and product appear to be the opposite."

The company is going through hyper-growth right now and it shows in both the stock price and campus vibe.  People are genuinely happy to be here and I'm no exception to that. LinkedIn is a meritocracy so instead of hiring people from outside there is a culture of promoting strong performers.  This is true even for managers and I'm impressed by how many managers used to once be engineers at the company.  The company is also committed to staying innovative so there are a number of initiatives which are geared towards encouraging employees to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems.

4128,LinkedIn,Terrible. direspectful for any employee and member... the management is filled with inexperience...,2013-07-30,1.0,,"Free lunch, free drinks, snacks and parties... product, platform, members and clients...","Management in this company is distinctly lacking experience and procedures to follow. They want to position themselves as employers on a par with the likes of Google and Facebook, but they are significantly lacking programmes for staff development and training to make this the case. 

Training repeatedly promised during my time there, was never delivered. Procedures and the ‘LinkedIn way’ of doing things were constantly alluded to but never clarified or laid out through training or mentorship. This was particularly evident with standards and targets, where concrete targets were NEVER clearly communicated.  Requests for feedback go unanswered, quarterly reviews don’t happen (!), and when this is questioned, vague, non-committal responses are provided… again, highlighting the inexperience of the management. 
Standard processes and procedures are non-existent in the LinkedIn Dublin office. Promotion ladders are quickly climbed for favoured staff members, where others are deliberately excluded from application. There was no evidence of a HR involvement with internal departmental management or promotion.  

It is clear that a policy of over-recruiting for certain teams exists as a means to hedge their bets in terms of handling market growth.  Unfortunately, LinkedIn’s  lack of monitoring  or projecting their growth and lack of understanding their customer requirements means that they have no way to predict the volumes they expect their staff to handle… over-staffing in these departments leads to a low case numbers and poaching between team mates in an attempt to reach unrealistic targets.  These staff are kept in an extended probationary period as a way to dispose of them when it becomes necessary.  Unfortunately for LinkedIn, Ireland is a small place and this practice of ‘probationary recruitment’ has been noticed by some of the main recruitment companies. 

The most frightening example of poor management staff handling I witnessed was during the visit of the CEO Jeff Weiner in Dublin, Irish employees were asked to be seated in the front row and meet him whereas the foreign employees from Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and France were asked to step back. There’s a word for that…discrimination.

For a company providing recruitment products LinkedIn’s own recruitment procedures are alarming and considerably off base from their supposed ideals. Calls from initial recruiter outside available contact hours, repeated rescheduling interviews and meetings as managers were ‘travelling’ or ‘sick’ meant that a recruitment period of 6 weeks required 5 interviews, each with different members of staff and HR representatives, and a language test. 

Even after head-hunting and recruiting from other well-known Dublin based companies like Google, PayPal and Facebook, the obvious ineptitude of management levels in LinkedIn Dublin means that many of these staff left within a short period to return to their previous employers. 

It is clear that LinkedIn (Dublin) is still in shaky start-up territory. A massive recruitment push to prove to the American offices that Dublin is effective venture has led to selection of poor, inexperienced managers who, without guidelines to follow or a clear idea of how they want to expand the company (or maybe they do know, but they never communicate them to staff) are flying blind and believing their own hype."
4129,LinkedIn,Billion dollar company with start-up culture,2013-07-28,5.0,,Every employee is committed to the success of other employees. The company really views itself as a team and measures individual success on the basis of how much an employee helps others succeed.,"There are still some kinks in the hiring process and HR organization, but that is understandable given the rapid growth the company is experiencing"
4130,LinkedIn,Incredible Employee Experience,2013-07-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"LinkedIn is a company with a culture of transformation and a priority of acquiring and developing amazing talent. Although the company is public and growing, it's very possible for any employee to make a great impact. Senior leadership emphasizes the importance of sustaining a startup culture. It's important to stay agile, move quickly, and be flexible in order to succeed. This is definitely not a culture meant for those that are accustomed to very corporate, linear, process-driven projects. The greatest part about the company is the amount of passionate people you are surrounded with who are motivated to help you any way they can. 

There are plenty of perks at the company including free breakfast and lunch, food truck fridays, microkitchens at every floor, arcade machines, pinball machines, bikes, scooters, gym, health programs, on-site haircuts, on-site massage chairs, influencer speaker events, shuttles to and from SF, and Caltrain discount programs. The compensation is very competitive with other tech companies.

One day each month, every employee has the opportunity to participate in InDay, where work is optional and the employee can invest in their own development through either LinkedIn-organized events, personal development projects, or volunteer efforts.

I've never worked for a company quite like LinkedIn, and it's amazing how much the company and its employees have accomplished in a relatively short period of time.","The company is experiencing rapid growth, and with it comes growing pains. Internal systems, processes, and support is still playing catch-up with the rate it's growing. The speed of hiring new employees is starting to result in a lot of junior/inexperienced employees or those that may bring bad practices/habits from other companies."

The brand is well recognized so good name to have on your CV.","Management in Dublin are all into the culture of the company and want all employees to enthusiastic at all times but without having an actual opinion of their own. The culture in Dublin is all about using the corporate buzzwords, make sure that you words like  ""transformational"", ""billion dollar startup"", ""ownership"" or ""culture"", creating a environment where well connected employees become spoiled and think they are the best of the best, but probably would not be successful in another major company. 

Success and promotion is more based on who you know and who likes you then any sound business logic. This may be because middle management is very inexperienced, from what I could see most are promoted into role and still trying to learn how to be managers and preferences to support their ""friends"" then make hard business choices.  


Linkedin is  by far the most political environment that I've ever witnessed, manager is always involved in internal fights, instead of working towards one goal they fight for political power. Everyone smiles and says they are your friends by they are looking out for themselves. Making many of the sales people very unhappy but afraid to voice concerns in fear of their jobs.

Compared to hiring standards and creative thinking in other online companies in Dublin, Linkedin is more close minded, managers are inexperienced and staff only looking to get a the brand name on their CV before moving on. Not a good place for people with with ideas of growing.."

Brand Recognizably","Arrogant staff doesn't even begin to cover the stuck up attitude of the team. They are so busy standing up in meetings to tell the managers how much they love working there, that any constructive criticism is seen as heresy, unappreciated and not reviewed seriously. The staff is not nice in general selfish environment that has snowballed to be that way by the snarky managers. 

There's a handful of senior level team members that think it's funny to 'haze' new hires by not acknowledging their existence for their first 2 months. They tweet cruel comments about the other staff members. They also tell other team members when individuals are put on performance improvement plans. So these bad apples ruin it for the rest of the team. Many other team members simply aren't interested in getting to know you or anyone else new or not because it doesn't serve their bottom line. For a sales team, it's funny there's no camaraderie or even general warmth. When you have a company that preaches culture, but management participates in no actual way to improve it and the foot soldiers are destroying it, the decay of morale begins.

Little to no training; it's sink or swim and they like it that way. So longer term employees have to pitch in and take time out to aid the same questions over and over because newbies get no overviews. In reality, it does not set one up as a new hire nor as a senior member as it's time consuming. It creates a hostile workplace where it's a weakness to ask questions and seek advice on improvement and there's nothing in it for senior team members as its not their job. One would normally direct them to their managers, but that's if you actually get time with your manager. They are usually in meetings or traveling so good luck.

6. There are interesting problems to solve in architecture, scalability, etc.","1. The architecture of the site is in shambles. Over 300 distinct services on the site. Not a single person could draw even a quarter of the current architecture.
2. The code base is in shambles. There are no comments or documentation in any of the code base. The wiki may be years out of date
3. Within the last year, culture here has gotten extremely political. I'm afraid to do a great job and discuss what I'm working on because it may cause a turf war.
4. Speaking of culture, LinkedIn's is a ""culture of fear."" We are over post-mortemed. People have responded by going through ridiculous lengths to CYA
5. Middle management is highly variable in quality. Middle managers are promoted by how well they manage upwards, not how well their teams are doing. I've seen people promoted that I frankly felt should have been shown the door based on their lack of professionalism and performance.
6. Engineering is stuck in a vice grip from product
7. When a team is mandated to build a piece of infrastructure, it takes forever and usually comes out as an over-engineered mess that's less capable than the open source alternative they spurned to write it in the first place."
