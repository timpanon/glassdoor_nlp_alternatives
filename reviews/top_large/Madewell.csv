114,Madewell,Don't Be Misled,2021-12-03,1.0,Sales Associate,"Sales associates, especially part-time ones, are usually interesting, dynamic people who are enjoyable to be around- but don't count on having any positive interactions with them at work. Even though most part-time associates are scheduled for 30+ hours a week, management goes out of its way to make sure employees that get along do not have shifts, tasks, or breaks together, even at the expense of store efficacy. Not to mention their insanely high turnover rate, even for retail: every associate and part-time manager that was employed when I started was gone in under 4 months, including persons who had been there upwards of 2 years. 

Management tolerable and even pleasant when dealt with on an individual basis, but their dynamic as a group leaves much to be desired.","Don't be misled by the facade management pitches in interview- management's courtesy and loyalty towards associates stops where their own paycheck begins. 
 Management gets a bonus from associates making sales goal, but flat-out told multiple high-sellers 'no' when they asked for $15/hr and proceeded to hire inexperienced seasonal associates at that rate.

When confronted, management:

 a) denied any wrongdoing/misleading
 b) called employees disrespectful for talking about their pay in the first place (a right which we were legally entitled to exercise)
 c) accused employees of creating a toxic work environment for the management, in addition to starting a 'little union'
d) talked about how in their day, we all would've been fired. 

 On Black Friday weekend, they tasked singular associate with 120+ online orders, and sent other personnel home early even when they offered to help out, just to prevent associate interaction. 

 Associates made repeated suggestions as to how our experience and workload could be better delegated (changing certain layout of store to make clothes more accessible/less laborious to put away, putting more associates on specific task, etc) and were shot down by managers who had never engaged in the responsibilities said changes were related to.

 Management is passive-aggressive and condescending- reduced associates to tears on multiple occasions. Couldn't count on consistent treatment or standards from management because they were so on/off, which put everyone on edge.

Even though almost all retail jobs aren't great in some capacity or another, this one was seriously lacking. There are better benefits, discounts, and base-pay at stores in the exact same center."

117,Madewell,Really wish the managers would step up and take ownership of their behavior,2021-12-01,1.0,Sales Associate,"Fellow associates were approachable and kind
Managers were nice as individuals when they weren't power tripping together","-Hypocritical management, would come over from across the store to keep associates from having any conversations with one another even when the store was slow and then would go gossip for hours in the back with each other

-No regard for loyalty. Management overlooked hard working sales associates who regularly made goal and then hired new associates at a higher pay without increasing any existing associates’ pay to match the new hourly wage.

-Company greenwashes their brand while profiting massively off of fast fashion that’s overpriced for its quality.

-Management lacked sensitivity for eating disorders among associates by constantly pushing diet culture, cleanses, weight loss, etc. even though the company claims to value inclusivity and diversity in sizes.

-No respect for availability or hours initially requested. Most of us were working 32-38 hours as part timers when we had asked for 20-30.

-Exhausting work for not nearly enough pay. 

-Visual designer would regularly take credit for sales made by associates even though she was full-time and didn't have sales goals to make

-Store layout was unorganized and the back was not fire-safe whatsoever, constantly had to climb over obstructions to get to inventory

-Training wasn’t thorough and most of the teaching was done on the fly by other associates. 

-Management was generally condescending, talked to employees like children, would tell us how to do things we already knew how to do while also refusing to train us on things like cash register or enterprise shipping (which we needed to know how to do).

-Terrible system to get shifts covered, Dayforce doesn’t allow employees to see others’ schedules or request others cover their shift."
118,Madewell,Favoritism/ racist/ lazy managers,2021-11-29,2.0,Sales Associate,"None. 

The quality of clothing has changed so not even the discount is worth it anymore",Management is very lazy throughout the whole district. They love to just be in the office. Training is horrible. Company policies mean absolutely nothing because we had a SUPERVISOR who would smoke weed on the job and all upper management and employees knew and yet nothing was done. I’m sure it was because she was WHITE and if it was any other person of color there would be a different situation. This employee was lacked work ethic as well and would go multiple times to the back to smoke. Many complaints were made and yet nothing was done and instead other employees had to pick up the slack. But that seems to be the trend at madewell. Don’t expect to work with a team because the leave out to dry always and you’ll be working hard for no reason.

123,Madewell,Don’t work here,2021-11-25,1.0,Retail Sales Associate,"Absolutely none to share, it is awful","•Environment is extremely toxic and body shaming is rampant amongst management. 
•size inclusivity within products is limited, corporate will send 1 XL per item and rarely sends jeans above a size 4US (27EU)
•Pay is not equal amongst associates, raises were nonexistent until associates started talking to each other. Once management matched pay among associates, they went against company policy and asked associates not to share pay. Then management went on to lie and hire new associates without experience at a higher pay. 
•management lies
•Time off requests are denied because it is a revolving door of associates
•expect part time associates to be able to work 30+ hours per week, when availability changes with school schedule, they make it hard. 
•Associate discount policy contains many exclusions which don’t make sense. Even with the discount, products are not affordable. Target’s Universal Thread collection has the same styles that are more affordable
•Company’s sustainability is nonexistent, not eco friendly whatsoever.
•Management rude to customers and go against company policy at times"

There is a strong demand for more/better results without the additional support, tools or plans necessary to improve performance. The bottom tiers are left to work harder, work longer hours to chase a constantly moving target. Management is incompetent and do not have any plans nor directions. They hide under the guise of “demanding a ‘high performing’ team”. There are few high performing managers, but there are execs that show disgraceful preferential treatments. HR should take employee surveys seriously and course correct on departments whose execs are in low standing or who have continuously received poor feedback from their staff."

flexible schedule","- $12 an hour when they pretend to be a progressive company- i think they assume all associates are rich college girls looking for a part-time summer hobby and clothes rather than an actual compensated job
- consistently violate break policies and don't give paid 15 min breaks for longer shifts even though required by company policy. management has said that ""we decide when those breaks are taken because they're paid so they have to earn it.""
- management is so cliquey and secretive and impersonal, i was interested in a full time position but the open position wasn't even mentioned around the store as an opportunity to move up. 
- management sits on company wide zoom calls in the back all day for hours on end while we're understaffed and incredibly busy on the floor. they also talk so much trash about associates in the back when it's obvious we can hear. even on hot days i have to leave the store during breaks because our break room is too small for us to sit bc the managers are all on their computers.
- not inclusive or interested in diversity at all, almost all skinny white women employees and they don't really care about feedback about what we need help with or ideas on what could be better, only care about what's selling well"

Knowledge of the product is important, but after you work there for a few months, you become really knowledgeable after listening to others describe our denim and leather products.
As a temporary PT assistant manager, you get introduced to the tasks of regular PT managers, without being thrown into the position unprepared. They slowly introduce and teach new tasks, while also quickly depending on you to step up your knowledge and support for the store. I really enjoy this balance.","I think training can really vary based on who is in charge of your denim certification and overall introduction to Madewell. When I first started out, I asked a lot of questions to associates if I felt I was overwhelmed, but didn't want to ask management again how to do something.

If they decide to change your schedule the day of your shift they will not notify you and switch it up on you on days you are not supposed to be working and then blame the employee when it is bad management who is at fault. Additionally, they threaten to terminate employees when inconvenienced, if a winter storm rolls in and you are unable to make the drive to work, they tell you that safety is their number one priority, but threaten to fire you if you don't make the icy drive. Judgemental and gossiping management. You do not get paid enough for what you do and the stress you encounter. If you have a life outside of work, they will criticize you for taking a day for school work, or for exams. If you want to report anyone on the hotline you are unable to because it is almost always down. I put up with this for a while but it just gets worse over time.

Not so great for part time hours. They gave part-timers very few hours at times (some times just 8 hours certain weeks) and you would also have to work on call. They would call day of work to verify whether you were working that day. So your schedule had to be super flexible as a part-timer.

Had a couple managers that weren’t so great but that was more of a personality issue than a company issue. Sometimes felt like they wanted me to make madewell my entire life when I was only part time. Company has had financial issues for quite some time

553,Madewell,madewell is a great retail company,2020-08-26,5.0,Store Director,"For a retail job, it is one of the best companies to work for. The culture was positive and we were expected and welcomed to have a very open dialogue with peers and supervisors. I always felt valued, while still receiving areas I needed to improve on. The leaders always listened to ideas, and felt like they actually considered all of the feedback we would pass along. It never felt as if we needed to “make the impossible, possible” because they were also human and understood it is often a tough situation we are in. But they still pushed us and motivated us to give the best results while trying different things, which I appreciated.","The annual review process was typically based on many variables that were uncontrollable, which would go hand in hand with receiving any merit increases. It was difficult to manage staff and provide valuable feedback when payroll was often cut so tight that you were strictly doing operational tasks on the sales floor and hardly had time to coach the people on the team.

If the company invested more in modern technology, I think it could have smoothed out many training processes, along with customer retention to increase spend habits. The leaders often relied on the store teams to provide a lot of feedback, when now, stores can rely on apps, better customer loyalty programs, and store iPads, mobile POS, etc to help with that."
554,Madewell,The absolute worst,2020-08-25,2.0,Sales Associate,Discounts and the flexibility are pros.,White feminism and microagressions are rampant here.

Madewell has the cutest clothes and its honestly so fun to work for a brand that you believe in and support.,Retail hours can get hard during the Holidays.

Overall, I felt positively about the company culture.","I didn’t enjoy having to pitch the “Madewell Insider” program, especially when we were extremely busy ringing people up. In addition, mostly around peak seasons (back to school, holidays) the clientele could be very entitled and rude. Obviously this had more to do with individuals and not the company but the clothing could be pricey and the people buying that price point of clothing were not always compassionate people (interpret that as you wish)."

582,Madewell,Decent job for a college student,2020-06-25,3.0,Part Time Sales Associate,"- Mostly women work and shop here, also female management (aka no service job harassment!)
- Management could be fun at times, also fun to work with other young women in my age range 20-30. 
- Good discount and cute clothes, can definitely use in any wardrobe beyond just this job. 
- Closing and opening could be fun and relaxing.","- Extremely unpredictable hours (and must work weekends). Sometimes you would get 9 hour shifts or a long close then followed by an early morning open shift. Other times you would get 4 hours every other week. 
- Have to ask for time off during holiday season 3+ months in advance, time off in general is hard to get and communicate.
- Slim to no room for growth or raise. 
- Had to look busy during every second, couldn't stand behind the register (""doing nothing"") even 1 second before someone was ready to check out. 
- Associate sales were in part used for scheduling hours (low sales = low hours, cycle continues)
- Occasional rude/mean customers, management took the side of the customers even in private."
583,Madewell,Cares less and less about associates every year,2020-06-24,3.0,Sales Support Associate,"Decent discount; used to be much better, but the program got restructured and now we've lost half the benefits and customers get the same or better discounts than associates. 
Generally a good group of girls to work with
Open Talk hotline","Low pay (minimum wage)
Doesn't stand up for associates

Fellow sales associates - the girls were so down to earth and made me look forward to working there and getting style inspirations",Accusing employees of stealing despite having no evidence and not apologizing when proven wrong
585,Madewell,Loved it,2020-06-23,5.0,Sales Associate,"Great team, good pay, great flexibility",Sometimes hard to find people to cover shifts
586,Madewell,Was Happy while I worked there... but looking back,2020-06-20,5.0,Assistant Store Manager,I worked there for two years and was quickly pushed to the top. Started as a seasonal. Everyone was always nice to me and if you ever worked in food- this job is like moving in slow motion. Easy money.,"While I always had a positive experience- wasn’t the same for everyone. In a predominantly white town- you can guess who got picked on. There was definitely favoritism. I always pushed for open talk (Madewells version of HR) however, I soon learned that investigations could easily be manipulated. That is definitely a problem depending on the store and not a problem within all stores. 

However, a problem that is within all stores is pay. There were $10 differences between people with the same job and same work ethic. Some associates are making more than management.

So if you’re working for the discount (40% always, 60% for 5 items), this con won’t matter. But even if you’re a part-time student- you deserve equal and fair pay. And don’t let your manager tell you that you don’t."
587,Madewell,Great Place!,2020-06-18,4.0,Retail Sales Associate,"Great discount (40% off everything, 60% off 6 things every month)",Kind of busy at times.

597,Madewell,Great place to work if you hate yourself,2020-05-24,2.0,Sales Associate,The employee discount was alright,"It seemed as though some of my managers were on a power trip for being managers at Madewell. Some managers were actually quite nice, but I had one manager who was absolutely horrible to work with. The environment in the work place was obscenely passive-aggressive. I would have managers prod me and make comments on how I needed to not forget to smile. I enjoyed working with customers however the sales team was sadly large, clique-y, and on a constant employee cycle. Unfortunately because of the size and the constant cycling between new employees, not many people made an effort to get acquainted with one another. When I worked with people I didn’t know, I was quickly banned from the floor for my entire shift to process ES until my fingers hurt. The pay was OK for what the job is, but it won’t be anything more than just pocket change. There is no way you can make a livable wage off of madewell unless you sold your soul to them. Due to the employee cycle it was almost impossible to consistently work and make money. I went months where I only worked at Madewell maybe 1 or 2 times and that was it. I had to pick up another job to survive."

603,Madewell,Good atmosphere for retail,2020-04-21,3.0,Retail Sales Associate,"- My co-workers and managers were compassionate and had great attitudes
- Madewell is a very well rounded company with advancement opportunities, consistent salary raises after review, eco-friendly/sustainable practices, and active in supporting other local or small businesses. 
- I didn’t work based on commission (both good and bad) but they give associates the opportunity to engage in other sale incentives like hosting shopping parties, having specific recurrent clients, and competition prizes.
- A very good balance between friendly/laid back/ open minded but productive and professional
- They genuinely appreciated hearing ideas from sales associates! It was validating to actually have my suggestions considered and rewarding if it lead to a change, because then I was more likely to participate more
- Management was very supportive (both of personal achievements but also professional ones)
Honestly, if I were in school for a field that had anything to do with retail, I probably would have stayed!","- I mean, it’s retail... I loved most of our customers and can appreciate the work but you still deal with some nasty people who think that you aren’t worthy of decency and human respect just because you work in retail.
- depending on your physical abilities, it can be a TAD rough on your body
- Sometimes the hours could be difficult in different ways depending on the season. Your either so busy that you are overwhelmed with your hours or so slow that you can’t get enough. I think that the biggest issue was hiring TOO many associates to fill in those small gaps in staff availability rather than re-working the schedule so that there was a stronger baseline of workers a who could have more consistent schedules."

I’ve learned so much and built my retail career!,"During a time of national crises you would think your company would be there for you and the community’s best interest. Unlike, aritzia, free people, Apple, folian, Abercrombie and Fitch and lululemon who closed their stores for two weeks and still paid their staff during the Corona Virus outbreak.  Madewell management has been forced to be exposed to the many shoppers shopping for clothing (an unnecessary thing at this time) there are many people that come in coughing and think the virus is a joke... None of us are sure if we have The virus or not since we’re all young and would probably not show any symptoms. In times like this it shows the company’s true colors and morals.

-extremely low pay. Working in fashion is already an industry that does not pay well but here at Madewell, it is shameful.  While i was there a request for a raise had been made 4 times within a year and still never received a clear answer or direction on when that would happen. 
-Upper management is not held accountable for structural failure. 
-there is serious favortism in this company, very caddy-like environment
-you are expected to work long hours yet are reprimanded when managers ask why you are working so late as an assistant
-there is a huge disconnect between merchandisers and production. Production is expected to answer all emails immediately when merchandisers will go weeks without proper response or updates

721,Madewell,very good place to work,2019-06-26,5.0,Sales Associate,These are things to consider before changing jobs. What is the current agreement you have with your Sales Manager about getting you to the AE position? Do you believe her? Letting your current Manager know how hungry you are for the AE position might change the dynamics of your current position. Your manager could fast track you; quitting would cut off that path.,"When Martin came in to his new AE position everything looked great. Then, the last quarter numbers came in lower than expected and the funding dried up. His position was the first to go. “I wish I had spent more time looking at the bottom line details. They were struggling, but all I saw was the money.”"

818,Madewell,Bad Management Destroys Team Morale,2018-10-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great Employee Discount
- Associates are (mostly) intelligent, unique, and amazing young women (no male associates at our store).
- Flexible Schedule - great for college students","- Promotions are mostly lateral from other stores, meaning no growth upwards unless you transfer stores.


-  Our store had a recent (~6 months) change in our management, as in all but 1 manager were either new to the store or new to the company. Unfortunately this created a lot of tension between preexisting associates and new management with an agenda who assumed associates were incompetent. This completely crushed the morale of our team and unfortunately led to an insane turnover where almost every associate who was there at the management overhaul has either left since then or is desperately trying to leave.  


- Along this line, new management created a catty, unwelcoming environment where associates were gossiped about by management in earshot of other associates and a level of distrust was gained. About 6-10 associates reported this behavior to corporate HR with very little disciplinary action or change in management behavior seen since, creating a toxic and highly unprofessional work environment.


- Upon arrival, it was made clear that there is a line between an associate and management and friendships outside of work were frowned-upon. This power hierarchy created an unapproachable, untouchable class of management which ultimately broke the 'team' feeling of our team, not to mention morale.


- Breaks were often missed the first few months of new management, where people were often taking their first break 4-5 hours into their shift, and if the shift was long enough for a second 15-minute break, it was forgotten about completely.



- Unprofessional sales floor conversations between management (and sometimes directed at associates) included discussing in detail:
*Personal matters such as romantic relations, parties/social events, and television shows/movies watched.
*Badmouthing former employees who left out of frustration due to their management style.
*Talking about difficult customers while on the sales floor, even if they were still shopping.
*Criticizing past management in front of associates yet not willing to listen to advice from preexisting associates about what worked and what didn't in the past.
*Audibly questioning if call-outs were actually sick or if they were just 'faking it'"

826,Madewell,Valley Girl Dungeon,2018-09-16,1.0,Visual,The brand is well known which looks good on a resume,There was disrespect for certain people's roles and staff would get 'bored' and suddenly want your job for the day. Hipster racism was rampant and the details of which are too numerous to list. There is peer pressure to buy clothes from coworkers who have rich parents. Some people do more physical labor than others and the storage room was a literal hazard to health and safety. Passive aggressive managers. Nothing I did was right once the gossip started. At the end of it all I was told I was not management material and that I should stop applying for manager roles.

887,Madewell,Visuals,2018-04-06,2.0,Visual,The company is profitable and growing.,"The back storage room was so crowded and dangerous you could not safely walk through it and things would fall on people. When I would ask to take out the trash they would say it wasn't a priority. Stuff was piled to the ceiling. The job of visual associate is redundant because it is used so that the visual manager does not have to do manual labor. So they do the work of a visual manager with less money. The sales associates and other managers do not respect the visual associate's duties and a 'me too' mentality forms where some jealous people want to 'decorate' or hang out in the back when they should be selling. Not to mention the abundant 'hipster racism' the environment encourages. White sales girls talking in fake Black slang and accents, but making fun of Black women's hair daily and Jamaican people's accents. There was at least one girl that would point and rant about how I changed my hair or what style it was in. People kept saying I'm surprised you don't laugh/talk louder...be louder...laugh louder...why aren't you loud. Rap music plays over the intercom so the company seems 'cool', but there were no diverse models and the customers would literally avoid me or jump back when I walked out the back with a 'fro or braids.  Customers only talked to me when I greeted them with straight hair. I called the anonymous tip line about the lack of diverse models. The reason most retail stores have large sizes left over they can't sell is because nobody knows you even have large sizes or how they will fit! In short..there were some AMAZING young ladies that worked here, but the overall culture caters to basics and all of their issues because it is a sorority."
888,Madewell,Quite the Toss-Up,2018-03-26,3.0,Sales Associate,Discount has been newly expanded to include 95% of items in the store. Creating a bond with regular customers elevates the retail experience. I enjoy the majority of people I work with and the product is great.,"Inept management, employee complaints filed with outside HR firm not investigated by corporate. Lack of hiring leads to associates in college pulling 9 hr shifts outside of holiday. No clear communication from corporate and even less from store management."

890,Madewell,Complete and total facade,2018-03-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Kind of a good discount,"Save yourself the heartbreak and don’t get sucked into this mess of a company. They will never know your name and use your talents until you are sucked dry. You will watch them spend so much money on supplies for frivolous things to make it look amazing while your hours, pay or position will be cut. This company was built on great ideas and people. The good people that were smart, great listeners and innovative are long gone. They have been replaced by affected New York socialites who think they are gifts to ge industry and to your life as an employee. You will never be promoted or taken seriously for a career. They will use you and make you wear 1000 hats for no money. They may give you a different title to make you stay, but beware that it means nothing and will not translate well to your next job. You will be convinced that this is the “coolest job on earth” but it’s not. They want to just make you feel like you’re part of some cool club and then you will never be allowed to really join. The people on top treat you like terribly while in reality they just have a different title than you. The people who will come to train you will be so snotty it will blow your mind. This company no longer listens to what their employees or loyal customers want which is why they are destined to fail. Again, save yourself the heartbreak and never think you will have a future here. They will use you for your talents so they don’t have to lift a finger and design and organize to innovate and create a great concept and space. Don’t let the windows fool you. They are more expensive then you and you will be dumped before they dump them."

Customers are very important to this brand and for that they do really well.,Doesn't pay well. No work life balance unless you've been with the company for years. Management blatantly plays favorites. Corporate is a joke. They spend too much time taking managers off the floor with conference calls when help is needed on the floor. No room for creativity in the visual aspect. Anything built for displays is worse than Walmart quality. Hard work and no payoff. Customers are extremely high maintenance and rude on most occasions.

However, I have never worked for a company where managers were downright insulting their workers on a daily basis. I was never formally trained and was shunned every time I asked a question. These weren't illogical questions may I add as they were mainly about operating systems which I was mentioned before, was never trained to operate. The managers were absolutely the worst part of this job as they were so rude to the point that it was abusive. Also, closing down the store is 2 hour job that was easily made into a four hour job. At the end of the day you have to manually restock a section of a store in addition to cleaning and folding etc. This could be easily fixed by systematically refilling quantity during the day, as most companies do."

This made everything feel very impersonal for me and I felt very undervalued as an employee.

999,Madewell,A COMPANY CONTRIBUTING TO IT'S OWN DECLINE,2017-05-13,1.0,Sales Associate,No pros to working for this company.,"There were absolutely no pros to working for this company, as they have zero values.

I never heard the terms ""work/life balance"" mentioned NOT ONCE in my year of working for this company. Also, this was evident in our day-to-day work, considering that 4 out of 5 shifts worked per week, management would ask us to stay late or come in early. Management would also suddenly ask us to work a 6am opening shift the following morning after having closed at 10:30 the night before, which usually meant not actually getting home until 11:30pm and not being in bed by 12:30 (then having to wake back up by 4:30am to do the same thing all over). Yes, the math = 3 1/2 or 4 hours of sleep. And this was not a one-off thing— they do this to their associates on a daily basis. What this company fails to understand is that when you don't allow your associates (and even management) to have a work/life balance, and when you work them to the ground, you're actually having the opposite effect than what you THINK/HOPE you're having. It is a known fact: When your associates/people are happy, well rested, and feel valued, THEY SELL. In contrast, when associates feel exhausted, under appreciated and dehumanized, they underperform, take their time performing simple tasks, move sluggishly, and generally don't output the good energy that is needed to give customers elevated service. This is common sense to me but is rocket science for store management, as well as the heads of the company. Mickey (Millard Drexler), the CEO, needs to make some serious shifts in terms of restructuring this company from the inside, out. And it needs to start with him having an honest conversation with the associates and asking them how they feel and what they want, for once. I guarantee you that happy employees will turn your company around, not your backwards idea of capturing as many customer emails as possible to spam their inboxes, daily. The heads of this company, as well as store management, are so far removed from the associates who are the ones selling the product, it is baffling. 

Additionally, in my year of working for this company, we did not have an all-store meeting NOT ONCE. Absolutely nothing to boost morale, which is essential when working retail, especially in big cities. The lack of communication between management and associates only makes for a messy sales team. We hardly ever hear about new product launches (and even in-store events!) until the day of. Management knows everything in advance, all the time, but do not carve out time during the day to fill the associates in. They also do not allow us to watch anything on the iPads or computers to learn about any newness, yet they somehow want us to be knowledgeable? They also look at you questionably and quickly ask you to perform a task for them if you do reach for an iPad to educate yourself on products. Basically, to them, being on an iPad equates to ""downtime,"" instead of understanding that being able to learn about the products ALLOWS US TO SPEAK TO THE PRODUCTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHICH = SALES. Allowing 10 minutes at the start of every shift to gain product knowledge would benefit the company tremendously, but once again, this is rocket science to them.

Also, yes, this is also a company that pays you minimum wage and expects you to perform like a rockstar, when really, all we can think about is how much time we spend working for this company, yet at the end of the day all we have is $5 left from our paycheck, which we then have to figure out how to stretch across multiple days. I've seen SO MANY ASSOCIATES WHO SPEND SO MUCH TIME AT MADEWELL WHO ARE UNABLE TO EAT LUNCH DUE TO LOW WAGES. It's completely dehumanizing. Like, how can I possibly make a $20,000+ store sales goal today when I don't even have food in my stomach? Not to mention, they also want you to wear clothing from whatever is the latest collection at the time, and even insist that you are in Madewell clothing whenever there is a store visit. HOW IS THIS REALISTIC WHEN PAY IS SO LOW? They also ONLY deep clean the store and make sure everything is organized on the floor and back stock when there is a store visit. They do this to impress the CEO & heads of the company, but it is so fake, it's laughable. THIS COMPANY IS PROFIT OVER PEOPLE, BOTTOM LINE. I'm sorry, but if you want amazing performers, they cost. SIMPLE. It makes no sense to me; the sales goals become higher and higher each year to the point where they are unattainable, yet you keep people at minimum wage? That's greed, and that is all this company cares about. Instead of hiring good people, they literally settle for seemingly whoever applies, including those who are unqualified, which makes for EXTREMELY HIGH TURNOVER RATES. It got to the point where I was unable to remember my coworkers names because I was always working with someone new because people left the company on a weekly basis. I'm sure this high turnover also had a lot to do with the unprofessionalism of management and the overall work environment, but also the lack of training.

Madewell simply doesn't believe in training and management has said that to me on multiple occasions. Yeah, they'll show you how to punch a register and perform simple tasks, but they will do absolutely nothing more to help you grow outside of those simple tasks, thus, you remain stagnant.

In all, if you currently live with your parents and have financial support from elsewhere, this may work for you. Madewell loves to take advantage of students who want a few extra bucks. But unfortunately, this is all that Madewell will ever attract. Madewell will never have loyal, long-term people who will begin to successfully structure a store for the betterment of all, because no one (including store management, Mickey the CEO...) cares to think that far. They are too busy focusing on short-term profits than long-term, true success. 

Lastly, if you are an employee and run into issues where HR should be contacted (mistreatment at work, unprofessionalism, etc...) THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM! I've tried extensively to hunt down a phone number to contact someone in the Human Resources department and was constantly led to ""Contact Us"" email address which is the exact same email that customers use to send in complaints/concerns. Once I finally did get in phone contact with someone from that email address, the woman stated that she didn't even work for Madewell and that she didn't have access to the HR department. That was a huge red flag for me and should be for anyone, and this only reaffirms how laughable this company is."

There was an unnecessary pressure to have these bizarre events as a way to drive sales (it almost never worked out) and to top it all off, the ""laid-back, cool girl"" working environment is a breeding ground for lazy, unengaged employees who would rather use their shifts for social hour, not to mention this culture doesn't allow for coaching to performance.

1097,Madewell,Not so Madewell,2016-07-04,3.0,Sales Support,"-Discount is OK, spans across J.Crew too which is nice.","-Expect micro-managing, lots of hovering
-Management likes to spend a majority of their time in the back office during store hours, leaving only one associate on the floor to deal with an overflowing number of customers walking in and out (particularly in a busy mall setting). 
-Visual books and managers allows little creativity, when everything is done by the book, your store just looks like a clone of every other one and it becomes boring - creativity when it comes to styling and merchandising should be encouraged. 
-Management will make you stay later than scheduled time
-Consistently understaffed, no one likes management and leaves after 3 months
-Hours are terrible, expect late nights 
-Pay is terrible
-Management expects maximum effort while belittling associates and lacks trust for their employees 
-Quality of clothing is not always Madewell. Only things worth buying are the denim (sometimes), leather items,  button down shirts. Every other article of clothing from Madewell is poor quality - don't be fooled.
-Management expects for life to be revolved around Madewell. They don't promote a healthy work/life balance."

Some lovely coworkers 
Some flexibility with scheduling","Brand culture is oriented towards the image of the ""madewell girl"" who is, according to the models who represent the brand image, skinny, clear-skinned, well heeled and fully accessorized, probably white, etc... 

During my time at the store, the two black women on staff left the company dissatisfied, and there are currently no black employees at the store. 
As a curvy woman, I was flattered to be invited to interview while shopping in-store (also I have found that a good many of their products do flatter my body, though I'm a size 10-12 and nearly pushing the edge of the largest sizes available through the company). 

If I show up without much makeup, or jewelry/accessorizes d to compliment the ""base"" of my outfit, there is a 100% chance that management will ask me if I'm feeling okay. When I do wear makeup, I'm rewarded with compliments. Associates are encouraged to purchase styles from the latest collections and sometimes required to participate in ""fit sessions"" which involve trying on pieces and displaying the looks to your manager, who might photograph you/display the image in the staff hallway/send it to corporate.

Associates are commonly referred to as ""girl"" by management in a patronizing manner. ""Hey girl! Can you clean the bathroom? Thanks lady!"" This creates an environment where gender and age are compounded to homogenize and put down employees. 

Finally, the company is extremely environmentally unfriendly. Every piece arrives individually wrapped in layers of plastic, which are unwrapped and discarded. Then, in order to fulfill online orders, the merchandise is wrapped again in individual plastic sleeves and sent out."

Everyone on the team is nice, the pay is fair for what it is. Our store doesn't have on-call (I think that's illegal?), and shifts are fair as well. For an international corporation, it's alright.","J.Crew as a company is NOT environmentally friendly. The trash generated by a shipment makes my stomach turned. Some of the packaging is so unnecessary and is overkill. I understand the need for protection of products, but it's insane to see it all. I hope J.Crew steps up to the plate and becomes a partner to the environment. It's very damaging. 

There's also a lot of white washing that happens in terms of Madewell's history. J.Crew more than implies that they have owned it since 1937, which is simply not true. It was an immigrant-started business that closed in the 1990s-2000s and the name was THEN bought by J.Crew as Drexler's pet project. I mean, it turned out well, but J.Crew definitely does act like they've been running the company since 1937."

You have to wear their denim if you're wearing jeans, and any Chambray has to be Madewell. Otherwise, you can't wear clothes with brand logos on them, but everything else is fine. 

They allow tattoos and you can have one facial piercing, at least at my store in Indianapolis.

1184,Madewell,"Fun, Great Clothes, No Growth",2015-07-23,3.0,Sales Support Associate,"Working here was fun for a while due to the events, amazing discount on clothing, really cool coworkers/ friends, and the really nice customers who shopped here. I rarely had a bad day at work due to circumstances created at work. It was always a pretty easy going environment. I always received a raise after performance reviews and was able to pick up shifts from others when needed. Management was nice for the most part, save for a few micromanagers, of whom didn't last long themselves.","The major downside here is that if you are not the kind of girl who blogs, is extremely social-media friendly, obsessed with fashion, or seemingly well-off, it is incredibly hard to work here to make a living. The hours can be non-existent in the slow months, so you have to hustle to pick up shifts from the employees who rather have the day off anyways. Management doesn't really recognize hard work unless you kiss butt to them and become their bestie. Favoritism can be rampant at this location, but that's how retail is. Though there is no emphasis on commission sales, if you are not great a endless, empty flattery it can be hard to get customers to spend money on things other than sale items. Girls can be ruthless when phishing for ""clients"" and are fierce about keeping them to land big, continuous sales. Very little develop for those who are interested and show loyalty to the company. Too focused on being cute and selling the brands image, rather than work ethic, at times."

I went into this job expecting to deal with rude customers from time to time (as expected in any retail job), but surprisingly, the only rude people I deal with are the managers. It's shocking and almost comical that these people are in a customer service based industry and are speaking to their staff the way they do.

Everyone is understanding and willing to help you, as well as mold you and help you grow. The discount that can be applied at all J.Crew Inc companies is stellar! Great quality merchandise.","Haven't been here long enough to have any real cons, but at first here weren't enough hours to go around. If I didn't have another job I doubt I could make it.

1272,Madewell,"Great company, good opps",2014-03-19,3.0,Retail Sales Associate,Worked on retail side; great discount and good opps for growth if interested in corporate retail later on,Strict dresscode; untrained managers; little transparency between retail stores and corporate
1273,Madewell,Great part time job,2014-02-24,4.0,Sales Associate,"Fun community, great discounts, positive hands on retail experience that has begun to prepare me for other sales jobs. Madewell has provided me with great skills for making hourly and daily sales goals, it has given me practice with closing a deal and also using inter-personal skills to deal with a variety of customers",Minimum wage with little to no incentive to make sales goals. Seems as though the managers are the only ones who benefit from making sales goals. Poor training program that left me with many questions and inconsistencies that could have been figured out earlier

Friendly.,Not as many hours as I would like. At times those who have worked there the longest are not as recognized and hours are given to new associates with less experience.

1278,Madewell,A good retail environment to work in,2013-12-02,3.0,Stylist,"Young and flexible work environment.
Fast paced environment.
Good employee discount.
Good introduction to higher end retail.
Relaxed and upbeat work environment.","Most employees are college or seasonal so there's high turnover.
Majority of workers are women by far and the environment can get tense.
Middle management can make or break the work feel and attitude of the store.
Stagnant upward opportunities.
Difficult to find coverage when understaffed, which is often."
1279,Madewell,"Comfortable, casual, fun atmosphere",2013-12-02,5.0,Sales Associate,Great people and great discounts,"no commission on sales, has its pros and cons"
1280,Madewell,Sales Associate,2013-11-14,4.0,Sales Associate,Madewell has great employees and truly cares about the people who work there. It is a great work environment with really good clothing,"Demanding schedule, on-call times, some employees aren't given the peak store hours when the most revenue comes in and Madewell tracks the sales of the employees."
1281,Madewell,Bitchy girls pushing a bland product.,2013-08-19,3.0,Sales Associate,"Their clothes are great for basic outfits, but once they started pushing the whole color and pattern mix and match, it looked too grandma and thrifty… for paying $100 for a sheer button down.","The girls I worked with were awful. It was my first retail job so I was getting used to the whole idea of selling something someone doesn't need. They don't offer commission, but they do put you down and yell at you on the headsets if you aren't taking every second to push products into people's fitting rooms. Constant folding of EVERYTHING drove me crazy. It took about 2 hours to close every night. And on-calls were super dumb. Lack of brand identity."
1282,Madewell,Sales Associate at high-profile location,2013-08-12,4.0,Sales Associate,Really great people and thorough training to assist each sales associate in fully understanding the brand and the products offered.,"Hours are not flexible.

1285,Madewell,Very Disappointing,2013-04-28,1.0,Sales Associate,"Great Discount
Amazing Coworkers
Ok hourly rate for retail
Lots of free time outside of work
Nice clientele
Like the sense of ""befriending"" customers","Hours are terrible with no sign of improving. You have to go into the store to get your paper schedule that tells you whether you have a four hour shift or a four hour on-call that probably won't be used. I was promised a certain amount of hours a week when I was hired, like many of my coworkers, and I don't believe anyone would have agreed to work 4 hours a week.

Also, schedules are only available 3 days before the next week.

There has yet to be any kind of store meeting. With a new store it would be nice to know exactly what is going on especially when hours go from about 30 hours the first week to 4 the next. 

We don't work on commission, but are encouraged to get high sales goals in order to get hours. Great plan except its hard to show how great of a salesperson you are when working 4 hours in the accessories room. 

Also two hour closes in which everything needs to be perfect.

Overall pay and hours are too low for what they are asking. And morale is very low due to the lack of communication from management."

I've worked retail before but never have I had an employer give me 5 hours and 1 on call. No one at this store gets hours. There's a staff of 30+ people. Most people have 0 hours every week and one on call shift. There may be opportunity to grow but not at this specific location. How can you grow when you work 5- hours?

The CEO was never pleased.  Compensation for an entry level job with no experience was not bad.  Employees were very cliquey.  Corporate made newer employees feel useless and slow."
1298,Madewell,challeging at times but very optimistic for future goals,2012-02-06,4.0,Keyholder,plenty of opportunity to grow and get promoted.,somoetimes when caught in the mix you can feel very undervalued and many others are always trying to out shine you instead of working as a team.

There is a lot of diversity.",The management was extremely unorganized. The pay was not commission based which I was excited about but there seemed to be a lot of competition to get the highest sales. Obviously the person with the best work schedule would get the highest sales (she was also WAY too aggressive)
