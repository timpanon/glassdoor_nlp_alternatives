This is a company where the work is challenging and engaging, plus there is a palpable connection to the Malouf Foundation with opportunities to give back to society, really only limited by your engagement.","As with most companies that grow past a certain size, there are varying levels of engagement at an individual level. The organization as a whole cares deeply and strives to get the job done while also delivering on a great place to work. Just remember that there will be challenges when working with individuals as we all strive to live and be our better selves, but frequently fall short of the ideal.

That said, in general, the organization is genuinely working hard to get it right."

I also have really loved the leadership and that they spend the time to get to know me personally. I find a lot of value you in the work that I do for them.,"The only thing that I really haven’t liked is their salaries. They spend all this money on culture, but they seem to hold onto their wallets when it comes to salary. They are typically below average for the positions that I’ve been in."
3,Malouf Companies,"The good, the bad, the ugly",2022-03-31,4.0,Administrative Assistant,The benefits are incredible. I know Sam & Kacie really care about their employees. Its exciting to be a part of a growing company that cares about their community and has established a foundation with a great cause.,"The HR department is a joke. They hire internal people who are not qualified for the job, but those people had no where else to go. Telling employes that the rules don't apply to everyone. I don't feel comfortable going to that department except for insurance questions. We have some incredible managers and we have managers that love to manipulate situations and show favorites on their team."

It can be hard to feel focused on one realm for some groups because they're spread across lots of different companies as we've diversified. There's also lots of growing pains since so much has changed in the past 5 years. There's some structural holes, but as the structure gets filled out, it becomes harder to move nimbly and get things done as quickly as we have in the past. As a product company, the global environment has presented many challenges, so you have to be willing to roll with the punches as we collectively weather the storms."

4) Benefits are amazing
5) People are treated with respect","The company isn't perfect, but what company is? Historically, there has been a lack of accountability combined with a lack of unified prioritization and goals. This has led to teams going their own way, decreased efficiency, frustration, and eventually unnecessary turnover.

I may be biased, but I think the newly formed MMC will help address some issues."

I have never felt so cared for as an employee. The benefits are great, the people are so talented and care about what they do, and it is just a super fun place to work!","I wish that the paid maternity leave was a bit longer instead of having to rely on short-term disability. If you don't add short-term disability to your insurance and have a surprise pregnancy, you will have a significantly shorter time to spend at home with your newborn baby before you need to get back to work. Luckily, some managers are more willing to work with you and allow for some remote work or a flexible work schedule, but I wish that this was addressed more at the company level."

The lunch provides a time in which you can get to know your co-workers.

We don't always feel like ""the right people"" were chosen for management positions, but I don't know if that will ever be perfect. I believe those people will grow into their positions with time."

We are competitive now as far as time off and health insurance go, but we still lack in satisfactory compensation.

Nice building with an onsite gym.

Many good people to work with.
The owners, Sam, and Kacie Malouf are awesome people.","Prior to working here, I had always heard good things about Malouf and that it was growing quickly. During the interview process, I was told that Malouf does not start people as high as other companies but is competitive and has a focus on rewarding loyal employees after they have been with the company. I took a pay cut to work here but had an open conversation with my manager about where I wanted to be salary-wise after 3 years and 5 years. I am approaching my 3-year mark and I am not close to where I wanted to be after 3 years which means I am light years away from where I want to be in another 2 years. Malouf is making updates going into 2022 with the salary structure and bonus structure which seems like good news on the surface. Hopefully, it gets implemented as seamlessly as possible without major hiccups along the way."

People that come here straight out of college have no idea how lucky they are to jump in right from the start with such a great place. Managers genuinely want you to succeed. Everyone owns their little areas and do what they can to contribute to the team so everyone wins. Company values aren't just for show. Everyone actually lives them.

Any list I would make would be inadequate.  First of all, the company works for a purpose.  We are united as a company behind a greater cause that is more than just ""what we do"".   Even then, I consider what we do - bedding - to be a lot of fun too.  The workplace environment is unparalleled.  The people are friendly, and everyone gets together for lunch.  This might be the secret of what really brings the company together so well - 400+ people (at separate times) can gather and get to know one another, one by one.  Eventually, everyone becomes a friendly face that you know and care about.  The campus is beautiful, and so is the inside of the building.  The beautiful design of the building inside is reflective of the beauty in the valley outside.  The Gym is a wonderful center for recreation, and all the other benefits - hair salon, fitness classes, and all of the benefits regarding insurance and retirement, are almost too many to count. When you're hired on at Malouf, it's as if you now have a membership to a life with wonderful opportunities.","The only Con I can think of is that the company is still developing and growing - but this is a positive thing too!  Sometimes there are opportunities found that cannot be pursued because other larger priorities have to be tackled first.  The fact is though, the more we grow with people, the more capacity we develop, and the more that barrier to project growth will diminish."

Malouf grows very fast. This is a good thing. Sometimes I feel there isn't adequate planning or consideration given to how events will affect employees. Often times it means that solutions do come, but only after the ""busy"" time is over. This can result in high stress situations that can lead to overtime hours."

Free gourmet lunch, free gym access, monthly barber visits, full medical, dental and vision premium paid, and paid maternity and paternity leave. The culture is incredibly exciting, with exceptional room to grow.","Great place to work for women, but there is a bit of a struggle for working mothers, especially with opting for longer unpaid maternity leave to spend the needed time to recover from complications, receive a full nights sleep while breastfeeding, etc.  
Not discounting the amazing maternity leave we already have. However, knowing Malouf's potential, it seems that Malouf is less progressive with allowing the time needed for this process. Many women opt for longer leave that is unpaid and this can be a financial burden. The cost of daycare can also make mothers feel like they cannot cut it in the workforce. 
Again, not discounting what we already have, we are so spoiled. But Malouf has the potential and capabilities to be more supportive for working mothers. Why not?"

My favorite aspect of working for Malouf is learning and growing with my coworkers.  we are all relatively young and eager to grow in our careers.  But even the ""old"" employees have young minds, are wanting to learn.","it feels like the perks are leveraging our ability to earn more money.  I understand this to your degree because i would rather make a little less money and be happy at work then be miserable with a bigger paycheck.  But still, the conversations about making money and earning potential have been deflating to say the least."

They are amazing and truly truly care about their employees. I remember my first week working here and Sam, the CEO, knew my name! That was unheard of for me! I feel very blessed. 
2. Co-workers! I've made some of my all time best friends by working here. Great group of people. 
3. My manager! My boss is the real deal. She cares about me, she knows what she's doing, she runs a tight ship, and she kills it. My job wouldn't be the same without her. 
4. Healthcare 100% paid for by Malouf. WOW! I feel very very lucky to not have to worry about that stress in my life. 
5. Bathrooms! Sounds like a lame pro. But honestly our bathrooms are top notch.","1. Communication! Woof. Communication between departments has been pretty rocky since I started. There are times something that affects your job 100% gets implemented without you even knowing, then you have to back track and try and figure out who changed it, and why, and then try and find a solution that works for both parties (finding that solution usually takes a long time). 
2.  No flexibility in schedule. I'd say at least half the jobs at Malouf could be done from home, but there's this idea that you ""have to work 40 hrs in office"" which can be really hard. I wish we were more flexible with schedules. Like let us still get our 40 hrs in.. but maybe work a few days from home. 
3. Open Concept! I love my co-workers. Seriously, I do! Some are my very best friends, but I don't need to hear about their Aunt Karen's divorce while I'm trying to get my work done. The open concept can be really frustrating and very distracting."

Upper management has taken a good approach to the growth opportunities/challenges and it will be exciting to see how Malouf transforms in the next 6-18 months!,The office is currently undergoing renovations to create more office space and that has resulted in a loud and dusty environment.

The health benefits can't be beat and it's greatly appreciated.  It's super exciting to work for such a great company who does so much for the community. The gym, salon and free lunch are nice but not that important to me.","The  pros listed  can also be considered as cons. We get lower payer due to the ""Free"" benefits, because we have a gym , salon and free lunch.  To some that is great and important, but to those who have  a family and house payment, we'd rather have higher pay.    The number of PTO days and holiday days are unimpressive as well, actually the worse I've ever had at a job. It seems that Malouf wants us to be happy at work, but giving us adequate time off to spend time with our families is not a priority to them.  I know this is an issue for a lot of employees and it's been submitted in the suggestion box multiple times. These types of suggestions never really get a good answer, nor does anything change with employees feeling this way."

294,Malouf Companies,More hype than business experience,2019-05-04,1.0,Designer,They like to have fun and feed people well,"Most of management is under-qualified and under-trained.  

There is no transparency in pay or position-based salary, so if you don't haggle hard up front, you can expect your peers (or new hires) are making better pay than you. 

Work-from-home or flexible hours for parents is treated as a favor, and those who ask for it are treated as a burden. They openly mock men who take their full paid paternity leave.They also ask personal questions about family planning, political views, religion, etc in interviews and reviews.

Seniority and favortism outweigh experience or hard work.  Bullies and slackers go unchecked in upper positions if they have seniority or can project a high sense of value while they ignore their emails. Immediate profit and good press outweighs serious internal problems or long-term business plans.  

When problems do get addressed, its often with passive-aggressive tactics and or inconsistent treatment. Employees often feel management is intentionally aloof or hostile about complaints from lower-level employees. Those who do complain often get blackballed from promotions, 'unpaid perks' etc until they eventually leave or abandon their concerns. 

The boss likes to pay people to humiliate themselves or intentionally pits people against each other for his entertainment. Respect and kindness is gladly  traded for cheap laughs."

301,Malouf Companies,Don't recommend horrible warehouse job,2019-03-12,1.0,Warehouse Worker,Free lunch. good health benifits. Good if you like having no life outside of work. Good if you need to be micromanaged down to the second.,"They are very cheap on pay. They will pay you as little as possible so they can have you work overtime and not get paid well for the 55+ hours you are required to work. The office jobs would be good to have but the warehouse is like a whole different company that they treat very poorly. They do noy care about anyone in the warehouse and they let the management and the team leads of warehouse do whatever they want. They just do whatever in their phones or they go sit in the office and talk or text or take selfies even, anything to get away from working. This of course means that they expect you to pick up their slack and expect you to constantly be going for the 11 hours shifts, no stopping, and no breaks other than lunch. They do not care about your opinion or what you think. The team leads will micro manage you down to every second that you spend not working by needing to know every time you go anywhere, even the bathroom. Also, no matter how hard you work, they will never be happy and always want you to do better. They won't recognize you for actually doing a good job. The owner is a very good guy, but he turns a blind eye to how poorly the warehouse workers are treated."

I was able to help furnish an apartment here in town for a refugee family thanks to Malouf's charity  foundation. They have a people first approach and that's a big part of what makes it such an amazing work environment.","Communication could be better at times, but when you hire 200 employees in the last calendar year that's somewhat expected.

It is a company in which the owner genuinely cares about his employees and is always looking for ways to improve the work environment so that we enjoy coming to work and enjoy what we do.

Another reason that Malouf is a great place to work is that I have great coworkers that I enjoy working with.

There is a positive energy that runs through the building that is totally a function of the people here.  Everyone is not just nice, but also intelligent, capable, and totally on board with Malouf's mission and values.  And speaking of the values, we have them, they're explicit, and we discuss them frequently, which really helps to cultivate a positive company culture of respect, progress, and (believe it or not) FUN.  Who knew you could have fun as an adult at your place of work??  Next, the environment and amenities.  The company has really made an effort to take care of the daily needs of the employees so that the employees can take care of the daily needs of the company.  We have a gym, a barber, daily lunch cooked by a wildly amazing team of chefs, a break room stocked with snacks, and so much more.  Guys, we have heated toilet seats, which sounds silly, and is a bit silly, but let me tell you: it rocks!  In terms of work, there is an excellent culture of employee empowerment, expressed through regular company trainings to ensure we're all still learning; a complete lack of micromanagement; positive encouragement to test out new ideas, create new projects, and basically do what work we think will help the company grow and progress; regular check-ins with managers for feedback; and more.  Next, and others have expounded on this so I won't too much, are the benefits.  They're downright unheard of: FREE insurance premiums for health, dental, and vision; a 401k with company match; paid time off and charitable paid time off.  It's awesome.

The last two things I'd like to point out are, for me, the most important.  Our CEO is downright rad.  He's incredibly down to earth while somehow still being a visionary and truly setting an example of work ethic and leadership that we all gladly follow.  Part of his vision (and this is the most important bit for me) is ensuring we are doing charitable work, both locally and throughout the world.  Employees are involved in so much of this charitable work and I really feel like my work, at the end of the day, helps support our greater charitable mission.  For me, that's huge.","I haven't personally experienced any drawbacks to working here.  I think all companies have their hiccups and quirks, but for me and many people I've discussed it with here, it's honestly a wonderland of opportunity unlike anywhere else I've worked before."
323,Malouf Companies,"Good Company, Unfortunate Management",2018-10-18,3.0,Warehouse Worker,"-Great CEO 
-Good ""office"" environment
-Benefits are above and beyond

Employees of Malouf know the good that the company does. That is undisputed. It is what made me first fall in love with the company. The Malouf Foundation is a wonderful and worthy cause. This Foundation will be the epitome of what other companies aspire to become. 

The CEO is down to earth, optimistic, humble, and ambitious. Again, that is something all employees can agree on.","-Poor warehouse environment
-Upper management has delegated too much responsibility to incompetent people 
-Insensitive comments about race are brought up on a regular basis without fear of consequence or reprimand
-Concerns are met with complete disregard 
-Long hours, little to no recognition (opposite of the office)
-Avoid if you are a student (they view students as pests rather than valuable assets, but don't pay enough to attract experienced full-time workers)

Malouf is growing fast and the warehouse has kept up with the physical demands it has produced. The normal shift has increased from 8-9 hour work days to 11 hour work days, and yet they still expect you to stay longer.  Saturdays and holidays are respected with reluctance. Raises are no longer based on merit and are withheld if employees don't volunteer their time to work these days. 

This problem could easily be fixed by simply hiring more warehouse employees in attempt to keep up with the growth of the company. Meanwhile, several warehouse employees have quit with no replacements in sight; leaving the rest of the employees to make up for management's refusal to recognize the needs of the teams. 

Employees are aware of the ""Malouf Life"" social media page for the company. But daily, the warehouse is excluded because while we work, they play. There is a stark divide and disconnect between office and warehouse employees. Some of the other positive reviews mention that the ""cons"" to the company are the immature and young employees who take the company for granted and complain too much. These type of reviews only further prove my point. These concerns are viewed as controversial in the eyes of office employees, but within the warehouse, it is a common consensus. 

Companies lose value when they start ignoring legitimate concerns of their employees. They are consistently justified without being honestly considered for improvement; instead they are ignored and justified defensively. For example, certain teams are required to work in Tremonton, whether they were told when they were hired or not; and when their concerns are brought up to HR, they are disregarded. 

When I started at Malouf I was an employee. Now I am simply a number."
324,Malouf Companies,Amazing company,2018-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The atmosphere is fun and easygoing, but everyone still gets there work done.",Pay is a little low because of all the other benefits we receive.
325,Malouf Companies,Interview,2018-10-10,5.0,Account Manager,Great communication on what the job entails. Amazing demonstration of the culture and environment I would be working at if hired. They even gave me a pillow just to say thanks for coming in. These guys were great.,"Not much negative feedback at all. The jobs pay is a little now for an account manager, however with the advancement opportunities and the fast growth of this company you can grow in sure if it."
326,Malouf Companies,The Best Place to Work,2018-09-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's hard to narrow down the list of pros, but here's my best shot:

- Focus on empowering employees: the company grows when the people that work there grow.
- Employees are treated like people: I've worked for huge corporations that treat employees like cost centers first, assets second, and people third. Malouf treats people like people above all else. 
- Amazing culture: we play games, have fun, and generally enjoy the work we do and the people we work with. My coworkers at Malouf have become some of my closest friends.
- Best benefits and perks ever: Malouf covers 100% of our health, vision, dental, long-term disability, and basic life insurance premiums. We have a great 401k matching program. We have onsite gyms, an in-house barber, free lunches every day and more. We have paid maternity and paternity. We get extra time off for charitable work. The benefits and perks are truly unmatched. 
- Energetic work environment: because the company takes care of its employees, the employees try to take care of the company. This creates a contagious energy and positivity that set Malouf apart from the competition. 

I love working at Malouf. I've been here for years and plan to be here for many more.","Many of the cons of Malouf tend to be connected to our rapid growth. There are a lot of new people, new processes, and new business opportunities being chased. That tends to create some communication challenges and other growing pains. 

Also, given Malouf's energetic culture, progressive style, and proximity to Utah State University, we tend to attract a fairly young workforce. This leads to some issues related to youth including lack of perspective, maturity, accountability, and experience. For many employees here, Malouf is their first ""real job"" in their career journey. It's hard to appreciate all the things that make Malouf special if you have no basis of comparison."

Malouf does all they can for their employees plus some.  It's also fulfilling to work for a company that wants to give back to the community.,The only downside of working at Malouf is seeing fellow coworkers take advantage and take for granted the wonderful place we have to work.
334,Malouf Companies,Warehouse team members are very undervalued compared to anyone else in the company.,2018-08-04,2.0,Warehouse Worker,"- The warehouse is very tight nit and we are all close friends.
- Good benefits such as a gym, barber, free lunch/food, fun company parties.
- Full-time employees also get great insurance.","- Warehouse management doesn't value employees very much at all.
- Opinions of warehouse employees aren't heard and if they are, nothing is done about them. (In one ear out the other)
- Very bad communication about pay with the employee. Management in some cases will withhold saying anything about changes in payment policies and you'll have to hear about it through other employees. 
- Office employees look down on warehouse employees like they don't matter or are lesser individuals and hardly reach out to talk to them. We should be equals at this company but it certainly doesn't feel like it.
- No allowed breaks throughout the 9+ hour day other than a 30-minute lunch.
- Warehouse members are treated like children who don't know anything. We aren't allowed to have phones on our person because we're not responsible adults apparently, we are micromanaged often to make sure we are always working and not slacking off, and we are reminded constantly to keep our talking amongst ourselves to a minimum and get back to work.
-  When we work a lot of overtime to get a big project done on weekends or staying late multiple days, we are ""rewarded"" with a donut, cupcake or snack of some sort and management saying thanks for your hard work. We would love to be compensated appropriately for our hard, monotonous work in other ways that actually make us feel like valued members of the company."

Some of my co-workers have become my dearest friends.",Like every company out there Malouf has a couple bad apples in the bunch. I think the biggest con is that management is too scared to let bad employees go. Departments that deal with this issue suffer and it brings everyone down.

Management is the perfect balance of making your work life relaxed and low stress, but can still demand the most out of you. The CEO tries to put everything back into the company to make it better for everyone. 

We are still a relatively new company experiencing very rapid growth. New people being hired every week. We have always been a relatively flat (a lot of people wearing a lot of different hats) company when it comes to management. With this growth we need to start spreading out responsibilities. 

What most people forget is that we are still a hard working and successful company. When you look at our industry we are on another level compared to our competition.

Our equipment we work with each day is very nice, the laptop I have and the two monitors besides the laptop screen give me a total of three screens to spread my work across.  It really does make a difference to be working on an application in one screen and researching the Internet on the other and the laptop screen is just a bonus screen, not to mention I can work from home, on the road or wherever I go.

There are plenty of nice people that work here most of the people here are young and talented.  It’s great to see fresh ideas and ambitions.

Company Parties at Malouf are a big deal, Christmas, Halloween, St. Patrick’s Day, and our Summer Family Party are just a few of the great parties we have each year.

I used to cut my own hair but now... I can sit back and relax and enjoy a professional cut each month.

Our gym has a variety of equipment anything from a few rowing machines to dumb bells.  I use the rowing machine, treadmill and spin bike quite often.    In addition to the Gym I have participated in company events like, the Cache Gran Fondo, Cache Valley Century, Basketball and Bike to Work day.  It's nice to work for a place that accommodates a healthy lifestyle.

Health, Dental, Vision and Supplemental insurance are the best I've had.  We have a steps incentive program that adds extra money to our HSA account each month when we have met our goal.

The vision and foresight at Malouf is huge there is an atmosphere of wellbeing and plenty to go around.  Our Thursday morning company meetings are the best I've ever had.  Often we have fun games, good food and updates on upcoming events and our charitable Non-profit partner companies we work closely with, such as OUR and Common Grounds just to name a few.",With all of the changes taking place it does become difficult to keep up with the fast pace in growth.

The overall attitude is upbeat and motivated.",The company is still young and is growing faster than it's prepared to. There are many decisions that are stalled due to a lack of hierarchy who can make ultimate decisions.
378,Malouf Companies,Truly a great company,2018-02-12,5.0,Digital Marketing Manager,"The culture here is very fun, based on quality of life for the employee, and management is dedicated to keeping it that way. The company has been very successful and growing rapidly. Hence, opportunities to contribute are everywhere. The owners are very generous and spend more than they should on making employees happy. They also donate a lot of product and money to good causes, like Operation Underground Railroad, so there are opportunities to support a meaningful organization.","Life isn't perfect here. There are growing pains everywhere. However, they are being worked on by people who genuinely care. Politics can often ruin a workplace, and egos do exist here. But negativity is not common and competing interests are tempered by strong leadership. It's also not big city pay, but living costs are fairly low, and there is no better place to raise a family, so the benefits outweigh the costs."
379,Malouf Companies,Amazing Company to Work For,2018-02-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The #1 thing I loved about working at Malouf was the people. Everyone was so kind, caring, and so much fun. The benefits are AMAZING, I think it would be very hard to find a company as amazing as Malouf. There is so much variety in the people and work which makes it fun and exciting to go to work every day. They care so much about the balance between work and family which is an amazing aspect.",I think it would be beneficial for Malouf to incorporate remote working. A majority of companies are starting to switch to remote working and I think it would be very beneficial for them to consider. Another part that I wish was different was when I was leaving Malouf. There wasn't much of a closing interview and none of the head principles were involved where they usually are in many other aspects.
380,Malouf Companies,Great place to learn and work,2018-01-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Malouf is a rapidly growing company that provides a lot of growth opportunities in any area that you work. Lots of opportunities come up and people are always willing to work with you to help you grow.

382,Malouf Companies,A Career Oasis,2018-01-17,5.0,Copywriter,I love working at Malouf for many reasons. But the most important to me is the immediate and genuine respect shared by everyone. I know I can share my ideas with any group and be heard and valued. It is wonderful to work and collaborate in   such a friendly atmosphere. I also especially love the strong focus on charity work through the Malouf Foundation. I honestly feel like we are making a difference in the lives of children all over the world.,"I would love to see more diversity in age, ethnicity, gender, and religion. It may require more work to bring aboard people with a variety of backgrounds, but I would love to see more departments make it a priority."
383,Malouf Companies,Amazing Culture,2018-01-17,5.0,Shipping Coordinator,"The number one thing about working at Malouf is the culture. The management shows that they care about their employees with incredible perks and benefits. Having fun is a huge priority, and it makes easy to come to work every day.","There isn't a lot of opportunity to move up in the company, even though it is growing rapidly.

I have been given opportunists for growth and development consistently since I started. I believe the company is good at putting people in places where they know success can be achieved.","Malouf is average to below average on pay. They do, however, offer yearly raises based on performance - as do most companies. I believe it's due to amount of benefits Malouf gives its employees. 3/5 on pay, 5/5 benefits."
386,Malouf Companies,"If you have to work, work at Malouf!!!",2017-11-22,5.0,Human Resources Manager,"Malouf's mission, Malouf's values, Malouf's culture, Malouf's foundation.

You're served gourmet meals for lunch daily at no extra cost to you.  There is a culture of autonomy and trust. The people are great, and the work is challenging.",The food makes most restaurants in town seem inferior.
389,Malouf Companies,Great Hard Working People,2017-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The work ethic of the people at Malouf are the reason for it's success.  There are lot of nice amenities and fun had at Malouf, but when its work time it's focused and results driven. It feels like a team effort with every department having the same focus on constantly getting better.

my biggest pro is the lunches provided. It honestly helps with company unity to be able to eat lunch with co workers from all the other departments. It makes work more fulfilling when you have that bond with co workers.","work environment: none
Pay: could start a little higher, but cost of living is cheap in Logan, so we live comfortably. Plus, pay increases have come very generously over time."
390,Malouf Companies,Malouf is a great company to work for!,2017-10-24,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"Working at Malouf is great. Here are some of the best reasons why.

I like that I am encouraged to expand my efforts within what I am responsible for. I like that I have ownership of things and at the same time am able to push for more progress in the areas that I work on. Lots of room for growth.

Collaboration between groups is enjoyable and easy. We are all working on small parts of the big picture and together we can create great things.

I love the product. We make incredible bedding products that we are able to enjoy at home. I am confident in our product.

The culture here is great. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. The work parties and benefits all help create an enjoyable work environment. 

I have access to top management in weekly meetings where we can discuss projects, work flow, concerns or questions, and anything else.

The Malouf Foundation is the organization started by the company. We partner with some great local charities and are involved with different service opportunities and ways to give back and be involved. I love that we have a charity foundation side to the company that let's us be involved in doing good.

It's a great place, I really love it.","I can't sleep with any product that we don't make because nothing can compare to the quality of Malouf.

Some departments can be slow with communication, but only a few."
391,Malouf Companies,Best Company Ever,2017-10-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Positive atmosphere. Awesome upper management who get to know you on a personal level. You're not just another employee. Amazing benefits. Free gourmet lunch daily. Free Gym. Free hair services.

395,Malouf Companies,Don't drink the Kool Aid,2017-08-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Building amenities and health benefits,"Don't drink the Kool Aid everyone serves up here. Seriously. If the main selling point of working for a company is the amenities and a nice CEO, you probably aren't digging in deep enough. Don't believe me? Just read all the positive reviews on here. Its all fluff about perks that don't actually address the state of the business. Bottom line is roles are filled with inexperienced college grads acting as managers. Pay is abysmal even for Logan.  Up at the top you have complete nepotism with a pair of family members making key decisions and everyone walking on eggshells to please them. Get out of that little pretentious bubble you are in because you have an unnecessary basketball gym and solar panels. 

You can't trust the reviews on here. Someone seriously wrote: 
""It's easy to overwork because the job is so fulfilling and there is always more work to be done.""
PASS THE KOOL AID"
396,Malouf Companies,Magnificent Malouf!,2017-08-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Talk about a company that takes care of their employees. It's awesome to work in a place where you feel like the company has your best interests in mind. The culture at Malouf makes coming to work enjoyable and fulfilling. All of the employees are very easy to get along with. The benefits that this place provides for employees are beyond anything you can find in Cache Valley and probably all of Utah.,"Due to the amazing food that is provided daily for lunch, you may see an increase in your weight."
397,Malouf Companies,Best Place to Work in Cache Valley,2017-08-15,5.0,Director of Online Operations,"There are almost too many pros to list, but here's a start:

- Culture of empowerment: The CEO and other leaders acknowledge and encourage meaningful individual contribution

- Opportunity for growth: Despite being a horizontal/flat structure, Malouf is dedicated to finding opportunities for employees to grow--sometimes through promotion but usually within the confines of their existing position

- Amazing benefits: A 401K that is fully vested from day one was important to me. There's also free gourmet lunch, an onsite gym, a free onsite barber/stylist, and best of all CHOCOLATE MILK ON TAP!!!

- Fun environment: I honestly enjoy the people I work with. I've previously never worked somewhere that I would go out of my way to spend additional time with coworkers. Working at Malouf is fun, relaxed, and fulfilling.","Cons are limited and far outweighed by the positives. 

- Growing pains: We're growing fast and that can be painful sometimes. People are often asked to step up and do more out of necessity. 

- Non-traditional: This could easily be viewed as a positive as well, but Malouf is anything but conventional. Malouf probably isn't the place for someone who thrives in an environment that is highly structured and who wants a ""traditional"" career path."
398,Malouf Companies,Malouf Culture is the Best!,2017-08-04,5.0,Shipping Coordinator,"Malouf cares about their employees and offers great benefits with competitive salary.   Lunch is catered everyday, and they also provide gym memberships for any employee that is interested.  Management fosters a fun work environment that is truly unique.

It might sound dramatic (and I promise I'm not being dramatic) but it's the 100% truth. I worked at a company for 5 years that treated me so poorly, and I would hate going to work every day. Malouf is the complete opposite. I truly look forward to going to work every day. My co-workers are all kind and friendly, I get a free 5 star lunch every day, I have a gym I can workout in whenever I please, and I can have as many 25 cent Diet Cokes as I want.",NONE - and I'm being 100% honest
