The owners are billionaires that seem to think they are not yet rich enough and have no issue with continuously making commitments to eliminate this problem, while consistently failing to meet said commitments. But the M&M characters are now more inclusive, so we have that.
* Another very simple Google search shows the ridiculously low representation of Black, Hispanic and other minority groups in Sr. Management. This is not a fluke. The company first set global I&D goals - I kid you not - just 2-3 years ago.
*While the company prides itself in pioneering a Marketing Code through which they commit to ""not promote treats"" to children, there are some pretty impressive mental gymnastics at play through which Associates are meant to believe that M&M characters are in reality aimed unequivocally and exclusively to adults, and not in way highly popular and attractive with children.

My contract was over and I decided to leave the company, but I wanted to help the team buy some time and find someone to replace me. So we came to the decision to sign a new contract for a short period of time.

I made it clear to the HR that my intention was to help the team and that I wanted to sign a new short-period contract.

The reply I received was: ""Yes, I understand what you are saying, that's the best option for you, otherwise your Director will get angry and he won't give you a good reference and that will not be good for your career moving forward.""



Previous to that, I was encouraged not to talk to the contract recruitment agency that was handling my case and to discuss with Mars' HR first.



That kind of behaviour is disrespectful and unacceptable. There are no excuses for incidents like that."

As a contractor you get no bonuses, different health benefits or no health benefits at all, no compensations, second hand computers, no voice within the company, no one to complain to, you'll get overlooked and overworked during promotions, you wont get considered most of the times for associates positions. They'll tell you how valuable you are but you'll get overlooked by silly excuses. You'll often have to do the job of as many of 3 associates without being appreciated.

you never feel you are missing out on anything until you leave","1. You never feel you are missing out on anything until you leave.
2. Once you leave and it takes about a year before you realize how demented the organization is. The rest of the world has moved away in salaries, promotions, careers, and you find yourself repeating the 5 principles mantra.
3. Company is hemorrhaging money and losing people and yet, no talk about it.
4. No one wants to change anything. Leadership globally is made up of Western EU expats from a clique , and they don't want change, as they will lose their benefits.
5. Someone tell me how will an expat know how to do business in China? this is a company that has invested billions of dollars over 2 decades. Their Chinese employees tell them candy, desserts are not part of the food habits there! but why will an expat listen? they get paid overseas pay free school for kids, free housing.
6. All Non EU employees are there to fill the room with positive talk and the greatness of the 5 principles! Love it!
7. Speak with some ex Martians, and all will tell you its a cult and they realized it only a few months after leaving. 
8. In all honesty I never leave reviews for a company, as why would I want change in a company I have left, let them stew.

Good onboarding program.
Excellent flexibility to work from home.
Great investment in personal development through training and mentoring. 
Good internal transparency: There is wide and deep access to information about business performance, the product portfolio and future direction.
Family-friendly culture.
Free chocolate!","Expect to be frustrated, bored and deskilled in digital, tech and marketing. The Food segment is not the employer if you like to see ideas seen through and not spend 90% of your time on Skype calls or in Outlook.

Digital last: This is not a digital-first organisation. Digital and tech capabilities and mindset are 3-5 years behind where they should be.

Powerpoint City: Too many powerpoint pre-reads ahead meetings and constant creation of 20-80 slide decks that are not followed by action.

Governance and processes: The global team has low authority because decisions are owned by the markets and are final. Global and local teams are rarely aligned. This results in meetings and emails that are focused on stakeholder management rather than driving action.

Risk-averse: Markets are too focused on the business of today and are not forward-thinking. 

Delivery for delivery's sake: At the expense of the end-user and disregard for business needs, too many associates deliver digital or tech solution meet their personal objectives or make them look good in an internal newsletter.

Not collaborative: Because of the big focus on individual performance, relationships can be transactional as associates only have meetings or exchange emails when one party needs something from others. 

Summary: 
Mars Food is a great employer but a bad career choice if you have a career in digital, marketing or technology. It's a business with a mindset biased towards why something won't work instead of how it could work and be action tomorrow instead of in 12-18 months.  

It's a slow-moving business so be warned if your background is working at fast-paced businesses whether startups, SMEs or large ones."

For many Associates, this represents the opportunity to work with large brands and big budgets.","*Child Labor and other inconsistencies with The Five Principles

I suggest you do a Google search for ""Cocoa's child laborers - Washington Post"" and familiarize yourself with the extent to which Mars has profited from child labor. Other facts that go against the Mars PR (see Mars.com for a taste of the Kool-Aid):

""Diversity"": the business is led by a 100% White, 100% European, male-dominated (only 1 woman) Mars Leadership Team.

""Progressive culture"": the concept of intersectionality is foreign at Mars; I have literally never heard that word uttered in my 9+ years at this organization. Other words that I have yet to hear ONCE: transgender, non-conforming, non-binary, queer; you get the point. Self-organized, budget-free Employee Resource Groups wil be the only space where you will hear any discussions on race and gender - if at all. Of course, without serious support from Leadership the impact of ERGs is negligible.

---

*Cultish organizational culture

Associates are force-fed ""The Five Principles"", ""The Associate Concept"" and other hollow concepts. You WILL learn them, you WILL repeat them and you WILL clap and smile when Sr. Leaders name drop them. Outside of newsletters and townhalls, you WILL NOT see them mentioned anywhere else (e.g. day to day conversations within your team, your performance review, critical decision-making conversations, etc.) so don't worry too much about them as they are not really used or understood, only referenced. 

---

*Favoritism

Talent decisions are ridiculously biased and favor those that look and act like those that call the shots (see comment on Mars Leadership Team above). In other words, if you expect your hard work, talent and effort to be fairly recognized regardless of your internal network, relationshis with influential Sr. Leaders and ability to ""fit in"", STAY AWAY."

1064,Mars,A sadly disappointing experience.,2019-12-12,1.0,Team Member,"The pay at Mars isn't bad, especially for what you will be doing which really isn't very hard, it's just a lot to learn. Learning it however will be a serious issue. 

They recently hired a trainer to try to help fix some of the enormous issues they are having in the plant. 

Great cafeteria if you don't mind waiting most of your break in line.

The company is very generous with break time, but by the time you're starting to really get moving and into a rhythm, you will be out on break again and come back in to your ""relief"" either having been the best person possible and having set you up for success or having completely slacked off and leaving you to race to solve the issues they could have taken care of during the half hour they were watching it slowly unravel. 

I wrote an email to Grant Reid about the way I was fired (which was predicated on obvious lies) and I was contacted by the company the following day. While nothing helpful came of it, I was and am respectful and grateful to him for making sure attention was brought to the issue rather than it being ignored.","I'll start with the worst of it. I was fired because the people on my team lied and fabricated an incident. It's easy to prove they were lying because they they waited over a month to bring it foward. The matter was either A they chose to lie to the company and hide a new employee having had this incident for reasons that are beyond me instead of escalating it and being sure I was trained correctly, or they lied that it happened at all.

The people who onboard you will get your information wrong, sent emails to people in my orientation that they ""weren't chosen for the position"" during their first week working there, which is ridiculous, and because of them I was unable to sign up for my benefits as easily as others so on top of learning an outdated time clock system which is absoutely preposterous, and learning the job from my trainer, I also had to figure those issues out which was anxiety inducing to say the least.

Beyond that, there are no trainers. The longest tenured person of the three in my area was 1 year. The following two had been there 8-10 and 3-5 months and neither of them correctly knew how perform their functions. From metal detection check instructions (which are plainly written on the paper for them to reference,) rethreading a pack machine's candy bag roll (with identical examples of how to do so right beside it,) and even simply reading a work order and cleaning the parts listed there in rather than the whole machine listed every single time which simply isn't the task. 

You will be berated the entire time you're trying to learn from these ""trainers"" and expected to learn something by watching it a single time instead of being shown how to perform your task and observed doing so as you should be. Fortunately my trainer was willing at least to write down what needed to be done through out a night, which I then used and started making strides towards actually succeeding, butan incident occured with a machine that I had believed I was using properly, but in fact was not due to the exact lax in training I'm speaking of. 

Very few lifts and power jacks are up to a reasonable standard of safety. It was a constant issue and stressor as well as being unacceptable that a company with as much money as Mars doesn't have them completely repaired, let alone replaced entirely for safer more modern models like the new Crown series. 

My supervisor assured me for several weeks in a row we would sit down and have the discussion we are supposed to shortly after your orientation but never got around to doing so practically until my first thirty day review. 

The retention rate is horrible so you will make the decent pay for a short time. 

The benefits are dissapointing and restrictive. 

The schedule you will be working is four shifts of twelve hours, two days, two nights, then four days off and repeat. I liked it but it's not for everyone. 

There is no SOP. The company calls it ""freedom"" but all it amounts to is that you will be taught several wrong ways to do something and one useful correct way and you can choose for yourself which one you like best. 

Even the schedule of orientation won't be followed and some things you will simply not be taught, or they will use so many acronyms that have no context that you will leave the room with a new found hatred for the alphabet. 

Palpable inequity between plant workers and corporate.
The people who built the plant decided in some utopian dellusion that putting corporate in the same building was a great idea and that having the breaks at the same time for both (or at least is seems they're the same times) was a good idea. 
Corporate gets an hour break so they will often times fill the line at lunch while you get a half hour to brave the line and woof your food down.

It can be very dominated by cliques here, you really do have to be with the in crowd for the most part to move up.

Diversity is a problem here, so much they called it out at the National Meeting. Yet, they have done little to improve this. Many roles go to similar looking people, so its hard to break that. You can check out HQ offices around the country to verify this or look at who has roles that can get you to the next level, please check around if you don't believe me. I often feel that the playing field isn't equal. There are several high performing people of color of get passed over or are just held in place. I know many have left due to being discourgared or not supported. One last thing, i've seen so many of the ""majority"" propelled and promoted it's not even funny. Many whom haven't been in role minimum time or have made significant impacts to earn it. Please fix the diversity issue !

Some promotions are not given out to those who earned them, rather who fits in for the most part. Also, certain people get ""chances"" aka selected to try better jobs, there isn't any consistency on this. If they are comfortable with you, they will promote you regardless of success. Many people are selected for some roles too, sometimes there isn't a fair chance.

Lastly, there is so much money left on the table by those who don't know what they are doing in their role, Mars could make sooooo much more money it's not even funny. Lot of people skate by and do little to drive revenue to where it could be. They are still celebrated, so why change? If you threaten the status quo you may not be promoted in some areas. Fitting in here goes a long way."

Do what you are told and keep your opinions to yourself. Otherwise you are not being a team player. Some territories are so huge that you might have to do overnight travel. There can be favoritism at times. You will see some folk get to try 2-3 different positions and you’re still “valued labor” for some stores. You also don’t get any personal fulfillment from the job. You are just moving cases around with other store employees who could care less if you were there or not. Once you get out of field sales it is like you are in a different world. Everyone is kind to you. People are intentional on integrating you to their teams. Some can even take their pets to work sometimes. Territory Sales Managers are the black sheep’s of the org.

Then they started looking for little things to try to fire me over and overlook their buddies who were doing the same thing. I brought up many no cost way to improve efficiency there while making the job easier at the same time and they just dismissed it, but when their buddies brought up the same idea they got rewarded for it. I showed initiative many times to learn new things to where I could do more for the company just to once again get dismissed for their buddies.

Development is important, but so is training for your current role. Transitions are a joke, my first role at mars I learned from powerpoint presentations, my second role I taught myself from work instructions, and my final role I taught myself based on what my stakeholders told me they needed from me, no work instructions, had to figure out what systems and access I needed myself (my manager didn't even know). 

A massive amount of time is spent writing your development plan and going through this process, to the point where most associates treat it just as a check box of ok that is done good now I won't look at it again. The amount of detail expected of you on it, the timeline to do it, and the lack of support to write you development plans are a joke. The only support is the same powerpoints of how to use the website, and the same leadership team panels talking about their development. Your line manager should be required to actually help you, while you own your development, your line manager should want you to succeed. 
There is this bizzare thought process in the service center that in order to get a promotion int he service center, you must go get a number of roles in the business unit first. While on the surface it makes sense, it hinders promotion of associates that want to stay in the service center, just because they have to follow this path. 

The FLT has no idea what the lower level associates, both the analysts and managers do in S&F. They make demands, and associates end up spending more time doing projects for the FLT than being co-pilots to the rest of the business which they support. 

Promotions are based on how many happy hours you go to, how many walks you go on, it is all politics. Your line manager holds all the power to your next role, and if they decide you aren't deserving of another role, or they don't like you, then they won't approve you applying to a new role, or worse. P&O needs to play a much more active role here. There should be no permission to apply for a role. 

Gallop survey, there is huge pressure to take the gallop survey, to get great gallop scores, but the leadership does nothing to change. Countless times going through gallop sessions where it is all about the team, but when the question is ""I know what is expected of me at work"" is the question in play, that is not the associates problem, that is the directors and vice president's problem, that the are not setting a clear goal of what is expected of their associates, by changing it constantly. 

Bonus, 2 years in a row, probably 3  (2019 associates still there, probably won't get a bonus this year either!), are based on unreasonable growth. AVP is built into the salary that is put on your salary offer as a total compensation. Then there is oh hey we didn't meet metrics so 35% bonus, or no bonus! Meanwhile, all the CLT, FLT, SLT, all the LT's got their MPI and MSOP bonuses!. If the greater mars doesn't get AVP, then they should not get MPI or MSOP. Additionally, if there is a chance you aren't getting bonus, do not put it in total compensation, that is lying. 

When the band structure was implemented in 2016 there was this lie told that everyone in Band lets say T2 made this range, here is the high here is the low, etc... the caveat is that it all depends on what area you are in. So the T2 in S&F only makes say $70,000 while the T2 in Marketing makes $100,000. S&F associates are underpaid and most of them don't even know it. 

Newark- Stay Here Grow here, except they are asking people to relocate from an area they can get a 3000sqft house for $200,000 with 5 acres of land to an area you can get a 500 sqft 1 bedroom apartment for $1.5M, and while they are paying for relo if you are within a certain radius, they are not giving any cost of living adjustment, even though the cost of living for the new area is not even close to the same. however the new associates coming in starting fresh in newark will get the higher salary as competitive with location."

There is a Consistent disconnect between internal team objectives and leadership regarding the realities of the job. Employees often go without the basic tools to do their jobs and are expected to create solutions which are then labeled “ development projects” outside of regular job duties and business hours."

You can learn a lot if you are self-motivated in a very short time.  It’s a good 2-3 years kind of environment.  

There are a handful of great inspirational leaders who can help mentor you.","It is really disappointing to see how the organization approaches talent and career management.   Unfortunately, good talent leaves because 1) decision criteria and role requirements are not consistent, 2) your potential is determined more by who you know and not by your results or your how  (no matter how much feedback or proactive development you seek out)  which creates a very inauthentic environment, and 3) leadership and human resources do not practice transparency so folks are constantly left questioning their self-worth and where they stand.    Mars claims to be a ‘people passionate’ and culture driven organization, yet they do not put these values into practice.    

What is really sad is that the human resources’ function plays a big role in what happens and as they also operate in the same way as describe above, there is no accountability.  

It’s the part of the culture that is not spoken about.  

In addition, many people experience burn out.   Work-life balance is extremely hard to achieve, and you will have to put in a ton of extra hours before or after you take some time off to make up for it.

The starting pay for an operator is good and the benefits are great.","A lot of red tape and ongoing politics like you'll find at any corporation. The food plant is actively prioritizing the hiring of women despite other applicants being more qualified for a certain position. I believe they should have equal opportunity and should be paid equally (which they are), but there are often cases of women having less expectations as there male counterparts in certain roles.

Likability is becoming a bigger factor than performance in determining an associate’s performance rating. Management often pays more attention to this factor than the associates’ contribution to the role and team. Performance rating expectations don’t seem to align with the requirements of the role.

After the expansion, the company lowered their previously more strict requirements to fill job roles. We've had a lot of quality and job performance issues as a result.

There's a huge disconnect between office staff and plant workers. I strongly feel office management have zero clue how things are ran and maintained on the plant floor. They have unrealistic expectations and there is a huge lack of communication between departments. 

As a plant worker, you're only entitled to a 30 minute lunch for a 12 hour shift when the office staff can take personal fitness breaks and take an hour off for lunch when they only work 8 hours. 

Shift work takes a toll on your personal life and health. If you can't find an office job, you owe it to yourself to consider looking elsewhere."

They rather kill everyone. You can see it in everyones faces how the swing shift takes a toll. Management is another con. They run the buisness opposite of what they are taught. There is clearly a culture transformation for the worst. This company was really wonderful to work at. I really enjoyed my job. It was nice to have that corner candy shop feel and being able to make those smiles. Management took that fun away. Now we all know wherever you work we have a job to do. But it doesn't need to be micromananged under the gun. Bottom line is the current regime has been making poor decisions and using the leadership beneath them as there escape goat. The company was a team from top down. It lost that with this management team. I'm sorry not a team. Bosses, tyrants. Sad how it became.  Now I understand why Forrest would promote within because they knew the buisness and he could trust it would be run as it should be. He wasn't too keen on bringing in outside people to run his buisness on a leadership level. I'm sure he's jumping in his grave right now. I put a lot of years into this place and I had to leave it. They teach you don't leave the company you leave your boss. This is 100% with the management there.  A lot of the problems is there stuck on this high horse of what they call MSE or MRF. Its the POC (root cause) as they say in there language of why the plant is what it is. They skew data to make everything look like its improving but bottom line there is no change.  Only blame the leadership below them and everyone who is involved in this nonsense flavor of the month initiative is there saviors as they sit behind a laptop and do absolutely nothing. Honestly, I can keep going all day. It's a shame what an M&M factory has become."

The Mars 5 Principles truly guide the business as well as their mission for A Better World for Pets.  The benefits are great with an excellent 401k, paid time off for vacation along with separate paid time off for sick leave, and holidays are paid.  Even though I was hourly, the pay was above average for the industry.  The company supports its employees with personal development and strives to help you grow into your next role.  This was surprising to me as previous companies I worked for it was almost taboo to talk about what you would like your next role to be.  The work environment is very inclusive and dress is business casual.  If you work in the corporate headquarters, you even have the option to bring your dog to work with you.  Benefits start on first day and the on-boarding process really gives you an in-depth look at the company and its values.  They are very big on culture fit so strive to ensure that they hire people who can embody the 5 principles.","My second role in the company is where I unfortunately learned the con's of the company.  My manager did not hold true to the 5 principles and unfortunately, played favorites.  It is hard to succeed in a role when you are never praised for your work but told daily how you have failed. In the end, it all depends on how your department is perceived rather than keeping good talent around.  It really saddened me to see that there was no consistency in good management.  Additionally, mental health is not truly a concern for them despite what they would have you believe otherwise.  It is ignored completely.  Depression is perceived as someone ""not engaged"" and every associate (that I knew) who took FML leave for mental health reasons did not have a job when he or she came back to work."

They are very good with basic flexibility; starting early/finishing late and working from home can be an option although it is based on line management approval.
Benefits are pretty good with the pension scheme being exceptional.
There are always a lot of projects going on and you will never be bored!
There is a lot of focus on engagement and well-being.","Unfortunately, line management at Mars changes a lot and can be very varied - I had 3 line managers in my first 18 months.   There are a lot of challenging line managers and even if multiple people complain, nothing is done.  
Fundamental flexible working is not great with multiple people being refused the option; if you are not in the right position, level or in with the right people, it won't happen. Whilst the benefits are great, base salary leaves a lot to be desired. 
Trying to get promoted in Mars is really difficult; it is even challenging to go horizontally.  They put you in boxes through an annual leadership review and you get no real say in it.  It is through this where they decide whether you are leadership potential or not.
Trying to get things done is a nightmare - sometimes you have/want to be incredibly quick but the red tape and collaboration means that it is difficult to be quick.  It can take months to do things that should only take a few days.  Sometimes, you are close to the end and your project is deprioritised and all your work is wasted which is incredibly disengaging.
Whilst there is a focus on engagement, it is about numbers and exercise - I think it use to mean something but it has lost its focus."

The company has a fantastic parental leave policy, but, if you actually take it, you're labeled as 'not committed to the organization.'

1375,Mars,Great place for career development,2018-07-25,5.0,P&O,"The career development at Mars is excellent and one of the main reasons I joined. Every Associate has a PDP (personal development plan) that is reviewed throughout the year and your projects and training then align to this giving opportunities to further stretch yourself, sometimes giving you the chance to work on something quite different to your day to day role. There is a lot of responsibility given to Associates right from the day they join and I've personally developed much more here in the last 2 years than I had in my career before joining. 

There are also opportunities for cross-functional, cross-segment and geographical moves within the business too which means many have a long career with the business. 

The business has a huge diverse portfolio of well-known brands which many are proud to work for and it’s very conscious about its corporate social responsibility agenda. There are also some great perks working for Mars, e.g. bringing your dog to work if you are part of the Petcare segment.

Mars is a heavily network driven business and puts a huge amount of emphasis on the personal connections and network that you build. When first joining the business there is a lot of encouragement to have coffees and get to know meetings with stakeholders all over the business and everyone is very happy to do so.  Mars really does have some fantastic people working for it too, overall it really is a great place to work!","The business has been through a significant amount of change with various mergers and restructures but is now coming through the back end of it. Decision making can be slow due to the matrix nature of the organisation and although the business is trying to get better at this at times it can be frustrating as getting things done can take longer than it would in other businesses. 

Due to the network driven nature of the business often you'll find yourself dealing with limited information and trying to figure out who is responsible for what, for those who are structured and like process this can be a challenging environment at times."

This can be disruptive to establishing strong brands and/or setting a long term vision. Managing people is viewed as a privilege for the most highly qualified, and as such it can be difficult to gain this valuable career experience (though you can't fault the company for being selective).

I’m proud to work for a privately held company that has major social/societal concerns and acts to better the world.,"This company is hemorrhaging talent because they are so slow to reward high achievers. It’s one of the most discouraging environments I’ve ever been in because you’re constantly asked to prove yourself over and over yet you get nowhere. They pretend to have a flat structure but the leadership team definitely loves to label people “entry level,” even though those “entry level” associates often times have way more work experience than their managers. It’s insulting and again, highly demotivating. 

Change management is a nightmare here. Communication is a nightmare. Get ready to constantly be “dealing with ambiguity.” The responsibility is placed on the associate to deal better with ambiguity rather than Mars taking responsibility and fixing the underlying business issues."

Mars gives trust and freedom to the associates and expects you to manage your work as you see fit. The mindset is always to take care of yourself and family first.  That's a wonderful thing. Working from home occasionally is common. I don't know if there is a more flexible company. We now have paternity leave as well. 

Good people. Collaborative. Helpful. Fun. It's always people first, then work. There is no other place that cares so much about associate development and ""how"" you get stuff done vs. objectives and ""what"" you get done. Overall, it's a good culture. Team focused. 

Awesome brands. A company that cares about the environment and its stakeholders. People are proud to work here. 

Decent pay and benefits. Overall good job responsibility.

There are many reasons to LOVE this company.","Slow to promote - If you are someone who is ambitious and hungry, you are going to get  frustrated by having consistent amazing performance reviews but with slow response to do anything about it. Many stellar performers leave because it's easier to get formally recognized and promoted at other companies. I think the slow to promote is actually a function of below... Decision making! And quite frankly being slow to promote is a threat to Mars overall because talent is the most important thing and great people are leaving! Wake up!

Decision making - It's snail speed. It took over a year after they announced that they were merging the candy offices to decide and share with employees the final location and in the mean time did an awful job easing concerns, managing change, and being transparent. It has to go down as one of the worst change management processes of the entire company history! And guess what - it's not over because the company is letting this drag on until 2020. Also, who is the decision maker is a question that is never clear at Mars. It's never just 1 person. There are always tons of people that have to give their input. I have seen decisions made and then unmade because one person didn't agree or wasn't brought along in the journey or changed his or her mind. Speed comes with alignment. Managers cannot align because they are stuck  figuring out the mutuality principle: Who is going to be the person left with the short stick? It's nice that you care about every stakeholder, but you have to make a decision and move on! There are trade offs to everything. Bite the bullet! Be decisive. Yes you can! Stop being so internally focused! Meanwhile... people make up stories in their head, try to guess what you are going to do, and worry. Productivity could be significantly increased if you worked on stronger decision making and communication of those decisions.

With Mars, it's we win or lose together. You can hit/ exceed every one of your goals, but if the company doesn't - your bonus is adjusted down like everyone else's. That can be shocking to people who are used to meritocracy and also who had a strong performance year and crushed their goals."

I was in the Walmart division, so all day I would go to 4 stores and drag 300 lb pallets on a pallet jack and hound managers to let me drop them on the floor. You also get endcaps and have to empty all of the merchandise off of them and find where they go on the shelf and stock it before you can do anything. Then you put your heavy (40-67 lbs) boxes of candy on the shelves. The ""sales"" involved is basically just asking the ignorant walmart managers if you can put your candy out on the floor.

Reorganisation every 4 years that moves people nearly randomly. Some IT offices are clearly stagnant without any chance for promotion or broadening your skills.

Management call it 'cat herding' justifying chaos by saying that Mars IS is so flexible. So, you might learn halfway into your project that budget authorization has been revoked, people allocated to you suddenly asked to do something on the side that totally distracts them.

You will be extremely overworked and underappreciated. Office management is totally clueless as to how the floor operates and ruthlessly punishes minor mistakes that are usually a result of the employees being overworked. 

Hard work is not appreciated and there are very few opportunities for upward movement and development for employees who show the competency and intelligence that could be beneficial for the company in other positions. 

Any upward mobility is not related to your body of work and only reflects how little trouble you stir up and how much you suck up to management . The so called. 'internal postings' are catered to the individual who the office wants and every other applicant is a facade. 

All of these points have created the worst aspect of working for this company. Due to employees having realized how difficult it is to move into an office position the work environment in the warehouse is incredibly cut throat and ruthless. It is impossible to relax because you are always worried about the office finding a minor mistake you made while being overworked or you are worried about a fellow employee finding or manufacturing a mistake to keep their stock high."

Most non-management associates are welcoming and good to work with. Fair pay, fair flexibility on schedule (depending on manager), fair vacation and benefits.

Company has strong brands which keep the company in business.","Leadership Team is very detached and lacks basic knowledge around day to day and customer specific operations. Leadership's lack of customer knowledge leads to lack of direction and ambiguity. 

Teams/segments are very silo-ed. Leadership Team makes decisions without understanding impacts and due to not understanding customer specific nuances, create a lot of rework and perception becomes Leadership is unapproachable in terms of proactive work and collaborative corrective solutions. Leadership detachment also leads to not understanding associate workload and morale.

Company also claims adherence to 5 principles but sadly, the principles are so subjective it's like reading a horoscope. One day you may be a Libra, Pisces, and Leo and the next day you could be a Taurus and Capricorn, so to speak. 5 Principles are also arguably outdated and lead one to believe the organization drives via looking in the rearview mirror as opposed to the windshield. Company IT systems are completely outdated and segmented into separate logins/applications for everything. Terribly inefficient, not a process driven organization, or an organization that is set up for agility or adaptability success in the long run.

Company and Leadership Team make top line ditch to ditch decisions which causes a lot of reactivity. Staffing moves are done in mass with little understanding of role nuances or customer based nuances that impact some roles. Perpetual cycle of hiring in new folks and then cutting back/restructuring once they figure things out.

Long term career plan is not as co-piloted as one would hope. You have input but ultimately, Leadership and Line Managers decide your next role and location. Calibration process is done via Leadership committee that due to detachment, really have no understanding of your performance.

Company is also considerably top and middle heavy in terms of leadership, which leads to restructuring frequently or trimming down lower level teams. Very symptomatic of high degree of politics playing favorite to actual performance."

2045,Mars,"Great, Fun Place to Work",2015-11-02,5.0,Product Development Scientist,"Wrigley is a wonderful company, with fun brands and great people to work with. The overall rating of 5-stars comes directly from the great people - who create an exceptional work/life balance and company culture. The emphasis on Innovation and Associate culture makes bringing ideas to the table very easy across the entire company. The Five Principles (Quality, Responsibility, Mutuality, Efficiency, and Freedom), instead of being a tagline, permeate throughout every decision and conversation. Line managers are very devoted to career development of all associates, which is made evident by the Continuing Education program, and the ease with which transitions are made between departments, functions, and even different segments of the larger Mars organization. 
Being on the R&D side, the inherent creativity involved in creating gum and candy leads to a very fun and engaging work environment. Everyone is very helpful, and it truly makes me love working here.","As with any large company, there are administrative hoops to jump through and required trainings / development plans. However the difference lies in the company culture, and that people genuinely seem to care about your career development and happiness. 
Additionally, the company needs to work a little more on cross-functional communication, as well as cascading decisions and reasons for decisions that come from the leadership teams to the rest of the associates. This is made difficult sometimes when people move into different roles very fluidly (see above: career development). Yet this is something the company acknowledges and very openly is working on bettering this aspect."

The leaders saw a need for increased focus on employee engagement, and have devoted a lot of time and resources to it over the past year or so.

I feel that the quality of the people hired in all levels the last 8-9 years is very low compared to older generations ( in terms of values and skills). In addition, during the past 12 yrs a lot of talented senior associates with many yrs of experience in Mars (10-20 yrs) have left the business. This has created problems in the Mars talent pipeline...Skills, hard work and results are not valued any more, you only need to pretend that you are working and build good relations with the higher management in order to be promoted. The top management teams around Europe are focused more on politics, and holding their positions at any cost ( even at the expense of mars...in the long run)! When results are not good they don t take responsibility...its always someone else's fault...the economy, their team, the unit's structure, the previous GM etc

Not only regarding my line manager and team, but people from across the business are happy to go out of their way to make introductions and connect you with the information you need.  Chance run-ins turn into ""get to know you"" downloads and information is transferred casually and earnestly. Everyone is extremely bright and motivated to succeed, so it's easy to reach out and partner with others.  I have the pleasure of sitting at the same site as the R&D team, and it’s inspiring to see the work they do pursuing new innovations every day. 

Comp and benefits – At Wrigley, there is a competitive advantage in compensation and benefit offerings to associates.  But the thing that stood out to me right away is how well they get work-life balance.  It’s not just a concept, but a practice in flexibility while still meeting goals and achieving results. Wrigley also provides amenities that aid work-life balance such as an onsite cafeteria that serves breakfast and lunch daily, a fitness facility that’s free to associates, an onsite wellness and fitness coach, and our site also offers free parking which is a premium in itself. 

Opportunities for development – After 4 months with the business, I already feel the investment in my development.  My line manager has had conversations about my goals and next potential moves to serve as a framework for setting my objectives and connecting me with the right projects to get involved.  Besides learning on the job, there are also dedicated online resources for training that are supplemented by instructor-led courses to ensure new associates in our department receive the same foundational understanding of our signature processes.","Overall, I've been really happy with my decision to join Wrigley.  I think that if you lean towards extroversion, you'll have no trouble adjusting to the energy and pace of the environment, but that if you consider yourself more introverted you may be uncomfortable with our open-environment seating and the high-relationship culture."

- 401k match and immediate vesting
- flexibility if you have kids

They try to be employee conscious, very sensitive to employee's perception of the ""culture."" If you pick the right path, you don't have to work too hard and will still get praised.","- Pay is average.  Bonuses are based almost exclusively on how the business performed (decided by Mars family).
- big lack of accountability, most are afraid to take risks or make mistakes so quick decisions are hard to come by unless there is a fire to be put out.
- 5 principles are applied in a selective manner, but are printed everywhere.
- This is a private company but it may as well be public.
- Cash is king. They will cut corners wherever possible to ensure bottom line is as lean as can be. This includes under-staffing and screwing over external business partners.
- Perception, not performance, is everything (hard to control since open office environment allows for a lot of quick judgment).
- Trust is hard to come by

The flat hierarchy helps younger staff feel important but that doesn't mean everyone is seen as a partner. There are still decision makers who have those in a lower tier ""figure out"" how to make those decisions come to fruition - the accountability for failure will normally fall on those further down the chain.

Don't think the ""Mars"" name on your resume will help much externally. The culture is viewed in a pretty negative light by those outside of the business as people who love it will stay (hence why few outside of Mars has a positive outlook)"

Many high performers who have a world of experience are promised the next slots on assessment centres but never get them, although the line managers and upper management are more than happy to off load extra duties onto those experienced employees because they know the work will be done to the standards they require.

2118,Mars,Great people and culture for a company always in a state of flux,2015-08-06,4.0,Site Quality and Food Safety Manager,"Culture:  Mars' corporate principles are not just jargon and schlock.  The company believes in its five principles, and they drive that belief to the associates through good engagement and follow-through.  The five principles can be quoted by just about anyone, and the reason they can be quoted is that the principle are communicated and they are intertwined into daily life.

Privately held:  This company can do what it wants, because it is privately held and has a boat load of money.  This is great, because its decisions are not swayed by Wall Street and they are not purely $$ driven.

Doing the right thing:  In my many many years at the company, decisions in regard to the consumer and customer are always made for the right reasons:  product doesn't meet spec? Don't ship it.  Product concerns? destroy it and do it right.  

Continuous Improvement:  This company is always striving to do better and to be at the forefront of product quality and safety.","Innovation- Mars Petcare does not put the effort and time into novel products like it used to.  The company is more focused at beating competitors at their own game and chasing after them, than it is creating and nurturing its own unique features that distinguish their brands from the competition.

Hiring- When I started, it was grueling and calculated.  They picked the best of the best, and turnover was nil.  The intelligence and energy were phenomenal in the company.  It's seems that lawyers and HR have run rampant with some brand of fear-mongering, so now the selection process is overly-scripted and pat.  It does not get a sense of whether the person and the company are a good fit culturally and ideologically.  Hiring managers are very constrained in what they can ask and have candidates demonstrate in interviews.

Red tape and decisiveness:  Everyone has to be involved in everyone else's business and with everyone wanting to put in their two cents, no one is able to make a decision.  In fact, quite often people are afraid to make decisions.  Rather than moving forward and getting things done, often topics are tabled for another meeting...rinse and repeat."

A lot of celebrations and silly events for average business results just to pretend that everything's fine and to keep everybody's moral high enough just to hide that things do not move in the proper direction. Lot of office politics, one can advance if there are enough ""connections"", no matter how good one is, results come second, recommendations and personal preferences come first (so be careful with whom you drink your morning coffee). The 5 principles, hanged on every single wall, are just what they are: nice principles written on a piece of paper, nobody lives them, the more people talks about them (a nice cover to hide a lot of shortcomings), the less they stick to them. Sometimes one can have the impression to have just joined a cult.

2206,Mars,Wizard of Oz - Great company...at first.,2015-03-29,2.0,Brand Manager,"Amazing people work at Mars. I have never had such a social circle within a company before.
Work from home (function dependent)
Great at making you think you have control and ability to make changes
Onsite gym, cafeteria, free coffee, candy and treats.
Amazing pension and benefits package.","Mars has no understanding of technology and it's importance in our society. Old laptops, terrible systems, slow internet, awful IT processes. If you like productivity, tech, and ecommerce - you will go nuts trying to move the needle at this company. 

100% responsibility, but no authority. You are given targets that are not grounded in reality and do not take into consideration budgets. You will not get a bonus if you can't achieve these results with the shrinking bugets.

Capacity and work life balance do not matter. You will be in a tug of war for resources across the office and expect everyone to be overworked. Below the manager level, expect everyone to be grossly underpaid for the amount of work they do. 

Performance reviews are bell curved. An entire team can't be excellent. Some people on the team must be ""below expectations"" every year. 2 years in a row mean you are on the street. You can be below expectations soley because of business results - so regardless how hard you work - if you are on a brand or customer that isn't growing, you will likely not get a bonus or have the ability to get a promotion.

No one can think for themselves. Rules are rules are rules. A process must be followed, because it always has been that way. Mars likes to have a lean office, and therefore there is no redundancy. If you get sick, your work just piles up. Departments looking to save money or create more capacity for their team will create processes that simply move the work onto another department. If you have a director not engaged with this political/process battle - you will get swamped with grunt work barely related to your job. 

Not inclusive - if  you have a food allergy, expect no support or accommodations. Good luck having time to leave the building to get a lunch somewhere else. 

HR (P&O at Mars): Spread gossip and over share your personal information. They do not know how to troubleshoot. No one can think for themselves. I was set up in every system incorrectly: to the point I couldn't get paid the first few weeks.

Pay: WATCH OUT! 10% of your pay is a ""punctuality bonus"" which you will not get paid when you are on holidays, get sick, or for any reason do not punch in on time each day. I had a meeting with the VP of P&O (HR) an hour before my ""start time"" and that was not proof I was on time, so my pay got docked. DO NOT ever expect to get 100% of that punctuational bonus. As a watch out: when they first give you our offer, they won't separate out that amount from your base pay. 

Pay roll errors: Mars makes mistakes on your weekly pay (yes, even office workers on salary get paid weekly, and your salary is converted to an hourly rate). They make so many mistakes it will bogglle your mind. Watch out though - if they underpay you, it will take weeks or months to get it back. If they over pay you, they will beat you up until it is fully repaid. Payroll and finance seem to not understand income tax and will come after you for the amount that Canada Revenue collects. 

Clean desk policy: Expect to have a terrible time trying to store paperwork, samples, or any other physical item you want in the office. You can't leave stuff on your desk, but they don't give you storage to put it in. My desk, 1.5 years in, is still filled with stuff from the previous 2 employees. 

Promotions and development: Mars talks an amazing game on this. Keep in mind, whoever is your manager controls your fate.  Unimpressive employees can shoot through the ranks with a manager who wants to make it happen. I work on a team with a manager who believes they are brilliant and everyone else has way too much to learn still and therefore no one under them moves quickly.  *You cannot get a promotion or move to another department without your manager's support.*"

This includes an annual focus on Gallup engagement survey.  Although encouraged to express your opinion you must make sure to be a team player as it is ambiguous as to how this will affect your position and team in the big picture.  Mars tends to make major restructures called ""revitalizations"" about every other year and due to the fact that the company must maintain the view of non-discrimination, they'll separate with anyone regardless of performance.  Goals are strictly bottom line to the corporate OGSM and they will sacrifice success at field level and the financial betterment of the field sales team to ensure that the corporate leadership makes it bonus.  Be prepared to work for your salary and not much more.  Took sales driven brands and made them marketing driven brands to great detriment of wonderful brands.  Most of the marketing personnel were barely out of grad school with little real world experience and made changes to the brands without understanding the market, industry, and legacy of the brands themselves which led to huge declines in brand awareness, customer satisfaction, and retail sell through.  They created confusing messaging and instead of becoming the leader of the industry as they could have, they became the ""safe"" brand which follows the leader many months/years behind innovation and continues to lose share."

You get to work with people from many countries if you're in IT.","It's decades behind in IT technology and only recently started to catch up. Each unit still behaves as a silo and even within teams, there is a dissonance between team members (global vs. local focus). You only get information if you' ve a relationship with someone, know somebody, etc. It' s a very social company and the perfect place for extroverts. Introverts will have difficulty with the open office space and the inconsistent information sharing. There is no global strategy besides very high-level points. In day-to-day activities, your local office is the one deciding things (and giving your performance review). The help-desk organization is really dysfunctional and serves a very small purpose, there is a lot of duplication of effort throughout the organization and teams that only do "" supervision""  work to close gaps that wouldn' t exist if the other teams had ownership and worked together. Too much management, very few skilled IT workers. Not a very good place to grow your IT career (unless you want to move from technical to management/supervision/liaison roles)."

Then the manager will do everything in their power to get you fired if you are a threat to them. They are quick to sweep things under the carpet so they won't get in trouble.  Circle the wagons around the protected few. What started off as a good plant went downhill fast.
2260,Mars,"If you have other employment options, SERIOUSLY consider those options instead of Mars.",2014-12-19,1.0,Sales and Sales Support,"Superb health and dental benefits and vacation time. Training and promotions come with time and excessive effort from the associate. If you are willing to write extensive and detailed information about yourself and your work endeavors and are able to highlight your skill sets and politicize your efforts to upper management, you will succeed at Mars/Mars Petcare. Compensation is top-notch, but often at the mercy of upper management decisions, sales target numbers (gross sales volume) and the high stress that comes with meeting each of those targets.","You must be willing to move, relocate and/or change roles every 2-4 years. Mars likes to ""reorganize"" or ""realign"" every 2-4 years, so you never get too comfortable in one position, especially if you are in a sales or customer support role. The Mars culture prefers younger people (under 40) to work at Mars. As you age over 40, be prepared to be released or realigned. Mars likes to think they are run by the 5 principles (responsibility, freedom, quality, mutuality and efficiency). However, the only time the 5 Principles are discussed is shortly before the associates take their employment Gallup survey each year. Upper management wants the Mars family to believe that they run their organization by the 5 Principles, but ask anyone who has been let go by this company to tell you if they were treated fairly or according to the 5 Principles. It is really shameful what they do to companies they buy out--they immediately disengage associates and associates lose their passion for the businesses they once loved. If you are seeking employment here, try to find someone who has worked for another company that was bought out by Mars and you will gain a deeper understanding of how intolerable employment is at Mars. Mars is now a mini-P&G because so many associates migrated from that company. This company does not do a great job promoting women and has very little diversity (meaning people of color) and does not seem to respect or value the contribution of Veterans in their company.  Further, this company does not value tenure, so even if you have been performing exceptionally well for many years, you will still be considered for realignment and reorganization if the company decides a reorganization is in order."

There are plenty of opportunities to move to different (lateral) positions during your career. The benefits are good for a company of this size, but not the best. Finally some of the of the most interesting and nicest people you'll meet are those who've been with the company 30+ years.","Mars seems to only recognize associates who are extroverts. Introverts, results \ performance based associates are typically overlooked for advancement if they lack the ""schmoozing"" trait. This results in many people whom you might work with being completely superficial about building friendships \ relationships. If it is discovered that you may or may not have any influence over someone's advancement, the relationship building seems to die off quickly with the more ...ambitious associates. 

Diversity is woefully sad \ absent. While there are some examples of women and minorities being promoted, minorities are pitifully underrepresented in middle \ upper management (if existent at all). Diversity of thinking \ thought is promoted, yet Mars management heavy culture produces managers who are all white males, uniformly dressed in the same color shirts, and are slow to think outside of the box. It literally is a group-think culture.

Mars is middle management heavy. Which makes navigation much more complex than it should be. Which means that an idea, project plan or a proposal must be run through a gauntlet of managers first if to be given the green light. If one manager is absent or disapproves of your approach, plan for a delay. Until there is a consensus, your project is going nowhere."

If you aren't an extroverted person who likes to socialize constantly, and talk yourself and your work up, it is highly unlikely that you will get promoted. Events and meetings always feel like an opportunity to just that, with people jockeying for their personal agendas. As a result, if you just want to get to know people on a personal level, it just don't happen, especially if you have nothing to offer. There is an element of exclusiveness among higher managers, which make you feel undervalued and unimportant if you are just starting out.

To that point, the organization has a ton of managers, and not enough people who are actually doing the work. 

Often reporting structures don't make a ton of sense, and you manager might not even be in your state or country, which is tough when you start off at an organization which thrives on developing relationships.

Pay is less than the industry average. The pace of getting things done is very, very slow. So much of our technical work is outsourced, leaving little to learn or develop in terms of skills."

I learned a lot with this organization but not through traditional development channels.","Mars prides itself on ""open office"" work spaces and touts that this is an important part of the culture. To a degree this is true because collaboration and networking are VERY important to being effective in your work. It's a challenge for new starters to ramp up quickly because they need to be able to build their network and there is little to support them in doing so. 
The culture is also billed as entrepreneurial and within limits you can have a lot of autonomy.  The hidden issue is that for most bigger decisions the processes are very consensus driven and this makes getting things done very slow. Over time this can be frustrating to those that want to move more quickly and lead in an agile way.
The IT organization is very male dominated and they cannot seem to retain their female leadership. I often felt like I was passed over for opportunities that went to male colleagues, this seemed to be a global issue so is likely deeply ingrained in the culture, but may be limited to IT."

If you land in the right spot and build relationships with the right people you can fast track to management regardless of your competence, this is not really a pro as conversely if you land in the wrong spot and are unable to cultivate the right relationships through no fault of your own you will fail regardless of your ability, your work ethic, and any value you add to the company
Opportunities exist for personal and professional development through developing competencies through training courses, Mars encourages this as they have a very robust performance and review process tied to developing these competencies.  The problem is that while I believe this process was well intentioned when it was developed, it's execution is abysmal, the review process is inconsistent from team to team and department to department.  It's often merely paid lip service too and in many cases that I saw as an employee it's used to scapegoat an associate rather than develop him/her.  The courses and the concept of the review process are still a value add even if they fail in practical application.","The 5 Principles (Quality, Responsibility, Mutuality, Efficiency, Freedom) are posted very visibly at every Mars site, in every conference room.  The problem is that you constantly see people preaching about them while breaking them in the same breath.  One prime example is something called a punctuality bonus.  At Mars every associate punches in at a time clock regardless of position.  If you are a minute late you lose your punctuality bonus for the day, which means you lose 10% of that days salary.  The problem is that some members of management never punch a clock, they override it, which is fine except in the same breath they will tell you that they have to do it just like everyone else.  This is one example of the hypocrisy that pervades the business.
Like any other company you have good people and bad, the thing is that in the span of my 25 year career I've never seen so many bad people in management, getting promoted through the ranks while good people stagnate in low paid jobs, or get backstabbed out of the company.
I personally witnessed a scenario where  product went through development and made it's way to the retail shelf of one division with a retail price point before the plant management had determined production cost or assigned a wholesale price.  Three people involved - the one who discovered the error, and the two who committed it.  Guess which two were promoted and which one left the company.
Associates are either grossly underpaid, or grossly overpaid.  This means that in many cases you can't attract good talent unless you catch them in a time of desperation.  Overpaid associates are generally ones who landed in the right place and either manage to master the game of Mars politics through stepping on the necks of their peers or playing the game of not caring about what's best for the company when it conflicts with what's best for them.  The Talent Management System encourages this practice leading to situations where if something is good for Mars but isn't on an associates objectives, it's ignored regardless of whether it impacts a departments budget or not."
2321,Mars,Great company,2014-07-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits.  Fair compensation.  Most of the associates are like family.  Plenty of opportunities to learn and grow.  People willing to work hard are rewarded.  Lots of chances for recognition.  Genuine use of the 5 Principles for guidance.,Upward mobility is somewhat lacking.  Sometimes I feel we are changing just for the sake of changing. Gum segment is declining so that makes some people scared.

Management truly cares about associates and wants to ensure that everyone develops and progresses.","The current business plan isn't working, despite several changes to senior management and strategy.  Investment was reduced in the category once Wrigley was purchased, and gum ain't healthy today.

Wrigley’s brand strategy and heritage are known throughout the world and is something that is expected from a large CPG company but also something we are proud of.  However, Wrigley often times feels like a small company—in a good way. During my time at Wrigley I have had the privilege of working on cross-functioning teams where we were given the freedom to problem solve critical issues that face the company. It is exciting to work in a group your opinion is weighed on its value rather than the title of the person speaking. Lastly, Wrigley strongly supports your career aspirations.

It does get a bit political as I've seen several associates get rewarded and promoted even though a program they worked on lost the company money and was mismanaged.

2439,Mars,Look a little deeper,2013-07-05,3.0,Project Engineer,"Mars generally invest a lot of time and money into their associates through training and other programs. Their rewards program is very much a ""package"" deal, with numerous non-monetary benefits. Mars' unique culture means they are known for recruiting high quality associates so you know that most of the people you are working with are friendly, helpful and willing to work with you. Mars has a corporate structure that allows you to gain horizontal exposure (inter-departmental) if you desire it, although this will need to be driven by you to make it happen. Loyalty is high at Mars, a lot of associates feel like they are looked after and will stay with the business for long periods of time because of it. The company spends a lot of time on the principle of ""engagement"" to help drive productivity and satisfaction at work. Because of the globalization of the organization some horrendous hours are required (occasionally) but generally the business is ""give-take"" to most associates regarding work life balance. Numerous times I have found myself on the phone in the evenings and doing work, but I get a lot of these hours back by taking time off elsewhere at my convenience. Mars also heavily pushes the 5 principles, those who give these philosophies the time they deserve generally find their working life very satisfying.","In some respects, Mars doesn't ""value"" their employees from a monetary perspective. Salary levels are pretty set at what you sign up to, and are influenced heavily by market ""comparisons"" (they never divulge the specific detail) and are also compared to other associates at the same level in similar roles. Good luck negotiating a pay increase that is outside the normal development system because they are generally reluctant unless you are some kind of super hero. The ""lets treat everyone the same"" mentality can bring into play serious cases of ""tall poppy"" syndrome. Mars typically doesn't like to ""promote"" people doing great things, recognition is often private and contained - probably because people are afraid to single out high-performing individuals. It is hard to maintain motivation as a ""high achiever"" as the business treats you the same to everyone else who are doing a mid-range job. Networking and career advancement is a real problem in the organization and feels heavily politically driven. The business does not recruit/network well across business units (chocolate, food, drinks, wrigley, petcare etc) and pushes the individual (ie you) to take control of this with pretty much no support (a very difficult thing to do). Roles come and go but generally there isn't a lot of movement so trying to plan your next career move is extremely difficult. Mars has a very heavy ""set and forget"" mentality. They tend to rely on the fact that associates are engaged enough to be satisfied where they are until an opportunity arises, so they do not know how to cater for the high-performing and ambitious individual who desires to create their own opportunity. The business is also very global, which can be problematic as decision making from ""up the ladder"" that has no practical or specific relevance to the site must be followed - often costing time and/or $ for no particularly constructive reason. Challenging global direction is generally frowned upon, and a ""follower"" mentality is generally expected from the senior management."

These days, Mars has changed a bit trying to be more like the latest ""Fad"" companies such as Google...
They should stick to the original designs that made them what they are today.
not as much advancements from within the company. ( its still there though )
not hiring as many full time associates.
Outside temp agencies doing the hiring now - no promises for full time jobs.
Outsourcing many jobs that used to be internally done.
new managers should have more hands on, working experience before they are put in their new position.
associates have to now self promote themselves to their managers...and develope their own progress goals and justify them. ( when it should be the manager who suggests advancement oppurtunities ) 
compensation has been on the decline in the name of staying competative to other companies.
Benifits still remain ok, but are not what they once were."

2539,Mars,Dissapointed by lack of direction and investment. Management only interested in self-promotion.,2012-01-08,2.0,Lead Operator,Secure employment as long as you keep your head down and agree with your manager all the time. Pay is average. Free chocolate that is often out of date. Shop floor operatives are hard working and passionate about what they do.,"The culture of nepatism is destroying any chance of getting anything done. It takes 10 years to develop a good relationship with any of the long term staff (and there are a lot of them) in order to get anything done. This is very demoralising as a profesional engineer to have to make lots of plastic friends in order to achieve the simplest resolution to a problem. You should be able to ask a profesional to complete a task and he/she should just do it without weeks of office flirting and gallons of coffee. Way to much focus on soft skills and no visible means of improving manufacturing, mechanical or electrical skill levels. Any monkey can pick up a spanner and hit the machinery then ask for help saying ' I didn't touch it'. It makes for a miserable existance when you have to keep fixing the same issues day in day out. I will be leaving here soon and will not look back with fond memories."

Can wear casual attire
Free hot beverages in the staff room
Opportunity to work more than contracted hours IF the store is making target","Supervisors are trouble makers mainly because they are often left to do as they please by managers.
Managers hire and fire at will with very little explanation or genuine cause.
Unnecessary amounts of pressure is put on staff who are expected to be happy 100% of the time despite increasingly tense working environments.
Managers regularly b*tch and gossip about the personal lives of colleagues and often try to control, manipulate and dictate how staff members live their lives and deal with issues outside of the work environment.
When I first started working there the core principles> Mutuality, Freedom, Efficiency, Quality and Responsibility were thrown about heavily and we were encouraged to think of them and enforce them in our daily activities - towards the end we were told that mutuality was a lie and freedom certainly did not exist in that place.
I do wonder how the Mars family would feel if they truly saw how M&M's World is being run."
2542,Mars,Position not as described and rather miserable.,2011-12-22,1.0,,"Decent benefits
Stable job
The lower ranking production workers and office people are a great bunch to work with.
Free chocolate","Annual bonus is based upon opinion of managers with no set guide lines for rating.
Job descriptions and reality don't match.
Promotion and evaluation are not based upon competence and ability but on politics.
Company propaganda is misleading.
The old boys network controls everything to protect themselves at all costs.
The few do the work of the many.
Training is virtually non-existent and very hard to get.
Everything is geared towards office people with little regard towards production workers."
2543,Mars,Mostly positive experience but in last two years major organizational changes with Mars Company as parent company.,2011-12-19,3.0,,Generous benefits; gum and mints sell well in most markets.,Wrigley associates are scambling to proof value to the new parent company- causing some competitive back-biting in the business units.

2546,Mars,Fun brands but not an ideal place to work.,2011-11-20,2.0,,"It's hard to beat the opportunity to work with candy and gum brands.  They have a solid category management and consumer insights organization, which help keep it on the forefront of the industry.","It's very easy to get stuck in a silo in either Sales, Customer Marketing, or Brand Marketing.  Very difficult to make the move from Sales to Brand Marketing and/or Customer Marketing to Brand.  Brand Marketers typically only recruited from Michigan, Northwestern, Chicago GSB, and Indiana.  A large number of these MBA recruits are in-out very quickly and management seems very disinterested in filling these roles from the internal talent pool, which is very frustrating given the experience and education of a number of internal employees.

The sales organization is run by old, salty account managers that are (for the most part) difficult to work for and with.  The general feel is that they are worried about losing their jobs to younger, more educated managers so the exchange of information and experience often gets muddled in an attempt to preserve themselves.

Chicago isn't a bad place to live and work, but I don't think I'd recommend Wrigley as a great place to work, particularly given the other options in the area (i.e. Pepsi, Kraft, etc.).

Overall the leadership by the executive team is rather disappointing, as the communication of the strategic vision isn't always very clear."

2549,Mars,A good place to work with opportunity if you take it,2011-11-08,5.0,Finance Analyst,You can make your work what you want to be. You will continually be challeneged by your peers. Managmenet is very strong and they will listen to your ideas. Very balanced male/female management (50% of managers are female). A great place to be developed. The five principles give associates a lot of freedom in makin decsision and having autonomy,The IT systems are truly poor; although some progress is being made. It can be about who you know and how you can leverage your networks. A more informal promotion process even though it is shrouded in formality
