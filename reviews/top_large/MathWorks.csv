5,MathWorks,Good onramp to corporate world,2022-03-30,5.0,EDG,"MathWorks has the program called Engineering Development Group (EDG). They hire you at a position called Application Support engineers. They groom engineers in this program. There are 2 aspects to this role. 

1) One is providing customer support. Customer support handles cases related to MATLAB, Simulink where basically you are a customer facing engineer who resolve customer issues. Majority of the customers are automobile industries and college Prof/Students. We try to resolve cases at our end but if we need development support we escalate the cases and act as middle man between customer and development. 
This is good exposure to new hires since they don't know about MATLAB and Simulink, and how it is used in the industry. Also, they work on communication skills, stakeholder management and product knowledge in this role majorly.

2) Second is working with development teams here we work on small projects/features (4-6 weeks). This is normal Dev work, you work with them to get a taste of the team. This is kind of matchmaking, to see if you like the team and the team likes you. So you can work with different teams until you find a good match.

Once you find a good match you can transfer out to that team.","As long as you are in EDG you need to do support work. So, you can keep trying different teams but in parallel you need to work on support as well."

-If you're looking to move from a non-CS background to software engineering it can provide you with a good transition, as they actively hire non-CS grads.","There are a lot of reasons why I would highly advise against joining EDG and have highlighted the main ones.

- There is a high probability that you will not get the position you want once you transfer out of EDG. You can end up waiting years for a position to open up in your preferred team. Most people choose to transfer to whatever position is available rather than wait for their preferred position because the technical support (in theory 50% of the work, but often higher) aspect of the work ends up being so unbearable after around 9-12 months.

- The department is constantly understaffed and we are put under a lot of pressure to satisfy the department KPIs of resolving support tickets. This in practice meant pulling a lot of extra work to deal with the workload and for a long time even being asked to work on cases during weeks allocated to projects weeks

- The managers are clueless and have limited experience with technical support and do not seem to understand the challenges of technical support and the fact that most of our challenges stem from being understaffed. If it wasn't for our full-time Technical Support Engineer colleagues with their high-value experience and knowledge we would be screwed. The Managers just blame us for being overwhelmed with cases on the""team efficiency"". They would constantly come up with terrible ideas that don't work and create an atmosphere where short-term fixes and taking shortcuts (e.g. spending less time per case to resolve it) were encouraged implicitly. When these shortcuts would inevitably backfire and engineers receive low customer satisfaction surveys, the manager would act all surprised that it happened and chastise them.

- Work-life balance can be a hit or miss. I had no issues and managed to get work done without working overtime, but I know a lot of people who had to work many extra hours. The main culprit of this was getting new responsibilities without adequate training or support to take on that responsibility. A common situation was when EDGers would be given the rotational team lead role and would work extra hours due to the high volume of tech support cases and the high pressure put on them to deal with it.

- A lot of useless/outdated training and processes (which you often need to do during your project weeks). What ends up happening is that in frustration answers get copied from more senior staff who have already completed them.

- EDG is an afterthought in the company and it is seen as less important than other roles. An example is that for orientation in pre-covid times, EDGers are put in the back of the line can end up waiting over 10 months to complete their BPO (company orientation), while staff from other departments often have the option to do it in the first few weeks/months. 

- The way that management gets around their failures to hit KPIs is by deflecting the failings to the EDGer. Every year a certain percentage of EDGer worldwide are laid off due to ""performance reasons"" (Similar to the ""hire to fire"" policy that other companies use)"

159,MathWorks,Mostly Great,2021-10-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The work-life balance is generally very manageable and colleagues have great attitude and are pleasant to work with.,"The benefits and compensation are slowly sliding downwards on competitiveness. Review process appears well laid out on paper per company policy but in practice it is very archaic and not transparent. Essentially the managers direct and skip level pre-determine the performance review well ahead of time despite what is stated on the review policy. 

Managers also have limited control over raises. After they predetermine the rating (which is not always necessarily unfairly rated), HR takes the rating and runs some algo to determine the raise. Despite good performance ratings that raise can be somewhat underwhelming and there is little transparency to the raise process as well. 

For such an otherwise great company there is little mobility to switch teams internally and the underwhelming raises cause some folks to jump ship for a better raise. This is a common problem in the industry but I think the company can try harder to be the exception to this norm. 

Lastly the company seems to be very hesitant on WFH policies and makes last minute decisions especially during the pandemic based on what other companies are doing. For a SW company already with a lot of collaborative remote work across global teams, I think there is a missed opportunity to be proactive and a trend setter in being innovative and flexible with WFH."

You learn 95% of everything you'll ever need to know in the first 2-3 years.","While a job at MathWorks work is very stable, it comes at the price of long-term stagnation. Understand that MathWorks is a private company and has been run by the same person for 40 years.

* Everyone I met was great to work with
* The work feels important

* There's a cafeteria right inside the building (for Lakeside and Apple Hill campuses)","If you want to be a developer, note that ASEs do development work only about half of the time with a team of their choosing, more or less. You do technical support during the other half (taking phone calls with customers, answering emails, and troubleshooting issues). However, there is an expectation that you will transfer to another team within about a year, whether that's a development team, sales, application engineering, education/training, or whatnot. Transferring out can take longer if you don't mesh well with the teams you work with or if the team you want to work with has few/no open positions. 

A whole bunch of ASEs were let go all around the same time as I was. We all had a similar experience; we were given a ""performance improvement plan"" and if we did not meet the improvement goals after 2 weeks, we could either try one more time for another 2 weeks or take a severance package. I heard that *nobody* passed the performance improvement plan. In retrospect, it seems that it was really a layoff but they just didn't want to call it a layoff for some reason.

Pros:
- Great products that really do make a difference in the world. I am proud every day of the work I do 
- More rational approach to growth
- Far better long range planning
- Process oriented culture (when its not overused) helps the organization execute better
- Management treats you like a person, not a number on the expense ledger
- Lots of great people and genuinely friendly environment
- Much better job stability than average for tech industry. This is one of the few companies in the sector that you don't have to constantly look over your shoulder for the next restructuring/RIF
- Annual merit increases are not bad for high performers
- Fringe benefits (retirement/health)_ etc very competetive
- fabulous facilities (but this hasn't been of much benefit for the last 18 months)","- Work/life balance took a massive turn for the worse during COVID. Management talks about taking time out, but the reality is all your peers work around the clock, emailing all hours of hte day and night and fill your calendar with non-stop meetings and you get glued to your chair worse than when we where in office. 
- Individual workload is very inconsistent. High performers experience the stress I noted above while other team members seem to just coast along and not be busy. But there doesn't appear to be a big difference in opportunities and benefits presented to high vs. low performers.
- Most of the tech industry has announced flexible/hybrid return to work plans but nothing but lip service here.
- Process is taken to an extreme here. measure twice cut once becomes ""measure 20 times, maybe cut someday if the right boss says its ok""... 
- Many of the great people that make this place fun are leaving due to burnout. I'm not sure what we are going back to in September.
- Base salaries are still very low for the industry.
- All the hype about the stakeholder bonus is mostly that - hype. Even with stellar reviews your annual rating growth is capped and hence bonus payouts never get much better than a single digit % of salary for 90% of employees. Similar performance at the FAANGs etc. earn equity bonuses that are a multiple of salary.
- Not handling global growth as well as they could. To much confusion over responsibility sharing across US, Europe and Asia development sites.
- Very complicated legacy internal tools slow us down and make it harder to move to industry standard DevOPS stack."

3. HR is very cooperative.","1. The culture is terrible
2. Managers think that they are school teachers and employees are kids.They are rude and arrogant. So many junior resources had to call them 'Sir' just to satisfy their ego.
3. In 1-on-1 meetings they often stress about spending 9 hr I office. But expect to work beyond 8.30 pm as meetings are setup regularly beyond 8.00 pm.
4. Managers doesn't know much about coding and technicalities. They often blabber nonsense in team meetings to show their presence. They reject your ideas but don't feel the need to explain why, they are managers you know..
5. When you join the org no one takes responsibility of onboarding. Namesake buddy will be assigned who will not answer your queries nor feels necessary to set the context. Never had such a horrible experience
6. Micromanagement to a level that will surprise you. When you talk to a colleague in India or US, your manager in US will have a record of that. Unbelievable.. but it happened. 
7. The hiring manager had lied/cheated about the technology that I would be working. When expressed displeasure about the same, he threatened that he would issues a PIP
8. The team I worked is totally mismanaged and the work culture is terrible. 
9. A lot of presentations and documentation. The emphasis is more on how you prepare your presentations and not on the quality of development. Font of a specific bullet point is more important than content. 
10. Most of the teams are peripheral to Simulink hence they don't find it important to write neat code.
11. It's not a place if you are an experienced/ambitious C++ developer. Keep away from Hyderabad office.

Jack, the CEO, is humble and steers the ship with an expert and nuanced hand.","The documentation group diverges significantly from the values, culture, and technical quality of the rest of the company: management seems to have confused fear with respect. It is the patent toxic environment described in Forbes article ""The Real Reason Great Employees Quit -- And Bad Employees Get Promoted"".

Should your manager fear that your activities or questions relating to your job, the content of your work, or your product documentation's needs will threaten his or her status quo, you will be considered a threat, and will likely be targeted at a later point. 

You should not expect transparency or rational conversations; in management's perspective, you are replaceable, because your job description is to say yes to what they say, and then publish it to the web. This is likely because management fears that it is fundamentally replaceable, and in the group's self-definition, you cannot have a quality that your boss does not have.

Regardless of what's said in the job description, your experience does not matter, and colleagues in other departments will assume that you have no technical experience to draw on. Management won't help; showing respect or explaining ""why"" also threatens the hierarchical balance.

The work you do will never be assessed. The conversations you have with management will never touch on the content of your work. Any yearly measure of ""quality"" or ""performance"" will mean ""compliance"", or, loyalty. Ultimately, you will only be assessed on whether your personality resembles the personalities of the management team. Did you ever wish you were  a mean girl? Now's your chance.

If you value teamwork, creativity, and critical thinking, this position is not for you."

I joined MW too because I had no option and it's difficult to live or leave here.,"From management to employees' appreciation, and from working environment to honing one's skills, If I could give 0, I would give 0 / 100.

1.) People from IITs/NITs/BITS/IIITs are hired at decent salaries and forced to do Technical Support. Now, I am not only against Tech Support, I am also against the micro-management that the department follow for the employees. 
Each morning they have scrums - good, but the managers expect you to speak up something even if that is out of context or doesn't make any sense. If you don't, u will be bashed in your 1:1.

2.) Project work - You will love working with your project teams and on your project work, because most of the teams are good and follow best practices here. But, EDG manager would make it sure to itch you for every small thing here. The reason being-
EDG managers are non-technical. They would ask you to explain all about the project, the challenges you are facing and would not understand the challenges you explain them. Even for the challenges for which the project managers would support you and completely understand the delay. In the end, EDG managers would still thrash you and would put the blame on you for every small thing - ""Project being late"" and all sorts of small things.

3.) Constant Feedback -
Once in 2 weeks, you will be presented with your feedback. Feedback on every small thing. ""Not speaking in meetings."" ""This is what I heard from him/her"" ""This is what I heard from your project manager"" ""You are not working on this area""
The story doesn't end here. All the small and negative points will be extrapolated and all the good feedback will not be told to you by the EDG manager. While, when you ask your reviews from your project manager, he would always tell you the true story - plusses and deltas which would help you push in the next project. Most of the feedback you take from your project manager and EDG manager will not match.
This leads to an employee in a depressed/demotivated state, and this happens in a loop (every 2 weeks). But, remember, you just graduated from one of the top institutes of India. Keep your head high and keep working.

4.) Manipulation - managers manipulate you. They force you to go to Quality Engg deptt. even if you don't want to, or they would insult you so much that you will be forced to either leave the company or go to QE. There is no future and self-growth in the company, and you won't learn any marketable and competent skills. In the end, you will be left put with nothing, all your experience will be considered void in other companies.

5.) They expect you to join and organize the parties (HR work), which they somehow consider to be part of your leadership and initiative skills (remember, MW is a technical giant). If you don't organize, they would insult you again blaming you how terrible of a leader you are. 

6.) Micro-management - EDG managers' job is to help you in managing daily activities and your projects. That's the only job they have, and they fail to perform that too.

The story doesn't end here though. 
Late to a meeting by a few minutes? - You should have told us you will be late
Can't join a meeting because your mother was sick? - keep managers informed next time, which means they want us to stop caring for our parents and prioritize work on even your or your relatives' lives."

As an engineer, I enjoy using the products and as a business person, I believe those products actually do ""accelerate the pace of engineering and science,"" which make me feel pretty good. Management is willing to help you offset your workload if it is too much, so speak up, and you will be heard. Being a private company, stakeholder = employee , not stockholder, which is great. The company is steadily growing. Overall, MathWorks is a great company to work for.","In Japan, the end of a fiscal year is March. A lot of customers ask for consulting services between December and March, and it gets pretty busy. If you want a job that is very steady, like 8 - 5 pm throughout the year, this is probably not a good position. On the other hand, if you get motivated to produce great outputs under some, reasonable pressure, consulting is great.

You might feel that salaries might be lower compared to other U.S. based tech companies."

Right from the interview process and onboarding, it was a pleasant experience. In a world with low retention rates across companies, there is a reason Mathworkers stay here. My manager will constantly check with me if I like my work or not or how am I feeling which is more important that you think. Health and family are important to the company and that shows in their leadership meetings and how your coworkers talk to you.

417,MathWorks,Great work life balance with extreme focus on micro-management and process orientation,2021-01-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,This is a great workplace to get work life balance. One enjoys their own personal cabin. Fellow employees are friendly and easy to get along when working in cross-team collaboration. Extreme focus on process orientation helps in little to no surprises during feature rollout.,"Process orientation becomes a double edge sword. With the need to get approvals from senior management and processes involved during software development make the turnaround time from idea to feature rollout very high.

Salary is reasonable but not aligned with industry standards. It also varies based on product one contributes to. There is about a 10-15% difference between Engineers who contribute to Simulink (primary product) vs those to work on internal  and customer facing web applications 

Growth opportunities are very limited. Promotions are limited by yearly caps and usually provided heavily based in tenure and less on performance 

With a general low risk taking mentality, product innovations are limited and technology adoptions lags behind current industry standards 

Micro-management is a common theme across the company which limits the freedom and responsibility on the employees

There is a stark difference in how the EDG program is marketed vs the reality. Although its a great platform to get hands dirty into different tools, technology and business domains for fresh graduates, Besides a few teams, Internal engineering teams treat EDG employees with little to no importance; providing projects on legacy applications that none of their teams members are willing to take"

441,MathWorks,"Great culture, brilliant people",2020-11-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"MathWorks as an idea and culture is fantastic. People really believe in the mission statement, to accelerate the progress of science and engineering. People have a lot of respect for one another, for our customers, and for math, science, and engineering.

90% of the workers are focused on the team and are wonderful coworkers that are conscientious and give generously with time to help ramp up new workers.

The company is very stable.","Not everyone is eager to share knowledge. There are enough that are and are great mentors so that you can grow--but still, it seems that some of the more curmudgeonly employees could use a reminder of the core values."

444,MathWorks,Very nice place to work,2020-11-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I started working at MathWorks not long before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and most of my onboarding took place remotely. Even so, the training and onboarding experience was excellent. Very friendly collaborative environment. Management seems to actually want improvement advice from employees. 

Excellent facilities in a great location near the Boston area. The benefits and perks are also very nice. Definitely feels like an environment where the CEO and company in general cares about their employees.

Prior to the COVID pandemic some reviews have said that MathWorks WFH options were on the weaker side, but the WFH requirement has forced improvement.","Would have liked to work in the office and have access to the gym, but that is out of their control due to the pandemic. Other than that, none that I can think of."
445,MathWorks,Great place to challenge yourself and feel valuable.,2020-11-17,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Management shows appreciation for your work. Amazing work-life balance.

451,MathWorks,Great work-life balance,2020-11-02,5.0,Applications Engineer,"The company, starting with the CEO, treats employees as its core stakeholders. This belief flows down into everything the company does: the work-life balance, the benefits and facilities, the annual meetings, anniversary celebrations, etc. They've succeeded in making the company feel smaller than it actually is.

Good products and a very stable profit model. The company has continued growing through the recent recessions.

The company actually practices its Core Values on a daily basis and hires people who exemplify them. As a result, you end up working with people who are not only brilliant, but also great to be around.

If you love engineering and science, you'll get to work on great technology and feel like you're making a difference.","Base salaries are relatively low for the software industry (profit sharing and work-life balance make up for this in my opinion). The company does not adjust compensation for location within the U.S., which is a pretty good deal if you're in the Novi (Michigan) office - not so much if you're in the Bay Area.

(The observations below would be considered ""cons"" by some)

The company is relatively slow to move in the marketplace, taking ""measure twice and cut once"" to the extreme. They will intentionally make conservative choices to limit growth.

Promotions are entirely based on seniority, so don't expect to move quickly up the ranks. Note that annual raises are pretty good for high performers even if your job title doesn't change."

455,MathWorks,The ugly shadow world of MathWorks documentation,2020-10-27,2.0,Technical Writer,"Product teams are generally great. Smart engineers, everyone highly educated, not much politics, focus on making great products. They understand the importance of documentation, because some of them worked in EDG (tech support). They make the job of a writer fairly easy.

There are lots of great writers who take responsibility and want to help you with your work.

I would rate the company four out of five stars, but the documentation group two out of five stars.","The technical writing and documentation (doc) management and organization have some serious issues, which outweighed the positives for me at the company. 

Although you work with a product team for all of your writing work, you are managed by a doc manager from outside the product team, who has little expertise in your subject matter. Talking to them in weekly meetings can feel incredibly pointless and unhelpful, depending on your manager. These weekly meetings, and most of your interactions with your manager, are about enforcement, not support: making sure you are doing your job. 

Management insists that new documentation projects have a requirements analysis process that is far too heavyweight. Management constantly emphasizes the need for requirements analysis, aiming to create better documentation, but they wind up obsessing far more over the process than they do over the product. Basically, to write new documentation, you have to fill out a huge amount of paperwork first. Much, much more than the software engineers even do, which is downright silly. Your productivity can feel incredibly stifled by the paperwork. This process probably saves the bottom 10% of writers, who need the paperwork to know what they're doing, but for the other 90%, it makes your job probably two or three times as tedious and provides little value. 

Most of the emphasis of the doc group, outside of your day to day tasks, is on following processes and guidelines .. and creating new guidelines. There are endless guidelines for endless different tasks, with the stated aim of bringing consistency and high quality to the writing. In reality, if you're already a capable and competent writer, than these guidelines and processes wind up fostering a culture of intense micromanagement and control. There are guidelines for the most basic of tasks, like writing examples (does someone need to know guidelines for how to write and document a hello world example?) There is an enormous database of policies, procedures, and guidelines, and writers are given special projects to constantly expand and develop new guidelines. 

The way that first-line managers treat their writers is wildly inconsistent. Some of them let their writers mostly do their own thing, whereas other managers are control freaks and want things done exactly their way.

There are good managers and bad managers. Some of them are friendly, supportive, and helpful. Others seem to mainly be self-serving, looking to further their own career, squash disagreement, minimize time investment, and make sure you are a good horse for their work cart.

There are endless tiers of doc managers, who often seem to contribute little as they have basically no writing duties. The number of new managers is constantly growing, and there are many, many managers with many different sub-managers. All this makes the key staff, the writers, seem grossly undervalued and underappreciated. Great writing and documentation product is rarely if ever singled out for praise. The emphasis is all on following processes and guidelines and making your (multiple) managers happy. 

Many of the more senior doc writers have little to no technical background. Which is not a problem in and of itself, but shows that the culture has had a strange evolution. Jack the CEO or someone higher up clearly let go of the doc infrastructure at some point and handed it off to somebody else and (mostly) forgot about it. 

Working at doc at MathWorks can be like working in a strange shadow world, supposedly paired with the product teams but shackled to an huge and dominating, extremely bureaucratic organization."

471,MathWorks,Engineering Development Group,2020-10-13,3.0,Applications Support Engineer,MathWorkers are friendly people and outstanding engineers. You will learn a lot working here and many of your coworkers will become friends.,"The MathWorks is a great company but the Engineering Development Group is seriously flawed. These cons apply only to EDG and not MathWorks overall.

In EDG you are in a technical support role. On a typical day you log in to the phone queue at 8:30am sharp. You can't sign off until 5:30pm. Sometimes your manager will listen to your calls. You have a scheduled lunch hour. You message your coworkers to tell them you are going to the bathroom. About once a month you get late shift, meaning you answer calls until 8pm. None of this is explained during the recruitment process.

Each day you are either ""on support"" or not. You will quickly grow very tired of technical support and time away from it is precious. There is a shadow economy where engineers swap shifts so that they can focus on professional development or take bit of personal time.

When you are in EDG you are laser-focused on transferring out, which often happens after a year or more. Transferring entails applying for any of the non-EDG openings that are listed on the MathWorks careers site. You have to interview for a permanent role and you will compete with both internal and external candidates.

Your EDG manager gives final approval on your transfer. Occasionally, a hiring manager will make a job offer that is shot down by an EDG manager. Engineers feel pressured to take any opportunity that presents itself because they are afraid of being forced out by management and because they have been exhausted by the tech. support schedule.

EDG engineers are too talented to sit this low on the totem pole. They need to be given the whole story before they join."
472,MathWorks,Need to negotiate well before joining,2020-10-13,3.0,Senior Quality Engineer,Work life balance is good and there are no late night calls unlike other companies and this could be a team specific information.,Work politics plays a huge role in moving between positions in the company. This is not something they tell you until you join the company and its quite difficult to even apply for other positions in the same department without a proper reasoning. This restriction makes anyone feel stuck in growing personally and professionally which is already slow.

487,MathWorks,Decent Company to work with,2020-10-11,5.0,Software QA Engineer,"I have been here around 8 months. So far its been great!

1. Friendly co-workers and work place environment-one can maintain good balance between work life and personal life.
2. Amazing opportunities to grow and learn new technologies.
3. Collaboration with cross teams and departments , coming up with new idea and implementing it are encouraged.
4. Facilities like game-room, cafeteria-with variety of food options, gym and health programs are available.
5. I also love the social missions driven by the company.
6. Values and options are respected.",Work from home policy (Through during pandemic this wouldn't apply- since we all are working from home :) )
488,MathWorks,Great company,2020-10-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"MathWorks is a great company. I started my current role mid-pandemic, and have been very impressed by how efficient and smooth both the interview and onboarding process have been. Management is very supportive and understanding, and people seem to maintain a good work-life balance. Salaries are generally pretty middle of the road relative to other tech firms in the area, but for me this is balanced out by good benefits and reasonable expectations from management. I'm hopeful that they will relax their previously strict work-from-home policy after the pandemic is over.","Onboarding and ramp-up is a little on the slow side. Company has some very strict internal policies and ways of getting things done, that can make projects a little frustrating. Promotions seem pretty rare."
489,MathWorks,Couldn’t Be Better!,2020-10-09,5.0,Information Technology,"- Amazing, inspiring, bright campuses 
- Fantastic leadership 
- Well organized onboarding program even during Covid

Above are some quick points on what makes MathWorks a fantastic place to work. From the minute I started, you get the feeling that you belong. The company and campus body is so warm and inviting. You don’t feel like a number here, you feel like a valuable asset to the organization. Because of this, you always want to do what is best for the organization. 

Leadership, top to bottom is very well structured. You will get positive feedback on achievements and feedback on certain tasks you can improve on. This is so important because there is no “sugar” coating and really helps drive accountability which is displayed across the whole organization. 

If you are researching a potential job opportunity here during the pandemic, I will have you know - the onboarding process was INCREDIBLE (even remotely) it was very organized and it felt like it was a normal practice that has been in place for years. 

All in all, there is nothing but great energy, great ideas and great people found at MathWorks.",There really aren’t any I can think of currently. It’s just so lovely!
490,MathWorks,"Best people, culture and company",2020-10-08,5.0,Manager,"Company bends over backwards for its employees. Great people work here, very down to earth and not a lot of politics to navigate. Core values taken very seriously.","Pre-covid, lack of flexibility in schedules and working from home.

506,MathWorks,Ignore the laudatory reviews,2020-09-30,1.0,Software Engineer,The company is well-funded. When it's not a plague year you get a little office with a door to yourself.,"N.B.: HR encourages employees to write GlassDoor reviews soon after they join, before they realize they've been trapped. Ignore the positive reviews and read the moderate-to-negative ones.

In my experience:

- The culture is corporate, cut-throat, and pretentious (e.g. coworkers are ""colleagues"")
- High pressure, low pay
- Lots of code (20 million+ LOC), very little documentation
- High micromanagement, low autonomy
- Managers will scold you for talking with your teammates about anything not related to your immediate task
- Managers treat your estimates as commitments
- It is improper to suggest new ideas unless you've been there several years
- You'll leave with few transferrable skills because all of their tools are custom-made
- Despite claims to diversity, the workforce is largely Indian"

-It feels to me like we stopped hiring people with actual UX experience and now bring on engineers and offer them a few classes in UX instead. Not the best system in my opinion.

Technical support in EDG causes immense anxiety because of the non-stop phone calls with incredibly demanding clients.

Neither they respect nor recognize hard work. They show a lot of favouritism. Unrealistic deadlines, no proper planning, and they indirectly force people to work long hours by loading them with more work in a short period of time. They do a lot of micro management. Many of the managers show bad attitude and are not at all supportive or empathetic towards their team members. The managers lack professional ethics and any administration skills. 
Well, HYD office was a startup at HYD acquired by MathWorks. This is definitely one of the worst decisions that the CEO has made. The sr.management at HYD office don't lead by example. They maintain the ""do as I say"" mentality. They advertise MathWorks core values but never follow. It never reflects in their day-to-day activities.

557,MathWorks,Incredible company. I wish they would allow transfers to their satellite/field offices!,2020-07-09,5.0,Engineering Technical Writer,"I worked at MathWorks for two years. It is an incredible company that puts a lot of care and thought into their policies and procedures. They have strong core values and actually adhere to them across the board.  They invest in your success. Training and professional development resources are fantastic. Lots of perks, but the biggest perk of all is knowing you are valued.

I was able to fully integrate into the development team that I supported and make high-value, high-impact contributions to the documentation strategy, SW design, and product direction. If you thrive on a cross-functional team where you can have an impact beyond just writing documentation, you’ll love it here.

Hiring is rigorous and transparent. By and large, your colleagues will be hard working, competent, and nice people.","1. Depending on the size of the team you support and the changes and new features in your doc set, your time can be stretched thin. Especially toward the end of releases. It was my impression that not all doc writers experience this. For reference, I supported over 30 developers and owned over 200 unique doc pages, a project to shift our presentation of the doc in our space, and several side projects.

2. Documentation is one of the positions where you form closer relationships with the development team you support than your own manager. Because your manager is not embedded in the work with you, it can be a challenge to convey the impact you have on a daily basis. I found it hard to adequately impress upon my manager the value I added day-to-day. 

3. I would have liked to stay at MathWorks for many many years, however when I requested a transfer to a satellite office, it was denied (satellite offices are almost exclusively for customer-facing folks). Needing to make the move for family reasons, I gave my notice in February before COVID. My last two weeks I successfully worked remotely due to COVID stay-home orders and the company continues to do so 4 months later as of the time of this post.  

There are writers in Natick, MA that support teams overseas. The difference in having a development team in Natick and a writer in elsewhere in the U.S. is lost on me.

I wish more consideration or discussion had evolved around the transfer."

Before COVID19, there were frequent events we can attend. 35th anniversary was amazing, they paid for our flights to Orlando, our hotel stay and events in the CityWalk, 4h exclusive access to Universal CityWalk Orlando. This was really awesome!

4. Relocation reimbursement + first month flat.
5. Soirée & breakfasts biweekly.
6. Book clubs + problem-solving sessions.
7. Company-paid trip to the headquarters called BPO (Big Picture Orientation), where they teach the structure of the company, how it works, its history.
8. They don't have any stock options or shares, but they pay a bonus every 3 months starting from around 9 months in being in the company. In January they may apply a multiplier of 2x or 3x to the bonus (not guaranteed).
9. The most senior staff of the company is actually cool, they are happy to have a chat and listen to people.
10. Monitor reimbursement, stopping smoking recognition.","1. ASE role in EDG is about 65% technical support and 35% software engineering. It's stressful and not exciting. If you ever try to look for a different job, then having Technical Support on the CV can hurt.
2. Each employee has a rating just like in Black Mirror episode ""Nosedive"".
3. Low pay. The inflation rate is higher than the salary increase rate. They don't match a salary from other company offers, not even increase by a bit. People who just join the company make more than existing employees.
4. Micromanagement. I have been asked multiple times to write how I have spent my day, they come and look at what I am doing all the time.
5. Bureaucracy. Everything has to be documented, presented, reviewed, all questions answered, reviewed again. If the manager is happy, then can proceed.
6. Have to do ""sitplan"" (SIT=specialist in training) during free time (most people have to do it outside work hours).
7. Impossible to transfer from UK to US, they don't want to sponsor L1 visa."

Great lake side view and what not.","This goes for the Hyderabad office:
1. The management sucks. Not sure on what qualities the managers demonstrated to get hired. They just climbed their way up through Urmi(company acquired by MathWorks). 
2. The only thing that matters to the managers is the no of hours been spent in office. Every one on one, the only thing they will ask is if you are spending 9 hours in office and are coming before 10.  Every day you might have to message the manager if you are 5 mins late to office i,e coming at 10.05, with reason. This adds up to so much stress. 
3. The managers suck up to their managers too. With emails like, Dear Sir, Please grant me half day sick leave, your's sincerely . They keep you in cc so that you follow the lead.
4. The idea you project to the managers are straightaway rejected, and if the same idea comes across through US folks they are given due importance. This dilutes your credibility and make you feel so less important.
5. All that matters in Hyderabad office is the number of fruits you are taking each day, what time you came and did you complete 9 hours.

If you can stand to put in a couple years at low pay you'll likely be set up to get a much better paying job elsewhere. Benefits are great if you are already making a decent wage, but do not compensate from the lack of pay and raises.","Pay. For recent grads saddled with student debt pay is often the bottom line and you will not get it here. You'll get ""promotional"" raises while in a role, but if you transition to a role requiring more experience you will not get a raise and won't be told what you can expect to get. They get around this by not accurately classifying the role level. E.G. a role requiring 0 years experience is the same level as a role requiring 3 years of experience. The company can definitely afford to pay more but doesn't for unknown reasons. There are multiple managers in finance who put little to no effort into their job and there are no consequences because they've been there for 15+ years. You won't get to work your way up because no one wants to leave a cushy manager job with no deliverables. The CEO is very nice but no one understands the inflexibility on the work from home policy."

Even though the company has good goals and objectives, it is enshrouded by their 2 release cycles a year. Simulink is their cash cow. There is lot of pressure to get things done in a less time but with great quality and in the way they demand. 

There is lot of focus and emphasis to learn MATLAB LANGUAGE which is good for nothing if you plan to leave the company. I had decent skills and C++ and I had to loose everything I know.

Management doesn’t like any new ideas and if you say anything against your boss be prepared for a PIP, which is a legal process to kick you out.I got a PIP  and I just quit on the same day. Now I work for a Fortune 46 company. I feel I wasted 1 year of my life. Don’t join simulink groups at all. 

Last but not the least. They boast about Glassdoor reviews and all but the fact is your career progression is not based on your talent rather it is based on the number of years of experience. 

I strongly suggest don’t waste your time if you want to grow in your life. After all it is a good for nothing company and is going to have a tough time in the future to come because of AI."

Given if you are lucky to work with them and your boss is cool to let you interact with them, it can be a pretty good experience. 
- Free drinks on the house. Though the selection could be improved. 
- Earlier this year,  the company sponsored an all-expenses-paid trip to the US for its anniversary.","TLDR; It's a lost cause. If they offer you a job, run in the opposite direction until you run out of your breath. Then drink water, relax and do the same until you are at least 10 km away.

- The senior leadership has a vision which seems more like a pipe dream rather than a good plan. It has no basis in technological feasibility. 

- The next set of managers are sycophants who wouldn't have been in their positions if not for their yes man skills. These people don't have the technological acumen or the grit to tell the senior leadership that what they are suggesting seems more like a script of star wars movie than a business goal. 

- Did you know before becoming MathWorks Hyderabad, it was a startup which was acquired by Mathworks? Well, it's still that startup, except the name. The work culture is still the same with heavy doses of micromanagement, bosses so insecure that they won't allow their subordinates free communication with other counterparts and often micromanage the communication. 

- In fact, most of these people were hired by the previous Startup. No way they would have been hired by Mathworks.

- No transport facility, no subsidized cafeteria or snack bar. The food court is extremely expensive. If you want to snack during work, you gotta go to the food court which would take half an hour and wrecks your concentration."

To me it feels like a lot of the main work we do are chosen by the ourselves rather than being ordered from top-down. This could be more so because I am in the Engineering Development Group. 
Chill and helpful colleagues: But at the same time, the people here are pretty chill. I think it is because MathWorks is doing a pretty good job in the market and has a strong foundation; and probably also because the company is rather conservative and slower paced. (Definitely not as fast paced as Tesla or other younger companies out there) I also want to mention we have a open door policy of helping others out. I often go to other colleagues office to get some help and vice versa for things I am good at.  
Learning: I think learning was also one of the core values our company hold. We are encouraged to better ourselves by taking courses, self paced learning, book clubs, et cetera. 
Own office / self paced: Everyone gets own office! And things are done at your own pace.  
Impact the world: And last but not least, MathWorks products are pretty popular around the engineering/science community. Feels good to know our work has a big impact for making the world better.","Salary: The pay is not bad really, but I think it can be better! 
Chill: MathWorks is a pretty firm company that has been around for some time. So it is not fast paced as the other young companies. So this can be a con for some people who want more aggressive and sprint-type work culture."

- Good work-life balance. You can put in extra work, but it's really up to you. This is true at least in my department. The story seems different in development.
- Good company culture. People are mostly down-to-earth and friendly with the exception of some senior folks who carry a bit of ""inner circle"" hubris.
- Another culture thing: You can always find help.","- Slow moving product that is losing traction to open-source and programming becoming more ubiquitous in science and engineering fields.
- Hiring mentality that everyone is replaceable, which leads to lower salaries for tech and a critical mass of mediocre hires who are largely not independent and motivated.
- Development mentality to use as little resources as possible to deliver minimum viable product that checks a box. For example, ""yes, we do deep learning. Here's *a* solution"".
- Marketing departments specifically lacking in ""doers"". People constantly looking to defend old-school standpoints and justify slow development action to avoid doing any significant work.
- The praise I have received from management has always been on small one-off projects unrelated to my main job rather than what I consider to be my most significant and rewarding contributions.
- Location is in the suburbs, a little ways out of the city."

Low salaries compared to other software competitors.

Stakeholder Bonus is a low hanging carrot that you possibly get  at the end of the year. I still haven't completed 1 year so cannot comment

 Very difficult working environment for people . You cannot work from home and and you are judged for taking sick leaves.  Basically they judge you on everything except the quality of your deliverable.

A huge amount of bureaucracy and infinite number of review cycles for every little project you do. 

No positive Feedback for accomplishments . No work at all for a good career growth.

Everything is done very rationally and thoughtfully - I was surprised when I first started at how well thought out everything was. The company works hard to do the right thing and continue to improve (really living up to its core values). 

It's extremely collaborative, and you can always find someone to help or to bounce ideas off of. I don't find it to be at all competitive - we all want to help each other succeed.

Company has a very top down approach which slows things down further and prevents any innovation. Even the office chairs need owner approval. Company has almost 5k people and only 1 makes any decisions, simply inneficient.

It seems like the Admin, IT, HR, Finance all are cutting the cost wherever it is possible to show so their efficiency to their bosses on the side of USA without conveying them how people hate the changes their acts bring in.

Examples:

Till date there is no arrangement of a decent pantry inside office. Only one vendor to distribute poor quality food for a pretty big price tag.

Office infrastructure is getting worse every next day with very little focus on fixing it.

All the drinks which employee likes and consume disappear from the cafeteria.

Entire HR seems to be run by only one person with little to no employee engagement. I can bet HR has no idea what employees want, in my couple of years of time in office I have never seen HR engaging any of the employees. It is pathetic.

3. Inflow of bright candidates through EDG
4. Free Wednesday breakfast
5. Quarterly bonus","1. Development managers who have worked here for a while have no idea what is going on in the world of technology. This leads to very slow adaptation of new technology. 
2. Some of the development side jobs are operation based. They do not require technical skills. So read about the position before you apply. 
3. Managers belonging to specific area can have different domain teams working under their leadership. As a result there is no proper evaluation of performance. Therefore sycophants or people who boast are likely to have upper hand in promotions. This adds an extra dimension to the work. This also leads to accumulation of unskilled staff.

Please don't join the company for the US trip. Definitely not worth it.","1. You won't learn anything in EDG, literally zero skills learned. 
2. Call center job, major focus is put on solving ""TECHNICAL"" customer cases. It's nothing but customer support like any other company.
3. Brainwashing is done by management & senior management. They make you believe that call center job will make you learn so many things about the company, it's totally useless. Don't get brainwashed.
4. 80% people copy the offline trainings, what's the whole point of keeping the trainings in the first place? The training is useless to be honest. 
5. If you leave the company after 2-3 years after transferring out to any development team in MathWorks, no one will give you a job, cause you won't have any industry knowledge apart from MATLAB. 
6. MATLAB is not used in CS industry and companies, it's just used by automobile industry and educational insitutes. 
7. You won't find any person to learn skills from. Very average employees. 
8. No work from home option.
9. Work on Windows machines, no MacBooks.
10. Very slow growth of the company, slow work, less work.
11. Majority of the good work is done in HQ in Natick, very low level work in Bangalore office.
12. Extremely low pay, other companies pay 40%-80% more, after promotion there is very less growth in salary.
13. No stock options since company has no IPO, stakeholder bonus is extremely low, don't even expect anything out of it.
14. No motivation for work.
15. Please don't join the company just because you want to go to the US.
16. Management will say that you can transfer to the US, but honestly you won't be transferred, literally zero chance.
17. The concept of EDG is rebranded, people from IITs are hired to do the customer support job. 
18. MATLAB is very slow software, people don't consider removing the dead code and making the software size smaller which is currently 25 GB.
19. There are two releases every year, just new features are added in those two releases there's no improvement in the existing codebase. 
20. Management says that MathWorks has very flat structure, it's because the number of employees is ~4000, naturally, smaller the company shallower the hierarchy.
21. Very high percentage of the company revenue is generated from customer support by EDG people. Don't work in a company where maximum revenue is generated from customer support."

764,MathWorks,Great work life balance but your career progression in very very slow,2018-11-26,2.0,Software Developer,"1. Not many deadlines that are hard
2. Flexible time - you can come in and leave when you want. But this really depends on your manager
3. Almost nobody gets fired. You have to screw up in a big way for a long time (at least in my area)","I am an immigrant and here are cons list:
1. Many entry level employees join through EDG which is a really bad place to start at. They do not apply for a green card until you move out of EDG. 
2. EDG is very inflexible and does not have immigrant friendly policies. You do not even get to take your vacation days when you want. 

Once you are out of EDG it gets a little better - flexibility wise but the following are still big flags for me:
3. No work from home whatsoever for new employees, new parents. You need to have a good manager who will allow work from home and this policy is very inconsistently interpreted through the company and at different levels of seniority
4. This is a private company. The upper management is treated much differently than anybody with less than 10 years of experience.
5. Hardly anyone junior employee gets promoted based on merit. The company is run like an oligarchy
6. Processes - there are long and arduous process for everything and even a simple project takes years to complete.
7. Design review feedback - You will be made to present your technical designs using Power Point to a room full of stakeholders (senior managers). This is usually followed by useless feedback. Every little thing is micromanaged by the senior management. 

Even a small feature can take multiple design review meetings. There are processes around getting meeting slots and inviting participants. There are dry runs for the presentations (sometimes more than one).

All in all, it is a lot of effort for some feedback that is not worth much. It is quite frustrating."

- Annual salary boosts aren't that great. I meet new hires with less experience earning more than me.

- The organizational maturity is really tough to measure here. It is most immediately evident in the products themselves: an automatic update model is finally being rolled out in 2018, and the company still seems to bend over backwards to release patches for specific $$$ customers. Looking deeper, one notices that a proper issue tracking system (in this case, Jira) was only adopted in 2018 (and the adoption feels...slipshod). Somehow, my experience at my previous job with a much smaller and younger company felt significantly better organized. Of course, if you were to ask the project management teams, you would probably hear a completely different story."

Free dinner every day of the week if you stay at work late","1. Promotions are based on years of experience, or how many years since you got your bachelor's degree.

For technical positions, new hires with a master's degree and no work experience generally enter as ""Level 2"".   After 4-6 years of decent work, you are promoted to ""Level 3"" (Senior).    After that promotion, you'll have to wait 10-15 years for your next promotion to ""Level 4"" (Principal).   

For many people, they get one promotion to ""Level 3"" (Senior) and that's it!

2. No work-life balance if you work on products in the CDA area.  This covers all the products that require Simulink.  Work with product teams in the LTC area (MATLAB and toolbox products) if you want work-life balance.

3. No work from home at all.  (But some managers don't care when you work from home, so enforcement is uneven.)

4. Each year, your performance rating is decided well before you start writing the self-review.  So nothing that you write in the self-review has any effect on your rating.  What you write is to justify the rating that was given to you."

The ""no WFH"" policy some complain about is no where near as draconian as its made out to be in reviews.  They just dont want people using recurring scheduled WFH. If you have childcare emergencies or its snowing they are totally flexible.

2. Annual team outings 
3. Descent hike and bonus
4. Free breakfast  and snacks once a week
5. Very humble,cool and inspiring CEO
6. Friendly and very supportive HR especially during exit feedback interview","I relatively worked for 20 years at Mathworks due to frustrating and tortuous work environment I  had experienced in architecture and tooling team ( as per theory of relativity just like planet near Gargantua black hole in Interstellar ) even though I stayed for 2+ years there.

1. Exhausting interview process with several rounds on one day as if you will be building rocket  next day..:) 

2.  Internal architectures tools used are mostly legacy tools sans some basic principles of Software Engineering. Also welcome to http era.
This makes learning curve and skills set very limited.  

4.  Reinventing the wheel practice followed often.
e.g Open source tools already available with developed features but not utilized there.

5.  Be prepared for manual tasks in this era. 

6. Bizarre decision of build failure investigation being done by RE which is normally the job responsibility of a developer ideally. 

7. Extreme sycophancy and open favoritism - it's an open secret in the team with better synonyms.

8.  Join the team only if you have gained superpower of premonition so that you can know when you are going to fall sick. Even if you have enough sick leaves but you are not supposed to avail those.

9. Once you have decided to switch, make sure to publish in newspapers whether  you have offers or not. Be prepared for ridiculous questions like - Why did u take sick leave and internal training  if you were planning to resign. 

10.  Unprofessional language used during mentoring and initial days of training.
Ultra micro-management throughout the year. You would receive a WhatsApp call  -> call on phone -> followed by WhatsApp ping even if you have gone for tea/ snacks break in the evening irrespective of work to be done or not.

- The company is very stable and profitable. You don't ever have to worry about the MathWorks going out of business.
- Job security, people don't get fired for no good reason. 
- Great opportunity to work on software development while reusing domain-background on an engineering or scientific discipline.","- The starting salary is below market average for CS and ECE degrees. Other disciplines though (e.g., Mechanical) may not have this problem.
- The Boston area has expensive housing and cold winters.
- The introductory program (boot camp / EDG) may overpromise that internal transfer can take place anywhere you want. This can of course happen (it happened to me), but it depends on internal openings. If the economy is bad, or if no new openings are created in your #1 target area, then you may be stuck or eventually transfer to a less preferred team. This can be more of a problem for ECE/Mechanical graduates that may wish to reuse a specific background that they have from school. CS graduates have so many options that they do not have to worry (for example multiple teams may be working with a specific language).
- The company has a lot of processes and some people may think that progress is slow. The company is very consensus driven; this is not necessarily bad, but if you want to be working alone in your office without interacting with people for weeks, this is not a good match for you.
- You can work from home for at most 3 days a year. Some people don't like this."

806,MathWorks,Marketing,2018-05-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,MathWorks offers stability. Leadership is very careful to take business risks which increases stability and job security.,The risk adverse and slow to change culture limits learning opportunities and career progression. Salaries are below industry standard as well as benefits. This is a good company to come to at the end of your career.
807,MathWorks,Best place to work,2018-05-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great team and well planned workflow,"Its been 6 months, since i joined. No cons so far."
808,MathWorks,Working environent,2018-05-11,5.0,Engineer,"An excellent place to work, with continuous supports from different perspectives.",High-pressure  and challenging research work.
809,MathWorks,Great work-life balance. Absolutely no opportunities for growth!,2018-05-10,2.0,Software Engineer,"- All the perks: 401k, insurance, gym, etc.
- Friendly colleagues. 
- Company outings and anniversary celebrations.
- Free Wednesday breakfast and Friday cookies.","No opportunity for growth! As a mid-size private company with no real competitors MathWorks operate on the principle of ""business as usual"", meaning you stay at same engineering level and the same performance rating for a long time, until or unless you get lucky!

The promotions are a joke! With sophisticated and secretive formulas for level/rating calculations, you're guaranteed to get the same gross salary or maybe less even if are promoted! Basically if you're promoted to a higher level your performance rating is reset so you have a higher nominal salary but a much smaller contribution from the profit sharing pool because of lower performance rating. Needless to point out that once at the higher level, rating icreases are harder and slower than before.

The review process is another joke! Once a year you write a self review and a peer review (which the peer will get to read with your name on it). Your manager also writes a review. But a couple of weeks before you write your self review and your manager writes his, higher ups meet to determine promotions and ratings. So you're writing a review after everything is decided! I wonder why the call it ""review""! So what you write and what your manager writes are essentially used to justify pre-determined ratings! I thought it's should be the other way around!

If in a team of say 10 engineers the performance of two engineers exceed expectations only one is promoted because two will exceed the promotion quota for the team! So one is promoted and the other one has to suck it up for another year until his names is thrown into the hat again!

This is the mechanism behind lower than industry average salaries and the lazy culture. A few years ago I expected the competition with open source to make a dent but that was wishful thinking!!"
810,MathWorks,"Great culture, exciting and challenging projects",2018-05-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work culture, people and environment is very understanding and respectful. The company has good core values and treats its employees well. Work-life balance is great. Depending on what you work on, you could be at the bleeding edge of the most exciting technologies in the market. It's a very grass-roots organization where ideas are primarily formed and nurtured bottom-up rather than being pushed top-down. This gives a lot of power to technical engineers and staff.","Not the best paymasters in the area but quarterly cash bonuses make up for it handily. Being a privately-held company, I've always wondered how it affects decisions made in the company. For the most part I think it has helped in maintaining focus on the right places to invest in. But at hard times, resources can get tight."
811,MathWorks,A great company to work for in general (not so much if you are an ASE),2018-05-05,4.0,Applications Support Engineer,"These are only my personal opinions after half a year in MW.
1. Benefits are sort of competitive. Rather frequent social gathering across departments.
2. EVERYBODY, I mean literally EVERYBODY, in my department is nice and helpful. Great dynamics in the team. 
3. The training process is smooth and helpful. You would find yourself quickly improving along the process. 
4. Overall work-life balance. Light workload for most of time.","These are the cons that is specific to my department:
1. While the ASE department (i.e. the technical support department) has good working dynamics overall. You would sometimes find yourself in difficult situations when you are dealing with the actual development team. You could definitely feel their attitude at you because you were just trying to hang out with them for the purpose of transferring to their team.

2. Reviewing process is VERY unclear. They would tell you everything they would consider but not exactly how they review you (basically nothing useful). 

3. Transfer process is totally random and uncontrollable. This is kinda frustrating because you sometimes are good enough for a team but there is just no opening. This encourages turnovers frequently.

4. The position essentially means you will provide customer service while doing some corner project works for other people. However, I felt it was described as mostly doing project when you occasionally write people emails. This is not communicated well in the interviews. Not that they were trying to lie to you or hide it. When they have been in the company for long, they might have a different views on how much time the technical support work would take. But you will be the TECHNICAL SUPPRT, you will pick up phone calls for a large portion of your time. DO NOT assume the support part of your job is negligible.

5. Not trying to be an a* here but the percentage of a certain nationality has been increasing . You would notice a lot of them are actually friends who know each other. Yes, referral has its magic here but the current situation is too much. I mean... like 70% of the new hires are from a particular country. I don't have the evidence to say that the hiring process is rigged or something, but the company needs to investigate it. Mathworks has a limited interview question pool, which makes this even more suspicious.


Overall, I think it is a great position for you if you are from engineering related area and want some super entry-level job to get onramp to software engineers. If you already have enough development experience, this might not be a good place for you to improve yourself.  Mathworks is a good place for you to stay for the rest of your life so if you are ready to commit in long term, this is also a good position for you."
812,MathWorks,Internal Sales,2018-05-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mathworks is a jewel within all these fast-growing, hyped-up companies. If you are looking for a job where you are dealing with professional and intelligent people, which take their work seriously and are passionate about the products, you have come to the right place . The team is a mixture of all ages and nationalities and the  atmosphere is one of mutual respect and helpfulness. People sell well, because they believe in the product, and there is a complete lack of the  ultra-competitive ,aggressive sales mentality  and rivalry that poison so many sales environments. Territories are clear and well organised, and there is advise and coaching but no micro-management. 

You never stop learning at MathWorks, and if you like Science and Computing, you are in heaven. The Managers are fair and they are ""proper"" managers, that care about their team and have the experience. MathWorks is a no-nonsense , friendly company with dedicated , hard-working employees. The salary and benefits are good and get better, the longer you are with MathWorks. Unlike a lot of the very ""young, fast and short-lived""  sales jobs,  MathWorks provides a  stable, mature and steadily growing  team and a nice ,modern office right in the Centre of Galway.

819,MathWorks,EDG Program,2018-04-09,5.0,Manager,"> EDG program is like a launch pad for young & bright engineers that are looking to build a long term technical career for themselves but are unsure as to what to pursue to be satisfied
> The program is multi-faceted and offers flexibility to choose projects of interest to gain skills
> Opportunity to provide technical support to customers that use our products and gain insights about customer industry, workflow and most importantly how customers use our products is key. You are not left to fend for yourself but have many bright colleagues to reach out to, to get help
> Work environment is pretty informal and easy-going. Higher management is easily accessible. You are not treated as an expendable commodity and your passion for technology is respected
> Work-life balance is great allows you to pursue your interests outside work
> Managers encourage independence & collaboration and are invested in success of engineers. They focus on providing timely coaching
> Several EDG engineers are successful in multiple departments in challenging technical roles. And transfers typically happen in ~12-18 months which engineers use to figure out where their long term interest lies
> EDG engineers are sought after by other departments because they possess a blend of product knowledge, customer perspective and strong technical skills

Overall a great place to work especially if you are looking to build a long term career for yourself","> Working with our customers and providing them technical help is looked down upon by some. Our customers use our products to build technology that is transforming the world we live in. Helping them be successful can be pretty challenging especially working with those who are masters in their domain and on the other hand there are also customers who are beginners in our products
> Understanding what customers value in our products is very important for success of a product development company like us and EDG program provides opportunities to gain such insights
> EDG is not the regular cookie-cutter job. It requires one to chalk out one's own career path and demonstrate strong ownership in working towards it
> Planning, multi-tasking, prioritization and most importantly motivation to learn are some skills required for success in EDG
> Several engineers who are successful in their roles across multiple departments started their career in EDG soon after college. They too should consider sharing positive experiences they have had while in EDG, in public forums"
820,MathWorks,EDG is a very good place to start the career,2018-04-09,5.0,Applications Support Engineer,"Engineering Development Group is a special team in MathWorks which has the following job role:

There are two aspects of the job role. 
1) Provide Technical Support to Customers
2) Work on internal projects

1) Technical Support:

One will be working on the challenging technical issues with customers. The queries from the customer will not be trivial since they would have googled and read documentations thoroughly before contacting Technical Support.  This role demands you to be good at multiple domains, for example to understand a problem on ""machine learning"" one needs to understand the theory and also understand how the  customer is coding it. 

I have worked in other companies previously, it is very rare that an engineer will interact with the customers directly. In most of the other companies one will be shield inside a development team without knowing where and how one's code is being used. This role gives an opportunity to improve your technical skills, communication skill and leadership quality.

2) Work on internal projects:

Application Support Engineers can choose to work with any of the below area:
* Software development team
* Application Engineering
* User Experience Engineering
* Quality Engineering

Depending on one's interest one can switch the teams after completing the projects. This gives high flexibility in exploring the areas that one wants. 

These two roles will be in two week - two week shifts.  

After EDG:

Once the ASEs become experts in certain area, they will be transferred to that product team as a developr/QE/ Application Engineer depending on ASEs interest. 

About learning:

MathWorks encourages its employees to engage in constant learning.  There is a dedicated time allotted to read books and discuss the concepts with the team. There will be lots of training available to ramp up for the product and technology. Engineers will be travelling to US headquarter after joining to learn about company's culture and process.

About the office environment:
Good cafeteria, free beverages, tea, coffee  and fruits. Free breakfast on Wednesday morning  and free snacks on Friday evening.",Nothing major. Work from home is not encouraged since the work demands collaborative environment.

825,MathWorks,EDG - Application Support Engineer,2018-03-20,5.0,EDG Manager,"* EDG is a highly selective group that targets the strongest and most qualified engineers and computer scientists from top universities.  
* EDG engineers have the opportunity to work on exciting projects throughout the technical teams at MathWorks.  The projects are self selected.
* EDG engineers are mentored and have extensive training opportunities to further hone their technical and soft skills.
 * EDG provides each engineer with opportunities to explore teams at MathWorks.
*  EDG engineers have an established network of peers and colleagues throughout MathWorks.
* Each engineer's experience in EDG is unique and customized to each individual.
* New team members spend about 12-18 months on average working in EDG (Engineering Development Group).  This time is spent contributing to projects, working with multiple teams, building a network of colleagues, and further honing technical and leadership skills.
* Career Opportunities are plentiful with many EDG engineers transfer into a wide range of technical roles through the company.
* Compensation is reviewed at least annually as well as when an EDG engineer transfers into another group, to ensure equity.  Bonuses are based on performance and have been paid out quarterly consistently.
* Managers are very flexible with regards to your personal schedule and requests for time off.","* The Application Support Engineer role in EDG is very challenging and requires a strong combination of technical skills, leadership skills, time management, and customer facing skills.
* Some consider working with the customers and providing application support on complex technical problems a con.  Managers at MathWorks consider it a strategic advantage that enables MathWorks' engineers to understand the customer perspective for the products they are developing.
* The EDG experience is what each engineer makes of it.  This model works for engineers who have a strong technical background, are independent, and demonstrate strong time management and initiative in their work. For engineers who want their work assigned and detailed instructions, it may not be the right fit."

837,MathWorks,EDG : An ok place to start your career,2018-02-14,3.0,Applications Support Engineer,"For someone without a background in CS, this is an OK deal, at least in principle to pick up skills that will help you transfer to other teams within the company or find opportunities outside the company. The price one pays, is of course spending bulk of your time in doing technical support and salvaging the rest to pick up the skills you really need.
 
The following stood out to me during my time in EDG:
- Smart colleagues
- Great office space, campus
- Celebrations for important events, grand company outings and other perks.
- Well structured trainings and equipment
- Strong culture of feedback and self improvement, and generally doing the right thing.","EDG is a place one can stagnate very fast without knowing it. The department preaches a culture very different from elsewhere in the company. There is over emphasis on soft skills and you are treated like a juvenile.  The managers themselves have a history of a mediocre career in technology and they're the one's deciding your fate. 

Your transfer out of the program is contingent on a myriad factors working for you - no peers competing for the same position, open reqs in your area of interest, and your manager's blessings,are some of the key ones.  You might have come on board with the perfect background for a certain product area, but if the company is expanding in a direction that is different from your target team,  you might find yourself very frustrated with the lack of opportunities. Unfortunately, this is not communicated in the career fairs.

A year and a half in, without transferring you can find yourself sucked in the tech support spiral. Having lost your domain expertise from school, and focusing most of your time on MATLAB and Simulink, which have very niche markets (try searching for MATLAB jobs vs other core languages on any job search engine), you are obsolete in the market very fast. 

Did I mention the increasing pressure from the management to work on technical support initiatives or be booted out? They project themselves as a program with high transfer rate, great marketing - they left out the folks they forced out.

My advice - join the program, if you don't make it to another team in a year, find yourself another opportunity before it's too late. If you do, congratulations, MW is a great place to work otherwise."

+ Great company with great core values and culture
+ Respectful and collaborative environment
+ Personal office space for all
+ As you spend more time in the company, your tenure is personally valued and appreciated, so do your benefits grow
+ Great company to stay for a long period of time and retire from
+ Fair review process with self evaluation and peer evaluations along with your manager's evaluation. Can't get better. Your ratings translate fairly to salary increments.
+ Perks: Company summer outing to the best mountain resorts in NH for 2 nights, cookies, free treats, Wednesday breakfasts, quarterly bonus, unlimited sick time, 8 hours social work time, 3 weeks vacation, personal office room, great 401k and health benefits, 40 hours trainings a year, awesome gym with many group classes etc.

I joined MathWorks straight from college upon graduation with Masters and it was my best decision. This company groomed and prepared me for work life in the initial 2 years of my job as an ASE in EDG. This program allows you to try out different roles and responsibilities like technical assistance to customers, taking up QE project, Software development projects, technical marketing projects, EDG team leadership, EDG process improvement, interviewing new candidates, knowledge sharing presentations, mentoring new hires etc. These are the things I got to  do over my 2 years span in EDG which has helped me immensely in my current role as a Software Developer.

You feel valued and appreciated in this company for your contributions viz. the company founder and owner, Jack personally calls to congratulate you on your 5th year anniversary at the company! :)","- Very process oriented company; it might fluster one who is not used to of the detailed analysis, documentation and reviews before implementation. Would be much appreciated by research oriented individuals.
- Only 3 days work from home and more on request. Works for me as the company has worked hard to provide us the best environments to work in with personal office spaces with great food and other services.
- Salary might be a tad bit low than some other contemporaries."

2.  Excellent benefits

3.  Bonus structure

4.  Work/life balance (if you meet certain unspoken expectations)","1. While work-life balance is promoted as one of the benefits, that's really only true dependent upon your manager, whether you're in development and if you are held in high regard by your manager and his/her superiors.

2.  The company's core values imply an easy going, flatter organizational structure.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The company is very hierarchical.  Be aware of who the higher-ups are, and be smart about your interactions with fellow employees.  

3.  The review process is onerous, and ultimately unsatisfying.  Self-reviews are part of the process, as is a lengthy review completed by your direct manager. Do not expect to be recognized for going above and beyond or for picking up difficult work that others won't or can't do.  If you pick up such work and it impacts another area of your job or your ""metrics"", it will negatively impact your review. 

4.  Do not expect your review to reflect the type of raise or bonus you may receive.  It's very likely you will receive a glowing review, and a small raise or bonus due to a variety of reasons:  your stakeholder rating drives your bonus and raise amounts, not your review;  there's is a complex compensation structure with defined limits particular to your staffing level, of which you are"

I interviewed twice with several people. The corporate recruiter praised my candidacy, called all of my references, ran a background check, gave me my pay rate, a verbal offer, and an idea of when I would start my first day. 

I found it odd that I hadn't heard from the recruiter in a week, so I emailed her. Nothing. I called her, left messages, and she ignored my calls. Two weeks went by... nothing. Three weeks... nothing. You get the point. I was given a verbal offer and then I never heard from the recruiter again. Very surprising for such a large and successful company, and extremely disappointing. I would never apply for a job there again and have told friends and family about my experience so that they can avoid going through the trouble as well."

Great place to start a career in professional software development.
Self motivated individuals are highly rewarded.
Lots of energy in some product areas.
Steady/level-headed CEO.
Lots of respect for bottom-up idea generation.","Aging customer base that pays most of the company's bills. As a result, upper management is very risk-averse and does not make bold moves that anticipate market changes or move the market in any meaningful way. Company is often playing catch-up.

Company spends too much time giving an aging (albeit large) set of customers the exact thing that they ask for rather than what they really need. 

Different product areas sometimes seem to compete unnecessarily.

The org-structure is too rigid and centered around particular products and roles rather than immediate business needs. This makes software development across multiple products unnecessarily challenging. Supporting roles, such as quality engineering, also belong to entirely different orgs with different sets of priorities which quite often do not align with the actual needs of a product at a particular point in its life-cycle.

Middle/Upper management tends to intermittently micromanage product development.

Career growth can plateau in some areas of the company leaving good people with no choice but to leave or face stagnation."

885,MathWorks,A place for new grads with no experience and a nightmare for seasoned experienced professionals,2017-07-14,1.0,Product Marketing Manager,"The title says all. If you enjoy small perks, with no value -add to your career (green apples, cookies and coffee) then go for it.","For seasoned highly skilled, master or doctorate level, qualified and experienced people: stay away as much as possible from MathWorks. The company does everything, according to the needs of the CEO and his ""trusty"" people direct under him.  Those needs are usually driven by perpetual sense of power and control. That is shown to all the other people, in the form of the passive-aggressive form of : We are doing things our own way, because they worked so well for the  past 40 yrs. Managers, wake up and remove your heads out of the sand (ostrich policy). Things have changed, and there are strong players in the industry which are blowing away MathWorks.
If you think that you learn something and you will just join MathWorks to gain career skills... think again. All the processes are internally developed, with no application anywhere else ( Because they don't apply due to their ""uniqueness""). They (processes) are mostly developed to accommodate and facilitate the upper management's controlling  power (that power is eroded due to the the growing number of low paying programmers (they keep hirring) which need to be managed).  MathWorks lacks the vision of the future, in a highly dynamic and growing market, where open source is becoming the norm and choice. The company refuses to see that reality due to the poor managers, whom have been working there for more than 18-25 years (in most cases this was their first job after their graduation) . These managers look after their personal interest. That is to get to the retirement age, with a fat check, while picking up the quarterly fat bonus,
Also, if you interview for them and thinking to join MathWorks, understand that there are no promotions nor career growth. The title they give you is meaningless because they value seniority at the company. The more number of years you spend with them the more senior you are. That's why your previous experience will not count.  10 years spent within the company represent the ""big threshold""  to cross, to attain ""tenure"". Till then,  you might notice that, some kid, who joined  MathWorks 5 years ago, for a low paying job, is actually considered senior to you.
The company is geared around and for developers and development management specifically. There are only few of them and they make all the decisions about the products. Interestingly, they never leave their offices and rarely talk to customers. Yet they plan and put in place the whole road-map of the product. They don't rely too much on actual market data, or marketing people recommendations, they mostly assume what is needed.  To make matter worse, there are a lot of redundancies among various products, due to development managers' ""turf wars"". That comes from their trying to prove to the upper executive management, whom is worthy of their attention, by building ""cool"" products (mostly with little to no value to the customers).
Marketing organization is ""auxiliary"" to the developers and is mostly asked to provide marketing (collateral) documents.  The overall sense is that marketing is optional, as an internal organization and almost unnecessary. As a result, the development side is always mocking and deriding marketing and product management personnel. That attitude creates a stressful environment which leads most of the marketing people, to a demoralizing self-fulfilling attitude.
If they try to advertise the  quarterly bonus, during the interviewing stage... That bonus is very small, for the first 1-3 years. It grows slowly as you are during your ""tenure track"" and in the beginning you will effectively get somewhere 5-6%. It will be weighted heavily by the number of years spent at the company and its growths is  extremely small from year to year for the first years.
Most of the people with experience from previous jobs have left the company within 1-3 years due to all of the above reasons. The attrition rate for the experience people coming from outside is the highest. As a result the  company is turning toward internships, helping to grow and mold the people according to company's interest."

3 Good work life balance, you are working based on fixed schedule, no flexibility but also no over time

4. There are many smart and nice people work here

5. Part of the benefit is good, e.g. 401K match, unlimited sick days, and there are some nice small perks","The cons part is only for EDG, and more specifically it is for the experience of computer science people in EDG

1. MathWorks’ pay to ASE role might not be that bad comparing to many mid to small size companies, but it is still much lower than most large software companies

2. If your career goal is to do software development, don’t give a very high expectation on EDG program, because it is mainly a technical support role. EDG is part of the technical support department, and your technical support job always has higher priority than all of your other tasks in EDG. Most of the managers will purposely avoid this fact when they talk to you before you join.

3. MathWorks is an extremely procedural company, so for anything you do, there is going to be some step-by-step documentations, which is good for many people. However, for some reason they never make the procedure of transferring out of EDG to development role unclear. The time you spend at EDG actually depends on the number of opening positions in the other parts of the company, and they do over hire sometimes. When this happens, again your manager will avoid the fact and tell you to not focus on if there are any open positions, but focus on improve yourself so an opportunity will come to you.

3. The performance review process is very unclear and inconsistent. The performance rating is from 1 to 6 points, and I have seen someone got praised by his manager and promised to get a raise, while someone from the same team with a rating just 0.5 lower got warned by the same manager that his career is at risk.

4. Most of the managers are not from the appropriate technical background, so do not expect they can help you much from the technical perspective. The management is highly technical support oriented, and if you say you have a degree from computer science and you are very good at software development, your skills will not be much appreciated here.
5. The expected amount of bonus for new hires listed on the hiring material that HR gave to me was way higher than the bonus I actually received, and since all new hires get the same amount of bonus regardless of the performance, the information from HR was just not true.

6. Some actions from the management are questionable in term of the work ethics. Managers use the threat of not filing working visa application to push engineers."

For example, ""Continuous improvement""  means continuously improving our products, and also giving employees opportunities for self improvement.  Very good work/life balance.  Excellent campus.","While there are understandable and admirable processes in place to ensure quality and ensure ample consideration of decisions, there are times that these processes seem unnecessarily burdensome."
937,MathWorks,One of the best workplaces in Indian market,2016-12-16,5.0,Lead,"Have worked in other companies including services companies in the past and experience at MathWorks ranks right on the top! Here's what I like about MathWorks - 

1. Privately held & profitable. Great work culture, not at all hierarchical, is similar across all locations. In fact, it took me a bit a time to adapt my work style to this non-hierarchical work setup. :) Management is very open to listening to you & taking action on genuine concerns.

2. Colleagues you work with are very bright, yet easy to approach and are not judgmental

3. Managers encourage you to build a long term career. Intra-departmental transfers are NOT discouraged. Yes, seriously! I know of managers in other companies where you are treated like an untouchable if you speak the dreaded word ""transfer"". :) >50% of employees have been with MathWorks for 5+ years and that's something!

4. EDG (Application Support Engineer) is a superb program for fresh engineering graduates. Have seen similar programs in other companies but what makes this different is that the company empowers these fresh graduates to make their own choices and build their own career path in the company. They learn MathWorks products from customers' perspective by providing them technical support. They can choose from a variety of cool internal projects to work on to identify the next technical role they want to be in for the longer term. 
Some reviews here about EDG/ QE are in poor taste, frankly! Probably the authors had a very narrow focus in their career and did not relate to company's culture of sharing feedback openly within the company. Hopefully with more maturity and experience at other companies, they may realize what they missed out on! Wish I had something similar to EDG when I started out.

5. Good work-life balance. Performance is rewarded","1. Sometimes decisions seem HQ-centric. As the company grows in other countries, though steadily, company is becoming more receptive to localization requirements which is important

2. Tech Park in which the office is located doesn't have a food court! Yes, a builder like Prestige didn't think it was necessary to have a food court! DUH! MathWorks needs to consider creative solutions to make it easier to find food for employees that rely on outside food for breakfast & lunch. If it is available in-house, avoids employees spending time going out everyday"

943,MathWorks,Great place to work despite lousy work-from-home & time-off policies,2016-12-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"MathWorks is a great place to work.  Roles can be challenging, ""crunch"" is pretty rare for most positions, and you're working with qualified, smart people.  Managers are effective.  There is plenty of room for growth in most roles, and the mechanisms for receiving and providing feedback are strong.  The company culture is good, though it's not the stereotypical 'Silicon Valley' type culture that might be typical of other software companies. 

Pay is competitive or on the higher side when accounting for bonuses.

There is a generally good work/life balance, and while there isn't a lot of vacation time, most positions have sensible hours and it's rare that you'll be interrupted on the weekends or during your own time.

The direction of the company seems positive.  MathWorks has a positive social agenda, and the company is open to feedback.

Overall, it is a great place to work.","The work-from-home policy and time off policies are really bad.  It's not just that the policy is bad -- 3 work from home days a year -- it is that the culture around the policy is toxic.  Despite that very few people ever work from home, when somebody does work from home, there is a constant suspicion from managers and peers throughout the company.  The policy itself, 3 days a year, is very restrictive and not flexible at all, but because the company has such a strict policy about working from home, this has become a culture issue as well.

The policy for sick time is similar.  While the policy is 'unlimited' there is a cultural stigma against using sick time and an unwritten but passively enforced policy against being ""too sick.""  The company has gotten slightly better with this, as now partial sick days can be used for doctors appointments, which wasn't the case until recently.

The vacation policy is lacking as well.  Employees can earn 15 days a year from years 1-5, and then earn 1 extra day between years 6-10, and then receive 5 earned days after 15 years.  This makes a very slow climb even after you've been at the company longer than the industry average."

The interview process can be demanding. I am an experienced worker and put 40 hours into prep for the many interviews I had @ MathWorks. Extreme? Maybe, but I knew a great opportunity when I saw one. Being very well prepared for a job interview here is a very good thing.

Great culture, great food, a very caring organization to work for. Working here is akin to the culture I've seen when visiting Google. Work pace is very measured. This is not a start-up culture where people drink ten Red Bulls and work till midnight,  then trash half of what they did the following day because they were up late grinding stuff out.

If you want that manic culture, (which hey, it can be fun), this is not a place for you. MathWorks wants more heat than light if you get my drift.

People attacking repo of mathworks as whole, you guys need to understand few thing.

1. Get the Definition of call-center right. You are simply cheapening your job description by calling it a call center. Do you say the same to your friends outside? That you work in call-center? Arn't you prouded to say MathWorks? You have done your masters from prestigious colleges of India/Abroad. You guys know the product (Matlab and Simulink) better than any other team in office. And thats the reason why MathWorks find you more capable of answering costumer queries which I guess even you guys know is not easy. 

2. I know you want to shift to development teams, but understand that people working in development team has 4,7 even 11 years of experience. I am not saying you can't do it, but you should be at par with these assiduous people. If you expect to become a team lead or manager within 2 years, thats not happening folks and trust me thats not happening in any company.

3. I have my friends from college working in other company as a ""developer"" and ask me what do they do?
* Every alternate week on customer support, sometimes starting from mid-night. 
* travel at 8 in the night to office just to restart servers. Fortunately we have SSG team handling that.

4. Being a part of development team, I find that we lack software knowledge which gives EDGs and ASGs an upper hand. I myself sometimes take help from EDGians for product knowledge. As an EDGians you get to choose your own team. Team that suits you best, which no lateral hires get.

If you guys think you are capable of working in a better company, go ahead. Go try other companies where you may end up working day-and-night. You may end up working with naive freshers. May end up working on something you don't like. Go ahead, and when you are done come back. Come back to have a perfect work-life balance. Come back to work with people with 11+ years of experience who treats you like a colleague and not juniors. Come back to work of feature you once used as a student. Come back to have your own ""Patent"", which should be the goal of any renown developer. 
Realize the goodness of company you are working in before its too late. :)",* compensation people say. But the salary quoted in CTC is not deceptive at all. I get equal compared to my peers.

1.  You may not write single line of code, but you do write lot of emails . So email writing speed improve.

2.  Seating arrangement is good.

3. You will go through managerial insult on regular basis and occasional insulting from random customers. Over time you will gain significant capability to digest insult. 

4. Congrats. You are no more an ""Engineer"".  You can proudly introduce yourself as ""Technician"" (as customers often refer to you by that).

5. Some opportunity if you want to become consultant or customer relation. But you must stay away 100 miles apart from this company if you want to be a developer.","I am surprised to think how this call center manages to recruit IITians for a call center role for years and so far get away with it.  They are indeed doing a great job by converting brilliant IITians to a call center executives.  They probably have given you lot of false hope during campus placement, but let me give you what would you do exactly here.

1. You will search internet for random things you have never heard of(and don't want to hear it again),  send document links, some suggestions like update the graphics driver or set some settings in matlab menu to customers. Some time you'd report customers about some bug. Mind it it's outside company policy to help customer technologically (ie. you cannot write code for customer or design their system). This is the role they call ""challenging"". 

2.  In campus recruitment they say support:project=1:1. In reality it's 7:3. Most of your time in project week would go to handle customers/calls from the last week.

3. No transparency in transfer. Not much significant positions in Bangalore. After 1.5-2 years, if you are lucky you get transfer in  a QE(testing) role or some maintenance project which are very mediocre project.

4. People stuck here for years because they don't get opportunity in outside company. Most of the stuff you do here has no relevance in outside world. After couple of years even a service based company would not consider your resume, unless you want to join another customer care."

i honestly can't find a single pro to write here.","oh where do i begin. if you are aiming for core and think ase is a core role after their ppt before placement season, please read the following:

""Hi my name is xyz, thanks for calling, what can i assist u with?""

i bet u've heard this before - call centers. if that's the role ur looking for after clearing gate, getting into an iit, being a matka(mtech), go ahead and join.

if u are looking for core, do NOT join. you are going to be stuck in a support role for a while repeating the line i wrote above. to get in other roles(not really core anywhere in bengaluru office), u have to work WITH the title of a support engineer, juggling both support and semi-core work. you are going to do a mediocre job in your projects because u have to be on support even on the time allotted to projects(customers keep coming back, manager assigns u pointless cases).

and if u want to get out of the company.. good luck finding a core role with the precious ""support engineer"" title. it is a struggle.

edg brochure reads like u'll be working on cutting edge technologies. the realities is u'll be doing call center work even if u don't know/aren't internsted in matlab. u'll be supporting service companies like tcs(there are core companies too). first of all - SUPPORT, secondly - for service commpanies like TCS.

Although limited, team members are given some say in influencing the direction of the team and team initiatives.","Pay is significantly lower than for similar roles at other companies in the area. The location of the company is not so great for younger people who prefer to live closer to the city.

Lots of misinformation or omitted information during the interview process. Here are the downsides of this position that they won't mention in the interview:

This role is primarily a customer support role. Don't expect to spend most of your time on software development. 

The customer support work environment is considerably stressful. You are pushed to take on more and more work with the technical support team the longer you work at Mathworks under the guise of learning ""leadership skills"". 

The managers also don't generally discuss the details of the (difficult) transfer process during interviews. You basically have to go through the same process to transfer that you would go through by applying from outside the company. You have to wait for a job opening on your team of interest, then go through the strenuous interview process, and finally beat out the competition of external candidates who probably have more experience than you. This makes transferring quite difficult in many areas (except for QE, where there is a lack of applicants in general).

The EDG/CSDG program is basically a way for the company to hire programmers on the cheap and get them to do some technical support work for the company so they don't have to hire a special team to do it."

- A huge amount of bureaucracy and infinite number of review cycles for every little project you do.
- Zero possibility to work from home.
- No positive Feedback for accomplishments but huge pressure and threat when something does not work immediately.
- Huge workload and I saw many people leaving with a burnout over the last years."

I love working here and feel privileged to be part of the team. My role is very exciting and gives me the opportunity to grow and be challenged everyday. With interactions ranging from the space agency to the automotive field as Application Engineers we get to see it all. The management structure in place has been incentivized to really remove obstacles from the path of us as engineers from being the best engineers we can. I feel bad for management sometimes since they are truly outstanding engineers from top schools themselves, but can be forced to be very process oriented.","As long as you are ok with being thoughtful from a customer perspective then this company can do wonders for your soul. Unfortunately, some people like to be innovative and creative in a vacuum such as coming out with a new idea but not really getting it validated by customers then this company is not for you and then perhaps a more research oriented role is a better fit."

It is a stable, comfortable work environment.  Most people are kind, intelligent, and willing to help you out.  The top leadership (CEO, VPs) really know what they are doing and they seem down-to-earth.  

Other benefits: 
1) Most people have their own office
2) Tuition assistance up to $5000/yr
3) Great health plan, 401k options
4) Some really useful training programs
5) Yearly summer outing
6) Free Breakfast, cookies on Friday, onsite gym","Promotions are determined by years of service, not by merit.  This definitely factors into the stability of the company (see Pros), but can really kill motivation.

Teams are not given much autonomy.  Every design decision seems to go through 2-3x more reviews than necessary, and process improvements are distributed from the top down.  Again, this helps with stability, but kills motivation if you are driven by delivering products in a timely fashion and if you enjoy satisfying customers.  The lack of autonomy seems to make middle management less effective leaders too, which is discouraging."

The problems are always challenging, and the managers do not push you to deliver, but still they have a good view of the team, thus they know if someone needs some help. 

The work-life balance is astonishing. 5:30 sharp is possible to go home, none never asked me to stay after business hours (although I admit that I tend to stay late since I love what I do). 

People are always nice, competent and humble. You can ask everything to everyone and they always try to help. 

Finally there is a constant push for learning and improving. Book-clubs, trainining, courses and so on.

He's keeping it real after 30 years - still bickers over FFT coefficient matrices in the gym (yes, he uses the same gym we all do), will get involved when middle management isn't doing it right.  When my five-year-old son was at work with me one day, our path crossed Jack's.  I stopped Jack to introduce my son to the man who built the company, and Jack (sole owner of a company of 3000+) stopped, got down on one knee, and engaged with my son about how his day at Dad's work was going, and did he have any questions.  How many CEO's would be in the hallway with the unwashed masses to begin with, let alone be late for a meeting to talk to a peon's kid.  

Very stable - privately owned, long-term vision, and the $$$ to follow through on plans, even if the first year (or three) look bleak.  If you can put up with the political, quasi-academic B.S., you could retire from Mathworks.","Very silo'd and very political - the experience you have will depend entirely on the manager you have and the group you are in.  And don't even try to go up the food chain to change something - you'll bump into the ""golden children"" and be sorry you did.

No accountability for the ""golden children"" that have been there 20+ years. They are above rules and norms, and pretty much what they say is the law.  If it's wrong, someone else's head rolls.  As a ""new"" employee (even after 10 years), go with the flow, or get out.  

Campus is in Natick - it is isolated, difficult to get to, and in the suburbs. Telecommuting is against company policy, so learn to love Route 9."

Lots of fun little perks (food, celebrations, etc)

Good benefits

Interesting products

Lots of nice, smart, & interesting coworkers and managers","Low salary.

Company moves at a slow pace.

The new grad program (""CSDG"" / ""EDG"") is disappointing. At a high level this is a project rotation program combined with tech support, with the intention of transferring out after 1-2 years with strong product/customer knowledge. There are many problems with this program:

  -The position is advertised as 50% support 50% project. In reality it becomes 50% support and 50% other, where other is project, meetings, support cases left from last week, etc

  -The support weeks are rigidly scheduled at 8:30-5:30 with a 1 hour lunch break. If you want time for your project (e.g. a 1 hour meeting with your project team) you need to find someone else to cover you on the phone lines while you are away

  -Within the first 6-8 months you learn most of what you will get out of support, but you have to keep spending >50% of your time on support until you transfer out.

  -There is a ton of training built around support, and very very little training built around development

  -Some of the support cases are interesting, but many are just very simple questions that can be answered by looking at documentation

  -Transferring to a development team still requires going through the whole interview process as if applying from out of the company."

In parts of the product, its age is starting to show.  When I was there Simulink and MATLAB were launched as the same process.  Depending on the component you work on, enormous amounts of code made building and testing cumbersome.  Their continuous integration/source control management system is a set of perl scripts layered on top of CVS and is really arcane.  (They were moving to Perforce when I was there.)  There are multiple sets of tools for managing code submissions, developed by different teams.

To be fair, they are aware of these technical problems and were actively working to address them and achieve better componentization of the source code.  But it seemed at the time like a huge mountain to climb.

Overall it is a good company with lots of good and smart people. There is a decent work life balance. When working at MathWorks, you have the opportunity to help create something that scientists and engineers will use to make the next big discoveries.","There are some very bad apples at MathWorks. These are incompetent people, who are in middle management only because they joined the company early on, and MathWorks values loyalty more than competency. Some of these managers suffer from inferiority complex because they can clearly see that they are not as competent as the people they pretend to manage. My manager is one such person. If there is any issue he likes to blame it on others and does not take responsibility of the overall quality of the product or its direction. His people skills are as abyssal as his technical skills. He often talks badly about other people in the team when talking with me and I am sure he badmouths me behind my back.

Even though it is clear that the product that he is managing is going nowhere and is stuck in time MathWorks rewards his loyalty by letting him continue.

He also insults people in team meetings and is blatantly sarcastic. He routinely comes late to one-on-one meetings or skips them altogether and pretends as if nothing happened. His demeanor is aggressive. Some of the things that he is doing may be corporate bullying but complaints from people go unheeded.  As a result of his bad treatment many people have left the team in last few years. I think some people have made this known to the senior management still there is no action. I will leave as soon as I get a good offer.

People interviewing at MathWorks should avoid such teams. If you are observant during the interview and ask the right questions you will be able to figure out if you are interviewing with such a team."

1119,MathWorks,A well managed software company that makes great products,2015-08-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Top management is very stable, has long term vision, executes well and is very capable. When faced with tough business conditions over the years, they have reacted in rational and thoughtful ways rather than just resorting to layoffs or short-sighted (and ultimately, useless) cost controls I've seen at other firms. They have stayed the course and kept to the plan rather than reacting in panic to quarterly results. A nice change versus public companies that live and die by what Wall St. says. Being privately held allows for a lot more freedom.

MATLAB and Simulink are well known products in their markets. In some markets they are the undisputed champion, in others there is stiff competition. Allows for a mix of pace setting/holding the course for some teams, more of a startup environment for others.

Office environment is nice, for many positions you get your own office with a door that shuts. Those who work in cube farms and build elaborate defense mechanisms against distractions will love this.

Benefits are quite good. Vacation, health, etc are all nice.

Profit sharing takes the place of stock options or other such programs and delivers cash into your bank account rather than useless slips of paper that never vest, or that get underwater.

Managers are generally OK with flexing hours and are not clock-watchers. Some people come in early and leave early, others come in later and leave later. Same for appointments that happen during the day. Nobody tracks if you had to go to the dentist for an hour or run an errand.

The path from doing support (EDG) to working internally is fantastic. You learn the product and the customers, and then put to work internally in another department.

I've never felt pressure to check email or log in outside of working hours on any regular occasion. There have been a few times I've needed to work late or on a weekend, but there was generally a very fine and justifiable reason for doing so, and those occasions are most definitely exceptional and not considered a part of day-to-day operations.","Telecommuting policy is ""there is no telecommuting"". If you are the kind of person who doesn't mind commuting, this won't be a con. But Route 9 is godawful at rush hour during school months, as are most other roads that get to Natick -- the Pike, 128, even the surface roads devolve into a traffic Armageddon around rush hour. Management does allow some schedule flexing, but when you add things like getting kids to school, life may not afford such schedule flexing.

Transferring positions within the company isn't very straightforward outside of the EDG route. If you want to switch jobs after doing something for a while, the process can be very tedious.

It's not exactly clear what it takes to get a promotion or raise, aside from going from a fresh college graduate to someone with some experience. There are defined job levels, but there's not a clear set of goals to go from one level to the next level. There's a large pool of people who get to one level and then stay there a long time."

Cult of seniority. You are expected to do what you are told by higher-ups (de-facto; on paper Mathworks is a democracy where in fact it is a pure autocracy). Zero promotions. No feedback is heard. Everybody is pretty stuck up, nobody cracks jokes! Oh yes, CEO's idol is Jim Collins - he idolizes Mr. Collins, which quite discredits him in my eyes."

1146,MathWorks,Review for EDG,2015-06-09,3.0,Applications Support Engineer,"Good work culture, products that touch many lives. Core values , good work life balance.","EDG in India is quite poor. Students from premiere institutions are recruited and told they can make career in their respective fields, this is not true. Once a fresher joins he/she will come to know there are no choices to make as such. Only 5 departments and no core. Very few openings makes transfer for EDG very difficult. Getting t stuck with support profile is the worst thing that happen flt career that too engineers from top notch institutes. Only few technologies helpful for long term career outside MathWorks. Managers from other departments recruit people from outside even freshers are recruited which sets EDG model for a question. People don't leave because they are left with no choice rather stay in EDG only. During recruitment students are not told truth about the career opportunities."
1147,MathWorks,Application Support Engineer,2015-06-07,3.0,Applications Support Engineer,"NOTE: This review is for the application support engineering role ONLY and does not reflect the rest of the company or other departments.

Pros would include:
- A safe haven for foreign nationals looking for a long term career path and eventual citizenship in the US. They will do all the immigration paper work for you.

-Many social gathering/events, generally positive work environment

-An opportunity to explore other departments within Mathworks and learn the tools","Your experience in EDG may vary depending on your manager. Some managers are very by-the-book while others are more laid back.

- You're no longer an ""engineer"". Any notion or aspirations you once had of actually designing something cool is kind of thrown out the window. Instead, the focus lately has been transferring people to the ""quality engineering"" team where you will be doing software testing once you're done with EDG. To maximize the benefits of a future career path, choose your team wisely. However, most look for an easy opportunity to transfer out without any serious thought or consideration while others are much more definitive about what they want (you’ll see senior EDG members who have been here for 3 years or more in this category). If you’re willing to work a little harder and brush up on C++, joining development instead of QE is a better career path (both pay and experience)

- The company as a whole is obsessed with quantifiable metrics, more so with the EDG group. Tech support cases take more priority over projects for the sake of customer satisfaction. Example: Didn’t contact a customer for more than 1 business day? Send them an email explaining your progress, even if you have no progress to report.  Long weekends are usually followed by putting extra people on tech support for the flood of email cases that comes in. Projects are the key to transferring out of EDG, but the irony is that sometimes tech support over-rules this and you're forced to task-switch.

-A member in EDG is expected to ""contribute"" to the team however the sudden growth of this department head count has led to a deprivation of any sort of needed contribution. This usually leads to people coming up with very niche/useless ""EDG-projects"" that have little impact on actually helping anyone. Many meetings will be had and usually nothing will come of it. Ideas spawned by managers might turn into a “pilot project” where they may test a new procedure out. Some of these projects are useful and can benefit the team but it has been noted that a large majority of them just haven’t gone anywhere at all and are eventually killed because the idea was not-so-great to begin with.

- Process. Oh, and a ton of meetings, many of which can be skipped, especially for more senior members of the team.

-Try not to stick around for more than a year and a half in EDG. You’ll eventually have doubts about staying with the company over-all and wanting to do something else – generally, your level of involvement in answering tech support questions will stagnate and you’re encouraged to focus more on career development (picking up projects), however, you’ll still get blind-sided by tasks  in contributing to the EDG team."

follows them or not depending on the circumstances.

EDG is a ruse for them to get Technical support done by highly qualified people and their values have diverged from the company's core values. Work/life balance is screwed up since you have to frequently have to work 12hr days and the hard work you would put in is not appreciated but rather seen as standard expectations. 

None of the managers have technical skills so they frequently try to evade questions by asking the same questions back to people. ""What do you think"" is the most commonly used phrase here and there is never any logical explanation for anything."

Also, the management style in the Engineering Development Group (EDG) is very autocratic.  Thankfully, this is not true about the company as a whole, just the EDG Department specifically.

With some exceptions mid-management is poor. It's not about your management skills is about how long are you in the company. That makes a huge difference in terms of getting the best resources, review and support.

Very conservative in what regards changes. Very process oriented and slow moving - when something new is to be proposed with the objective of improving quality of work, it has to be reviewed so intensively that most people just give up and don't bother anymore.

1245,MathWorks,"In the business sector, MathWorks is one of the best.",2014-06-18,4.0,Senior Developer,"Great working environment. Everyone has an office. 

People respect and invest in the success of the company and each other. 

MathWorks is financially very strong and stable. For a decade it has been consistently growing.

A lot of interesting ideas and advances in the technology. Every new hire can learn a lot, college grads or veteran developers.

Considering that the main products were created in the 80s and early 90s, it is really amazing that there are still many innovations happening in the products.

Deeply penetrated markets. Well respected in the industry and a lot of loyal customers. 

Good work/life balance.

Good communication with customers. Customers loved the products and they are helping to shape the future of MathWorks.

If you want to find a good example of Jim Collins' book, this is the place. It shines in quite a few areas that Collins has highlighted in his book ""Built to last"" and ""Good to great"". For example, the 'cult-like culture' is an intentional results of years of cultivation.","Overall, the main markets are R&D and education institutes for MATLAB and control design automation for Simulink. These are small and well-established markets. MathWorks products have very strong standing in these markets, but the market itself is not growing rapidly. This means relatively weak salary and slow financial growth for individuals. With the stakeholder bonus, the total income is average in the design automation market. 

Another typical pitfall for tech companies from the 80s is that there is no career growth outside the management track. If you are good in a technical area, you are expected to become a senior team lead (STL) and then a manager. It is impossible to stay in the engineering track. As a result, quite a number of real good engineers have to leave the company to pursue technical advances.

The weak mid-level managers is another result of the same problem. The mid-level managers were good engineers 5-or-10 years ago. They are in a manager role now, but some are weak at leadership skills and  try to play the engineering role by making critical technical decisions and try to squeeze time to do coding works. This is bad for both parties, it discourages the engineers, creates conflicts and even makes it hard for the managers to grow in their management role. 

The engineering levels and management levels were invented when the company was still small and no one has that many years of experiences. They left very few space to grow when the company became big and people became older. As a result it has become harder and harder to get promoted because there is not so many levels to grow and there are so many people who need the promotion. 

Over 10 years ago it was decided that MathWorks will follow 'the Toyota way' and then became a process oriented company. ""There is a process for it"" has been the trend ever since. For a currently company with 3K employee it feels as if the company were 10x its size. There are a lot of lengthy processes and useless meetings. Mostly because the process were invented by the managers. A lot of people/parties needs to be involved for very trivial issues. Maybe someday the executive team can realize that the Toyota way was born out of Japanese culture for production system and US sofware companies really need to customize it for their own needs.

Over the last few years the company has gradually fell into the pattern of Collins' other book, ""how the mighty fall"". For example, most teams have lost their focus. (If every team has more than 10 focus areas, is it still appropriate to call it a 'focus'?) Luckily the top executive team seems to be aware of the issues and are improving it."

CEO uses the same amenities as everyone.

* Really good requirements and functional specification before development begins so as to avoid having to rewrite too much code as you progress
* Very good deadline setting for new features.  They do not attempt to force things in that would end up being rushed and sloppy.  Instead the focus switches to fixing bugs in the other new features for a given release so that the overall quality is high.  Trust me, this is a great way to work and leads to great morale and great work life balance.
* Managers almost always come from within
* Many junior level new hires come from their Engineering Development Group which leads to having co-workers who have knowledge of a wide range of the product line and customer viewpoint
* Usability is a huge focus
* When the economy gets tough, they do not layoff because they are private","* No MBTA subsidy
* New ideas for products or features seem to only come from a select group and so it doesn't feel like you can be as creative as you would hope
* Managers are promoted on their project management rather than their people skills.  It would be better to have managers manage team leads who would do the project management, and have the managers still do regular duties (development or whatever on the side) in addition to management.  Team leads should handle project management, managers should handle people management, and they are two very different skill sets.
* There is supposed to be 360 review, but rarely do you get to review your manager
* The parking spots are extremely narrow and cars are regularly damaged by other cars.  It seems like 2-4 people post about their cars being damaged per month asking for the person who hit them to please step forward.
* The working from home policy is VERY restrictive.
* The office closes for almost nothing.  We were open even the day of hurricane Sandy.  We closed during the afternoon just as things were starting to get crazy outside.

Many challenging aspects of the work
Learned a lot","Heavy workload and lots of pressure. And the pressure only increases.

Although I was ostensibly hired to build a new product, there was still a HUGE amount of maintenance to be done on the huge amount of existing code.

Very strong culture. Which is a strength in some ways, but it also means that only a ""certain kind of person"" is a good fit. Are you that kind of person? Ask a lot of questions. And don't assume that MathWorks is uniformly great in all groups.

Much of the code in my area (Simulink) was overly complex. Entire frameworks were created to insulate business logic from technology choices (e.g., Java implementation, Qt implementation). Result: a large amount of work was typically required to implement even the simplest feature.

In my group, management did not have very good management skills. Running the new project seemed to be an ""afterthought""...the top job was making all the bug-fix numbers. And the new project ended up getting canceled."

1336,MathWorks,Nice place to work,2013-05-03,4.0,Software Engineer,"Lots of culture, good work life balance, flexible hours, good senior management. Good company if you are looking to settle down. Company growing, has a stable market.",Not many career opportunities for moving up the ladder.
1337,MathWorks,"incompetent management, too many egotistical seniors , slow grown",2013-05-01,1.0,Quality Engineer,OThers will review on the pros. Let me focus on Cons.,"First of all it is surprising to me that company has so many 5 start ratings from current employees, as if they have be asked to improve the company image.

Company hierarchy - The company has increased 10 folds in last 13 years. So all those who have been here more than 10 years (competent or not) have moved into management positions. They are enjoying without doing much work, taking big salaries and making sure that they will retire here. There have been cases where people had to loose their jobs if they pissed off these managers (obviously the reason was shown to be something else). Senior management on the other hand is all about profits and doesn't care much about bad things happening in the company. There is no process here wherein you can anonymously complain about someone especially your manager. All you can do is talk to his manager, and guess what will happen.


Work from Home Policy -  You can only work from home 3 times a year. Even if you are 1 hour late, your manager expects you to tell how you will make up for that. On the other hand some people come to office only for 6 hours a day and spend most time chatting in corridors. This is ridiculous for a Software Company.

Review Process - Every year all managers sit inside a closed room and start fighting like dogs for a fixed number of ratings for their direct reports. They have an excel sheet on which every QE is listed. That decides your salary increase. A street smart employee even though not productive gets the rating increase especially if his manager is aggressive in these meetings. On other hand  a hard working and highly productive employee will not get a rating increase since not too many managers know his name and his manager is not aggressive.   That's why street smarts make lots of presentations and make sure that every manager knows their name. If you are waiting for the right time for your promotion, it will never come. 

1 month after the ratings are set, the review process starts, wherein you write your review, your manager writes your review and some peer quotes. These are just a formality since your rating has already been decided. (You should ask this question about review process if you interview here.) I have seen really smart and productive people stay at same position for years or leave the company while a incompetent butt licker gets promoted. This company with 3000 employees has lots of politics at play. It also has high attrition rate.

In Quality Engineering the situation is worse. You many be doing a fanstatic job and be appreciated by all the development, but if QE managers don't know you, best of luck. That's why your manager will ask you to make lots of presentations and not worry about doing your work since he alone cannot give you a high rating.

Product Quality - Management always talk about importance of fixing the bugs but there are senior development managers who discourage finding bugs in the product since it makes their team look bad. They might be asked questions as to why there are so many bugs being found. Even if there are bugs in the safety critical code generation products, they convert them into enhancements just to look good in eyes of senior-most management.

Salary raise - Company makes huge profits and still pay increase is usually under 5% citing bad economy(that too if you are doing good).

In end, company has the motto of ""do the right thing"" but all management does is what's good for them. This company has too many processes to follow.  Every time middle level management tries blaming their incompetency to the lack of processes, they come up with a new process to follow. In all, the company has is my way or highway."

1351,MathWorks,"Overall a great company, with a few flaws",2013-03-01,4.0,Engineer,"- MathWorks is a very successful company.  Despite being very conservative from a management standpoint, it is still able to rake in boatloads of cash.  That cash is then reinvested strategically in the business (facilities, new hires).
- If you have initiative, you are encouraged to carve out your niche, by working on side projects that you're interested in.  Only 1 of my 3 objectives has anything to do with what I was originally hired for.
- Open door policy: the culture encourages people to collaborate and get involved in others' projects.  Information is freely dispersed throughout the whole company. This is such a refreshing change from working for public companies and the government.
- The work/life balance is great, at least in my group.
- Perks: Free breakfast, drinks, cookies. Anniversary celebrations, winter celebration, summer outing, Sales Kickoff.  Facilities are great.  Nearly all employees get offices.
- Solid benefits: Health insurance, 401k match, group discounts.","- The review process is largely a waste of time. Your rating is decided (by consensus of the managers in your group) before your manager even starts writing your review.  You are asked to write a self review, but your manager isn't even allowed to read it until your rating has been decided and your review has been written.  Since peer quotes are non-anonymous, they are mostly just employees scratching each other's backs without any honest feedback.
- Senior management can be out of touch with what customers really want. Product decisions are made based on what is the ""next big thing"" or what Jack thinks sounds cool, without any customer demand backing it up.  Yeah, MATLAB Mobile is a great idea - too bad you can't actually do anything useful with it.  These projects are then pushed out at the expense of other projects (things that customers actually want) that have been languishing for years.
- Cliques have formed of people who have been at MW for decades. They are quick to close ranks whenever they feel threatened by newcomers.
- The previous two bullets, plus the fact that MATLAB doesn't have significant competition, mean that there are few consequences for failure.  There are no ""feature deadlines"" at MW.  If a true competitor emerged, MW would struggle to compete with this mindset."

- There is an impressive base of engineering grads (an MS is basically required for entry-level positions).  
- In the large majority of cases, people work well together and there is a cooperative atmosphere.
- Honesty is placed in very high esteem, and people try hard to conform to that standard.
- Benefits are very good (401k match percentage is almost unheard of in the industry).
- EDG/ASE does provide a good opportunity to try out different departments before making a transfer.  
- If you do a good job and are well-liked, you will move up in the ranks fairly quickly.","- In EDG, if you are given the wrong manager (basically assigned by luck), then your career is doomed.  
- Too many mandatory meetings and micro-management.  In some cases I was asked to write a ""plan"" for a project that took as long as the actual project itself.
- There is a strict culture of doing things ""the MathWorks way"", even if there are better ways out there.  Because of this, it takes forever for new features, and even bug fixes, to make its way into the customer's hands.
- Transferring between jobs inside the company is way more difficult than the other companies that I've worked at.
- The CS grads tend not to be as talented as engineering grads, yet they are courted more aggressively due to a lack of these types of people.  Top-notch engineering grads will come here, whereas top-notch CS grads tend to turn down offers here because they would rather work for Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc.
- Base salary is very mediocre.  My starting salary at my new job was 25% higher."

The company has good perks such as paid trip each year, and free snacks/drinks.  This is where the benefits ends","The perks at this company comes with a huge price. You lose your freedom, autonomy, and self respect.  In the IT department, every person hates working here.  The  management  creates an environment of fear and constantly berate  your skills and competence.  The managers are very manipulative and there is generally,  a culture of distrust.   Criticizing your work and contributions is common, so they can increase control and manipulation.  If you work in IT, you will be watched and tracked continuously.  Every error you make (regardless of how small)  is used against you.   For example, if you did an installation that went well for  hundreds of people, and one person had a minor issue, this will be tracked.  Then management will keep berating you for this ""horrible"" error.  They keep a record of every comment someone says and use it for power and manipulation on your reviews.  For example, in one meeting (where I was not even a required participant), I was checking my emails on my Blackberry.  Someone reported this to  my manager and this so-called ""issue"" was used  in my reviews. There is so much  micromanagement of your work.  They watch everything you do, and there is a general distrust of  the employees.  There is an unspoken rule that you are not allowed to question any of the policies or processes unless you have been here for 5-10 years.  If you question any of the existing processes, you get singled out.   There are so many unnecessary meetings during the day, that you don't have time to do anything else.  Half of the meetings, you don't need to attend, but if you don't show up, Management will label you as  a bad team player.  

There is NO work from home policy.  It doesn't matter if there is a hurricane, a huge snow or a state of emergency, you CANNOT work from home.   If you like any degree of autonomy, or value any amount of freedom, or  a place where you can  voice your opinion, please don't work here."

The only people who complain are the ones who are not innovative or strong enough to drive change! Yes - a lot of the times the decisions involves senior management - but they give you a complete freedom to come up with ideas, innovate and prepare a sensible plan - the ideas that get canned are either idiotic are the people bringing those ideas do not have enough expertise in their field or lack confidence in their own thoughts. Over 70% of the workforce at MathWorks have been here 5 years or more - that's proof enough! If you are smart, enjoy your work and have a good manager, you will love it here.

Interview process is indeed rigourous, but the result is you rarely see idiots or people who can't fit into the culture being hired.

- The company is very profitable and it’s great to be part of a winning team.","- Things can move slower than some would like. You are encouraged to measure twice and cut once.

I loved the cookies!","This is a good solid company with alot of potential, but I disliked working here. Management watches over you like a hawk.  There is alot of micromanagement.  They don't allow you to work from home at all.  Career advancement is vitually none. Seniority is based on your number of years, and they treat new people (new = under 3 years) like they don't count . You can't voice your opinion or challege any of the antiquated process.  Their answer is basically ""It's the Mathworks way"" which means shut up or I'll get you in trouble.  There are meetings after meeting after meeting and most of them are a waste of time. However, you have to go or someone will tell your manager and get you in trouble."

- Excellent breakfast buffet on Wednesday mornings

- Lots of free beverages

- High density of geeks and nerds

- Plenty of challenging projects to work on","- No telecommuting allowed

- Below average salaries for a software company

- If you're in software development, half the product teams (all Simulink-based products) are under extreme high stress all the time.  If you don't want to be stressed out of your mind, stay far away from that side of development.   The other side of the company (MATLAB-based stuff) is full of easygoing laidback people who have little or no stress at all. 

- People who shouldn't be managers or team leads get promoted to those positions just because they've been around the longest and no one else wants to lead.  Good developers are often poor managers.  The search for a good manager is basically impossible in development.

- ""Application Support Engineer"" is nothing more than a fancy title for ""Tech Support Grunt"".  If you enter the company as an ""Application Support Engineer"", be prepared to get yelled at by angry customers every week.

- No politics: everyone is here to help the company and their co-workers succeed.
- Profitable company that shares its success with the employees through a stakeholder bonus.

Over the dozen or so years I have been here, I have pretty much written my own job description.  Small side projects became larger projects, become job requirements.

That said, I think people come in with weird expectations:  It is not high school, you don't get a promotion every year.

The company genuinely cares about its employees; the company's ethics (for example, the way everyone in my group takes the time to say ""thank you"" at least once a day) and benefits/perks (such as fresh fruit in the morning, and counseling services) reflect an incredible commitment to the well-being of the staff, and to ensuring that they're not only happy in their jobs but happy in their lives. (This is also reflected in the volunteer program and Social Mission, by the way-MathWorks' commitment to community and service was another big indicator for me of how good this company is.)","Commuting to the Natick campus from Boston can be a bit of a pain, especially if you can't drive and have a long-term injury or surgery. While Boston's MBTA provides reasonable service, they're also strapped for cash, and the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (operating shuttles from MathWorks to MBTA stops) is unreliable, disorganized, and overcrowded. The company has a very strong commitment to on-campus, in-person business, which makes for a great and productive working environment, but it also means that working from home is not an option for extended periods of time, even with a doctor's note."

The Engineering Development Group is a great way to enter the company/workforce. Everyone in the department is right out of top tier grad schools and it's a pretty close knit group.

- Financially stable if you want to be relaxed with little work
- Good knowledge gain in first 2 years","Mathworks will do lots of bragging when you interview. So let me just directly point to what's wrong with the company.

- Low starting salaries. They brag a lot during the interview process.  Do not be frustrated if you do not get into Mathworks. Since there aren't that many big companies for  Science and Engineering Graduates, Mathworks gets huge number of applications, and it rejects almost any applicant for no clear reason. I myself interviewed many people but hiring manager could find any stupid reason not to hire. One hiring manger said that he didn't want to hire this candidate because he was looking outside to window too many times during interview.

- You think feedback from your colleagues with whom you do 90% of your work will decide your rating and promotion. But that decision is made by your manager with whom you do 10% of your work and other Senior Management folks (old timers) who may not even have heard of you. So when you get frustrated after some reviews as to what you may be doing wrong, your manager makes stupid excuses. Manager asks quietly his favorite team member (whom he/she wants to promote) to make presentations, make personal communications, emails and what not to approach the big managers who make ratings and promotion decisions at the end of the year. They make sure that senior managers sit in these useless presentations that have nothing to do with the product.
- If you are smart and a graduate from schools like MIT or Standford, incompetent colleagues will leave no chance in taking some credit for some smart work you have done. Behind your back they will in fact try to take most credit for contributions you have done. They will also undermine your work at every occasion to make sure they are recognized.
- Only reason some really smart people are still working there is they are think management is giving them credits for their work. Another reason is that they are some of the few smart people who are verbose.
- You will definitely need to do lot of butt licking if you want a promotion.
- Developers are given a little bit more respect. Senior development Management knows that if these important people leave, they will have tough time to replace them. When a developer wants to leave, these managers scramble to make any concessions, pay raise, better position etc so that the developer stays no matter what. Quality Engineering Management doesn't have to do that.
- You will see many employees in the company that are visa holders. So if your green card is in the processing, especially if you are from India and China, they know you have no where to go. Even managers say it on your face that you are stuck here, and all you can do is smile and ignore it."

I consistently appreciate all the little things the company has to offer...intelligent people, literally awe-inspiring technical computing products, great benefits and profit sharing.  There is a consistent vision of the future and a workplace centered around hard work and results.  Many of the ""individual contributors"" know their subject areas well, and could probably run companies of their own.

I've grown personally and professionally over these past 5 years, and a great deal of the credit goes to MathWorks.  I never before realized how different things can work better if they fit into a well-defined process, and you'll definitely get that insight and experience working here.  I love and appreciate this company - I'm loyal.  Yet, it does have its fundamental flaws.","3 words: meetings, politics, promotions.

Meetings: There are way too many.  If you're the type of person (like me) who needs hours upon hours to concentrate and focus and think big thoughts in order to contribute well, then you'll find it difficult to do that in this environment without staying after normal working hours to do so.

Politics:  The way our reviews are organized require consensus building amongst managers.  Our fate is determined not just by our direct manager, but by managers who we may have interacted with only a few times during the year.  In my view, this breeds territoriality and rather petty bickering.  People will go behind your back and above your level....and they will get attention because they're the squeaky wheel.

Promotions: I don't believe a single person in my group of ~30 has been promoted within the last 5 years.  The economy was given as the reason previously, but that excuse can only last so long.  Yes, we are lucky to have jobs.  However, the lack of a well-defined career path is I believe fundamentally hypocritical at an organization which is hierarchical yet also holds the core value of ""respect and invest.""  What ends up happening is that you'll be expected to work at a higher level of excellence, but ultimately never attain a higher level in the organization."

You have to work 'around' the meetings and the documentation.  This means a very long day just to get your actual work done.  No time for breaks or lunch, many people eat at their desks.   

Always need to do better.   I have witnessed people work so hard only to be told that is your job, now do better than that.  They want only superstars, but even if you are a superstar, you are not recognized for it.  I think they strive on making you feel less than adequate so they can control you better.

No flexibility to work from home.  Policy is 0-3 times a year with management approval only."
1428,MathWorks,"Great place to work, but only choose if you want to stay for 10 years",2011-11-27,4.0,Development Intern,"MathWorks' product is well established and the company has really good financial performance. Great people around. The product development process is rigorous. As a developer, you need to have formal, written definition the requirements and it got to go through internal reviews before you can start writing a single line of code. Good documentations support. It's a great place to learn Software Development. It seems to be *very* stable in MathWorks. People around stays for 10 years or more!","Standard big company, lots of meetings to attend, even it's not relevant to you. I have worked in the UK office, and a large portion of your time is spent on making phone calls with people in MathWorks US office, trying to explaining what your code means. Or the other way round, when you have  problems using others' code. People stays there for long, that means it's hard to have a change there. My manager there has been a developer for 9 years before transferring to  his management role. Another QA guy hsa been there for 5 years. These are actually young guys in the office. There are ones who have worked for MathWorks for 20 years."
1429,MathWorks,Overall it has been a great experience.  As long as your work is done then you are left to manage your own projects.,2011-11-27,4.0,Quality Engineer,Quaterly stakeholder bonuses are very generous and the atmosphere surrounding the six month release cycle provides challenges all the time.  Other employees are usually wiling to help.,Diversity at MathWorks is an issue at least in development.  I'm not sure if this is because there are not enough U.S. workers who are qualified to work there or if it is an issue with recruiting.  It seems most people in development will be foreign born and I see this continuing in the future.
