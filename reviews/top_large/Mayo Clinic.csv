I used to work in the Practice Shield.,"Information Security (IS) does not share the values of Mayo Clinic. I have heard IS managers mock the Mayo values. Managers in IS do not support employees, they only look out for themselves. Managers of different units are vindictive to each other which makes it very hard on the members of the units to move work forward. No managers have an IS background but they are making IS related decisions. They spread emails in jokes and spend their time on other useless activities rather than doing real workload management and other manager activities. HR protects managers and there is no one to go to. Everyone is simply going along with the disarray in order to not get on the bad side of their managers. There is no room for honesty without negative backlash. The people who actually want to do good work are leaving or looking. The people who want to fake it and be lazy are staying but complain behind the managers' back to others. It is toxic and depressing to work here."
56,Mayo Clinic,Good Work/Life Balance,2022-03-16,5.0,Clinical Lab Technologist,"A lot of Mayo labs have 10 hour shifts / 4 days a week for their technologists, which makes a huge difference in work/life balance.

130,Mayo Clinic,Job Review,2022-02-12,2.0,Clinical Lab Assistant,The work itself can be challenging and interesting. There is a sense of satisfaction in working with a team to help patients receive their best care. It might be a good place to work if you're young and just starting out (and don't mind adhering to an extremely strict attendance policy that doesn't allow you to have any kind of life).,"I've realized that Mayo Clinic Rochester's priorities seem to be focused more on the needs of the doctors (i.e., their training and research) than on the needs of the patients. If these happen to be in alignment, then that particular patient is given a ""red carpet"" treatment and may even be the subject of a published journal article; however, if the patient's needs do not contribute in any way to the overall development of the doctors who are being trained here, then those needs may or may not get met - but if the patient complains, they are sent to the ""Office of Patient Experience"" where their complaints are basically ""contained"" and dealt with separately (in other words, so the doctors don't have to deal with them). Mayo's other focus seems to be on maintaining a favorable image with the public, which is often in direct conflict with reality (such as publishing articles on how they support equity towards women when they are actually quite misogynistic in practice). In fact, it seems that Mayo Clinic Rochester has focused so hard on research that they've completely fallen behind in practically every other area where other companies have progressed, and have tons of catching up to do. Finally, their new policies toward career advancement require competition and reward youth (and sometimes seniority), so if you begin working there as an older adult you can just forget taking advantage of any opportunities. Realizing all of this as an employee has been discouraging and depressing, to say the least."

Only accept a position if your direct report manager has more than 15 years experience at Mayo, anything less and they probably don't care about you as a person just as a dispensible body and number.",New leadership at top of the nursing food chain is not supportive of actual nursing only cares about the bottom line.

Their motto is ""needs of the patient come first"", but morally the only care about making money, so if you are a patient with money, you get what you want. If you are a patient without money you get left behind. Its sad that this Mayo legacy of trust and commitment to patients and their care, now comes down to dollars."
139,Mayo Clinic,Mayo Clinic Research,2022-02-09,4.0,Senior Program Coordinator,"They stand by the needs of the patient comes first. 
Lots of exciting research.",Wages are not competitive as they are in a small town bubble.
140,Mayo Clinic,Door opener- not career,2022-02-08,2.0,Financial Counselor,At one point if you change departments you are allowed to keep your pay or have your pay increase based on your new department pay rate. You can sign up for leadership training with the approval of your supervisor( this does not guarantee any results of having a possible role in leadership).,"So I've been there for quite a few years and it seems to be getting rapidly worse. I've seen a lot of abuse of power and covering up as well as retaliation. There are constant threats to terminate people for what is turning out to be any reason. Poor communication. Constant policy changes almost weekly to daily and you're penalized if you do not know these. New hires with little to no experience are being offered higher pay than the current employees that have been there for years. People who apply for one of the Mayo clinics other sites and are hired for the said site but physically sit in another state are NOT being paid the posted compensation on the positions they applied for because they live in another state. Benefits are not the best at all (pricing and coverage details vary depending on which department you work for). You are treated as if you are a child (For example : The ""Stars"" kids get elementary, an almost exact replica and each ""star"" means something different) but instead of stars, you get coupons. For Medical Leave, you are only allowed to make up 3 days per quarter (even if your department is still actively working and during business hours they will not allow you to make up the hours ( as if the individual can control whatever medical issues or treatments are required for them; this also varies as to which department you work for. I have learned that you are not allowed to share information with your colleagues even if you think that could keep them out of trouble or things that you guys just may disagree with and may have general questions about. My coworker is a private person and she tried to add her husband to her insurance and their response to her was; pretty much, well you never talked about your husband or mentioned that you had a husband before so we're going to need your marriage certificate as proof. I have been in meetings where supervisors have told several of my coworkers who had general concerns that they should be grateful that they even have a job because of everything that's going on. In addition, the major issue that's happening is if you happen to be on the call or an assignment that runs over or into you're 15 minutes or your lunch, they are implementing rules that if you don't get off on time or you don't log out on time then you completely miss your break and or you only get to use what's left of it (Meaning if you are on a call that runs 5 minutes into your break you only get 10 minutes left of a break or they'll tell you you're not allowed to take your break at all. The same thing for your lunch. If you are on a call and the call runs 10 to 20 minutes into your lunch you are only allowed to take a 50 or 40-minute lunch instead of a full-hour lunch). Everything you do is timed. Everything. More responsibilities are being added without additional allowed time. So if you get a patient or a client who is just so confused and has a lot of questions you only have 4.5 minutes to answer their questions and if it goes over that you are in trouble. You're rushing them off the phone and leaving more questions than answers and you have 3 minutes to note the call in said person's account anything over and your score suffers drastically and threats of termination role in. There is a lot of writing off the wealthy's debt and sending people who are struggling financially and health-wise to collections. It is a very stressful environment. A large number of my team members have announced that they are seeking employment elsewhere. Everything I have mentioned has been spoken out to leadership and though they stated they were going to look into it there have been zero results yet and it has been 2 years of decline. The only response we received is that there will be no active changes in regards to anything I've mentioned above."

If you aren't doing something that actively make money for the clinic, it feels like you aren't valued. The sisters aren't around to defend that philosophy and I think they would be disappointed to see how it's changed. Will make large donations to ""end racism"" and make sure it's all over the media but has no issue contracting, the most culturally diverse departments. Removing much of our culturally diverse staff, from the employment/healthcare benefits they deserve. Then 'educate' remaining staff on the issues of minorities not having access to quality healthcare. Which is one of the largest inequality issues in the US. It's abhorrent to see them contract these departments but still lecture about the inequalities in healthcare for minority populations. They could have remained to be part of the solution."

256,Mayo Clinic,Used to be a unicorn,2021-12-22,2.0,Registered Nurse,"I have worked at Mayo for six years as an inpatient RN. Mayo was the best hospital I could have asked to work at when I first started. The hospital is clean, used to be very well staffed with nurses who really knew their stuff. Mayo has a lot of resources available, such as phlebotomy, STAR RN (ICU nurse who rounds on critical patients), vascular access team (RNs who do central line dressing changes, place PICCs, access PORTs). The nursing staff who work here are overall very nice and willing to help one another.","COVID has been awful for all hospitals; however, Mayo has not supported their nursing staff throughout the pandemic. They think giving the staff a $500 gift card and offering double pay to pick up additional shifts (for a short amount of time, that you have to schedule two weeks in advance) makes up for not giving us any other incentives for drowning with terrible staffing ratios the past six months. They do not care that we are incredibly short staffed and are having trouble giving patients the care they deserve and expect at Mayo; but, they still have no problem sending individual emails to their staff if something was done wrong. They want to say ""the needs of the patient come first"" any chance they get, but the truth is, they only care about the bottom line. They have lost their respect and appreciation for their nursing staff and they have made that incredibly obvious throughout COVID. We didn't expect things to be easy throughout the pandemic and understand staffing may be short, but Mayo was the worst paying hospital in the area and refused to pay their staff anything extra to help retain staff. Now our floors are filled with travel nurses who have no idea how to care for our patients and who are making twice as much as us. Well done Mayo."

260,Mayo Clinic,"Values are going downhill, healthcare is business afterall, poor management prompting high turn over",2021-12-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits package, ongoing support for education within Mayo's growth project, dedicated staff, above average patient to nurse ratios

Great place to START your career, but certainly not to live out your career here.","Within certain departments, there is a lot of toxic culture. Constant bullying that continues to be unaddressed by their ""leadership."" Those in management positions are so focused on climbing the ladder, and not actually being there for their people. With high turn over rates, the management team is still scratching their head as to why people are leaving. They do not know how to ask the right questions, and are very elitist in how they manage. So focused on xyz degree, xyz speciality, when in reality, experience and actual abilities should come first.

At the end of the day, regardless of how many years you have served, you are replaceable. They are more willing to replace than to retain. Unwilling to be flexible on things like schedules and life events only place employees in a weird spot to choose their family or their career. High expectations to complete work out of work hours, and little room for overall career growth. 

Care is expensive here. Whether it is because you don't have the right insurance or all providers are booked, it's hard to get in. Seems like the majority of cared for at Mayo are the rich and privileged. Appointments are hard to get - even if your condition is time sensitive...requires patients to leave continuity of care within the system."

It's easy to use PTO to take days off in my unit.
Food in the employees' cafeteria is budget-friendly.
A lot of staff work remotely, so it is super easy to find a space in the parking lot.","Before I worked at Mayo, I thought the negative reviews about Mayo on Glassdoor would not represent my experience at Mayo. Unfortunately, I experienced something that I did not hope for and felt the same pain.

There is insufficient support with high expectations to handle a heavy workload once poor-quality training is complete.

Narrow-minded employees contributed to the toxic work culture in my unit. While I was tolerant of my toxic co-worker for a while, it caused me a lot of stress and anxiety. If you experience a similar situation at Mayo Clinic, do not put up with yourself, because your tolerance may not bring you a positive outcome automatically.

Managers have very poor leadership skills. If you see a high turnover in a team, that's a red flag.

While salary and benefits seem better compared with other hospitals, it is not worthwhile to sacrifice your health and job satisfaction to earn them. The managers claim they care about staff's well-being, but actions speak louder than words.

You have to use your PTO to get your holidays paid.

A lot of backstabbing and ego. To stay humble is not appreciated.

Communication is horrible among different departments.

The needs of physicians and patients come first. Staff may be not treated with respect sometimes. Some doctors are very difficult to work with. While the Office of Diversity and Inclusion sent a lot of messages for diversity and inclusion, I did not feel my work culture was diverse and inclusive."
400,Mayo Clinic,Its ok,2021-09-27,3.0,Mayo Clinic,Mayo values longevity and they base a lot of their decisions on how long you've been there.

-Depending on your department, leadership and culture can be fantastic.

-Patient interactions make work feel meaningful. 
-Mayo (for obvious reasons) supports opinions of real scientists, doctors, and experts, as opposed to lame politicians.","-No sick days, paid vacation, paid holidays, etc. You have to use your precious PTO for literally EVERYTHING. 
-If you have to stay home because you're sick (even if you have a doctor's note) Mayo considers that an ""unexcused"" absence and it becomes an occurrence. 
-Some departments tend to hire external applicants just because they have a personal connection to the supervisors or other employees, even if that person bombs the interview. 
-Despite Mayo trying its best to send messages of diversity, inclusion, and tolerance, you'll still get narrow-minded coworkers who scoff at those ideas. (But it all depends on the culture of your department.)"

Provider autonomy and ability to make the best clinical decisions for their patients has been replaced with a corporate structure of untrained managers dictating aspects of clinical care that they do not understand. Quality providers are leaving in droves because we did not spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of our lives on education and training to have no control over our workflow, schedules, and caseload. Nor do providers appreciate being micromanaged to death when we are busy just trying to treat our patients with the best care possible.

I have been a victim of and seen instances of bullying and harassment none of which are ever appropriately dealt with. HR does nothing nor compliance especially when the once doing these things are in any type of leadership role. However if you are a “little guy” you will be chastised for every mistake you make. 
If you know the right people and have the in your career can be fruitful and a walk in the park. If not, you will be stuck doing the lowest jobs scratching until your nails bleed to get anywhere. And even if you know the right people if they don’t like you enough your screwed.

Mediocre art in the patient care areas - though usually the frame job is more valuable than the object, but that's a classic Mayo feature: shiny on the outside, something warmer and stinkier on the inside.","Conformity is the #1 cultural value. Bureaucratic subordination is #2. Kissing the chair's hindquarters is #3. Not complaining that any of this doesn't smell like roses is #4. Going to long boring meetings in which nothing in particular is decided is #5. Findings ways to squelch innovation is #6. Being the most boring person you can possibly be is #7. Making sure you don't inadvertently make a celebrity unhappy - or someone that someone in the bureaucracy thinks is important to the institution's image - is #8. There are more, but you get the point

What's worse, they say it's all about needs of the patient comes first, but really its all social control of you. It's absolutely amazing how problems in some administrators head turn into grave patient safety issues while real patient safety issues are ignored.

- Benefits include short-term and long-term disability, as well as a private pension plan; bedside nurses are immediately eligible for short-term disability (after a 24-work-hour waiting period) without having to wait a year for coverage to kick in
- Sense of camaraderie and mission at the hospital in Rochester is very much true to the spirit of the Mayo brothers' mission
- New employee orientation included a broad and detailed overview of both history and mission, with explanation of how this contributes to the ongoing mission of the organization
- Working alongside physicians at a variety of stages in their training can be interesting and rich in learning opportunities
- Demonstrated commitment to addressing racism both within and outside of the Mayo organization
-Coordinated, efficient and effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic with early initiation of institution-wide measures to promote health & safety of patients and staff","- RN pay is not competitive with that of the Twin Cities' hospitals
- Penalties called 'occurences' are incurred if a nurse calls in sick (incentivizing nurses to come to work sick!)

1152,Mayo Clinic,Great place to work,2020-01-26,5.0,RN ICU,"Mayo's compensation for nursing staff is tops in the valley.  They truly care about the patients and staff by acuities.  This leads to nursing having greater job satisfaction and not getting burned out with overwhelmed staffing assignments.  Typical shift on med/Surg floor 3:1, ICU 1:1 or 2:1.  There are always plenty of resources around to help out.  You can tell Mayo Clinic puts the money they have back into the facility to create an unparalleled working environment.",The upward movement is slower because people don't leave once they work there.

Great real estate appreciation in Rochester.

Exposed to some of the best physicians and researchers in the world, with Mayo recruiting talent from across the globe to achieve their 2030 goals.

2030 goals offer a lot of opportunity for career growth.","With our new CEO starting just one year ago, administration is coming out of the dark ages.  Today's more modern leadership/management philosophies are steeped in the model of ""the inspired employee"".   Not so much here - this has been a very traditional top/down hierarchical system like one would commonly see 15-20 years ago.

However, I already see signs of moving in the right direction with our new CEO who speaks regularly about the importance of a joyful and fulfilled workforce, - championing the undeniable basis that the institution will be unable to continue offering the world's best health care if the employees responsible for creating said health care are not joyful, fulfilled, inspired, encouraged.

No employee parking in Rochester.  You will need to find another way to get to work; and winters in Rochester are brutal so waiting at a bus stop is beyond miserable.  But the bus system is good; it's clean and runs just about all over town, and Mayo pays for it.

I was told I would have 2 weeks of PTO first year but NOT told that I would be forced to use these for every holiday AND for every day missed due to an inability to travel (due to bad weather ie frozen streets/white out conditions).  And PTO is slow to build - it takes a few years to build enough PTO to have a decent vacation plus cover holidays plus cover bad weather days.

The Rochester locals, who you'll be working with largely, are courteous, but mostly hail from many generations of farmers.

Extremely difficult for newcomers to build a social life.  Most locals spend their weekends with their families, and they're generally closed-off to ""outsiders"".

Very little direction is given to the new employee re navigating this large institution's highways and byways.    

Compensation isn't super competitive.

Most employees are stressed out, with more work to do each day than they can possibly do.  But there's a general acceptance of this so you're likely to be ""cut some slack"" when you can't get it all done - but generally, you need to find a way.  Many non salaried employees work while not clocked in so they can get it all done.  Overtime is either highly discouraged or not allowed at all - but you're expected to get it done."

1196,Mayo Clinic,"Abusive Management - Skip Compliance Hotline - use video on you phone, then get a lawyer",2019-10-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"For me, it is a short commute.
Decent benefits","Abusive manager- Dept manager that literally cornered a colleague in their cube and was screaming and waving her arms while yelling at the colleague who had no idea what the manager was screaming about. It was as if the manager had gone berserk. Found out later that the compliance hotline closed the report without anyone ever contacting the reporter or the verbally abused employee. 

My advice - skip the black hole that is called the compliance hotline. They will do nothing. Use your phone - have the presence of mind to hit video because even the audio will be helpful and go get a lawyer. 

Very little advancement unless you know someone on the interview team.

Research has lost its way. Do not go on a treatment study. No one in clinical research seems to know how to do their jobs very well. It is all about supporting the pharmaceutical companies and the money they can bring into this billion dollar organization and not about ensuring patient safety."

For these reasons it can be very difficult for one to reach his or her career goals- especially if you work in an unrelated department.

Fair compensation. Free CEU in-house.,"Management and nursing staffing office consider nurses to be interchangeable widgets on a schedule with vacancies, constantly changing from day/night shift multiple times a week. There is no such thing as a work life balance if you are a staff nurse. There are many ""staff satisfaction"" surveys, though it would seem that little is done to improve the declining morale among nursing staff. 
Managers face punishment if they provide a reference for current or former employees for career or educational endeavors.
There are few other employment options in the area outside of Mayo, resulting in submission of nursing staff in order to keep jobs. Additionally, management bends employment laws to meet the needs of the company rather than protecting the employee. HR works closely with management with the goal of moving up in the company, therefore employees are not fairly represented when issues arise.
Not much opportunity to attend offered education in house that is not required for position. Management rules with an iron fist - autonomy of thought is not acceptable.
Regarding receiving health care: as an employee, you are triaged to receive appointments last, often not getting an appointment with your primary provider and being told there are no appointments on the available calendar (within 12 weeks). Unfortunately, the city this company resides in is in rural Minnesota, and they are the only available provider for the 40,000 employees and their families. Sadly, the health of employees suffers and health needs are unmet due to the poor management of health resources, rationing of care.

I worked for the next 5 years at the Arrowhead Family Medicine office.,"Unfortunately, my husband passed away unexpectedly in June of 2015.  This same Friday, my supervisor of 5 years relinquished the Arrowhead site to a former Supervisor who chose to write me up for all my tardies and/or absences that my former Supervisor worked with me on.  I took 5 1/2 months off on personal leave to attend to my 2 children who at the time were 13, and 17.  Additionally, I had my disabled parent living with me and for whom I needed to take care of as well.   After returning to work in January of 2016, and attending the funeral of my mother-in-law.  I was immediately reminded that I was on my first written warning and that any further tardies or absences would not be tolerated.  In August, 2016, my daughter returned to school to start her first year in high school.  She missed her ride and I had to take her to school and sign her in. Upon arrival, my supervisor, Linda Hallett, glared at me and I knew it would probably be my last day.  I workded the entire day that Friday.  At 4:45pm, she called me into her office to terminate me, she put her hands on me and tried to make me sit down to offer me some ""resources"".  She fired me 10 years to my service month, knowing that not only did I lose my husband, but I lost my mother-in-law in December 2015, My cousin in March of 2016 and My father in law in July 2016.  My daughter was suicidal for the first 6 months after her father died and my 17 year old son did not speak about his father for almost 2 years.  She never gave me credit for the great accomplishments I did achieve in my 10 years with Mayo Clinic and, ironically, she retired 6 weeks after terminating my employment and to top it off...she made me ineligible for re-hire."
1286,Mayo Clinic,"Stay far, far, away if you value your license and your sanity",2019-03-24,1.0,Registered Nurse,"Some of the staff are amazing human beings

Some of the patients

The critical care physicians and ICU medical staff","Nursing administration is dumpster fire quality. They could care less about the patients and worry more about inner office politics and how they can make people quit so they do not have to fire them rather than the issues at hand.  The CNO seems to truly cares; however, the level below that position paints a rosy picture to make themselves look good so the CNO has no idea what is truly going on. 

Extremely short staffed all the time on purpose. The needs of the patient do not come first unless you’re wealthy. 

Inadequately trained nursing staff that struggle to make it through a shift because of poor training. The turnover is beyond abysmal. Look how many ICU openings there are all the time. Triple and quadrupled ICU patients at times. That is absolute madness! Not enough management for the number of employees either. 

A culture of bullying and blame/shame game with a “Mutual Respect” facade painted on top. 

Terrible time off. You are given a PTO bucket that is utilized for everything. Sick days, time off, cancellations, etc. 

You are told not to come to work sick but when you call in you’re given an occurrence. We work with sick people in high stress environments, people are going to get sick but we are penalized rather than nurtured.  

Zero pay incentive to succeed. No holiday pay, no certification pay, no preceptor pay. Zilch. Shut up and do what we say or you’re targeted as “a problem” employee. 

Lazy charge nurses are allowed to remain in charge. They sit at the nurses station and micromanage with clipboards never helping staff and do what they have to to look good. 

Extremely high staff turnover?!? Entire units turnover multiple times in one year. Entire units! 

Survey results no longer publicized to protect awful managers so they can make it into administration. You should see how many grievances are filed on nurse managers. It will blow your mind! They promote 20 somethings with minimal experience into management positions. Just because you have a masters doesn’t mean you’re management experience. 

Nurse managers that close their doors when it’s noisy on the unit rather than helping their staff out. They are too good for that now apparently. 

Patient safety issues. 

One could write a book about how awful this place is but it will not change a thing."

If you are not a local, be prepared to be treated unfairly as if you are an imbecile by locally planted employees  with less education , global experience, and career success  than yourself.  

As a minority with a graduate-level education from 2 top-tiered  (top 20) universities, I was shocked at the level of passive aggressiveness from the Sr. Managers. Most are from nursing backgrounds from local universities who received MBA in management management and have such a disdain towards outsiders it was unreal. Many of them are in locations in NW Rochester (Global Business Services), to the main campus where I saw several part-time GBS nurses transfer to and infect their brand of behavior.  

Not only this, based on conversation I have had with others who worked with mid-to-senior level leadership expressed similar situations.

I simply gave a two-week notice and left this organization for Minneapolis, MN. Mayo needs to work on their internal branding and behaviors of their long-term, well-seated, sense of entitlement local staff.

 These individuals I encountered worked for Global Business Services, Office of Access Management, Human Resources and a few other departments .

Be warned!! There are far too many excellent healthcare facilities that can equally attract and retain top-tiered minority talent without the backlash of the negative behaviors exhibited by the locals with little global experience/leadership. 

I would discourage any person of color with exposure to large global companies to re-think their choice in travelling to Rochester, MN."

This can be great for many people in many roles, but can make it an uphill battle for career-minded women to be recognized for your work. The organization is still rather centered around male doctors with stay-at-home-wives... i.e., gym childcare hours, appropriate benefits, lack of sufficient breast pumping rooms in work areas, and lack of formal maternity leave  support the men + stay-at-home-wives well, but start leaving working women feeling unsupported or valued. This is particularly true for women with non-traditional-female careers, such as research. Finally, several women I personally know have run into pure sexism with certain bosses. Sexist jokes about women always spending your hard-earned money that you're expected to laugh at, being told that it looks impossible to make it in research if you decide as a woman to have kids (though men can be parents just fine), and holding maternity leave personally against someone is ridiculous. Beyond that, it took years for HR to finally deal with a research PI who held lab meetings that somehow women are never invited to, took womens' names off of research papers they authored (typically without telling them) and assigned highly technically qualified women basic lab maintenance roles that men are magically exempt from.

Sometimes we need to treat each other better though (sorry, should be under cons!). I've been an employee, a patient, and multiple family members have been patients, I'd give us a 98%, of course someone has to mess with the statistics! Seriously though, the nurses are treated with respect, the pay for I/P is much higher than ambulatory, but the cut in pay to come to Mayo from Banner was soooo worth it, two totally different companies. Love my job and my department! Education for nurses is highly valued and encouraged, most of our team are either in school for BSN or NP, or see how much we have learned, so they will be starting school once the benefits for tuition reimbursement kicks in-yes, Mayo offers that, does not cover it all, but it certainly helps! There is a ton of opportunities for growth, to be on committees, and to learn from our peers.","Can get clicky, what do you expect when a field has the majority of female staff.
The management can be political, so one learns to watch their P's and Q's, our voice as nurses has been heard more in the past several years, so overall, depends on who you wind up with as your Supervisor and your OA. There is a reason why Mayo is often rated #1 hospital in many categories, we are EBP, which can frustrate newcomers since change can take time there. But I'd much rather that then just going with winging it!"

People generally have stayed in their positions for the job security and their coworkers. The pay is good for the area, but not nearly enough for the job being done and the high expectations placed on patient care employees.","politics, favoritism, micromanaging, budget cuts, scheduling, burnout

The obnoxious understaffing (on purpose) has caused even faster burnout on employees and with strict rules, everyone has quickly become unhappy. They say you get 10 sick days per year, but really you get corrective action beginning with 6. Any corrective action results in held pay increases, no tuition reimbursement for a year, and other big incentives. Minor corrective action receives the same penalties as a major one. There has become no incentive to stay with the company anymore. The scheduling used to work well for students (seeing that probably half of departments are students pursuing education or continuing education that's required) but doesn't anymore and has been increasingly frustrating. 
Many management positions have been given to people based on who they know not their credentials. This causes a lot of upset for people who have worked hard for their higher education and strong credentials but not given a position because someone has a connection to upper management."

The city is really built around Mayo and IBM and IBM is not thriving as it once did so their is a bit of a gloomy environment. Since much of the population is transient, there is clearly some areas that are not well cared for. The parking is horrendous and entry level employees have to bus in from off campus.

- Rochester, MN would not be what it is without the Mayo Clinic (#1 employer)

- This is a good place to start your career if you are from the local area.","- Minnesota nice (Passive Aggressiveness) reigns supreme at the Mayo Clinic's Rochester HQ.

- If you are an employee and a patient, you don't get treated like a pure patient. Cash in hand is key.

- ""Mayo is a transnational corporation"", not a non-profit.  Those words were spoken by the CIO in a 2015 department meeting, much to the surprise of the staff in attendance. Mayo is being converted into a corporation by C suite suits, where the bottom line is more important than anything else.

- Cronyism is rampant in certain IT/IS support areas. Talent/potential < Years of service/carrying water for management.

- If you don't drink the Kool-Aid, you will be benched. Mayo wants subservient employees, not free thinkers.

- Whistle blowers are targeted and persecuted. Regardless of what you are told in Orientation, do not blow the whistle until after you have everything documented. Even then, it's best to stay anonymous until after consulting a lawyer."

One positive is that you may have access to working with clinical data than working at an academic environment.,"Mayo is run by MDs so basically to get hired as a PhD ""professor"" (just a title no one really teaches anything) you have to fit in rather than be a robust scientist. As a result this place is littered with sub par PIs who have no clue how to manage their post docs / conduct quality research / or hold best interests for post docs. Why? Well because there is no tenure here so a post doc becomes a sponge that needs to be squeezed of all resources so that the PI can show progress to their supervisors. In academia a tenured professor doesn't have such pressures and as a result quality stands out whereas at Mayo they are under pressure to get grants and produce (regardless of quality) so post docs are sent on fishing expeditions to get some data on some preliminary study so that a grant can be written.

Plus there's no academic environment such as seminars or sharing of ideas. It's a very desolate environment if you're a PhD.

People talk about benefits a lot here but honestly as a post doc I can't even afford those benefits so it's terrible for that too.

Overall if you're a PhD stick with academia. This is no place to advance your career."

I suppose Mayo is generally selective with their applicants, so most of the time, you will get very bright, competent staff, ie, your management and co-workers. I have had a varied experience here. It really depends on the people, like any place. But overall, Mayo staff seem committed to quality work. My one complaint would be the office culture in certain places. Just certain things, not all. People can be unprofessional or treat their work as a social hangout. :\ I had a co-worker who complained and bad-mouthed the patients every two minutes, which is understandable sometimes, but, all the time? It's so bad for morale. The bulk of people are pretty polite and kind, though. They do their job sufficiently enough. The doctors really care about their patients.

I'm supposed to write 20 words, hopefully this is now enough...","PAs, as well as ARNPs, are expected to know as much as the Physicians, however are treated like we are the bottom of the totem pole. So we are good enough to do the seeing of their patients, assess, diagnose, treat, etc etc, but then when it comes to doing all the scut work, that is also our job. We are not treated with the appropriate amount of respect when it comes to anything, other than being trusted to (depended on to) do all of the patient care. But then when a patient needs to be called for a simple message (secretary or MA task), your patients vitals need to be taken (an MA task), something needs to be faxed (secretary task), a form needs to be entered in the computer (MA, CNA, or secretary task): the PA or NP is also supposed to do also do all of that. So basically, mayo sees all ""APP's"" (as they like to call us) as first year residents who the Physicians can unload all of their work on to, as well as can be used for clerical and any other task that needs doing. If you are a PA or an ARNP and are thinking of joining Mayo, keep in mind you will have no ancillary staff to help you, as is the case in the rest of the non-Mayo world. You are the ancillary staff, in addition to being expected to keep a full calendar of patients. Get ready for zero respect from the physicians. If you happen to go in to a surgical subspecialty, you will be delighted to see that between getting to the hospital at 6 am to ""pre-round"" on all of the surgeons patients before he/she gets there (read: pretty much do everything for the surgeon while he/she is either sleeping or in the ""consultants only"" lounge, rounding, getting to the OR before the surgeon, doing the assisting in the case, helping at the end of the case, prepping for the next case (it is now 2:00pm), you are not allowed in the surgeons lounge. The surgeon, and whatever other consultant who may chose to also accompany him or her, is free to grab whatever free snack and water or juice and watch some TV while you hold your pee and prep for the next case. Eating? Resting? Going to the bathroom? You haven't earned those privileges as an APP at Mayo. Oh, and by the way, you can create all the revenue you'd like with your full schedule, charging almost the same as the physician does and getting paid a quarter of that, but you are also not allowed to park in the garage. So you, Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner, can park out in Timbuktoo in the middle of whatever weather elements there may be and walk about a quarter of a mile a day to get to work while the physicians park in their designated spots in the garage, and get there after you do and you've seen their first patient."

Research infrastructure is cumbersome, lots of red tape and slow activation process for clinical trials, plus cost of trials run at Mayo very high which limits interest of study sponsors in selecting us to run studies.

This hospital has a poor reputation in the community and assuming the Mayo name hasn't changed that. The culture needs improvement; staff seem miserable since Mayo took over.

Average RN pay is very low compared to the rest of the state. 

Benefits are dwindling. In fact, Mayo powers that be voted and now this is the only Mayo facility where you will not receive a pension creating even less incentive to work there.

Also the PTO program is ridiculous and seems to penalize any absence and favors presenteeism at all costs.

Workers do not have a vision plan available to them along with their health care insurance like most other hospitals offer. 


This facility does not seem to operate under the Mayo model of care like you might find in larger facilities. The building is old. The model of care is archaic. 

There is very poor management especially in the Nursing department. Communication between staff and management seems to be very poor in the worker's input doesn't matter.
 
Staffing level is often unsafe. Management has no regard for this and no contingency plan for short staffing. This place cannot retain staff. There is little room for advancement."

- Stable employment. As long as you meet the minimum requirements for you position your job is safe. The bar for success is surprisingly low. In 18 years I have never seen anyone let go.
- The pay is competitive for the area, and the benefits are still OK.","- The IT department as a whole is poorly organized and very inefficient. Efforts to improve this are ongoing, but implementations of those improvements are extremely slow. 
- The leadership model is strange for IT. Mayo is a physician led organization, and the values of the company are very patient focused, as they should be. These values tend to cross over into IT and while there are many smart and dynamic IT leaders, they tend to be less technology focused. Most lead programmers I know were never really programmers, and are more project manager types. As result there is a lack of real technical leadership at Mayo. Depending on your perspective this is not always a bad thing. It is easier to get your way when your boss doesn't understand the technical details of what you are doing. 
- Over the 18 years I have been here they have whittled the benefits away at a pretty constant rate. The compensation is still competitive with other employers in the area, but it is just another signal of the change in how Mayo values it's employees."

But you get the other major holidays off to spend with your family. If you can't accept that type of schedule then you shouldn't work for a hospital.

A pro is the pay. They employ about a thousand mid-levels (NP/PA's) at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.

You work in a specialized service and the medical residents and Fellows do the diagnosing, prescribing and everything else; you will practice well below your training.
2.  I was in orthopedic surgical services and as the Certified Nurse Practitioner a registered nurse, surgical assistant, medical assistant or secretary could all do my job. 
3. You have to live in Rochester, MN, and there is nothing here. Rochester's population is about 110,000 people. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester employs 36,000 people. The city government, hotels, shops and restaurants all survive on hand-me-downs from the Mayo Clinic.  There is no diversity, culture or competition and the Mayo loves it that way."

Also, some upper managers or physicians are arrogant, and if you are paid hourly (allied-health staff) be prepared to pick up the slack of overpaid salaried coworkers so they can use the workout center during work hours.

2070,Mayo Clinic,Administrative Assistants @ Mayo Clinic,2015-02-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Mayo Clinic has Administrative Assistants; there are no perks to being an Administrative Assistant other than for those who are trying to enter Mayo Clinic as an employee - this is the way to get your foot in the door.,"Mayo Clinic has been reevaluating a lot of job classes stemming from the Sirota Survey responses.  But the only job class/category not being reevaluated is secretarial positions.  The last change made to this job category was back in 2004 (11 years ago in March) and only a title change was made from Administrative Secretary to Administrative Assistant.  The pay range was not adjusted to reflect this change as is the case with numerous other job title changes at Mayo Clinic.  

Part of the new Mayo Clinic culture is to invest in Talent as part of their Strategic Plan.  So why does Mayo Clinic not invest in the talent they already have on staff or by hiring those with specific vocational degrees and job experience instead of investing in someone with no work experience and a non-related degrees (i.e., Biblical Theology, Psychology, etc.) to perform Administrative Assistant work?  That’s the million dollar question.  Mayo Clinic sees talent as having a Bachelor's Degree and no experience and you don't even need to know how to spell or use proper grammar.  

There are employees at Mayo Clinic who are currently doing secretarial work who have had their job title and job description changed along with a salary range increase but are still performing secretarial work.  For example, two women could be sitting in the same office performing the same job duties but, because one has a bachelor’s degree, is paid more.  To get around the federal rules the minimum qualifications are changed and/or the job description. However, a job description change does not necessarily mean that is what is being done in that job.  When employees witness such action, it is demoralizing to those who are working in the same capacity but are paid significantly less.  

A lot of other job classes requiring Associate Degrees and/or Diplomas offer different steps that employees can move through in their positions; e.g., Research Protocol Specialist I, II, II & Senior, etc. For those of us who choose this as a career and have 10, 15, 20-30 years of experience in this field, we are not considered “talented” enough to be given opportunities unless we have a Bachelor’s Degree.

Unfortunately, for those of us who have vocational degrees/diplomas, we are not allowed to advance in our field of choice because Mayo Clinic is oppressing those of us who love this work and choose to do this work as a career choice.  For those of us who speak up, we are basically banished from ever going further in this field.  After dedicating many years of your life to Mayo Clinic as an Administrative Assistant you will eventually be capped at the top of the pay range.  At this point you will only receive the pay range increase and nothing extra.  Mayo Clinic used to give our Merit Increases to those who were at this point, but this has been done away with for the secretarial field.  All other fields get their Merit Increases by being able to advance to different levels within their job fields and by job titles being changed to make accommodations for exclusive employees to continue receiving pay increases.  In 2015, the pay range across the board increased 2% so that means those at the top of the pay range only receive a 2% increase.  Now that’s investing in your talent and investing in staff who give 1/2 their lives to an organization."

2110,Mayo Clinic,Proud to work for Mayo,2014-10-07,5.0,Medical Transcriptionist,"I have been at Mayo Clinic since the early 2000s, and it's the only major institution I've worked in, though I have had other part time positions elsewhere. I didn't realize how good I had it for the first few years until I started to realize how hard it is to get in to a company like this, especially in economic hard times. I now work in a teleworking position and actually live out of state, even though I started out on the Rochester campus downtown. Working from home has improved my job satisfaction immensely, even though there are sometimes technical difficulties, being able to avoid commuting and having to buy work clothes makes up for the periodic inconvenience. Mayo does take good care of their employees; though, just like any large company, some work units have better supervisors and policies than other. Overall, though, they try to keep things fair in terms of compensation and hours, including systematic raises and pay ranges.","There are often ""hiring freezes"" in which, in order to save money, when someone leaves, they are not replaced except for in rare circumstances. Our work unit has experienced this several times now, and the work continues to be redistributed, sometimes stretching people beyond their limits, even if temporarily. The past few years, there have been a lot of campaigns to ""work differently,"" meaning finding ways to work more efficiently and using less resources, waste, etc. It has made a big difference in a positive way in many areas; and, in the current job market, many of us who are still working, we are grateful to have a job with good benefits--however, some of the uncertainty is a little unsettling for some work groups who are always wondering if they will be next on the chopping block. For the most part, however, if a team is eliminated, those folks get first priority in placement in other departments."

2116,Mayo Clinic,I worked at Mayo for 5 years in their IT department.  It's a mess!,2014-09-12,2.0,IT SYSTEMS ARCHITECT I,"Mayo has a great reputation overall.  They utilize cutting edge technology that enhances patient care, but things move VERY slowly.  They still have/had pension benefits.  Overall acceptable benefit package - although decreasing each year.","Management has been there so long, they have forgotten how to operate 'outside of the box' and used to doing things the same way.  It's all they know.  They tend to micro manage - so if you are a free thinker - probably not the place for you.  A still current employee (who has been with Mayo for 20+ years) once explained to me that as long as you 'move with the herd, you'll be fine'.  If you cannot - the herd will find a way to 'push you off the cliff'.  
HR is there strictly for management, not for YOU.  Don't be deceived."

2118,Mayo Clinic,Moving on to better places,2014-09-07,3.0,RN (Masters Degree)Staff Nurse,Good benefits at the present yet benefits are consistently being cut back little by little.  The health care system does have many specialties in which staff may choose although getting assigned an interview is difficult due to the HR department.,"The corporation has become very arrogant over the years. The staff are no longer important in the grand scheme of things only the patients are. This has caused resentment and distrust in the corporation. Staff do not feel there is any loyalty by management or the from the company as a whole. The attendance policy is not conducive to staff who work in a healthcare setting thus being prone to catching illnesses. Nurses work various shifts and are severely punished if  sick, late or accidentally miss at shift. Past work attendance or work ethic does not matter if a staff member is written up for inadvertently breaking the attendance policy."
2119,Mayo Clinic,Don't care about Autism!!!,2014-09-03,1.0,,It's a job that pays well. Don't expect employees to work too hard.,Insurance does not cover therapy for autistic children even though we live in WI and WI requires employers to cover ABA Therapy. Mayo is large enough they can get away without having to do it. Very disappointing for a medical organization!!
2120,Mayo Clinic,Decent opportunities but leadership needs more training.,2014-08-29,3.0,Senior research technologist I,"There is a lot of good work being done here with many talented individuals in departments across the country.  The benefits are really quite good, and Rochester is a nice place to raise a family.  Tons of different research and clinical labs here too, so lots of options to pick from.","Training!  The major downfall of this company is that their values stress that ""the patient comes first"", but that's not the culture.  The culture is that the doctor comes first, which usually means that they have little to no experience or training in managerial skills.  A PhD or MD can have a lab, but that doesn't mean it will be run well.  To some extent this is likely true around the world, but Mayo doesn't even attempt to improve the managerial skills of their top workforce members.  However, if there are issues, HR is pretty good at handling them effectively."

Mayo subsidizes public transportation (including coach buses), which allows long-distance commuters to defray travel costs.
Employees have access to world-class doctors and treatments for their own medical care.","As the ""Bastion of Conservatism"", dress codes are too rigid and out of date, especially for areas with zero patient contact.

2132,Mayo Clinic,Great place to work!,2014-08-04,4.0,IT Systems Administrative,"The best thing about Mayo is that everyone(well, almost everyone) really does realize that the needs of our patients come first, regardless of what time of the night or weekend it is. 

That being said, working at Mayo in IT is mostly an 8-5 job. The reason for this is that there is not enough parking downtown, so at 5:00 pm there is a max exodus of employees trying to catch their bus ride home. There is an on-call rotation, however, so  I can be paged in the middle of the night if a system has a problem. 

Management is good, and I happen to work right now for an exceptional manager. 

Salary and benefits are excellent, even though old timers grumble about the ""good old days"" where healthcare premiums were covered free of charge.","IT at Mayo is what I would charitably call ""mass controlled chaos"". Doctors have a lot of power at Mayo, so in the past, if a doctor wanted a pet project, she usually got it. Regardless of whether it required special databases, middleware, etc. 

Because of this, Mayo is rife with one-off applications, environments and technologies all over the place. Until recently, it was a free-for-all where almost anything goes. 

Finally, Mayo brought in a new CIO who is working towards streamlining IT and attempting to introduce standardization. It's a slow process, but we have seen some positive changes already. Still lots of work to do in this area. 

Work/life balance is very good, but Mayo is a bit conservative, so there is not the flexibility like there is at other companies like IBM. You're pretty much expected to be in the office from 8-5. 

Parking in downtown Rochester is abysmal for Mayo employees. I think the current waiting list for a parking spot is about 12 years. Most employees park at ""Park & Rides"" and take the bus into downtown."

It takes several weeks after you have accepted the offer before you can join because HR takes a long time with their internal process.
You will be required to take tests (TB etc...) and vaccinations. You have to fill out a form listing your entire vaccination history --who has that kind of information? Note this is for research staff--I'm a mathematician--I don't deal with patients.
There is a dress code--I can understand this for patient-facing physicians but for a mathematician doing research!!! This is 2014 and they expect their researchers to come to work in a suit!!
Food at the food court (yes like in a mall) is appallingly bad. I understand that this is the middle-of-nowhere- midwest but still Mayo could have made an effort.

2184,Mayo Clinic,Safe and Ethical without Risk; but without Challenge Also,2014-03-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company is the ultimate ethical company.  Treats employees well but offering basically lifetime employment unless you do something stupid.  That said, it also draws people who want the welfare experience.  Pay is at best average and therefore you draw average talent.  A rich history of quality medical practices and outcomes which has build the brand.","Even though the brand is strong for the right reasons, those from the business side of things will not find a challenge here.  Decisions are made by committee on everything!  The loudest voice often gets its way in those environment, or decisions don't get made and the solution is very watered down/ineffective.  No one is willing to take a stand on anything and most everyone is risk adverse; doing time to collect a pension.  There is almost no understanding about financials in decision making.  Why?  Because a long time ago, the Mayo Brothers made Doctors the ultimate leaders.  This has its benefits when it comes to overall medical decisions and direction but when it comes to competing in other non-medical arenas that the Clinic participates in, these part-time leaders frankly are not qualified to lead."

Compensation is mediocre compared to other top institutions nationally, though cost of living is low. While possible, promotions need to be aggressively sought after as committee after committee needs to approve them.","Work life balance is fantastic and leadership is strong and transparent. In an age of quickly changing healthcare and basic medical research, Mayo Clinic is determined to help define the future, not follow.

If you are from a big city you will likely feel Rochester is too small, antiquated, and unfortunately just far enough away from the Twin Cities to be frustrating. The city is the biggest downside to working at Mayo Clinic from this perspective. This extends to significant others, who, if they do not work in the healthcare field will likely find other employment opportunities lacking."

The pay is great too.",Some people have only worked for Mayo Clinic and don't know how good they have it and will complain about changes or little things that can be frustrating about every job. If you've worked anywhere else though you'll learn to just ignore the whining and continue to love how good you've got it. I think the worst thing about the entire company is trying to find parking.

That is flat out false.  Maybe 20 years ago that was true, but no longer.  Unfortunately it is clear that the management and leadership have no business being managers or leaders for such a large company.  They follow the ""treat everyone the same"" mentality which, in turn, creates a culture of mediocrity.  You can work three times as hard as the next person, but your compensation will be the same.

Employees positions were cut or moved to Eau Claire, where employees were forced to either drive the extra 50 miles, take another position in Barron if one worked for them, or resign all together.

Not too long ago that intellect and zeal were almost palpable in what could more-or-less be called the crown jewel of the city of Rochester.  I was honored to continue these traditions through my work and dedication at a place in aesthetics, aptitude, and psyche was an example for the medical community. 

Mayo Clinic offers excellent compensation for your time and very competitive benefits.  Its one of the few places I have worked at that still offers a pension, affordable medical insurance, several weeks of vacation upon starting, and decent lateral movement should you want to do so.  

Mayo once offered a foundation by which you could make life long plans and aspirations.","So what happened?

Mayo Clinic for the last few decades has continuously degraded by mediocrity, preferential treatment, poor implementation, ghost riding, and lack of vision. Mayo has been riding on the ghosts of its accomplished past.

A career at Mayo Clinic is an enigmatic one.  On one side of the coin you will be enthralled to work with able minded people who are not only skillful in the craft of science but who legitimately have passion for patient centered research and care.  I have had the pleasure of seeing people with drive who have worked from the ground up from a simple technician to become an administrator or even Ph. D, as I am currently working on.  The other side of the coin includes select consultants, senior/middle management, and even mid/low level scientists seem to think that once you get your “Golden Ticket” to Mayo you simply put your heart and mind into neutral and coast to maintain the status quo.  There are many wallflowers that only care about the bottom line: their paycheck or personal status.

While Mayo Clinic fosters brilliant and effective minds, there are just as many if not more that are busy waiving their “Golden Tickets.”  My time has been plagued with a few pampered consultants who verbally and psychologically abuse you, entitled management who are woefully under-equipped in wisdom/aptitude, and salaried/hourly technologists who get away with harassment or being paid for flat out not contributing.  You may as well not report incidences like these, since at any rung of the aforementioned nothing will change.  Rocking the boat puts you at risk for retaliation, ridicule, being overlooked for a promotion, etc.

The current status of Mayo Clinic would be as one of my colleagues put it, “…we have too many chiefs and not enough Indians.”  When you answer to many people, some of who may be inept or incommunicado with their own contemporaries, avoidable mistakes are made, inefficiencies continue to build, decisions that may be completely dangerous to patient care are created, and the overall mission of Mayo Clinic, “…the needs of the patient come first,” continue to diminish.  At the end of the day the blame is usually assigned to the easiest target or those too meek to defend themselves.

Mayo’s initial answer to the economic environment in 2008 was lethargic.  Excessive spending on parties, other frivolity, and business as usual continued.  Fast forward to 2013 and Mayo is virtually in a panic over cost control due to being overextended at the cost of morale of its employees and patients.  Benefits large and small continue to shrink or have disappeared completely.  Forward thinking and preparing for fiscal pumps in the road, not banking on changes in philanthropic donations, having MML be fiercely competitive with other health systems, ceasing kingdom building projects, etc. were not a part of the equation until lately.  

Mayo is finally starting to take the punch bowl from its own party.  The problem is that while Mayo has been partying for the last 20 years the competition has become a lot smarter and leaner, where Mayo has become slow due to its own convoluted bureaucracy and over indulgence.  The withdrawals are very hard everyone especially for those that actually work very hard, since those perks were the things keeping the talent here. 

In the years I have been here I have seen magnificent individuals of all levels of employment be crushed by the current of “Mother Mayo’s” will.  When your lifestyle depends on who writes your paycheck, you always see the zombie like following of Mayo either too scared, too indoctrinated, or too burnt out to care to resist the crumbling paradigm that is the psyche of Mayo Clinic."

A position that encourages very little creativity or ingenuity. There is only one way to solve every problem and that is the Mayo way.,Office politics is over the top! HR only protects incompetent mangers with complete disregards of patients and employees. The Peterson principal is in full display in every layer of management! Turn over in some departments is 98% per year. Several patient scandals have occurred as a result of lack of trust and openness among staff. There is always retaliation for speaking out! Thinking out side of the box is ostracized and will lead to termination.
2272,Mayo Clinic,Retired Nurse after 25 years at Mayo Clinic,2012-12-04,1.0,Staff Nurse,"Working at Mayo Clinic provided me with a large variety of experiences with  many different kinds of patients and rare disease processes. I also learned the differences in working with consultants, residents and fellows, a teaching hospital. Good benefits, nice workout facility.  I saw Mayo Clinic change dramatically. There was a huge difference when the Sisters of St. Francis were managing the hospital, they made sure the patient's always got excellent care including the details. The hospital has teams for starting IV's, putting in urinary catheters and drawing labs, as a nurse you can call a team to take care of those things for you.  Excellent consultants if you are lucky enough to see them. All of their facilities are very clean and well organized.","Small but critical things fall through the cracks. Inexperienced Residents are not closely supervised  by the consultants. I have experienced this both as a staff member and as a patient. Medications errors by the MD, and when followed up on are brushed under the rug. Discharge summaries that state that the patient is being discharged with home health or hospice care and the discharge planner or MD have not even consulted with the agency, they just tell the patient to call someone when they get home. Patients feel ""pushed out the door"". They have discharge planning nurses that have never even seen the patient and are making referrals. The clinic is focused on checklists and procedural guidelines that are written by nurses who have not worked with patients for over 20 years. They actually have a committee on committee's, lots of wasted time and money with administration and time and money taken away from quality patient care. I was so proud to work for Mayo....it is sad to see the lack of attention to details. I spent 75% of my time as a staff nurse charting and 25% of my time doing patient care."

2279,Mayo Clinic,Fantastic employer,2012-09-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Fantastic work life balance. An institutions with a mission and core values you can feel proud of. The commitment to the staff is amazing.,Mayo does not provide financial incentives for job well done. The same raise calculation is used regardless of performance.
2280,Mayo Clinic,Would the Mayo Brothers be disappointed?  Probably.,2012-09-15,2.0,Senior Researcher,"Mayo Clinic has many great things going for it.  You have the opportunity to work with some world class minds and equipment.  Making lateral movements within the foundation is a viable option even if it takes some time.  The compensation is geared to keep people for the long term, the benefits are reasonable (provided you receive treatment at a Mayo facility), and the fact you are associated with the Clinic in general allows many perks with insurance, discounts, etc.

On paper the mission statement that drives the direction of the Clinic ""...the needs of the patient come first..."" sounds wonderful.  The ""Three Shields"" concept is motivating: Practice, Education, & Research.  There are many people that are intelligent, driven, and truly do care about the direction of the medical field to enhance patient care, satisfaction, and experience.  When you find those people, hold onto them, as they are your true resource to experience the vision that the founding Mayo Brothers had.

While the location of Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, itself is a little boring, it has the feel of a small town with some of the conveniences of a large city, which isn't such a bad thing if you have a family.","Mayo Clinic is a bureaucratic hell.  There is enough unnecessary red tape to suffocate any and every respirating organism on the planet.  At times getting access to equipment, funding, and personnel for clinical research can be a struggle, whereas another colleague can request the same thing and literally have it almost instantaneously.  Mayo Clinic is very much a who you know community rampant with nepotism, favoritism, and other inequities.

The ""Mayo Mantra"" is to speak up when you as an employee have comments, questions, or concerns.  This can be to your detriment given the aforementioned, and I speak of this in a completely neutral fashion.  You don't have to be forceful, rude, or considered a ""problem"" to be the recipient of severe backlash should your viewpoints contradict a member of management's or a consultant's (doctor's) opinion.  Suggesting something, even altruistically, can come back to bite you the higher up you go in the Foundation's food-chain.

Despite encountering intelligent, driven, and compassionate individuals for every one of them there are 20 who care nothing of innovation.  People with whom I have spoken with that have been with the Clinic for decades and from my own experiences have shown there are plenty of hourly, salaried, and management staff members who care nothing more than to maintain the status quo and their paycheck.  Some individuals get away with terrorizing other employees or flat out not working regardless of how many times they are reported.  This has been observed in lower to mid level management as well.  Mediocrity can be a problem, and from what I have seen these are the people that get promoted.

The management system is stifling, where they have more say or pull than the scientists and consultants for whom the patients actually come to see for care.  Having multiple people with whom you report to often leads to contradiction to the point where you spend more time finding out how to navigate around these confutations to finally get to producing something valuable to the Clinic.  Do they have meetings to schedule meetings more than they should?  You bet.  Management of my department has admitted to having hour long discussions of words like ""tardy.""  Really?  Webster could define that in moments.  We use the private donation and visiting patient's money for that?  More often than not people that aren't even remotely your equivalent in experience or education level will be in charge of you, who will request you to do something that is either completely wrong or in some instances dangerous.  During your time in research you may find yourself continuously baffled as to why people that would be perfect candidates for these positions tell you that they applied for ""that job"" only to be turned down many times.

Mayo reacts like an overactive immune response to problems that could be solved with simply firing a issue employee.  Example: if one employee is constantly leaving early and reporting they are staying much later Mayo remedies this by punishing everyone to a new time keeping system.  What was once a flexible and amicably maintained perk in the interest of the patient and Clinic has now become almost completely inflexible.

Mayo Clinic as a whole is in some respects still living in the past and riding on its name too much.  The world is changing and Mayo's competition is growing in aptitude at a better price point.  ""Mother Mayo"" seems to think she is the entire cosmos when in reality she is still a microcosm."

Mayo used to be a pretty good workplace, unfortunately it's been changing for the worse since the early 00's.  The workload is increasing exponentially, and the hiring doesn't follow.  Useless training, procedural steps and policies are constantly piling up, without improving workflow or productivity (think of the movie ""Office Space"").   Good employees are getting completely demotivated and burned out, lazy employees know they can get away with doing hardly any work , since Mayo never fires for poor performance.  A supervisor once told me with a straight face that some employees in her unit were trained only for the easier duties only because they couldn't handle the complexity of the task / the workload / the stress.  It  would imply that more capable and smarter co-workers were expected to pick up the slack..... for the same pay.  I finally realized things were not likely to improve, even if I transfered  to another unit (I am not saying that there are absolutely no well-managed work units at Mayo, but they are excessively rare).

Tuition reimbursement is one of the best in the Nation for an employer! Amazing Gym for staff at a very reasonable price. As a nurse, I've worked elsewhere and I must give credit where it deserves credit. There is good open communication between nurses and ""residents"" but zero with the consultants. Consultants here are the Staff doctors, and most of them 98% walk with their noses up in the air never acknowledging the nurses who care for their patients.

A very bureaucratic management and advancement opportunities for nurses are limited. It certainly is about who you know and how well you've gotten along with your nurse manager to move up the ladder. If you've never worked anywhere else but Mayo you will not feel competent to work anywhere else after working here. Nurses don't start IV, or even put foley cathers in! They have a ""team"" for all of this. At first this may seem nice for you that you don't have to worry about doing this, but when you need an IV STAT, good luck! They give you less patients to care fore than other hospitals, but you will be doing a lot more than your nursing role to make up for that. Nurses here change linens, bathe your patients in a shower not just in bed, feed your patients and do your strict I&O, and sometimes get paid to sit in a combative patient's room as a one to one, because they don't have patient sitters here. Oh and to top it off, you'll also be a social worker calling Nursing homes to hold patient's bed and arrange home health Oxygen and so forth. Basically, they call this ""Primary Nursing."" I would have to say the ultimate con in this workplace is the lack of diversity and way too much back stabbing and triangulation. If you are not from the Midwest, don't ever move here!
