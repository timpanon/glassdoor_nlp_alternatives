0,Medtronic,New “Leadership” seems determined to destroy the company,2022-04-09,3.0,Quality Specialist,"Pay is good at enterprise level/depending on group/division you’re in.
Working for a company with a great reputation.
People managers are awesome depending on the group/department.","Benefits are going downhill. The latest prescription plan with CVS is terrible. Many employees are now battling to get (in some cases life-saving)  prescriptions  covered that were previously covered, no problem. Completely unacceptable for a company that is supposed to be in the business of world class health care and devices!
The new(er) CEO (Martha) is either legitimately a fake woke tool or is just talking the talk to appease the fringe. Either way, it has helped spawn the bloated DIE division that amounts to being obsessively focused on people’s physical characteristics and sexuality (how is this professional?) and wasting employee time and Medtronic dollars."

As others have said here, bullies remain in positions of power, even after multiple reports to management and HR.
2. Horribly incompetent senior leaders that make one short-sighted decision after another, which results in constantly-shifting priorities. Meanwhile, the folks on the ground have to change gears every few months to follow a new strategy and still have to clean up the resulting messes from prior bad decisions.
3. Benefits are decent, but monetary compensation is awful, especially when folks work overtime so often.
4. Senior leaders attempt to solve problems by just throwing more money or low-quality contractors at them, instead of getting to the root issues. This only creates more problems down the road for the full-time employees."

A lot of locations throughout the US and Globally and great network potential. Great company name.,"Not a lot of career development. A lot of training is exclusive to only top performers and recommendations from senior management which cultivates a toxic culture of competition and back stabbing from team members. A lot of favoritism from senior leadership, usually to those who are friendly but don’t do work which again reenforces a culture of toxicity. When there’s conflict or issues with coworkers, as a result of the toxic environment, management does nothing to resolve it. There’s also a lack of training from management and a culture of, “let’s throw them into this problem and see how they figure it out,” type of mentality.

2. Most of the top talent are leaving at a fast rate or have already left.
3. HR is useless. Escalation, complaints for repeated harassment from other employees, coming from multiple employees are not taken seriously at all. In fact such perpetrators are promoted. Quite a few harassers/bullies who will never get fired.
4. Talk of innovation, technical details is less and inconsequential details like following templates, unnecessary endless meetings discussing logistics is more. Procedures,SOPs are the worst, they inhibit good work, no one can comprehend the guidance properly.
5. Leadership is terrible overall, excluding certain few managers/directors. You are very very lucky if you have a decent boss.

A bit toxic if you ask me, and discourages employees from applying to roles they're interested in. Also, the work-from-home policies they have been having is nonsense. No body on my team wants to go back into the office, and yet upper management is insisting on returning. Also, the CEO keeps saying that everyone is asking him when they can return to the office. I'm not sure who is asking that. Furthermore, the promotion process is kind of dumb as well. Managers are hesitant to fight for their employees and act in a way to please their superiors.

276,Medtronic,Don't make the mistake I did,2022-02-03,1.0,Event Operations Coordinator,The only good thing is that it made me realize that life's too short to stick with such work environments,"The events team is run like a kindergarten. Managers treat their employees like children who should not speak up, have their own brains and think. Well, while employees are encouraged to put forward ideas, managers already have precoinceived ideas so your ideas have to match theirs. Team members are required to send rewards to each other and no rewards received means low annual review. Managers like to employ people straight from uni or changing careers as only those will work hard for the peanuts that are being offered and can be easily micromanaged. Office management as well as other corporate teams treat employees like a nuisance and a piece of excrement. Everything you'd need as an employee is very hard to get, starting from day one when nothing is ready for you and it seems as if you're the first new starter ever. HR team is making employees' lives miserable and it is impossible to get anything done by them, while it is also impossible to escalate any issues with them. Local management promotes rude, passive-agressive and toxic behaviour and if you're not like that, you're out. Higher Medtronic management is detached from the lower tiers and live in a completely different dimension with no insights as to what happens to regular employees. Lastly and sadly, most of the positions in the Prague office are very poorly paid, benefits are only ordinary and there are virtually no career opportunities."

On tope of that, there are many opportunities within the company for movement and they help map out your career. My boss has been the most supportive boss I ever had.

443,Medtronic,Worst place imaginable,2021-12-18,1.0,Manufacturing Supervisor,I have nothing good to say,"Medtronic is a horrible place to work. They reward and promote incompetence and promote the good old boys club. The managers are some of the worst I have ever seen in my life. I can speak on this with good authority after many years of working with high level officers while in the military. 

Medtronic is known to have poor employment practices and their HR and labor relations is a joke. I was terminated with zero write ups, an above average review, was not even approached to discuss the allegations for something I didn’t do. I never had even one write up in 20 years of employment prior to this, so that goes to tell you how bad Medtronic it is.

The person I replaced was fired for being in the hospital - they called it no call no show! They do not care or respect the American with disabilities act, veterans, or people with medical conditions. They don’t care if you inform them they are violating federal laws because they will not settle out of court and when filing a lawsuit it is still difficult to succeed. I was represented by a very experienced employment attorney and she has had many lawsuits involving Medtronic. In all my previous employers I never even heard of an employment lawsuit but I knew of several immediately after being hired at Medtronic. 

It is no surprise why they do not attract the best talent. If you want to be underpaid and work for clowns, then it might be for you. 

I ended up getting a much better position afterward making much more money. Do not waste your time or damage your career by working for Medtronic. 

And if you’re an hourly employee you are treated as a number and there is little change of upward mobility. 

Avoid at all costs! Hopefully I helped a least one person with this review and cost Medtronic some money, I wish them nothing but the worst."

They didn't care about their teams, only about how they looked and how they could get ahead.
Rewards and punishments are handed out arbitrarily. When asked, managers refused to explain their reasoning for decisions.
Our team was told never to escalate issues to the manager or come to them with questions. When we brought up issues with how things were managed we were told to shut up or go work somewhere else, which several people then did.
The company loves to say how much their care about their employees while laying them off by the dozens. Most people I spoke with believed they could be let go at any time for no reason.
Getting ahead in this company means appearing successful and hardworking even when it's evident people are not. It doesn't matter how good you are at your job, that is never taken into consideration."

- Poor HR department (not the people just the way it's structured). It's difficult to get in contact with an actual person and even people in the HR department had trouble finding my representative.
- Funding is distributed poorly so some departments are overfunded while the departments that needed it are severely underfunded. That makes training/advancing your career difficult and salaries can be far below value depending on where you work.
- Upper management can be a bit oblivious to unhealthy behaviors and people get promoted simply because of the time they've been there, not because they possess the skills and emotional maturity to do the job. You have to be cautious when interviewing to make sure your manager is prepared for that position."

In general nice people working there. Especially on the non-manager level.

A good work place if you are someone who likes to just do your job without ever questioning anything.","Overall poor low level leadership. Most of the line managers are more of team leaders with no actual authority or power to impact. Probably got their positions thanks to their willingness to keep employee complaints from reaching higher level management. Usually a former team member with no prior management experience. 

It seems as the low level line managers really are team leaders given their roles to act as a punching bag both from top level management and employees. No authority to take any important decisions. 

Line manager are eager to throw their direct reports under the bus if needed. They will definitely not work for the employees best interest in mind.

Working at Medtronic is like going back to kindergarten as managers will instruct you as if you were a three year old.

Whatever you do, do not try to improve a process because it will be perceived as criticism which is not taken lightly. Any type of criticism will be badly received and can result in the employee being fired or just bullied into quitting.

Back orders and delivery problems are a constant issue but employees are instructed to lie to customers.

Not a place for critical thinkers or progressive people."

2109,Medtronic,Very Toxic Culture,2020-09-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Looks good on your resume - has a good internship program. Would say this is a good place to start your career.,"The culture at Medtronic (specifically Diabetes division in Northridge, CA) is very toxic. There is high turnover for most departments and the roles are typically replaced with contractors. Many of the middle management care nothing about the employees and will throw you under the bus. People are constantly going out on leave and not coming back. The burnout and stress is real. I have literal nightmares about working here. It has a good old boys club culture. Avoid at all costs. 

I have worked at Medtronic for over 8 years and have had many managers during that time. They have gotten progressively worse as time has gone on. Management tends to bring in their friends from former companies rather than promoting within or converting contractors to FTE roles. Upper management is constantly changing which is part of the problem. There is constant restructuring. 

There is little recognition for working nights and weekends which is expected for most people. Managers make promises on promotions and don't deliver, even after you pull miracles. Complaints to HR about unethical and toxic culture go unheard. 

I was promoted into a management role and given zero training despite having no experience. I had a manager above me who was a toxic micromanager. This manager made the entire team miserable. The manager was sexist and told me on several occasions that team members should choose between their career and their families. Again, complaints to HR did nothing to resolve this. That manager is still there today making the whole team miserable. Complaining equates to causing drama. 

If you are looking for any type of work/life balance, do not work for Medtronic Diabetes. They will not deliver. 

The benefits get worse each year. They never give good raises and 401(k) match is never what you are led to believe. The goals for the year become more and more ridiculous and unachievable each year. 

The company throws more work at you each year as they progressively add new projects to your plate. There is no extra benefit, just more work. I have witnessed many people miss deadlines and get yelled at. Most of the time deadlines are missed because of poor project planning. This delays the employees at the end of the process and these poor people are often not given extensions on their timelines."
2110,Medtronic,Temp,2020-09-14,2.0,Assembler I,Pay is above average for this type of job.,The company cheats you out of hours worked.

Great compensation, benefits, work-life balance opportunities and with a visionary new CEO at the helm.",Extremely matrixed legacy organization which created an atmosphere of 4 distinct companies in one and with competing priorities among them which often makes getting work among them quite difficult. Change to introduce new approaches does not come easy at Medtronic for this reason. The upcoming corporate restructuring announced recently will be among the largest in Medtronic's history and is likely to have layoff casualties as a result. Career advancement is also difficult and will be less likely with the major restructuring ahead Medtronic is a good proving ground to launch a career and which helps with taking talents elsewhere if needed and which many have done.

But it happens to operate in the highly competitive, complex, and ever changing world of healthcare and med device. So, yes, people are driven by the mission, but also driven to compete and win in their category. This usually results is a win-win for Medtronic and healthcare.","the company is caught between a decentralized model where each business unit operates as its own company and centralized company that takes advantage of its scale, capabilities, and breadth.

2280,Medtronic,"The bad and The ugly, but never the Good",2020-05-14,1.0,Quality Assurance Analyst,Decent pay and overtime available most of the time.,"Medical device manufacturing can often mean plenty of OT. Sometimes it can be a bit much and makes it difficult to work-life balance but it's still tolerable.  What unbearable most is the toxic culture.  People are considered objects or expenses rather than assets.  The heartless company will not hesitate to lay off half of the workforce and resort to temp workers to get their numbers in the green. OSH Act means nothing Medtronic.  Management spends little concern for employee safety or well-being, even during the sensitive time of Covid-19.  Reactions to infectious workers are slow and inadequate, putting others at greater exposure risks.  When news broke out on virus casualty, management did nothing to keep calm, rather, they enforced lip sealing policy to avoid liability.  Incompetent and poorly educated leadership team infiltrates the manufacturing plant, spreading the ""KISS-UP"" and ""KICK-DOWN"" mentality, and uses layoffs and fears to prevent employees from speaking their minds. Favoritism rings high and reflects in every aspect of operations, including hiring/layoff/promotion/reward decisions and job assignments.  People gangs up to survive.  Some, including myself, decide to stay mute and numb to get the days by and continue bringing home the paychecks. Needless to say, there's high levels of stress, turnover, absenteeism, and burnout. The misguided leadership reach far and wide, resulting in total disconnection between upper management and employees at the bottom layers.  This ignorance is perhaps a byproduct of their willingness to sacrifice the workers for company's bottomline."

Corporate level initiatives provide great development opportunities and there are career paths available if you're willing to shift discipline or focus area.,"Highly silo'd organization. Digital capabilities are lagging and plagued by previously mentioned silo's and politics that impact alignment, budget availability and ability to do meaningful work. Your manager and/or functional/org structure determines the majority of your work experience - interview them as much as they interview you. Ask about their engagement scores, as several Groups/Functions have consistently scored low in collaboration, leadership and ability to get work done. Interview your manager on their engagement scores, character/style and then the rest of the interview team to validate your findings. The organization has little loyalty to its employees as seen in consistent use of reductions to balance their finances, re-organize or eliminate people/roles/functions so be cautious of false job security as I saw meaningful teams eliminated and HiPo individuals moved out rather than strategically moved into other roles."

Company transport at Changi South is provided. 
Knock off on the dot else you miss the bus.","Some people just want to listen to what they want to listen. Went through 2 weeks worth of discussion and reached an alignment that I made in the 1st meeting 3 weeks ago.

Some managers just say whatever that will make themselves look powerful/resourceful/useful, at the expense of humiliating you. You will not come into their minds until the blaming game starts. All the advocates on looking at the real root cause are just talks. It is all about politic games. Shame on this because you are supposed to make a medical device that saves human life, not using them for your selfish move. Also, you got to grow your capability as a manager if you want to have such a big ego.

For some unknown reason, most colleagues are not helpful to the newcomers. You got to learn most of the thing the hard way. 

In summary, don’t join this company until you know the coy culture has improved. The culture was too unbearable for me. Also, eat healthier. Because, after working there, I know I don’t want to have a pacemaker installed inside me"

MDT, like any large public company, has limited and annually reduced funding for groups that don't grow over 5% per year.  They're trying to emulate GE... which seems outdated.

There was one manager who tried, but I've heard she's left since then.","Leaders didn't understand that Houston can't be run like other territories - it's large and contains the TX Medical Center.
Leaders didn't care about work-life balance.  You could never take time off to be sick or recover from on call weekends because there were not enough workers due to high turnover.
Leaders knit-picked over the smallest things, but expected us to be at 100% every single day, even after working 14 days straight - Did I mention we worked on call from 5 pm Friday to 7 am Sunday without getting compensated or comp days?
Leaders only appeared to care about their bottom line, not the well-being of the staff.
Leaders didn't train the Sales Rep on how to manage the territory and Clinical Specialists, so teams had a challenge due to lack of poor leadership.
People were burned out which led to high turnover.

A new mobile phone of worth 10000/- can be reimbursed once in 3 years that too on  a pro-rated basis, Broad band bill of 1200/- per month can be reimbursed.  
Other than these there are loads of tasks are given to employee
Working tasks on functional aspects are good as most of the process deals with medical devices , regulation , compliance , QA etc.","IT Center in Bangalore was opened with the main intention of saving expenses mostly on everything including on office utilities those are made available to employees free of cost. Hence main focus was shifted from US to India to open a new office.
A recent shifting of office from HAL to Outer ring road We Work is one of the blunder decision that management has ever made. 
When Medtronic policies on security , confidentiality , IPs are so stringent and strict then how come a shared Workspace like We Work was chosen to be a office destination, within the building one can see there are many other companies working with us just a simple separation of a transparent glass board that itself is a violation of all confidential norms of company .
But the management is happy because they were able to save loads of money by moving to WeWork building. 

Testing team is spoiled to the core by bringing down the standards wherever they can find cost optimization. For all approvals there is only one manager who is seen as all powerful.
Manager attitude is not less than compared to a dictator  ,only a manager voice is heard and made effective in every decision making points.

It is because of these reasons there are many absconding cases , early exit cases within 2-3 months of joining the company. 
So any new job seekers please be aware here don't get attracted by just looking into the product based profile, inside this is just another service based company trying to run its operations below its billing concers , at some situation even worser compared to a service company."

2. Very bureaucratic, the incentives of the entire IT service data-driven initiative was ""get-the-number"" out to the highest level manager instead of quality, accuracy and improvement. The lower level analysts eventually bear the consequences of the poor-quality outcomes direct managers strongly demanded.

3. No training, it's ""throw you under the bus"" style starting at day 1. 

4. At some peripheral departments, such as IT Global Service, it's almost 0 quality result driven and more like 90 percent management-authoritarian driven and people are working to comply what higher managers demand every day for promotion, instead of functioning around the actual customer-satisfactory outcome."

They should  be held accountable and tested quarterly on their performance on how they are handling their team based on survey.

Management thrive in receiving awards based on their accomplishments and recognition when in reality nothing was really done to show as successful.

Lack of communication addressed to the team, not everyone is informed and many pockets are created on certain people only know while the rest are kept in the dark.  

Beware of ""corporate brain washing here"", you are more credible than you think, they will under size you. I was told before that I was not good enough for project management or as an analyst; was passed continuously on promotions due to favoritism and a cut-throat environment.  

Found it morally wrong how people were being treated.  I have left the company and now working at a successful corporation working in a project management environment assigned to tasks and deliverables for all types of work for process improvement.  I have proved them wrong."

All the managers are from service based companies with their never changing attitude as if they own the company.

Indian IT center is opened to save cost but the director wants to save more than required to get his award for Cost optimization from CEO which he got last year. and  managers want to save cost to impress director with more ideas.

They are cutting cost in every aspect, in terms of people too.
People with more experiences and salary are being targeted every quarter and being terminated.

SAP team is shrinking in every angle and given all routine activities with no challenges or exposure.
They mainly focus to give the work to contract employees which makes it more suspicious.

At the North Haven corporate area there are almost too many people who have worked there since the US Surgical days 15+ years ago & still treat everything at the pace of 2005. 
You will be treated as JUST a  number. Team comradery in just about all groups out of the Lab Services is extremely low. Basically anybody part of a real Core Team project is miserable in their group b/c directors will treat you only like a number.
Everything runs SO SO SO SLOW!!! They like to minimize cost by going to Contract Manufacturer's but the projects take 6 months longer than it should take.
Absolutely no chance at Work-Life Balance. You enter the building miserable & you leave the building miserable.
What got me to move to this company was the company slogan. Within 4 months I realized the slogan ""Quality Begins With Me"" is ONLY for the public & the shareholders...and the quarterly Town Halls. You work on a core-team project & if they could cut as many corners as possible they would do it. It is ALWAYS the QE on the project that has to tell the Project Manager that this isn't how it works.
The directors don't fully understand how dysfunctional their own team is because they are traveling a quarter the time,  getting 10 weeks of vacation a year, or working from home another 1/4 of the time. 

Personally don't think anybody that is working on validation type projects would want to start working here in the next 9 months with the regulations happening. The company is so stuck in their old ways of the only goal is to manufacture as much as possible that they fail to realize if they don't build these validation lots for regulatory then the product line could be forced to stop running.
We get these ""backorder"" data showing how much there is but they refuse to just stop production for a day for sellable product to move to the one shift that would cover all the validations for the Stability, Sterilization, Packaging, & Biocomp teams."

Hence tribal knowledge is very prevalent and inhibits ease of work being done. Everything moves slowly.  Promotions are impossible unless you have the backing from the directors and you boast on trivial ""leadership"" skills. Too much paper work to prove to regulatory bodies that you did what you were supposed to do.

2865,Medtronic,Worsening benefits/repeated layoffs/loss of motivation,2019-02-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I started working at Covidien during a local downturn in the industry.  I was very grateful for the job.

Medtronic will match donations to the charity of your choice

The fitness center has nice equipment and is rarely crowded.","When I was hired on at Covidien the benefits were top of the industry. We had unlimited sick leave  which was great for a young family. We also had great United Healthcare benefits, which was terrific for a family . When we found out on a Sunday night that we are getting bought out by Medtronic, most people were excited. I didn’t worry about my job and I thought the benefits would only improve. But the benefits got worse, and the  layoffs are every year since (sometimes twice a year).  To sum up, the medical insurance get worse every year, Medtronic dropped the unlimited sick leave (now you get to take vacation so everyone comes in sick),  and the 401k match dropped.  Medtronic also ruined the cafe. Yes, there are two restaurants on campus and a coffee shop. They really don’t help you at all as the food is terrible and coffee gives me heartburn (seriously). Medtronic fired the former cafe operators and spent a few years going with different vendors. Now they are back with the original vendors but costs must be cut, as the quality of the food under Covidien never returned. Yes, those restaurants are there, but Most don’t eat in them anymore.  Most people bring their lunch to eat at the cafe tables or eat in their office, or their car just to get away from the loud cubicles (that’s something I had never seen before Medtronic, sad people sitting around puffing and eating in their cars). 

The healthcare is more expensive and far worse, e.g. Blue Cross/Blue Shield wanted me to drive my serverely injured child straight out of the ER 100 miles out of town instead of using a local surgeon. I ended up paying about $4K  out of pocket to stay local ( still to this day it makes me so angry) I tried to appeal the decision twice, even calling Medtronic’s outsourced HR, but got no where....sick or injured kid? Medtronic doesn’t care. This year, the final straw was some sort of “insurance” out of Minneapolis and it’s pay-as-you-go called Bind. So your choices are BC/BS out of Minneapolis with few local providers or “Bind”. Most I know are on their spouses insurance.  You would think all that money Medtronic saved by “moving” their headquarters to Ireland would be put towards benefits to retain employees, but it’s not.

Once I saw how bad the health insurance (and moral) had gotten, I started looking for another job and quickly found one locally. Starting a new company you’re reminded how bad it was at the old. I have better benefits (just used my new vision benefits and saved over $200 more compared to Medtronic ) , better vacation ( the vacation I have now is better than 20 years at Medtronic + sick leave and 2 extra holidays), better 401K match (Medtronic dropped the 6% Covidien match to 3% (with a little extra for company performance) now I have 10%), same salary and work with happier people. 

The yearly layoffs at Medtronic have taken a toll on employees (every June and sometimes December). The last one they dropped the few dedicated employees they had-you know, the ones that had put in decades and were waiting for retirement...lots of tears that day.  To sum up, those that can get another job do, people who can’t stay with corresponding attitudes (ever see Office Space?). Oh and the severance package is the very least, one week/year.  So, if you are a new employee that moved here to take a job? Good luck, here’s your week ( saw that happen also).

Forget trying to get help with HR or IT that is all outsourced and you’re pretty much on your own. Get used to calling the Phillipines for help with HR (the fun part is asking them your question in a room full of people in cubicle) and Minneapolis for local IT questions. 

If you are desperate for a job, go ahead and take it at Medtronic. Know that they will drug test you after the offer, and if your drug test comes back positive your offer will be rescinded and everyone you interviewed with will know why.  Gossip is horribly pervasive at Medtronic (I used to find out about upcoming layoffs from the person who served coffee, people would treat her like she was invisible and she would hear it all-she ended up quitting also) and there is no confidentiality (I suspect that left when Medtronic laid off all the local HR reps).  Yes, and they will rescind an offer on testing Marijuana positive. How do I know this? I was told when asked why X hadn’t started, everyone knew. There is no privacy. I should have never known that information, even now it feels wrong. 

Medtronic also has an issue with Charities. You will be required (the company will say you’re not required but your boss may infer you that you are) to help with whichever Christian charities Medtronic decides to bring in. You will spend time during work hours doing whatever job they need you to do, and then have to watch a video about “god” afterwards, truly...I couldn’t believe it.  You will also have to donate money to whatever right-wing charity Medtronic chooses in order to wear jeans. You boss will receive a list of those who have paid and will reprimand you if you don’t pay to play.  

If I were a new graduate looking for a job, my advice to you would be to get an internship at Medtronic. They pay pretty well and the people that take on Interns are generally pretty good (then they get new jobs and leave). Then use that experience to get a job somewhere else. Put your talents to a local company headquartered in the US with better benefits and maybe some stock options (you don’t get that either at Medtronic)  there are plenty around Colorado."

- Management openly hostile to employees
    * Would yell at employees in public areas/cubicles, where everyone could and would overhear
    * Would belittle employees for a lack of perceived movement on projects, comparing employee performance to their own.
           - ""Why did this take you X days/weeks? I could have done it in a few hours!""
    * Would often give incorrect instructions to complete a minor task. Task would then take more time to complete, resulting in previous point's issue once completed
    * Refused to give positive performance evaluations despite proven performance
    * Refused to give promised promotions, despite employee meeting all requirements (both time and experience) to achieve promotion
    * Refused to acknowledge employee performance over and above required time (lots of night and weekend work demanded, but never mentioned upon completion of project)
    * Reprimanded employees for issues unrelated employee performance
       - E.g. - another department updates their policy which hinders document creation or approval; employee is admonished for not knowing this, despite the same or similar document being previously approved with a similar issue.
       - E.g. - Another department/group is having delays accomplishing their portion of a project, with management initially acknowledging the issue. Once Program Management asks management regarding delays, management points to the employee and claims they're ""Dragging their feet"" in getting the work done, without employee being present at the meeting
   * Gives high performing employees improvement plans, only to fire them once the plan seemingly is failed to be achieved
       - Plan metrics decided on by management, and improvement criteria solely based on management's judgement
- Upper management seems to be unable or unwilling to resolve issues with middle-management
     * Issues with management abuse taken to upper management, with UM interviewing numerous other group members. No actions were taken, and management abuse subsequently increased, leading to the assumption that knowledge of the complaints were leaked to management.
- Quantity over quality mentality means churning out new product every year, despite known drawbacks
    * Serious issues with devices as well as documentation practices were cloned in subsequent iterations of products
    * Aggressive schedules with little allowance for delays require unpaid and unacknowledged overtime
    * Lack of customer input to group functions means little to no drive in product improvement, over what management deems necessary
- Pay is not on par with other opportunities in the area
    * Employee with 10+ years with the company, and 20+ years experience paid less than Sr. engineers at other companies in the area
    * Employee with 8 years experience and advanced degree purposefully held at an entry level position, no reason given despite years of promises of promotion
    * Employee who gained a degree while working there was never given a promised promotion and transfer into an engineering role, despite doing the work but being paid significantly less than an ""entry level"" engineer."

3036,Medtronic,Senior Director,2018-09-12,3.0,Senior Director,"CEO Omar Ishrak is the absolutely best CEO in Medtronic history.  He has been laser focused on 3 key long term strategies, since he joined the company.  This focus has facilitated the execution of the business strategies across all of the businesses.  And the company has met its financial objectives in nearly all of the quarters since he became the CEO.  The stock price is significantly higher than when he became CEO - that is a huge benefit to employees who participate in the stock purchase plan and who receive stock options and restricted stock units.  And, obviously it is a huge plus for external shareholders.

Employees in all businesses and geographies are committed to the Medtronic Mission.  It is the glue that binds all business units and geographies.

The very rapid pace of change helps employees grow their careers very quickly.  They learn to adapt their skills and competencies to the ever changing business environment.","Work/Life balance in the U.S. is simply terrible, especially in staff functions.  Many employees and leaders in staff functions are just burned out.

After the Covidien acquisition, Medtronic became much more bureaucratic, and it adopted many of the Covidien bureaucratic policies and procedures.  This resulted in many employees at the senior manager and director levels having to slow down the work of their teams to comply with the new rules.

In the U.S., Medtronic employees also experienced a significant reduction in their benefits, as Medtronic responded to the  need to reduce benefit costs to make sure that Covidien benefits did not increase too much. 

Also, after the Covidien acquisition, the business travel policy for airline travel significantly reduced the value of airline travel for business travelers.  Medtronic said that its new policy was ""competitive with market practices"" (which it was NOT).  But the aim of the changes was simply to reduce the cost of international airline travel at the expense of those business travelers who frequently traveled internationally."

3051,Medtronic,One of the best in Medical Devices,2018-08-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I have been associated with this company since last few months only. I loved the overall culture. Still it is too early to judge.,There are people who thinks that their job is at high risk. Performance is key for success here.
3052,Medtronic,Its not worth it...,2018-08-25,1.0,Engineer,There are some really smart and hardworking people. You get to work on products that make a difference (even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes).,"The culture is VERY passive aggressive. You have to be very careful about what you say and how you word your emails. It's exhausting.  Also, It's an open secret when managers are toxic but no one ever does anything about it. When I left, I had no more than 10 people ask me if it was because of my notorious manager. 10 people! 

This particular manager has a very high turn over and will try to explain them all away. She micromanages, she's incredibly insecure and she needs to be constantly be validated/be the smartest person in the room. She regularly loses her cool when she feels even slightly out of control. If she says she hates something, it actually the opposite. She'll ask for people's opinion but if it doesn't align with her's she gets really mad and will be passive aggressive to you for the next week. She'll talk badly about you behind your back (she does this to EVERYONE).  It's impossible to succeed under someone like this and we all deserve better. 

But overall, you're just a number at Medtronic. They say they appreciate you but then they foster these really toxic environments where upper management makes decisions without thinking about the impact on the employees and where they don't hold managers accountable (she's not the only one). 

Honestly, I would just stay away if I were you. If you're someone who likes to be told what to do, do your job, and go home then, sure depending on the department, you'll be fine. If you want to grow, be challenged, and feel like you're being heard/contributing this isn't the right place for you."

3. Great benefits and compensation offered even without negotiation at the time of job offer.","1. Human resources are very difficult to come by, the company runs extra lean on staff, so as a project manager it was difficult to get the resources needed to implement any recommended changes and/or projects.
2. Worst internal transfer policy I have ever seen. You have to stay in your current position for a year (2 years for Sales), you must notify your manager when you start applying internally (and they receive email notice as well from HR) and there is a cap on how much you can increase salary in moving internally (but that cap is only mentioned, not disclosed). 
3. Company culture of procrastination rather than planning. Regularly pushing a deadline ambiguously somewhere down the road rather than buckling down to get things done."

This company also pushes to ensure they are hitting goals for hiring diversity and gender so if your a women you’ve got a step up on all the men in the room. Good, hardworking individuals become sick of this and head off to different Medtronic sites in order to get to where they want be and it’s a shame because all they’re doing is pushing high talent to a different site instead of keeping it in house. 

This particular site has so much change and turnover at a Supervisor and above level it’s insane and not normal. However they’ll tell you it’s normal because most of them know nothing different. Ask anyone and they’ll tell you every year it’s just another new wave of leadership. It’s not healthy to change management like that and it’s a sign that people aren’t getting what they desire or need from their role or boss.

3177,Medtronic,Corporate CULTure at its absolute worst,2018-05-18,2.0,Inside Sales,"You will get A LOT of free food; the location for the office leaves a lot of great after work/lunch options for you and your peers to bond over; the pay is above average and I must admit I made quite a bit of money in my time here; the dress code is casual which is always a huge plus for me; despite all these seemingly awesome perks, this place drove me closer to insanity than any other office I've ever worked and it all has to do with the corporate CULTure that upper management trickles down.","I had read reviews about this place on both Indeed and Glassdoor as well as heard from previous coworkers that this place a had a bad reputation for really being the worst example corporate CULTure, so I blame myself for not believing how bad it really was.

This was by far the most passively hostile and toxic work environment I have ever been in; it is beyond childish and honestly reminds me of Mean Girls (sorry for using such an adolescent reference to describe the culture but it is fitting because of how immature management truly is).

Gossip is rampant; feelings are hurt way too easily which causes disgruntled and shamed employees to chat and email their friend in management for sympathy; cliques openly welcome and then ostracize those same people as if they are trying out for a reality show; office romances and friendships become the stuff of tabloid fodder; management is all too interested in any dirt they can get on an employee and encourages their minions to bring back as much as they can get.

I have thick skin and couldn't care less what rumors are saying, the problem is supervisors and managers have inner circles and if they catch wind or believe negative rumors, they immediately take this into consideration without even trying to find out the other side of any story.

I went to HR twice about rumors that had circulated and gone out of control with seemingly no consequence, and I have never had any personal issues or even spoke with HR in any of my previous 10+ years of professional experience; despite my outward cries for help and messages to partners outside of the call center, I was let go for no particular reason on a recorded line after being on paid leave for over three weeks and was simply told that legal in Minneapolis said I was a risk (to who?) and was to be let go; no conclusive reason or evidence was ever presented as to my termination.

It's sad because I was actually stellar at the position, was passionate about being the best, and had essentially perfect attendance but had my career cut short because someone started a rumor that never escaped me.

At the end of the day what is really going on in my opinion is the managers who have been running this call center since it's inception are scared for their jobs because they know they are unqualified as the company has grown acquired other companies in its diabetes department, so naturally more educated and skilled employees are a threat to their own job security and CULTure; so to keep the jobs they aren't qualified for, they create this atmosphere of backstabbing and deceit  that I refused to take part in which ensures anyone who they choose to bring into their inner circle first knows their place and second knows what it really takes to get there, not being a great example of work ethic and determination.

If you don't think you will eventually quit yourself or get let go over a legally dubious reason, then you are one of the 500+ employees who gets hired on and actually is promoted into that inner circle of control and power (most supervisors and managers are brought in from outside, VERY few employees see any lateral or vertical movement), all the others have a ""famous"" 5+ and 10+ year flags over their desks and have been stuck in that same role their entire career with no end in sight."

The hours (excluding overtime) are nice too, considering it's just 8 hours in and out. It's easy work for a decent pay.","As a production floor worker, it's very difficult to get out and into a different field in the company (say, the field of my degree). Management claims they'll help, but nothing comes of said help after a few weeks. They can also call overtime on you at within a 24 hour time frame and if you have plans already, and someone else already has the day off, you better cancel or else you get a mark against you for missing work because they decided to tell you you have to come in to work tomorrow for overtime. If your shift happens to be short on people too, it doesn't matter because you're still expected to hit the exact same target as any other shift that's fully staffed and if you happen to miss said targets, your supervisor can get on your case about it, claiming ""short on people"" isn't a valid enough excuse, which means you've got to work the amount of 2-3 people to make the same amount as the other shift. Management keeps talking about ""teamwork"" too, but teamwork seems awful nonexistent, as each shift tends to prefer competing against one another too, and not in the friendly competition way. Management doesn't seem useful for much of anything either, except to tell you you're not doing your job good enough when you don't hit goals."

Remote work possibilities, depending. 
Lots of good, educated people (amidst: ""Friend or Foe"" areas).
Safe, decent environment (varies by location and Dept.)
Established, solid Co.  
Respectful environment (on the surface at least).
Okay pay.
Fond memories... back in 'the day.'","Layoffs every year @ fiscal year end (Apr 30). TENSE for months, preceding. (""Who/what BU/Dept will get hit this year?"")
MANY ""contingent"" worker trend. How can this be? Working among lots and lots of contingent workers makes full-time-with-benefits staff nervous. Constant feeling of competitiveness, which is probably on purpose. 
Automatic/low annual empl. raise Budget Plan had not allowed me to keep pace with inflation or offer a chance to ""get ahead"" with bills and savings. Just got worse over time and the already low auto ""raise"" went even further down recently. Scary. Maybe due to the merge with Covidien and ""overlap culling.""
Constant change: software, people, organization, process, location... can interfere with actual 'work.'  Lots of daily non-work ""INcoming.""
Must report ""hours worked"" each week so working smarter not longer not well reflected; appeared risky to log less than or around 40 hrs. Especially with contingent workers so ready to log many hours (for which they are paid OT).
Co. empl. Benefits were steadily eroded over my tenure. E.g., Co. contribution percentage to 410(k) for new vs. former empl. Allowed time off shaved down. Etc.
Advancement opps can be limited. Hard working empl. can be typecast and stuck. 
Who you know, can really matter. 
Who likes you, can really matter.
Favoritism if/when allowed to foster is palpable.
Work/home-life balance difficult due to tsunami of non-work 'incoming.'
Any software interruptions directly and negatively impact empl. work/home life balance. Felt the weight of every software interruption on shoulders with no ability to predict or control software functionality outcomes.
Management quality/ability feels uneven. Can be an issue for empl. moving around who might have come to expect a management ""norm.""
Onerous: annual perf. goals, annual behavior characteristic demonstrations, annual development goals...  Work (goal) success can be offset by low behavioral score which is arbitrary. You can ""achieve"" but at raise time, have your hard work achievement offset by a low behavioral score which can induce lots of anxiety for several glaringly obvious reasons. 
Support for training and education was reduced for the majority over time.
As an employee, felt bottom of the barrel after stockholders, customers, clients, suppliers... ANYone else actually. Felt ""lucky"" to keep job after each year's layoff.
Rewards for hard-working staff achieving milestones was often 'ice cream treats.'  
HR appeared more and more outsourced and unavailable. Not uncommon perhaps but felt HR was there to support management.
Felt repercussion of a situation not of my making... but ""blame happens."" NG.
As top management changed over the years, so did the good times and feelings."

I had numerous evidence against him--documents to prove his lies,  a reliable and respected witness,  knowledge of others who had taken him to HR, and others to back up my story. Obviously nothing was done or he would have most likely ""behaved"". Nothing was done to help me and a meeting wasn't set up with the manager to discuss with HR what he had done. He was a brown-noser to HR and management, as well as in a protected class so those were a big part of not reprimanding him."
3291,Medtronic,read the find print before you sign to work for this company,2018-03-01,2.0,Ask Human Resources,Very diverse group of colleagues who were helpful and supportive. Modern office.,"Welcome to chaos: many of the colleagues and even the hiring manager admitted that this team has a huge turnaround and that processes are still ""not all in place"". 

Like many other multinationals that moved to Prague because labour is much cheaper, Medtronic is still busy closing offices elsewhere and setting up shop in Prague. I don't have a problem being in a team where you need to work and think on your feet. In fact, it can be a great time to join a company when things are still developping and you can be part of the growth. However, once you are a former employee, only then will you see just how bad the communication is. Good luck getting all the necessary documentation that you should receive without having to ask countless times.  Getting something in writing does not mean it will happen either. I had to finally involve my former manager over what my official last day of work was as this had an effect on the distribution of meal vouchers. This information should have been documented in their system already as there was plenty of hard copy evidence what the correct day was. Instead, they relied on an email that contained incorrect information and then the person tried to blame it on ""miscommunication"".

All the perks excluding meal vouchers only kick in after the probationary period and even things like vacation and language bonus are not necessarily a given or your legal right. For example, even though every employee has a legal right to 20 vacation days per year, if you do not work a full month and leave during the probationary period, you will not have any right to ANY pro rato vacation whatsoever.  

My position came with a language bonus that I believed was part and parcel of the base salary. Wrong.  That too is only paid out if you work at least a month. 

I feel like I was lied to.

My work contract was given to me for signing by a work colleague as nobody from HR was there! The same went for when I resigned. It seems there is no HR presence at this office. This is the epitome of unprofessional. It should never happen in any reputable company unless perhaps it's a family run business,

Advice to foreign employees: read the Czech labour act well before you work for any company in the Czech Republic. The rules are very different here than in other European countries."

This makes the office environment pretty toxic and causes employees to be rather competitive in order to gain favor with senior leadership, which results in collaboration being almost nonexistent. 

Managers often force responsibilities on employees that are way outside of their skillset and job description rather than finding or hiring appropriate personnel. They then chastise those employees when the project starts to have issues (who'd have guessed)... 

Compliments and/or recognition from  management is extremely rare. There is no clear path for advancement within the company meaning it is virtually nonexistent- no matter how much effort and sacrifice you put in.

There is no work life balance, I have to be available 24/7 no matter what day or time it is. I am expected to have my computer with me at all times, and if I don't respond to something quick enough the calls and texts start on my personal phone . This usually stems from a lack of planning and procrastination on the part of management always creating ""emergencies""... This has made my home life very stressful and complicated."

The  pay is decent for what you do. 
There are great benefits when you are hired full time.
You get to  help patients with medical needs.
It can be difficult, but you have the ability to get a steady schedule that you like.
There is pleanty of overtime available.
 You automatically accrue 40 hours of pto at beginning of year, and you accrue 10 hours per month.
You are paid time and a half on holidays. 
They catered meals on holidays and occasionally when busy.
Some patients think the world of you when you solve their issues and give you high praise.
You are given extensive training at beginning of work that can greatly prepare you for most aspects of your job.","The work is repetitive and sometimes monotonous, and there is little to no variety in work (you will usually spend your days constantly on the phone).
The promotions were limited in my department due to near constant influx of callers.
Your performance ratings are focused on metrics and extensive scripting and not how well you support patient normally. 
Being an FDA regulated industry you are required to take extensive notes.
Since a patient calls with their or their families medical needs they can be irate on a whole different level which can be trying at times. 
Some things covered in training are  inaccurate to what is done on the call center floor."

In practice all that matters is making money at the expense of innovation and getting anything of quality to market.
- Under competent management it is possible to learn, grow, and develop as a software engineer (all of these managers have since left the company)
- Really great people seem to end up working for Medtronic and stay because they honestly believe in the mission and want to help the customers.","- Way under paid for the work.
- A management team who doesn't understand the first thing about developing software or how to plan a project.
- Gender and race are more important to the company than finding people that are able to to the required work.
- Management spends all their time fighting and attempts to build empires at the expense of those doing the work, project schedules, and ultimately the customers.
- Promotions are not based on merit but on filling quotas and ensuring that anyone attempting to do real engineering is not considered.
- All software development is being outsourced without regard to quality, or meeting the basic standards required to release a medical device through the FDA.
- Schedules are driven from the top without any knowledge or regard for the time it actually takes to complete any amount of work.
- Health insurance is very expensive due to subsidizing members of the group plan.
- Project management is not capable of planing a project, or understanding the most basic concepts for developing medical devices.
- Engineering is discouraged it is better for your career to just say yes and agree to whatever management asks for.
- Deadlines have no real importance, schedules are made by throwing a dart at a calendar, and when it comes time, nothing happens.
- It took me 1.5 years to get the requirements for a promotion. When I tried talking with management about a promotion and prepared examples of how the criteria was met with examples, additional criteria was ""made up"" on the spot which is not actionable without any career improvement plan.

- Took Medtronic Diabetes 15+ years to develop a ""new"" insulin pump.
- Management manages projects with wilful negligence. Internal and external requirements are not met, and rather than writing deviations as required, management withholds information in the reports and tries to inundate those reviewing the documentation with so much info that they don't notice.
- Third party vendors and arrangements. Be prepared to work for the people your company is paying to ""help""."

Medtronic generally has been known in medical and academic circles as having some of the best and most rigorously journaled products, and generally is the brand of choice of implants for VIPs.","Salary increments are painfully minimal (regardless of performance) - make sure you negotiate as high a pay as possible upon entry. You'll unlikely get a decent pay jump unless you move on else where, even doing so just to result in a counter-offer.

Integrating with Covidien also means Medtronic has been inheriting outdated policies - like hard copy approvals instead of email/digital approvals, for many simple things. The past few years has seen considerable increase of red tape and paperwork, without hiring the additional manpower to handle them.

Integration (between Medtronic and Covidien) has been problematic for the past few years. General consensus suggests that the internal cultures have soured with the onslaught of new faces, while proper cohesion efforts have been nonexistent."

This has caused moral to drop tremendously due to the people being left behind having to pick up the extra work,  which has in turn caused more people to leave. Having said that they do not  compensate the employees for the increased workload's and for the most part you only get about a 2% raise per year which does not keep up with the cost-of-living.

4146,Medtronic,"Was a great company, going downhill fast at this location.",2016-08-17,1.0,Production Technician,"Great people to work with, literally the only reason I have stayed as long as I have with the company. The benefits are OK but the coworkers really make it great. Benefits, while not as good as they have been/should be, are okay, and there are some other perks including education assistance. Probably a great job for someone right out of school so they can get the experience under their belt for a year or two. ISO 1000 qualifications, and AATB certifications and classes are available as well. Good company to get used to the corporate environment","Lets start from the top: Management in the last year or so has been abysmal, and needs to be remedied with new upper managers for the site.

We have been through at least 7 supervisors in the 5 years I have worked here(incuding a layoff of 2 supervisors recently. Most problems go unresolved because of budget issues(probably also why we have cut back on staff). Managements solution for hiring is to take anyone off the street they can get for cheap as they hemorrhage seasoned employees. Most new temps are required to work longer hours for less money, and there is no longer a promise of full employment like their used to be(I'm assuming another cost cutting measure). Some temps were hired, used for the 1 year contract, and then let go despite being great workers. 

Engineering for our products/paperwork is terrible, our best engineer just left the company to find other employment, and the rest have never known how to do quality work, leaving most of it on his shoulders. Most are very stubborn to change, and not entirely knowledgeable in what they do. It took us 3 years to get new equipment, and when it was replaced, the new equipment was so badly engineered we had to go back to the old stuff.

Benefits used to be great, but since I have worked there the premiums have gone up, and the service has gone significantly down. 401K is the same, we used to have Vanguard(great) and recently got switched to Aon Hewitt(terrible). Also used to have a great help desk service for benefits that would do everything they could to help you, that's gone as well. Stock purchase plan is still okay. 

Management will tell you in every meeting that the work you are doing is saving lives(we are) and that the company is pioneering new and innovative blah blah blah.....the products we make are at minimum 6 years old, and most are losing market share because there are newer and better technologies. 

Oh and I forgot to mention that they recently told us that our opportunities for advancement have effectively been shut down, we will not be getting any promotions or level increases for the forseeable future, even if you have the proper requirements. They have become more and more stringent on what you need to progress over the last 5 year, but this is the first year they flat out told us we will not be advancing despite having the proper qualifications."

This is especially useful for early-stage product development.  If you need specialized test performed or information outside your scope of expertise, resources are often available internally.
Mission: Medtronic has a strong mission & makes decisions based on it.  Many of my coworkers felt this was a match to their values.
Career opportunities: there are many areas to provide for career growth within the company, including ability to make minor or major career position changes without changing parent companies.
Pay & benefits are exceptional.","There are many divisions & geographic site locations within the parent company.  Multi-site projects are common & can hinder effective communication & collaboration, especially for product development (not as relevant for ""desk"" jobs that lend themselves to telecommuting).  
Corporate culture: The company culture can vary widely between groups and/or sites, largely a reflection of division / departmental management.  I was in a dysfunctional group, but many are better (wish I'd recognized it earlier & transferred).
While many tools are available to communicate between groups and/or sites, often one group has no idea what others are working on - can lead to duplication of efforts & missed opportunities to leverage learnings of others."

I acknowledge as with any company, that financial motives are a key factor in decision making, but I can honestly say that I have witnessed a substantial number of occasions where the patient, customer, and employee come before the financial impact of the situation.  This in combination with the direction that our current CEO (Omar Ishrak) is steering us gives me genuine belief in the overarching goal of our company and allows me to sleep soundly at night.","On the other hand, between the CEO (and his team) and the employees that are working day-in-and-day-out with the patients exists a completely misaligned and borderline antagonistic component of corporate culture at it worst.  I have witnessed far too many examples of corporate 'jockeying' and allowing personal career agendas to supersede good corporate stewardship in the local, Australian market.  Now, I understand that it is admirable and more than acceptable to want to advance your career with any organization, but it should never be at the cost of the 'external focus' of the company; which happens to be one of the key-traits for the company.  To that note, and as my final recommendation/review, I recommend approaching Medtronic ANZ with caution as the mission will carry us all, but the local politics will make the ride rather uncomfortable."

4321,Medtronic,Very Poor Leadership - Avoid MDT!,2016-04-04,1.0,Finance Manager,Satisfaction knowing that your company saves thousands of lives each day.,"Leadership - severely lacking, and this comes from the very top in Omar's office.  I was part of the Covidien group that Medtronic acquired.  Covidien was an amazing company and was a well oiled machine.  Once the acquisition was complete and executives had promised over $800M in cost savings over x years (to financiers), it became very apparent that every leader was out for their own good.  My manager flat out told me that she did not want to manage me anymore and wished that I would report to someone else.  And the ""legacy"" Medtronic leaders have this philosophy that ""this is the way we've always done it, and that's how we'll do it going forward"".  Covidien was Medtronic's largest acquisition ever, so a ""one size"" approach doesn't always work, but the legacy MDT leaders would not listen. 
While I think MDT does a great job in saving lives, the company's leaders reap the financial benefits while they work their bean counters to the bone, and are very poor about giving out financial incentives to those employees that go above and beyond.  If you are looking for a med device job, avoid Medtronic!"

Finally, their travel policy sucks - you have per meal limits, but if you spend less on one, you can't use that to balance against another meal - and no market adjustment.  Same limits in NYC as in Dubuque...and no adjusting for currency internationally.

They also don't allow business class for anybody but the executives.  Even on 10+ hour flights. at least as Covidien we could do that. Travel policy was one of the few intangibles that made it worthwhile. especially since now we have to burn our vacation time over the Christmas holiday or go unpaid at the end of the year because they ""close shop.""  Yeah, merry ducking Christmas there...

4334,Medtronic,Place for a solid career with lots of organizational bloat,2016-03-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"A secure, comfortable place to work. Reasonable benefits.","Lots of bureaucracy. Teams are frequently composed of individuals with very little in common in terms of business alignment or motivation, often leading to least-common-denominator solutions.  As a developer, I've frequently been on teams where other business segments are represented and are more motivated in mitigating risk by preventing the project's progress than actual collaboration.

There is very little trust demonstrated between teams or groups.  A huge emphasis on ""status reporting"" is relied on to track unrealistic deadlines.  I've been on a couple projects where the number of people who's main function was to report status to varied lines of management outnumbered folks actually working on the project.

Being a medical device company, process is very important and often leads to inefficiencies and frequent analysis to weigh the cost of the right action (e.g. addressing a problem) vs no action (e.g. minimizing the burden of process related work).  Frequently the latter wins, which can be soul-crushing."

4337,Medtronic,Sales Representative,2016-03-25,2.0,Sales Representative,"Medtronic CRHF products are great products. If I had a relative or a loved one requiring a cardiac device, I would not hesitate.","Throughout the past several years this company has continually reduced the compensation and benefits of it's employees. A few years ago they even cut our modest $45K-$50K base salaries by $6500.00 which were already far below what our competitors were offering their sales representatives. Medtronic did this under the pretense that it was to help cover the 2.3% device industry tax ObamaCare was imposing upon our industry. Yet, they have spent far less money successfully lobbying to delay paying any of this tax. Upper management took the same percentage cut at the time, but underhandedly reinstated their own salaries 6 months later as was referenced in our annual report. Senior leadership is making more money year after year and they are constantly telling us how the company is thriving while the field continues to make less and they neglect to funnel any of the profits back towards the worker bees. We have not even had a cost of living increase in the past 7-8 years, but hey, it's all good because our CEO just had a 79% increase in his compensation over the previous year, earning him over $ 40 million. Also, company employees, some of which dedicated their entire careers to Medtronic, got hit with hefty taxes due to the Medtronic/Covidien merger. Conversely, after less than 5 years of employment with Medtronic, CEO Omar Ishrak was granted an addition $25 million dollars of stock to cover his taxes, along with approximately 20 other executives that unlike employees had their tax burdens covered. I sincerely question how Mr. Ishrak is capable of looking his employees in their faces when he shows up at the National Sales Meeting. This company's leadership clearly does not value it employees and that is sad, because it used to be much different 10+ years ago.
There is no question that Medtronic has become a huge multinational conglomerate, but it was built off the backs of the CRHF division. The work/life balance of a CRHF representative is horrible, when one considers that as a sales representative, you are on call 24 hours a day Monday-Thursday, every 4th to 5th weekend and most holidays. As a result we should be compensated accordingly for the sacrifices that we are expected to make time and time again by putting work before our families and sometimes our own health, but we are not. I have many friends working at different companies who sell medical devices outside of CRHF and even they feel it is ridiculous that we are not paid MUCH better than they are for the quality of life that we endure.
Lastly, in CRHF the training learning curve is so long, that they will not allow you to move to a different division, no matter what management claims. I know many people who have had managers in other divisions openly admit that they had been told they are not allowed to hire from the CRHF division.
I realize that this review contains more negative content than positive and that there are also reviews on this site which are positive. That said, when reading the positive reviews, please take note of the length of employment of the reviewer. Many of the positive reviews are written by newer employees. Those of us who have been with the company for longer periods know what Medtronic once was like and that is where we are basing our comparisons."

Silos are quite prevalent. Resources were reduced after the Covidien merger, causing a frenzy among program managers trying to meet their deadlines and milestones.

Since he joined the company, his laser-sharp focus on 3 key strategic objectives have been a very welcome change from the ""flavor of the year"" visions of his predecessors.  He has made it very easy for employees to understand the direction in which the company is going.  He is also the first CEO we've had who actually understands what it means to be a global company - previous CEO's allowed the company to continue to be a U.S.-oriented company.  The huge increase in stock price is proof of his leadership.  Pay is competitive.","Work life balance is simply terrible.  The company continued to eliminate jobs over the past several years and leaves those who still have jobs to do more with less staff resources.  Since the Covidien acquisition, the company implemented many, much more bureaucratic and cumbersome policies and processes, making it much more difficult and time-consuming to get work done - the additional burden of new policies and processes do not add any value to the work getting done.  Over the past several years, benefits have continued to be decreased, with more expenses shifted to employees - generally, the company gets away with this, because benefits are rather complicated, and it's very difficult for employees to understand how the company compares with other companies in our industry."

The job its self is GREAT, but the staff makes it like high school.","FAVORITISM!! FAVORITISM!! That's really all this company is about. If you are not best friends with staff and supervisors - you will go no where within this company. It is really sad because there are some TOP performers who will never get a chance because they are not social butterflies. 

The company likes to manipulate employees and/for their time. For example, they will groom and prepare reps for a leadership or team lead position, give them all of the work and escalations, have them ACTING in that role for months before they can even interview for said position. The managers always pick their favorites or people they know - or when they decide on other people - there is little to no feedback on why or how to improve for you future interviews/chances. You have to be very direct with management to get anywhere or anything done. The supervisors are so-so. Some work hard - some hardly work. 

There have been a lot of firings lately which has helped some but there is so much more shady business going on that doesn't get addressed. The same reps who win employee of the month go to eat lunch with their supervisors outside of work - how is that not conflict on interest ?? Supervisors also date lower level reps here. VERY unprofessional. I was shocked to learn that a fortune 500 company does not have some type of no fraternization rule(s) - and if there is one, it is NOT abided by here. Same people ""picked"" for prizes/awards - it really ruins team and department morale when the people who win those awards are the ones who are not processing the patients orders correctly. Meanwhile, the ones who do not win or get recognition are the ones fixing those orders. 

Leadership makes promises and doesn't follow through on them. Has spoken of giving different work shifts and/or part time - they never do. 

The work load - depending on what territory or dept varies - I can say that the overall demand for work is HIGH. They demand/push for overtime so much, but if you do not give them overtime and practically live there, good luck moving up into any type of leadership."

I worked in engineering, and was very upset and disheartened with the lack of respect with which some employees are treated. Talk about segregation. Most of the department's contract (no benefit, minimum wage) workers are minority workers (Asian, Latino, ie: not white). The people manufacturing the medical devices that are inserted into other people's bodies subcutaneously are getting paid as much as the people who flip your hamburgers at McDonalds. Many of them are there on visas and are afraid to speak out due to their immigration status and fear of deportation. Management is unnecessarily spiteful and demoralizing (sometimes even hateful) to these employees, and the workers must just keep their head down for fear of losing their jobs. Many of the workers are skilled at what they do and have been there for many years. They deserve more respect. Instead they generally look fearful and anxious of being yelled at, punished, or fired. Just because Medtronic isn't legally liable for these workers due to them being contracted out doesn't given them the right to treat them subhuman."

You know who you are.","Greedy. They treat their coworkers very unkindly, especially for those who have been with them the longest. They find any reason, any excuse to fire them after being with the company for over 15, 20+ years because those people have the best benefits. And since they're greedy, the company can just hire new temps to take over and pay them way less than what they had spent on the other now ex-employee. Then everyone is scared to say anything in fear that they may lose their job. And those people working, bless their souls, have families that depend on them to come through.

Due to the high level of inefficiency, I am surprised anything ever gets done.

Being a big company, you will find a wide varieties of workplace sub-cultures, some good, some not so good. Where I work, there is significant distrust between employees and most levels of management. This is the result, in part, of many years of layoffs, initiatives to ""level"" employees (demote those that are not performing, or invite them to leave), loss of unused vacation time (it's not paid out - it's lost), a huge increase in off-shoring (remember all those layoffs? Guess who got the jobs?), and more. I've experienced 5 years of 50-60 hour work weeks with no tangible benefit (except, perhaps, being able to keep my job). I have had requests for vacation denied, as well as requests for training. In 25+ years of employment, this is the worst employer for both work/life balance and supporting employee training.

Whenever they posted a new job position they already knew who they were planning to give the job to. It is just a formality that the job had to be posted for a specific number of days. They say that they want to retain talent; however there is a lack of promotion from within; instead they hire their friends from the outside, and promote their friends. For example, there was a woman who only had a bachelor's degree in biology, and no directly related work experience, yet she was hired in as a senior financial analyst. Then about every year or two she would be promoted. Whenever they wanted to promote someone who didn't meet the requirements, they would custom create the job position. For example, to be a Principle Financial Analyst you were to have at minimum 7 years of direct experience and a degree in a directly related field like finance or accounting; however they would change the requirement to 2 years and exclude the requirement for needing a related degree.

There are a number of different areas to work, if you want a change you can find it within the company.  Some really great talent that works hard to do the right thing and make positive changes - hardest working group of people I have been associated with in 15 years in the medical device industry.","Risk averse, especially when it comes to changing something with a tie to an important person.  What might have been good 10, 5, or 1 year ago may not be sufficient now, but there is an inability to make the correct choice, even with data to support the change.  Extremely top heavy, wouldn't doubt if they have more Directors and Vice Presidents than they do Technicians.  Layoffs every April seem to be the 'cure' for double digit returns?"
5310,Medtronic,"Good to place work but with becoming big corp - now lacks innovative, creative and entrepreneurial spirit",2012-04-09,4.0,,"Good place to work, good compensation, flexible, good people overall, life saving products with real life impact, good stewards of community","Slow paced, lacks of innovation and entrepreneurial drive, would rather buy innovation then invest within the company to innovate, senior management too risk averse and dug into their trenches.

Strong sense of community and collaboration to meet business goals. Balanced thinking with respect for all functions,"Usual politics, but quite acceptable. Employees are not quickly convicted, but in fact can be quite opposite and takes time to get rid of bad apples at the top."
5313,Medtronic,Loved my colleagues,2012-04-05,3.0,,High caliber people working in an industry that impacts people's lives.    Great benefits and good pay.   Minneapolis staff are some of the best people I have ever worked with.,"Boys club,    Ridiculous amounts of red tape to get the job done.    Too heavy on managers and not enough people to get the job done.    In this industry your job IS your life, leading to stress and burnout."

Good pay and benefits.  The patient-focused mission is a wonderful thing, even for those who are not in patient-facing roles.  The annual holiday party features 6 or 8 patients and their stories.  Amazing stuff.  Never a dry eye in the house.","Management talks of focusing on only two or three objectives,  but the list below each objective is often unobtainable.

Very short-sighted thinking with respect to recruitment.  There is always talk of hiring top talent, but when faced with down quarters dysfunctional limitations around relocation are imposed.  

CRDM, the biggest business unit, hasn't made plan for five years.  Layoffs every time as a consequence."
5316,Medtronic,medtronic offers excellent training in the area of device follow up and implantation support.   The best in the industry,2012-03-22,2.0,Clinical Specialist,"medtronic is very well respected by our hospital and physician customers. The amount of training that is provided is first class.  If you put in the time and effort you will be rewarded with pay increases,promotions, and stock options.","The CRM division has had a hiring freeze for over a year. It takes at least 14 months to train a highly motivated new employee.  We can't seem to be able to keep employees in our district for more than 2 years. They all get burned out and quit or go and work for the competition.   The company was built on non-revenue service. This worked for a long time, but with the flat and negative market growth in devices the service expectations keep going up but the hospitals keep demanding more and more price cuts. Medtronic has not offered solutions or policies to help support the field with this problem."
5317,Medtronic,Not a real medical device company,2012-03-18,1.0,Engineer,"MNav is a strong growing business and the lack of bureaucracy allows work to proceed quickly  
Free Coffee","Medtronic as a whole has poor benefits (Vacation and the 401K Match VESTS!)
Poor systems (Quality and Manufacturing)
Poor Management (dangerous amateurs)
Poor facility (not well cared for, dirty bathrooms) 
Unethical business practices (management is not to be trusted, eventually their business practices will catch up with them)"
5318,Medtronic,Layoffs ahead--again!,2012-03-14,2.0,,"Company is interested in community-based work, encourages employees to volunteer.  Good pay unless you're in customer service. Benefits are good.","Here we go again--another round of layoffs and cronies running around trying to figure out how to protect themselves and their favorite followers.  Another round of subjective ""fair process"" (there is no process) on who gets let go this time.  Employees are forced to spend time again worrying, and protecting their turf-- instead of adding value to their jobs.  This (now) annual process is not a result of true leadership--it is just picking low-hanging fruit (heads) to make the numbers look good for a time.  How about some true leadership and totally reorganizing this fat, top heavy, bloated, inefficient mammoth of an organization?  Seriously, stockholders, ask how in the world this organization is going to be able to sustain itself in the long term?   What is the span of control for leadership---how many (all levels) VP's, Directors, Program Directors are in the organization?  I'm surprised the company doesn't implode on itself with all the weight at the top!"

* Your company makes tangible products and your work directly or indirectly extends and improves the lives of individuals.
* Good benefits (under pressure due to cost-cutting), good life/work balance.
* Pleasant coworkers, some good managers
* Stable until your department gets RIF'd","* The medical device industry as a whole has gone into single digit growth or decline due to recent economic events and public resistance to ever-increasing health care costs. This means continued cost cutting and RIFs.
* Risk-averse culture, more concerned with not making mistakes than innovating. This is understandable, but somebody interested in innovation should look at a smaller company.
* Lack of accountability. There is not enough pressure to make important decisions in a timely manner or to empower managers and contributors to take risks. 
* Lack of opportunity for advancement or lateral moves. Promotions are based on loyalty."
5323,Medtronic,The overall experience working with Medtronic was very positive.,2012-03-03,4.0,,The company itself is very stable and provides their employees with great benefits. The company also has great senior leadership and culture.,"As with any large company, there are always a few drawbacks. Some of the major drawbacks occurred while I was still employeed there. Most of the changes and issues originated with the company streamlining their business, which of course is practical, however there were times when an employee would few less valuable and more like an expendable business unit."

There really are some smart people at this company, and people who leave consistently say that the caliber of people at Medtronic is higher than what you'll find at most companies.","For every fantastic manager I've had, I've also had a terrible one.  Medtronic needs to better train management to lead: give specific feedback, give the coaching and resources employees need to succeed, set a vision and make sure all work falls within that vision.
