1,Milwaukee Tool,30 day review,2022-04-06,4.0,Facilities Coordinator,"The work environment is excellent, also the company benefits are amazing.
Everyone I have met and had contact with here has been very pleasant and welcoming.",Training felt rushed and there isn't any manual or literature to look back on for questions once your training is complete.

3,Milwaukee Tool,Amazing company,2022-04-06,5.0,Advanced Quality Engineer II,"Milwaukee Tool is leagues beyond other companies I've worked for in all aspects. Company culture is the biggest thing that sets it apart, they care about and reinvest in their employees, and the products are obviously exciting to be a part of. Pay and benefits are competitive. Flexible schedules. Work hard, play hard.",Not great paternity/maternity leave. Evening calls with TTI team sometimes.

5,Milwaukee Tool,Market leader with a good reason,2022-04-06,5.0,Principal Electrical Engineer,"It was not an accident that Milwaukee Tool became the most successful in their market segment in 2020-2021 (and still growing fast). It's the great people and the culture of the company that made that result possible. I've been working as an electrical engineer for 12+ years and worked for quite a few organizations worldwide, but I've never felt that I am surrounded by that many clever yet friendly and positive people in a room. Milwaukee Tool realized that investing in the innovation and future technologies as well as talented people pays out and they are really walking on this path, not only talk about it as many others. Inside the walls, you always feel that there are great things happening here and you always feel supported that you can make the most out of your skills.",The company is growing so rapidly that it's difficult to know most of the people.

-loyalty isn't rewarded (pay raises over time).
-some benefits (eg, employee tool discount) have been axed
-executive team doesn't seem to care about most workers
-despite massive earnings growth and inflation, raises this year for lower rung employees were around 3%. Somehow I doubt the upper echelons feel that."

33,Milwaukee Tool,Don’t believe the Hype,2022-03-09,2.0,Demand Planner,The perks and the health insurance.,Gaslighting in demand. No clear direction. Constant changes to the “process”. There is no process. People are afraid to ask questions. Too many bosses no true leaders. Professionalism is lacking. Too many people drinking the kool-aid just to get through the day. Work in any other portion of the business except Demand. 1/4 of the job is forecasting. 3/4 of the job is updating PowerPoint presentations. A lot of point fingers and lack of accountability.

37,Milwaukee Tool,Limitless Company,2022-03-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Milwaukee Tool is truly an incredible company. It was obvious to me on day one why the company has seen tremendous growth -- a never settle mentality, profound investment in not just products and technology, but its employees and facilities, and the the value it puts on its team members. There is a clear hierarchy and ample training, which helped me hit the ground running. In my last role, I was under a tremendous amount of pressure to hit the bottom line and went to bed most nights worried about my future, but here I am energized and can focus on doing the best I can and then finding ways to do even better. The communications from the executive team make me feel secure in that the company understands why other businesses have failed and how we can avoid each of those pitfalls and continue our incredible growth.

My pay upon hire was a healthy percentage above market and I have enjoyed perks such as stunning facilities, subsidized lunches, product discounts, schedule flexibility, casual work dress, and travel opportunities.","The company's rapid growth has stressed the availability of office space/parking and resulted in office sharing and moving, but I have been impressed by the company's willingness to invest in new space quickly."
38,Milwaukee Tool,"Good Culture, Getting Diluted",2022-03-03,4.0,Design Engineer II,Milwaukee has great facilities and consistently provides you the resources you need to do you job.,"A lot of people are getting hired quickly and starting to dilute the good culture. Many subordinates are having to train their managers and even their entire team, which makes for a difficult working situation on a daily basis.

The increasing need for heads is also taking up internal career opportunities for advancement. It is slowly turning into a company that you could stay at and grow, to one that you're going to come to for building your experience for a few years and then moving on to be able to advance in your career."

I can't complain about any of my team members or management. The HR and IT departments were very helpful with On Boarding me as a new employee. The benefits here are pretty good as well.,Our team is growing and will be relocated to a new facility in the future. It's not a deal breaker but just something I'll need to adjust to when the time comes.
43,Milwaukee Tool,Terrible,2022-03-01,2.0,Technical Trainer,"Coworkers, break room, and hours","Management and HR is a joke. They care about their ""culture"", but when you're open and candid, you get the short end of the stick. They expect you to do jobs that are not yours on a continously increasing pace.

54,Milwaukee Tool,Great Place to work,2022-02-21,5.0,IT Associate Analyst,"Pay, Scheduling, Team work, Benefits, and Fast Pace","Orientation is a little wonky. You learn a lot about items that do not pertain to the field that you will be involved in. So it should be more focused for your job specific role. 
401(k) - There should also be stock options. This would encourage those that are looking for a long term career at Milwaukee Tool to push themselves in their fields to see the Company succeed. While 401(k) is good, the stock option would be better and encourage the culture that Milwaukee is known for. Maybe do 1 year on job Salary Employees can purchase stock. For Hourly maybe 3 years on the job and then you can buy stock. Let the Employees become invested in the success driven environment, which will make Milwaukee Tool the set standard for the industry."

60,Milwaukee Tool,Abusive Threatening Work Place,2022-02-17,1.0,National Account Manager,"Great Brand, Great Innovation, but a thirst for profits over employee welfare","UK national account roles have a high turnover due to an aggressive abusive culture, everyone has a shelve life and as soon as the orders dry up the next young buck will come through from their graduate scheme and you will be forced out of the business. Im happy to no longer be working there, its the worst culture ever with zero accountability for the culprits. Zero employee benefits, poor pay and crap bonuses whilst they make maximum profits. Even kept all the government furlough cash whilst registering maxium profits."
61,Milwaukee Tool,Recently started,2022-02-17,5.0,Firmware Engineer,"It's a very friendly work environment where everyone is willing to help and answer any questions. It has a very motivating culture that encourages you to take control of your work and seek out ways to improve your approach and yourself. Almost everybody at the company is accessible and you are encouraged to build relationships with coworkers and managers, both in your department and outside of it.","The company moves fast and people's schedules can very easily fill up. There is a very strong culture here that may make you feel like an outsider if you are not motivated and interested with your work.

The compensation for Industrial Designers is single handedly the worst part about working at this company. The starting salary for an Associate Industrial Designer has not changed in the past four years, even though inflation and company sales have grown exponentially.

Help Desk - the nicest people work at the help desk support line.

Fitness Center on site.

Free flu shots on site and regular blood drives.

2 days off for local volunteer opportunities.

4 weeks of severance offered if they fire you and you agree to sign their shady NDA.","Interviewed 2 times for a posted job with 8 people. Had a great experience in the interview and was offered a job different from what I interviewed for. I never received a job description and ended up having to write it myself. After 3 months I worked with 1 of the 8 people I interviewed with. On my 2nd day one of those people were fired with no explanation as to why.

Terrible health insurance. Somehow my insurance was enrolled in twice and I was charged twice. It took 2 months to receive an insurance card so I could even use the insurance.

The division I was moved into with the 3rd Manager I had in 4 months was a toxic environment due to leadership. The biggest issue was a power struggle of who is in charge. In order for me to do my work I need to get ""alignment"" from 3 division heads. It was difficult to get everyone together to review work at one time so when I would make a decision based on meeting with 2 out of the 3 groups the 3rd person left out would interrogate as to why they were left out. I couldn't win with getting ""alignment"" by the given due dates as it would be a bigger issue if a date was missed.

No regard for COVID safety. Required employees in the office to be in small closed door meeting rooms without wearing masks and no vaccination requirement. Corporate guidelines said that virtual links were required but when I would join from my desk due to wanting to keep distance I would be called to have to come into the room. In a cross functional corporate meeting I had to listen to someone going off on a rant about how people need to get over these COVID concerns when concerns were brought up. A leader came from Texas to speak in the auditorium to speak and the direction from management regarding the packed audience was that not enough people were there in person and we need to make sure to attend (a link was provided for viewing but they don't want it to be used).

Petty and disrespectful environment. It was commonplace to be asked to contribute to lists of complaints on people that they didn't like and review their concerns with management. Sometimes that person would find out and elevate to HR which would drop that issue.  Other times management would talk to the person that has a list of complaints about them to their face and also say the concerns are petty without passing any legit concerns along creating an environment full of drama and gossip. 

Weekly meetings would be held with as task masters giving out to do lists to the group along with deadlines. Afterwards separate email different direction would be sent with a different direction and cc management as if something was done wrong. Not a team environment; was a witch hunt to accuse everyone but themselves of doing things incorrectly.

Turn time for work was unrealistic. Products would be received and expected to be evaluated, reviewed with team and full feedback sent the next day. Usual pace for that at other companies is 5-7 days. Work hours ended up being very long as there was not enough staff to complete the work. 

Very bland and cold white male environment. Literally the temperature is too cold. Women's bathrooms do not even have feminine hygiene products. I was in a meeting where a manager actually said ""white men are becoming extinct"" in a presentation.

My final manager before joining the company got all the gossip on everyone and started to influence people before he even came. I was told to stay away from certain people as they were working on getting them fired. I had to watch him sneak around my desk on my last day so he could tell his boss that I was there so he could fire me. Even though to my face he told me things will get better.

This is just a few examples of the toxicity. I hear other areas are better to work in."

Management does not care about you, until you mess up. You will never make enough parts, or seal any packaging, or finish the parts. You will spend 7 days a week in the plant and be so tired when you leave that all you can do is sleep and get right back to work. Profits and numbers will always be more important than your health, mentally or physically, so be prepared to not live up to what they want, getting evaluated, then telling you your not doing enough, and leave work and do it all again the next day.

297,Milwaukee Tool,Great Place,2020-12-14,5.0,Production Manager,The culture and team atmosphere is something that is not like anything I have ever experienced within a company setting before.

298,Milwaukee Tool,Just what I was looking for,2020-12-10,5.0,Software Developer,"It's pretty much everything I've been searching for in a work environment...people, pay, culture, respecting work/life balance, the list goes on. In other jobs, it's hard to see your work come to life as it may not be public facing, but here, you get to see/work with the product first hand, and you see the recognition in your work from others around the company.","I started working here either during or just after a massive hiring, so the structure put in place for the smaller numbers of employees was quickly being outgrown and it showed in some circumstances. Since then, there has been at least a few changes to help mitigate it, so this may not even be a con anymore for most departments."
299,Milwaukee Tool,Culture and process is the name of the game,2020-12-09,5.0,Project Leader,"The Culture (Candid, Obsessed, Agile, empowered leadership, never settle, one team mentality) is such a solid foundation for everything that happens here.

Professionally I can't imagine what you'd be wanting more out of a company that is going to grow around you by way of your success.","None at the time of this writing. Every position/employer has it's bumps and with the ""pros"" as foundational as they are here, i can't imagine any cons will be long lived."

I couldn't ask for a better place to work. Highly recommend to anyone.",One of the only thing that comes to mind is it really is fast moving. Some people really could not handle the speed and agility the job brings.

Huge resources for professional development -- plenty of room for career growth","Keep an eye on your work-life balance. It can be hard to maintain boundaries in such a demanding work environment.

Things can be a bit... macho, but it's hard to fault a powertool company for that

Very little nice outdoor space available at the brookfield office. Plenty of room for a 20 acre parking lot, though

Location, location, location -- Brookfield is a bit of an exurban dead-zone, so be prepared to commute from downtown MKE or Tosa if you want to be near any action.

386,Milwaukee Tool,Great opportunities but poor culture,2020-07-20,3.0,Territory Manager,The product is innovative and has a reputation for durability. You have opportunities to grow quickly within this fast paced environment.,"The pay does not match the amount of work and time put in, you constantly feel like you are drowning in presentations and calls. The downside to a growing company is the promotion of people who have no idea what they're doing and add more work to your agenda. Not the employees fault as the manager is usually stretched so thin they can spare the time and it's on the job training most of the time"
387,Milwaukee Tool,"Exciting, confident, relentless, and more to come!",2020-07-16,5.0,Engineering,"The overall culture at MT is that there is no obstacle that we cannot meet and beat. Both internal (rapid sales gains, relentless hiring, etc.) and external challenges ( Competitors, Tariffs, Covid-19, etc.) are met with agility and a common goal of breaking through. 
Career growth opportunities are abundant due to our continued focus on staff skills, training, and providing experiences to be challenged.","Sometimes it can appear that the workload can be disproportionate between departments, not uncommon across industries I think, but steps are being taken to communicate and better divide and conquer."

Make a point to be anti-environmental, such as getting rid of ALL recycling in the building, routinely telling stores to just throw the lithium batteries in the trash instead of recycling, and banning you from bringing in any reusable containers to use on the salad bar and thus forcing you to use the crappy one-time-use plastic container. Speaking of which, the salad bar is the only thing that is actually edible for food there - I never got through a single hot meal as it was disgusting and/or was either raw on the inside or completely overcooked. I even got food poisoning twice. It's also a very Bro culture and witnessed coworkers routinely talking down to female colleagues."
391,Milwaukee Tool,I look forward to going to work everyday.,2020-07-07,5.0,Jobsite Solutions Market Manager,The culture here is amazing and you are able to grow at your own pace. There is also something special with how my teammates and I interact. Everyone that works here is focused on two main goals; achieve number one market share in every product category and developing friendships with co-workers that will last a lifetime.,It can be difficult work to some. I enjoy the flexibility and thrive in a work environment where I am allowed to make the decisions that I believe are best for my market. But some people need more structure and line by line need instructions on how to go about their day.

402,Milwaukee Tool,Empire Level Acquisition by Milwaukee Tool,2020-06-02,5.0,Manager,"In June of 2014 Empire Level Manufacturing, a fifth-generation family-owned business established in 1919, was acquired by Milwaukee Tool. At the time of the acquisition, there was a great deal of trepidation and uncertainty felt by all Empire employees, as is common with most acquisitions. What was uncommon was the zeal and eagerness with which positive change took place. Long-needed investments in equipment, process refinement and staffing, demonstrated in short order that Wisconsin manufacturing was not only a priority for Milwaukee Tool but also a passion. This passion was further demonstrated through an aggressive drive toward safety improvements, cleanliness, organization and efficiency. Bolstered by the marketing prowess of Milwaukee Tool, demand for Empire product increased dramatically as did our capacity to manufacture through the purchase and integration of automation and state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment. It is worth boasting that as efficiencies increased with automation, we continued to hire and train additional skilled and entry level production workers due to the increased demands for Empire and Milwaukee Tool products.
In addition to an unmatched benefits package, Milwaukee Tool intently provides and promotes opportunity for advancement. Job opportunities have commonly crossed over between Milwaukee's Brookfield campus and Mukwonago Manufacturing as well as opportunities within manufacturing, promoting from within whenever possible. The clean, organized, climate-controlled facility in Mukwonago has become a showplace for the new age of manufacturing. 
“Never satisfied, always improving” is the mantra we live by; employee input is highly regarded and promoted with a ‘Continuous Improvement’ suggestion board that is reviewed routinely and acted upon by the entire management staff. Like many of my coworkers, I look forward to the challenges and rewards that arise every day.","Perhaps due to Mukwonago’s relatively rural location without mass transit access, sustaining the growing need for good entry level positions can be challenging."

Also, upper management plans ahead well, allowing us to weather difficult times with minimal job loss. Middle management has your back, ans most managers/directors started in the lower tiers and worked their way up. A friendly atmosphere. You can sit and have a coffee with a director of a department, and you will be treated just like anyone else. Upward movement is encouraged, but you are not punished if you wish to become a ""master"" at your trade. Diverse workforce and diverse opportunity. Many people transition laterally to different functions. Very fun place to work. You will not ever be told that your idea isn't going to work. You will be encouraged to try it.

I love working with passionate peers who are just as driven as me.","The amount of work that is expected is completely off balance with the pay scale. Several peers work weekends back to back just to attempt to manage with the workload. Rather than recognizing this as an issue, leadership gives feedback like ""You do whatever it takes to get the job done."" Additionally, we are expected to travel nonstop, which is a lot to put on people and has an effect on personal lives. I would love to stay here and watch my career progress, but I cannot imagine doing so with the current work life balance. I hope the company recognizes this and continues to hire."

Milwaukee Tool has a decent amount of brand equity within WI or workers in the trades.,"The culture lacks meaningful diversity and inclusion strategies and efforts. So far, I've seen a very white male dominant culture - often resulting in chauvinistic and discriminatory practices. I've also witnessed unprofessional outbursts from senior leaders (ex. CFO and President Power Tools) include but not limited to yelling at employees during meetings, talking/laughing with each other while lower level employees are presenting, and making jokes about peoples appearances (stature, clothes, etc.) in public forums. 

While they ""started"" a diversity and inclusion effort more formally on 2/26/20, it's limited and doesn't address the core issues. In fact, they adjusted the objective of the initiative to delivery ""diversity of thought, experience, and background"" but didn't provide measurements of success or mechanism to affect internal culture."

For example, I started at Milwaukee Tool in their Advanced Engineering - Power Tools group researching and implementing new technologies into power tools. A few years in, I was given the opportunity to move to New Product Design - Power Tools to focus on designing power tools to meet detailed user needs and drive projects to aggressive schedules. After building my knowledge of our ME design process I became interested in cross functional team's processes and the business case around why we select the projects we do.

Most projects require working with several different areas of the company.  Great benefits.  Company has continued growth and great vision for the future.

463,Milwaukee Tool,Unrealistic Project Schedules Results in Fire-Fight Culture,2019-11-21,2.0,Design Engineer II,Projects can be very interesting as they are tools that you will likely use at home.,"Milwaukee tool does a poor job of properly scheduling, planning, and executing on projects. Nearly all projects end up as a fire fight for the last 3-4 months. Management will then pull additional people to fight the current fire but then the projects those pulled resources were responsible will suffer as well with another fire fight on later on those projects. This results in a continuous never-ending cycle and culture of fire fighting without any plan to improve the situation. Management is happy enough with the status quo because they have bonus structures in place to incentivize pushing lower level engineers to work extremely long hours to maintain schedules. Management does not care about employee burnout and turnover is starting to become a large problem with increasing amounts of engineers leaving the company due to the excessive work hours and below average pay given the amount of hours management requires."

I never feel like I don't have a voice or platform to succeed personally.,"Petty complaints but usually from ""non-big-picture"" people who only care about how something affects them directly rather than how it affects everyone in the organization.  Those same people expect to do the minimum but be rewarded for exceeding expectations. When that doesn't happen or they don't get their way, the negative, biting comments and reviews ensue.

They throw most of the resources they have at that.","If you work in supply chain, however, you are seen as at the beckon call of sales and marketing. There is no collaboration. Only being told by sales what is going to happen, and then the supply chain has to make it happen. Supply Chain should be advisers to the sales team, and provide solutions. Not the other way around. Home Depot runs the supply chain decisions being made, to the point that the other channels and customers get left behind and neglected. Service levels of 98% are only met because of service to Home Depot (who sit at near 100% fill rate most months). This is not sustainable, and the company would do well to re-evaluate how it runs and treats the supply chain team."

That can mean long days and a plate so full of work that it can feel overwhelming at times. The organization knows that the successful employees will find a way to achieve in spite of these challenges and will continue to push you.

That is because Milwaukee is owned by TTI, and TTI and the shareholders dictate what's happening.  You are expected to live and breathe work, especially if you're a manager or on sallary.

There is an extremely high level of respect between employees at all levels. There is no pecking order and upper management makes sure to engage with every single employee.
-Everyone is busy, but strangers will take time out of their day to help you complete a task. 
-There is lots of autonomy, even for a Engineer I. You will be given basically total control of your project from the beginning.
-The company is not afraid to spend money. Anything you need for your work, you can just put it on your corporate card.
-Massive in-house prototyping shop for mechanical parts.
-Most people can flex their time (some managers are more-flexible than others).","-You get thrown in the deep end right away. There is a self guided onboarding process, but a lot of it is outdated. I didn't have time to review it due to my workload.
- You will need to be humble and ask questions a lot, which is usually handled well by more experienced co-workers.
- Agressive project schedules can be difficult to manage. Delays are inevitable, so there is buffer built-in to any project. Management will be generally understanding if you support your reasoning with hard data.
-Electronics lab isn't as advanced as prototyping shop, but they're working to address that.
-Design work is test and data driven, which leads to scrap and wasted time. Little emphasis is placed on model-based design."

It's nice to be able to dress casually - jeans every day, etc. 

I like being able to travel every once in a while to visit customers and distribution centers. 

Benefits are great - excellent health care coverage, 401K contribution and matching. 

Work life balance was something I was able to take into my own hands. When I first started, I felt like I was on call, but my manager established the expectations so I don't check my work phone when I'm home.","Supply Chain roles are not defined, there are no set processes, task of defining this is assigned to employees instead of being provided by leadership. 

The pay is literal garbage. The impact our team has on the business as a whole is not even remotely close to proportional to the salary we receive. 

Not everyone is respectful of the work life balance. Some people work 24 hours a day.

Company value of being ""candid"" only applies to men. Women are frequently told to ""watch their tone"" while men frequently and consistently  behave rudely. This company can be quite sexist."

Your voice is heard, at least in my department.  
Richman is a true leader VERY inspiring! 
It's not always about making money it's about being the best at what we do and what we make. 
The reason it's not for everyone is if you think your going to come in and work 9-5 and sit at your computer all day, sorry no. Milwaukee expects results, they go the extra mile for you, you should give them more in return. Employers pay for 8 hours of ""work"" not 8 hours of ""time"" make sure you are giving more than you receive!","I really can't think of any cons but if you want to call this a con I work 10-12 hours per day, but I like working so I have no problem putting in extra time.

However, some of that does come at a great personal sacrifice when the demands of the job makes you choose between your family and the job.  Could be a great opportunity for younger less experienced professionals, but it can grow tiresome quickly for more senior workers with a family.","As the title states, it is VERY white male dominant culture.   This company works very closely with the team in China and the people there are all treated as children - follow directions and not allowed to think critically.  The few that tries, are severely punished when they make mistakes, which makes the rest less willing to follow that path.  In the end, actions speak louder than words and the fact that they have a white male senior VP in the China factory for many years (as long as I have been there).  In addition, all of the high level VP in every department is white male except for HR (very typical).  In the end, it doesn't matter if you are good at what you do.  What matter is that you look like everyone else in management and can say the right thing to the right people and not say the wrong thing that offends the wrong people."

616,Milwaukee Tool,Incredible company and culture,2017-11-15,5.0,Engineering Manager,"I've built my career at Milwaukee Tool in challenging engineering roles for just over 20 years.  Compensation and benefits are good, I've never found a good reason to move on.  I've always had opportunity to advance my career and continue to learn.  Especially over the past 10 years, the aggressive growth and furious pace of new product development have been exciting to be a part of.  I can't say enough about the unique culture here.  Milwaukee management takes the time to recognize our accomplishments and pay it forward.   For example, they rewarded us with an impressive workout facility after delivering a key strategic initiative.  Milwaukee has been very profitable, and the best part about that is we continue to invest in key technology to drive innovation.  As an engineer, that means new toys to play with ;)   We have milestone celebrations where the whole campus shuts down, we bring in food and beverages, and the company band plays.   Other fun perks include Brewers and Bucks games, team building events, annual bowling tournament, annual golf outing, summer picnic, and many more.  I really enjoy the youth that has been injected into our culture.  Mentoring bright young engineers fresh out of college has been very rewarding for me.  Personally, the best part about working at Milwaukee is our reputation.  When I am out in social situations, I always ask what people do for a living.  I listen to their story and I can't wait to tell them that I work for Milwaukee Tool.  Almost every time they know the company, love the product, and conversation takes off from there.   I am truly proud to be part of an such an awesome company and culture.","Growth is a good problem to have.  We've had to work around building expansions, parking lot expansions, etc..."
617,Milwaukee Tool,Intern,2017-11-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The coworkers are great and make you feel very welcome and supported. There is always someone around to help you if you have any questions. The projects I got to work on were varied so I never had a dull day. I gained experience in all areas of my field and had a nice mix of easier projects and projects that challenged me. Pay is great especially for an internship and the work enviornment provides space for collaboration, individual work, and lots of natural lighting. Management was amazing and willing to help tailor your experience to your career goals as well as allowing you to work on a flexible schedule.","As with any job, the workload fluctuated. There were times I had plenty of projects to work on and a few times I struggled to keep busy. Past orientation, there were not many events to help interns in different departments get to know each other."

619,Milwaukee Tool,Think before you go for the interview,2017-10-14,1.0,Picker,It's a job if you're desperate as I was.,"There are so many things wrong with the company. Nobody knows what is going on, If you ask 5 supervisors, leads and upper management you will get 5 different answers. 
There is really not any room for advancement unless you are a favorite. Experience does not matter, it's who you know. 
You are suppose to do a certain number of picks per hour, no errors, etc. or you will be talked to and or written up. I've yet to find anyone who has been written up. I've been hearing this since I started. You are never acknowledged if you do a good job, but they are quick to point out 1 mistake, nothing is done about the mistake, but they let you know.
Everyone gets the same raise. Doesn't matter if you do your job or not.
Also, if you work on 3rd shift, you can sleep on the job, have your picture taken and shown to HR and still keep your job. How cool is that?
I left a job with the same problems. I know all companies have their problems and they are not perfect. But there is such a thing as treating employees with respect, dignity and recognizing employees who truly do a good job and actually care. But this company does not do these things and I am on the search for something else."

628,Milwaukee Tool,Industrial channel Rep.,2017-08-25,3.0,Territory Manager,"This is a Great physician and a great job to put on your resume. Company provides company truck and allows personal use.. phone.. computer.. printer, dental vision and health insurance that is above par, expense account with nearly unlimited funding, great pay for age, customers that are already selected and consistently purchasing, great training, good computer systems, demo tools, flexibility with work schedule, about 12 days of vacation, company events are like parties - No Expense Spared","Many people in this company burn out quickly because corporate will not allow more sales reps to cover larger geographical areas. Customer service is overworked and can get upset with customers that call in. Shipping is a disaster. Reps are consistently pulled in many different directions yet expected to complete assignments quickly follow up with customers consistently and go above and beyond in all areas in addition to fixing errors made by corp issues. There is simply no time to do all that company desires. This is a very fast paced company with many different promotions, responsibilities, initiatives, and frequent changes that convolute your job and confuse customers. 

If you value your family and if you are trying to keep a good work-life balance, being in sales with Milwaukee might not be for you. Many reps travel consistently but some reps stay in hotels 100-200 nights a year. Company has an extensive non-compete that includes not only competition but Will keep you out of the industry for a period of one year after leaving. Company has an elitist culture that is created by the training and ego of managers who have raised through the ranks very quickly. By the time you are completely on boarded, you are definitely ""drinking the cool aid""."

652,Milwaukee Tool,New Product Powerhouse,2016-12-28,4.0,Engineering Manager,Very aggressive company going after their competition and new markets/competitors.  Great processes in the areas that matter which give teams a framework but do not provide too much red tape.  Mostly excellent people to work with in engineering and extending outwards to other cross-functional areas needed to launch new products.  Rewards high performance.  Many growth opportunities for those that want it and demonstrate success in current roles.  Hard to get bored.  Good at hiring high quality people which are the most important part of our success.  Smart people at the top (don't try to run BS by them).  Project teams can effectively navigate tough cross-functional decisions with escalation and culture of making the right decision after getting the facts out there.,"Rapid growth has resulted with some weak leaders in the mix; many are great but inexperience and lack of leadership shows at times.  Can be a little tough for some from other company cultures to ramp up quickly because our culture is kind of intense and there is no ""manual"" for most jobs--entry level engineering on-boarding is solid though.  Work/life balance could get out of control if you let it--communicate/prioritize with your manager.  Product management team is very strong at the top but weak decision making at the bottom can slow down engineering and waste time/effort (a good Project Leader can overcome this)."

Products are high quality and it feels good to know you're helping create a quality product. The tool discount was excellent. Lots of fun parties and department outings.,Upward mobility was limited in IT since there were so many strong hard working coworkers.  The pay was below industry standard for the position and responsibilities. Spending all kinds of money on company parties and team outings isn't enough to boost morale if people are underpaid and given limited opportunities for growth.

Some of the middle management is young and inexperienced,
A bit cliquey here; It helps to fit with the right people.

Company is out of touch with employees at the ground level, especially manufacturing, central repair, and the branches. They send down demands with no idea what is going on below them.
Company overall seems to be constantly putting out fires while simultaneously trying to find an identity.
Company is full of veteran employees that have drank gallons upon gallons of the kool-aid, but things changed, and now they're just grumpy old bullies that will eventually leave.
Mostly discriminatory. Many assumptions are made regarding age, religion, skin color, sexual orientation - all of which is totally unnecessary in today's culture."

There are a few reviews on here that criticize work/life balance. I personally do not see this as a problem - those with the 60+ hour weeks are typically self inflicted. There is a ton of support here and everyone is pulling together. You just need to be mature enough to ask for help if you need it. 

Of all the employers in the Milwaukee area, this has got to be one of the best organizations. There's a boat load of growth potential for the company and for your career. Highly recommended.","Don't be intimidated by the ""not for the faint of heart"" stigma. This is true but if you are a hard worker looking to do good work, rise up to the challenge. The one thing I will say is there could be some more diversity in the workplace though this has been improving as the company grows.

I was in my territory for well over a year and never had a manager work with me. Management does not have your back, which does not make you want to work hard for them.

Milwaukee is growing like wild fire because their engineers are developing the best products out there. Great training. Great people.,"As a Territory Rep (which you're actually an Account Manager) you are traveling non stop. Don't listen when they say you get 1 week a month in your home territory or 1 office day a week. Prepare to live out of a suitcase for your time there. Long work hours because you're a one-man-show. That means you're not just selling and reporting your sales. You're doing all the advertising, marketing, and you are the customer service, and you're doing it all late at night and in a different hotel room every night. The work load is ridiculous so you're better off not even paying rent for an apartment because you'll only sleep in your bed a handful of times each month.

Archaic ordering methods don't make your life any easier or less time consuming.

Zero commissions on sales. Lack of incentives won't drive a sales team. Being told ""You should be lucky you're selling Milwaukee tools."" doesn't help pay any student loans."

Bad decisions made by Sr. Management because they have their hands too far down- they should be focuses on strategy and improving a declining culture.  Culture is arrogance and favoritism.  Makes it difficult to enjoy when you know Sr. Managers put people down, black list them and walk around with a sense of superiority.  Place is getting so crowded that it's not pleasant anymore.  They saw this growth coming years ago so why they haven't addressed it sooner is beyond me.  If you join the company and don't drink the Kool-Aid your time will be marked.

Other companies do not understand the importance of product development like Milwaukee does.  Every day is exciting here and I always feel empowered to make decisions that directly affect our bottom line.,I think sometimes we lose focus on the end goal and our long term strategy and become too reactionary to the demands of our biggest customer Home Depot.

Dewalt's former sales management was co opted by former Dewalt CEO and now current Milwaukee Tool CEO Joe Galli. It seems any ties with Dewalt gets you promoted around here. There is a philosophy,brought by Joe Galli, to recruit young, good looking college kids straight out of school. If you happen to have been a college wrestler, then you are likely to get preferencial treatment as Joe Galli is a former wrestler. Anyway, pay is inadaquate and work load is exhausting. This company resembles a cult like experience. You have to look the part at all times. Gain 10 lbs too much and your job is on the line. Let your hair grow a little and your manager will take notice. These superficial trait seem to matter more than being good at what you do. Unless you are into self torture, I highly recommend looking elsewhere as I am doing now. Heed my advice.

In three years, I over performed on my over drive number, and not only was I not awarded anymore than people who had not, they did not pay me my full commission because of upload issues with our CRM system. 

You will be required to track down 80% of your clients receipts, scan them, and upload them to the CRM system. If anything goes wrong, or if your clients refuse to give you your receipts, they simply will not pay you your commission. 

There is no cost of living adjustment. I was forced to live in shabby run down apartments while generating three times the amount of revenue than those in the middle of the country, but they are paid the same, and are not shy about rubbing it in how they can afford a four bedroom house, a car, a boat, all on the same salary, with a mortgage less than what you pay for rent in a big city. If you complain, Milwaukee will first act as if you are ungrateful, than simply tell you ""we don't provide a cost of living adjustment"". 

You will have 8 or 9 different people telling you what to do, on top of your normal day to day requirements, and if you do not deliver on everyone's requests, you will be fired. 

This is a churn and burn environment. They will take you in after college, teach you, build you up, pay you nothing, then when you get to the point where you deserve more money, they will simply force you out of the company with embarrassingly low salary offers, or simply come up with a reason to fire you, and hand your clients over to a younger rep whose too naive to know to ask to for the money they're worth."

Company growth has been good",About a year and a half ago the company made some very bad decisions.  People got let go that were change agents and challenged the cultural decline that was happening.  People got promoted to levels they were not competent in just because they were favored by some.  Everything has now become about individual advancement and not a team effort to win in the market place.  The face the organization puts on to the press and their customers is 180 degrees different than what the internal culture is.  Instead of trying to change the culture (which will be hard now that the cultural drivers were let go the past few years) they search out those to talk bad about them and squelch  their voices.  They monitor these reviews and try to figure out who is writing them...I'm guessing they even ask or require some of employees to write favorable reviews to offset the bad ones.  This is they type of organization and leadership they have become.
746,Milwaukee Tool,Great Sales Start,2015-07-06,4.0,Sales,"Perfect place to start a career in sales.  There is tons of opportunity for advancement if you are willing to move.  Every year or so you can promote if you are hard working and motivated to learn.  You get a company truck, gas card, expense account, iphone, laptop and fax machine/printer.   You can drive the vehicle on your personal time and do not pay for gas.  Brand recognition, innovative products and aggressive product launching help to increase opportunity.  Benefits are pretty good.","Work/life balance is not very good.  To promote you almost always have to move.  If you keep turning down promotions you will end up blacklisted, forced out or fired.  All sales positions have low base pay.  Only receive a 5K raise for each promotion.  Very aggressive bonus structures are paid out annually only (zero commission).

Given the freedom to essentially manage myself as long as my work is getting done. Lots of collaboration with team members. Exciting to see products ive worked on shelves in store in sometimes less than 12 months. Excellent cafeteria and gym facilities. Lots of passionate people working in all the departments.,The amount of projects forced thru on a yearly basis can be overwhelming if you don't manage your time.

- Use of ""information power is rampant. Manager and senior employees always withhold information in effort to retain power, not knowing people have little respect for them."
782,Milwaukee Tool,Many feel the company is headed for a crash High turn over and employees are jaded.,2014-09-24,1.0,Senior Engineer,Paychecks clear. Free coffee. I like my co-workers but wish there was not such a bad turnover.,"The company has grown so fast they have lost control and many employees are disgusted with the place, there is little to no motivation to work harder and do a good job as overall communication in the company is a complete failure and managers never provide clear guidelines so many no longer care and just consider it a paycheck job - its not a career there.  

Turnover hurts everyone there, seems every few weeks whomever was supporting your projects has  quit or was let go. They expect you to give them 110%, yet compensation has been getting worse the last decade as raises are at the point of  insultingly small and bonus for all but the executives and managers are practically non-existent, all while the company is making record sales. There really is no incentive for most employees to work hard considering the company does not reward efforts, working late and missing time with family is the norm. And despite them gutting all the benefits and performance compensation we are expected to work all day and when home with the family, leave them hanging every night to field conference calls for hours from the engineering teams in China. 

Even worse is how terrible the test labs are. There is a small handful of good technicians but they are always busy and all the engineers can't get even basic support. The labs look like pig-styes!! So the engineers often have to step in the lab themselves and do the technician's tests - which means an extra 10 hours a week of unpaid time on top of the late night conference call we do not get compensated for either. When we speak with the technicians they definitely are not happy there, one even told me he feels as if ""the company feels technicians are second class citizens and to upper management we do not exist."" He said all the technicians had their Christmas and performance bonuses taken away a few years ago and it makes them sick seeing the company spending uncontrollably on items such as tens of thousands for liquor at marketing get togethers (the infamous $50K tequila parties....), tens of millions for decorating executive offices. But try to get a $500 piece of equipment required to run a mandatory test and you are told no. 

So the company pushes to have tests done in China, so now we have to wait months for them to complete the 
tests but they are ALWAYS done wrong and you ALWAYS get bad data - yet projects are pushed through even when they do not work right. The big joke is we have the customer be the ""Guinea Pigs: to test the products. 

15 years ago it was a great company. 10 years ago the Chinese bought it and you know what they think about workers hours, benefits and compensation. 9 years ago they took everyone's profit sharing away. 8 years ago they started laying off all the long time employees who had the knowledge of the products  and they gutting benefits more.  Then they went on massive hiring sprees to get young kids out of school to fill all the openings as they will will work the long hours but turnover is big!. 5 years ago the technicians tell me they all stopped getting Christmas and performance bonuses. It just disgust many what has happened to this place and the repeat failures in leadership 

Ironically, every company meeting they have they parade up the executives and brag how great sales are, how great has been the growth and how much money the company is making, and do not realize many in the audience get angry when they hear that as they all remember how many benefits had been taken away and they just pretend to be happy workers, but afterwards leave and talk about how bad things are now for all bit the executives. 

I am part of the fortunate few who are not managers or executives but get great pay. But since the majority around me are not compensated well, it hurts my ability to complete projects. Because of my pay I have been complacent about leaving but know to have a real career I would need to go to a company that did not have so many internal failures. That will be my next new year's resolution."

On one hand the company publically touts themselves as being a world leader in Lithium Ion battery and cell technology but behind closed doors we have to delay critical battery testing several times each week since there is no test lab area dedicated for testing. This is the norm and has been going on for years.

The company does not hesitate to spend large amounts to make a new marketing area or remodel an area as into a showplace to take our distributors around on tours, but when it comes to the core technical areas, testing required for product development you would swear the company is bankrupt.

They had a record sales year, and the pay and bonuses were the worst, workers are really disappointed with how the company had been going backwards in their compensation to their hardest working and most committed employees. 

The company wastes a lot of time with poor communications from the top down. It is just too common to have duplicate efforts on the same work. We spends hours everyday in useless meeting and you look around and everyone is just surfing the internet on phones.

Expect to be ignored if you try and say good morning to any upper management when you pass them in the halls.

795,Milwaukee Tool,In Crisis.....,2013-02-20,2.0,Mechanical Engineer,"Very laid back - jeans and T-shirt environment,  often lower ""ranked"" employees looked more like top management than the actual management.","In the companies focus on trying to steal management from competitors they have become very top heavy and crippled by meetings. It was easier to get a half a dozen managers in a meeting than to get a single technician to test the product you are engineering.

In the rush to beat the competition to market, the accompanying rush to get  out products left many things desired for quality. We wasted more time chasing the fires caused by issues rushing around does than being proactive. The push gave us no choice but to do the absolute minimum development, testing and documentation. Often we had to ask was  can cut out so we can make some deadline marketing gave to a customer. It felt like the management focus is that the product goes out whether it was ready or not as it was more important to fill a shelf . The culture was that you can always later get the whole department to stop what they are working on for a few days to engineer some quick fix than to on deal with the fallout from a bad product. 

It seemed the company looks more at profit as a sign of their doing well, than anything else. As profits for the company went up, benefits went down for most employees except management which has grown in size. When I was there they eliminated all of the worker's profit sharing and even took away our Thanksgiving turkey - talk about being out of touch! 

Promotions came two ways - seems you are guaranteed promotions just if you are in management, but for the rest of the company, promotions usually only meant more more with minimal increase in compensation."
