They live up to the company’s mission and vision. They take care employees and give each branch a good budget to recognize and reward people for a job well done. Company is growing like crazy opening up many opportunities.,It’s hard to request more pay if you are needing a little extra.

Great place to have your finances.","Work life balance sucks! Sometimes you have to work while sick, the CEO said he doesn't want anyone working while sick, yet I had to do it. Branches are open until 6pm. You have to work weekends. Management promotes growth only within the company and not goals outside MACU. Meetings or trainings are not communicated well. The training you receive is basic at best and not adequate in any way to consider yourself to help people make huge financial decisions. It takes forever for management to hire people. It's like pulling teeth to ask to do things during work hours, again the work life balance needs major work. Morale is low right now in the branches. Mutual trust and respect is huge in the culture but management is the worst at giving it, even though they preach it the most. Rumors between management and negative perceptions make it hard for you to grow or shake a negative view of yourself. The sales culture is getting out of hand and people are being dishonest and nothing is done when it's reported. Branch employees are paid the same as stay at home employees, might as well stay home and make the same money without having to deal with members in the branch. Career opportunities depend heavily on where you live."

50,Mountain America Credit Union,Toxic,2021-11-14,1.0,Fraud Specialist,Some genuinely amazing people work there.,"The most toxic place I have ever worked. Management does not care, regardless of how much they pretend to. They will turn everything you say around on you and convince you it's your fault. They are pushing out quality people that genuinely care about the members of the credit union and making a difference. The team is in a constant burned out state due to the amount of turn over and significant increase in work volumes. They promote giving others the benefit of the doubt, but it is never given in return. Respect goes a long way and it's severely lacking at MACU. I have never felt as disrespected in a workplace as I have here. Even seeing promotions painting the place as the most amazing place to work makes me sick."

There is still a huge lack of diversity at the top in regards to minorities and women. For years you would only see white families in their advertising.

Management does not take feedback well. You will only be treated well if you’re performing well. Poorly managed all around.

They work on and improve the negatives within the company.","Some departments might have some negative management views or relations. The department of service center loans had some issues with negativity, stuffy approach to employees that lead to a high level of gossip which was addressed and felt as though it wasn’t always a safe environment to discuss issues or training needs but this was resolved with my personal manager and seemed to have been addressed across the board. To be clear though, my last three managers are amazing and loved working with them. So negatives are a little thing because the company has excellent policies and does improve bad. 

One negative I would say that was not addressed is that the pay for loan officer is not competitive. Hourly is good but insensitive for online apps are only paid on additional products and not loan volume for the online mobile apps. Other cus pay for that which would drastically effect pay. Btw I did see good loan officers leave for this exact reason. Pay competitiveness is very important to keeping qualified, motivated and high performing people."

As a whole, the department had a good marketing base to work with. However, using the expertise you are hired for to take the credit union above and beyond the status-quo was a hurdle. Marketing is difficult to achieve if each discipline is operated in a silo. There is a lack of communication between disciplines and in some instances; communication between employees is frowned upon. This makes it very difficult and frustrating to produce great marketing.

Another thing I witnessed over the past couple of years is the hiring of high level individuals who were hired for their top talent, only to see them fail in the position because they were hired to do one thing and only allowed to do very little. These individuals were very restricted but measured by goals that were un-achievable because they were not allowed to perform the way the needed to."

The marketing leaders are terrible. They punish people for being innovative and trying to better themselves professionally. They say they want employees to come to them with concerns, but punish them when they do. They don't empower their employees to be marketing thought leaders, they hinder them. If you're considering working in MACU's marketing department--don't do it. I am one of many people looking to leave once the right opportunity comes along.

There is room for some growth , pay is good with annual raises.","PTO and sick days are separate and they BLOW. Im part time, I got a part time job for school, I didnt expect to only accrue 8 days PTO for the whole year. Plus when youre sick they deduct it from your PTO. Training sucks, and the worst part is that everyone knows it, you get to your branch and know how to do absolutely nothing. On top of wasting a week for training only to show up and have to learn on your own, they push ""sales"" on all their employees, I loved MACU so much at first because it was the first job that didnt push me to force sell anything and truly felt like they focused on members, a few months in I realize they want you to mention products to EVERY member, its not only insincere but also hassling members, they disguise it as ""free products that help better members lives"" and some truly do but most people can research them on their own and dont want a 15 min conversation about Investments when they come in to deposit a check. The only way to move up is to know people, management is incompetent as they just came from different internal departments and have no background in management at all, not even degrees in semi related fields (my branch has been through 3 sets of asst man. and gen. man. in the last 6 months.)"

There is a reason there is such high turnover here and it's because people get hired, obtain experience then move on to a higher paying bank or other credit union."
332,Mountain America Credit Union,It,2015-04-21,4.0,,"Medical, Vision, Dental, PTO, Holidays, Corporate Level Compensation, Excellent CEO Sterling Nielsen, a board who takes pride in MACU, training programs, high level leader access and communication, etc..  The BIGGEST pro is the culture.  As employees, we get paid to help members.  Our Vision is to ""Help Our Members Achieve Their Financial Dreams"".  The directives that align our efforts are pure and transparent as they come from our CEO down the line.  The future of this organization is exciting.  I love that this is not a company for a person who wants to get comfortable in their job.  If you don’t want challenge and change, MACU is not for you.","Compensation for job responsibilities in branches:  Loan and New Account Officers are member solution experts, processors and quality assurance agents on top of the typical work load of front line employees.  The myriad of skills this requires on both the people interaction and processing sides is a difficult set to find naturally in new hires.  Quality of work is heavily scrutinized at a branch level.  Directly competing institutions have departments of people that address errors and processing MACU handles on the front line.  This makes MACU better able to address member needs in a timely manner.  Our compensation in this area is only competitive with our peers.  We are asking much more of employees and paying the same (this is not true of the majority of our corporate level positions).  The higher expectations are similar for Branch Managers, Assistant Managers, Tellers, etc.  If not for our culture (company pride, belief in our mission, respectful environment, etc.) we would have much higher turnover than the industry averages in our branches.  You will get amazing training and coaching at MACU, but you are expected to work very hard in many different areas that may detract from your primary job responsibility of helping our members.
Another important factor is that front line employees are incented to save our members money.  The more money they can save a member, the better the incentive to them is.  This can be very lucrative for employees with the right skillsets.  
Work Life Balance in Branches: Staffing is a major point of interest for any organization, but MACU is running LEAN in the branches.  If staffed fully, most locations perform well with experienced employees.  Even operating within generally accepted turnover rates, this model falls short due to the learning curve of a new employee.  When employees are out on PTO, attending required training, FMLA, newly trained, etc., MACU is unable to offer what it does best, high class service.  Staffing models used for Saturday branch coverage complicates this further.  It's not uncommon for hourly branch employees to work 6 days a week 2 out of 4 Saturdays."

I know that management within my department has been soliciting people within the department to write ""positive"" reviews..  I am actively looking for new employment. The buck continues to be passed, as excuses are made for everyone within our department being unhappy or leaving. These excuses include ""someone has to make the hard decisions, and people don't like those decisions sometimes and leave."" The attrition issues within our department, from my opinion, has more to do with the way people are treated than with the decisions that are being made by the department leaders. I've never worked somewhere where there is a larger disconnect between middle-management and their employees. There is no effort to get to know their employees, become their friends, know about their families and personal lives, etc. In fact, the opposite couldn't be more true. It's almost as though there is a deliberate attempt NOT to connect with employees at a personal level. In addition, there is a ""hire external"" first mentality that prohibits talented individuals from getting promotions and opportunities within the marketing department."

Management truly cares about the employees and proves it through above average compensation, great benefits, and a strong work-life balance.  They hire talented people and allow them to use their talents to the best of their ability.  My co-workers were all intelligent, well-qualified, and a pleasure to work with.  Everyone was willing to do what it takes to help each other out in achieving common goals.  I left the company because I had the opportunity to take a position that really advanced my career.

I have read a few of the negative reviews on this site, particularly in regards to the Marketing department, and I would like to say that I disagree with most of what has been said. My experience has been very positive. I feel like I have a very open line of communication with my manager. I have never once expressed a concern that wasn't immediately addressed. 

I work with great people, and I am empowered and trusted to do my job without  people looking over my shoulder. The compensation is more than fair. It seems like Mountain America takes the hiring process very seriously and they do their best to hire individuals who have standards that line up with company objectives and goals. They also seems to go to great lengths to keep those individuals happy.","I hesitate to list this as a con, but I can't think of many other things, so I'll discuss it here. The Credit Union is growing at such a rapid rate that it can be difficult to prioritize/stay on top of things at times. Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I would certainly prefer it over spending time looking for things to do throughout the day. 

But with that being said, I don't feel like I am asked to put in so much time/work that my life is out of balance. Another thing I really like about here is just that. I feel that my life is very balanced between work and family. I put in a very honest and hard day's work each and every day - but I do not feel like I am asked to work so much that I have to put my family on the back burner. That is very important to me."

As a long time member of the marketing team, I can attest to the positive culture and truly feel the leadership team believes that if employees are treated with respect and feel valued, this will reflect in the quality of service offered to members. This has helped Mountain America win numerous awards for work/life balance and best places to work year after year. Most of these awards are based solely on current employee survey responses. 

One of Mountain America's core values is continuous improvement. This is evident in the opportunities presented to employees to acquire new skills through in-house training, conferences, webinars, community events, etc.

342,Mountain America Credit Union,Poor Leadership Creating Unsatisfactory Work Environment,2015-02-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mountain America has so many great things going.  There are some truly amazing and dedicated people that are doing their best to help members and offer some of the best products and services available in the market.  In addition, the benefits are above average and there is a pretty good work/life balance.  The company as a whole is growing and strives to be on the cutting edge with many of the systems and products/services offered to members.  As with many companies, it really comes down to which area you work in that will determine your perspective.","I just recently learned about this site and was encouraged by former co-workers to write a review in hopes that it would help to bring some changes to the marketing area.  I have read some of the reviews that others have written and can certainly relate to most of the challenges mentioned.  I am one of the people involved in the “mass exodus” from the marketing area, and can confirm that I wasn’t given an exit interview when I left (on my own, and on good terms).  I was disappointed because I had some constructive feedback that I think could have helped.  
 
My biggest concerns stem from my interactions with top leadership in marketing.  There seems to be a severe lack of leadership and lack of strategy/ direction at the top.  It was evident to me that top leadership felt threatened by the talent of many of the team members rather than tapping into that talent to really grow the business.  Fear tactics were used regularly, with somewhat of a “bully” mentality.  There is no dissemination of strategy or budget because of a fear that “everybody is trying to copy”.  This limits the ability of team members to really bring their best ideas and solutions to the table.  The lack of oversight by executive leaders brings concern to me for the whole organization.  
 
If somebody is evaluating whether they want to work for this company, read each of the reviews carefully.  As mentioned earlier, the area in which you work really makes a difference in your overall opinion of the company.  It should be noted that I personally witnessed multiple individuals suffer repercussions from approaching HR with concerns.  That is a scary sign for me, I would hope that they would be looking out for the company as a whole.  My experience also makes me question the executive team as they (from an outside perspective) seem to be ignoring the issues."

I would stay for years if it weren't for some of the challenges within my department.","There are a lot challenges within the marketing area specifically. This includes lack of leadership and direction. Marketing is set-up as a relatively flat department, with ultimately only one person being given any power to make decisions. Most of the decisions are not explained to the employees, and there is no transparency that would allow the department to work more collaboratively. When such collaboration is attempted, it is quickly thwarted and people are put in situations where they have to choose to put themselves in jeopardy trying to do what is the correct thing to do for the business versus what is the politically correct thing to do in order not to get in trouble."

There are some innovative things happening there, especially for a credit union.","There has been a recent mass exodus in the marketing department (after 2-3 years of a steady flow of people leaving).  My understanding is that only one or two of the people that left were given exit interviews to determine why so many people are unhappy.  This to me, speaks of a systemic problem within the company where problems in leadership are continually overlooked by HR and Executive Leadership.  If you are considering employment here, be extremely cautious.  The company does an excellent job of touting the awards that they apply for as a reason to work there, but I would challenge any potential candidates to speak candidly with people that have experienced the reality of working there.  I think this applies more to the corporate side of things as the retail side (branches) seems to be slightly better, however, I am sure it is a matter of time before it trickles down to them."

It is not overly stressful and allows for a good work life balance.,"A lot of external hiring, which limits the ability to be promoted.  The culture is changing slowly to that more like a high pressure sales banking environment.  The pay is lower than other financial institutions.  Starting to sacrifice the work life balance in favor of the member experience (opening on Saturdays)"
364,Mountain America Credit Union,Turning into a bank which is not the philosophy of a credit union.,2012-11-03,1.0,Manager,Decent benefits (no better than any other financial institution I would assume). Bank holidays are always nice.,"I've worked at MACU, one other credit union, and a bank. The bank (the predominant bank in the state) was the best of them all. Why does MACU need to move into markets that already have credit unions? It dilutes the existing branches, which hurt my job potential."
365,Mountain America Credit Union,Current executive leadership is destroying the company.,2012-11-01,3.0,Management,"This has historically been an amazing company to work for, but times are changing.  That is what happens when inexperienced executives take over.  Pros:  Outside of the executive team, there are many amazing people, pretty good benefits, very nice amenities (work locations etc), and incentive based goals.","Lack of professional and knowledgeable leadership.  This company SEVERELY lacks leadership with integrity and values.  I have watched it slowly crumble over the last years.  Things had been so good that it is taking time to show the signs of the damage they are doing.  Don't expect fair treatment or management based on business reasoning, but rather it is dictated on if you are a member of the predominant religion and if you are part of the ""good old boys"" network.

In a time when the company is experiencing record profit, pass some of that back to the employees, they are the ones really working to make it happen.  Bring back incentive increases that allow employees to actually make a raise, or at least keep up with cost of living increases."

369,Mountain America Credit Union,A growing experience with capable management.,2011-08-23,4.0,Collector,It's a company that cares about it's employee's health and overall well being. There is room for advancement in the company as it continues to grow throughout the Midwest.,There still are some areas of management that could be a little more employee friendly.
