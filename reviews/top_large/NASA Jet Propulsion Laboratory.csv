2,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Great projects and interesting work, poor environment",2022-03-30,3.0,Software Engineer IV,"Really interesting work and projects.
Job stability - once you pass your probation period of 6 months, they can't get rid of you (can be a good or bad thing).","They tend to slice you thin across multiple projects. People can end up working on 4-6 projects at the same time. Talking about being efficient and switching gears...

Lots of micro environments under the same roof. Your happiness and success in this place depends entirely on the team you land in. There are many unhealthy environments, so ask to talk to all team members before joining the team just to get an idea of what the culture is.

Job stability, where after 6 months of probation they can't get rid of you, can be very detrimental to the team. The team can end up with very poor ""specialists"" that are stuck in the group with very little contribution and very little value to add to the project."

15,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Extremely siloed workplace - manager makes or breaks experience,2022-02-12,2.0,Technical Learning and Development Specialist,"Some of the most talented, deeply interesting people I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with are employed by JPL. There is zero shortage of passion and curiosity around the lab. And, of course, the missions are incredible.","I’ve worked in large corporations and in academia and, unfortunately, JPL seems to have embraced the worst of both types of workplaces. The lab is extremely siloed as an organization which means that your immediate supervisor or manager is likely to have an extraordinary influence on your experience. Combined with the fact that hierarchy and years of service at JPL are everything, there appears to be zero accountability for people in positions of power even in cases of discrimination, abuses of power or the like. For anyone interviewing with JPL, I highly recommend you get to know your immediate supervisor(s) and manager(s) as well as possible prior to accepting a position. And beware of gaps between blue-sky descriptions of how things are (e.g., Glassdoor awards) and the day-to-day reality (e.g., retention issues among earlier career professionals). In hindsight, some of the strange and frustrating aspects of the application and interview process (poor communication among people on the JPL side, disrespect for my time, vague and inconsistent descriptions of the role and responsibilities, last minute demands and changes, etc.) were glimpses into what would become some - just some - of the frustrating aspects of being a JPL employee. Get curious about things that seem off during the application and interview phases and you might save yourself some heartache down the road.
The position I was in spanned HR and Business Operations, both extremely political organizations that expend a great deal of resources on maintaining the status quo (and status quo for these ordinary business organizations at JPL is, ironically, 10-15 years behind the private sector) and fear-based leadership. If you are an engineer or research scientist, your experience may be wildly different - and can help one to make sense out of the wide range of reviews here on JPL - but the siloed nature and hyper-localized culture of the lab will still be relevant. It was a heartbreaking decision to leave JPL and a position that, on paper, seemed like a dream opportunity. I can only hope that incoming leadership will help to improve the experience at JPL for a wider variety of employees."

Multiple layers of management, many of whom have contradictory policies for their employees leaves you caught between 2 people above you.
Too much red tape. At the time I left, I had 7 managers. Yes. 7.
Health Insurance is a joke - super expensive except for the cheap HMO and if you've tried finding a doctor in LA that takes new HMO patents, you realize you are getting nothing for your employee contributions.
Zero rasies, minimal raises, given with a smile by your manager who will happily tell you how lucky you are to have this job.
Condescending, harassing culture that is aided by HR. They tell you to report harrassment to HR. Then HR turns around and rats you out to your manager.
Promotions are based solely on whether or not you are personal friends with your manager.
They tout diversity and inclusion but it's just window dressing.
Most of my colleagues were taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs.
Truly an awful work environment.
Salaries cannot keep pace with private industry and since JPL is in Pasadena where a starter home is over $1M, it's not sustainable to work there."

40,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Great Experience,2021-12-07,5.0,Systems Engineer II,"I felt super cared for as an employee here, which obviously depends on the institution as a whole and direct management, both of which were excellent for me. Annual peer reviews keep you thinking about your work product and goals. There is also a lot of opportunity for movement within the company if desired and modest monetary awards are handed out for solid work. They do the coolest things! Can't beat it.","Expensive, government-funded, one-off missions leave little room for error and creativity compared to some other aerospace companies. Project's can feel like they move at a snail's pace if you're not used to it. However, the projects are absolutely one of a kind."
41,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Mediocre at best,2021-12-07,1.0,Electrical Engineer III,The job is great if you're not interested in learning outside of your niche or if want to clock bankers' hours.

Everyone is somehow related and it makes you question if they would even get the job without their parent’s help.

Management is slow to promote and if you don’t have 20 years experience at Jpl good luck being able to move up especially on the business side. They do not value non-Jpl experience or industry experience

Get ready do jump through paperwork (online or otherwise) hoops for any number of arbitrary things.

There are N number of little fiefdoms and micro-fiefdoms, there are a lot of smart people there, unfortunately there are also a lot of control freaks masquerading as knowledgeable people and the bike shedding rate is excessive.

This place could really use one of Elon Musk’s fabled firing sprees.

Be prepared to do things for absolutely no good reason. Be prepared to waste both your own time which you will be given side-eye for despite both you and your colleagues being unable to innovate (because of fiat bans on much process innovation) your way to a less frenetic, less manual, more automated, less unaware manner of doing things.

It’s quite silo-ized so be prepared for a total lack of a cohesive online communication strategy (slack was introduced in 2016 and it took a global pandemic to get to 75% participation (participation on slack was at 25% of lab-wide employees previous to lockdown).

Like I said, if your career is in deep space robotics and aerospace engineering then JPL is anywhere from THE place to be, to a great notch on your resume. You’ll learn a bunch of stuff, and depending on if your academic or chosen career trajectory aligns with those subject areas, then the stuff you learn might even be useful generally speaking for you.

The health insurance is a joke, the PPO premiums are punitively priced (it’s as if they don’t want you to actually see any doctors).

The 401k retirement account and contributions are pretty stellar, that’s about the only area where JPL wins, It’s the 8.5% automatic contribution to the retirement account (14% if you’re over 55).

So if you’re a space nerd and you REALLY REALLY ARE a space nerd and it would be your dream come true to work on space stuff… go apply at Space X, if that doesn’t work out, give JPL a shot.

I’m not a space nerd and kinda accidentally got in here, which explains the frank and candid breakdown."

JPL is a large campus. The tour groups are told it bigger than Disneyland.

It’s academia! It IS managed by the neighboring CalTech after all. It has the feel of a college/university atmosphere. However, it’s not just pure academic research. It’s applied science! You can work there as an engineer or a scientist, an accountant, a manager, a machinist, or a mechanic, or a glass blower, or a janitor. 

Nothing compares to the emotional rewards when a successful touchdown happens on the surface of Mars or on an asteroid or your research goal and your small or large contribution to the project, the countless invested engineering hours finally pay off!

It was a great place to work! There was a lot of freedom!","Like all large organizations it’s suffers from being top heavy, lots of bureaucracy, and endless hours writing grant proposals to fund research because, let’s face it, large groups of citizens see it as a waste of resources to invest in space technology. They don’t see the upside being useful things like JPEG encoding, microwave ovens, and vast amounts of scientific education regarding our origins in the universe.
Because it’s academia there are a lot of Masters and PhDs. Brilliant people all of them. However, many of the are not practical people. They are theoretical folk. So as an engineer it was my job to distill their theoretical understanding into an achievable practical solution. Sometimes with them throwing their academic weight & credentials around to fight you every step of the way. At least until you could show them a workpiece and finally shut their theoretical nay saying up. This was not a huge “con” just a minor annoyance. In the end it still was a wonderful place to work ."

102,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Great place to work if you know how to navigate bureaucracy and hierarchy system,2021-06-24,1.0,Mechanical Engineer,"*Always doing something new, which is very exciting
*Starting and ending times are somewhat flexible
*Prestigious place to work. Family and friends bitterly idealize you
*Large campus like setting","*very very bureaucratic to the fault. Ones who know how to work that system really thrive here. It really doesn't matter you're the best employee. You just have to kiss so many a** correctly
* Very traditional way of working. Takes days to reply important emails. If you ask about an email that was not replied, you will be in trouble for stressing that person.
*Slow to adapt for new technology and doing things efficiently. Making sure funding received is well spent. Once you work here, it's hard to adjust to a commercial/profit driven company
*You need to be popular to get promoted. It's a cult like atmosphere. 
*Lots of ill trained inexperience people at the management just because they know to intimidate people.
*Popular way to hire people are to offer contract or temp positions. This means no salary increase for however long you work there. They will promise you the path to a permanent position but will never happen. So, after working at JPL on a contract or Temp basis, it will be a career suicide. You will have a hard time getting back to a permanent position.
*Besides, no matter how experienced you're, your say means little if you're a contractor or a Temp. There's a clear separation between social culture in contractors/Temp and permanent staff.
*HR is there to protect the management. Systems are in place to mitigate issues, but they are just systems – barely makes them to actions.
*Lots of $$ spent on outreach and branding
*Salaries are 20% less than the industry level offer
*Changing groups to acquire new skills or for your own career development is nearly impossible
These comments are very genuine effort to stop people from making emotional decisions when considering an employment at JPL. Best wishes!"

Sometimes things can be slow, and sometimes they can be extremely fast - depends on the project.",Maybe pay? But you are not working at NASA for the pay (although unfortunate if you are living in/around LA)
116,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,The problems are strong with this one,2021-05-07,1.0,Mechatronics Engineer I,"You get to work on robots that go to space and do amazing science. You won't find this kind of work anywhere else. At the end of a long project, you'll be able to say that something you contributed to is in space or on another planet.","- Poor pay compared to industry. You will be renting forever unless you want to commute 1+ hours each way. 
- HR is ignorant of the fact that Pasadena is a very expensive area. Good luck negotiating salary, especially if you are a woman or a minority. You'll be gaslighted until your hair catches fire.
- Management is ridiculously bad, especially in the engineering sections and divisions. They promote the best and/or favorite engineers to be managers, which kills two birds with one stone: you now have a bad manager who doesn't want to be there and you've lost a brilliant technical person. Well done management.
- Sexist old boys club. As a woman, I lived with daily gaslighting, questioning of my qualifications and ability to do my job, and highly inappropriate jokes, both verbally and in emails. In one particular incident, the presenter in a meeting said that he preferred working with men in the lab because ""women tend to cry when things get difficult."" The higher ranks are overloaded with old, white, baby boomer managers and technical experts that are clinging onto the old ways like their lives depend on it. Don't even bother trying to change their minds because it's not going to happen.
- No support. From anyone. You go to your manager with a problem? Watch them spend the next 20 minutes explaining to you that you're simply over-reacting and should maybe try harder/work more hours. Ah, the sweet smell of gas. That is if they'll even make time in their ""busy""? schedule to meet with you in person. Wait 2 months, then watch as they lose their mind and yell at you when that thing you asked for their help with threatens to delay a milestone. Unless you're the part of the project that is so on fire it's going to delay the launch, your requests for help will go unheard.
- No opportunity for advancement unless enough managers decide they like you.
- Rampant favoritism. Managers and high up technical people pick who they like and if you're not one of the lucky ones, you won't go anywhere. Those that are chosen get all the help and support they desire and are listened to in meetings because they have someone that will back them up.
- Remember that scene from Star Trek when the Centaurian slug burrows its way into Captain Pike's head? That's kind of what it feels like in a JPL design review, except instead of a slug eating at your brain it's the words of the reviewers. It is brutal. There is no respect if you have been there <~15 years If you're <5, I'd suggest covert kleenex earplugs. You will be yelled at, told you're an idiot, etc.... Reviewers have gotten out of their chairs and started smacking the projection of a powerpoint on a whiteboard. Poor whiteboard.
- If you're seen as brilliant and valuable enough to the lab, you're safe from discipline no matter what you do. Managers will cover up anything and everything.
- Everything is a competition between employees due to the practice of ranking employees for raises. Employees will battle with each other for resources and throw their teammates under the bus to preserve their image to management.
- Poor training, no standard documents/procedures. Reinventing the wheel is rampant. Documentation? HA.
- Bad parking. Road to the east lot floods when it rains. Watch out for glass that gets carried into the wash, it'll shred your tires."

186,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,For front of discovery,2020-12-28,4.0,Data Scientist,"Working at JPL is like living in a science fiction novel. There are lots of projects pushing the boundaries of human knowledge but participating in such projects requires very technical skills pertaining to applications of physics, chemistry, software, and engineering.","I can only speak for the science section of JPL rather than the engineering side. It's still an academic environment with the same stigma as a top tier university. In academia, one's life is usually defined by their work. I have managers that work all the time and send emails at odd hours of the night. Projects move very fast and you're often juggling 2-4 projects at a time. Not all will lead to publications either usually projects are more focused on a deliverable data product/service rather than a publication. When you're employed you sign away rights to your intellectual property. In the sciences/academia, you're expected to write funding proposals and publications and at JPL these projects will ultimately fall under the IP of the company. However, little to no company time is given to employees to write proposals/publications which means if you want to advance your own bibliography expect to work nights and weekends."

210,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,An amazing,2020-10-12,5.0,Systems Engineer,"Overall, JPL is an amazing place to work that is one of the most diverse and progressive workforces in aerospace. The projects have global impacts, often lasting generationally, and co-workers are motivated, passionate, and caring. All of my co-workers and management have wanted to see me grow into the individual I can be, as opposed to just seeing me as an employee. There is a big culture of teaching and passing on knowledge as opposed to keeping IP constrained to certain individuals. Moving around is encouraged and making large career changes to learn something new is not uncommon. It really is like a giant Disney world for engineers/scientists/artists across the board, even if space exploration is not your hot topic. There is Earth science, science communication, microdevice research, and a whole lot more. Anyhow, I have a lot I could say, but I would highly suggest trying to work here if you are a motivated individual who wants a good balance of life, culture, and engaging/challenging work.","Because it is still aerospace and an FFRDC, some of the benefits of working in more start-up-esque tech places don't exist such as free snack rooms. Also, on a group by group basis (JPL is a matrix organization), there can still exist an ""old boys club."""

It's both government and higher-ed, while those things can be positives it's an adjustment if you come from the corporate world and will occasionally make you shake your head.

I know what I am doing. They spend so much time arguing with me and not letting me do my job. I do my best I work hard I do pretty clean work and they still don’t appreciate it. It’s like a competition there. I am there to do work not to socialize and fool around and walk around and do nothing. These engineers walk around and fool around while I sit at the bench in the lab under the scope 90% of the time. There was always someone jealous of me because of my talent. You would think JPL have smart people and people who do a good job and not just sit around all day and wonder off and gossip. That is not the case there people gossip like crazy there and you can’t trust anyone. I am actually happy I no longer work there. My boss was cool but unfortunately the team members weren’t and they talked behind his back too which I didn’t think was a good thing. People at JPL are really fake! I wouldn’t have mind working there still but I didn’t think there was room for growth and I felt like I was working with engineers who think they know everything when really they don’t.

282,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Amazing entry level Software Engineering Position,2018-11-29,5.0,Software and Computing Systems Undergraduate Student,"It is the place to work while in school if you can handle the commute and working while in school. Everyone is understanding of that school comes first, no matter what. In fact you must maintain a certain GPA to remain an employee. This is a place that if there is something one is interested in they can explore that avenue. There is not a dull moment or project that one can work on at JPL. 

The biggest pro is that they engineering and build the most extraordinary machines in the world that accomplishes the impossible. One does not get to be a part of that very often.

One can work from home with Flex work, there are 2 gyms on lab, 2 cafeterias and a whole lot of awesomeness.",California is expensive to live in and if you don't live near or in Pasadena then the commute is horrible.
283,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Working for the Government Presents its Own Challenges,2018-11-27,3.0,Senior Systems Engineer,"Interesting projects. Incredibly smart coworkers who are usually very willing to help get you up to speed. Current upheaval of the old guard is actually presenting some new opportunities to lay down the foundation for the lab for many years to come. 

Name-drop-ability is real. People's ears perk up when they hear JPL and NASA, and if you're the type that likes to work at a place a lot of people are interested in, and flat out envy at times, JPL will do the trick. It's also a conversation starter when talking to recruiters, and most will be very interested in chatting with you to hear what you were up to at NASA. 

9/80 work week is observed by most people on the lab, and yes that means every other Friday off. Unlike most engineering jobs, it's not a trick, either. People take it off and the lab basically shuts down every other week on Friday. I've had a few Fridays I felt like I would use the day to catch up, but that was my call and overall the lab tries to practice what it preaches and does honor a good work/life balance. 

Remote work is also available, and depending on your team could be encouraged, due to the parking issues the lab does have. Those are real... You'll see people complain about parking a lot on here, and it's a serious problem. When I can, I work from home, which helps greatly get work done and not have to worry about running all over campus, and especially not waste time hunting for a place to park in the morning.","Work can move at glacial pace. Constantly fighting the old way of thinking, and there is a lot of push back toward anything new (whether it be a tool, a different way of working, or even a messaging app). Some missions are fully agile, with a slew of modern tools and technology, while others are using software and build practices that would have looked outdated in the late 90s. There is a constant bucking of new and smart grads and younger techs against the old-been-there-forever engineers. 

Most employees are also on matrix based project schedules, and it is rare to be assigned to more than 25-33% on any one project. Most engineers are juggling three to four projects, each with unique requirements, tools, and processes. It's actually closer to working three to four completely separate jobs, and with the variance and meeting schedules it can really feel like all you're ever doing is running around from meeting to meeting. 

Not a lot of guidance if you want a structured role. Most folks are so busy bouncing from meeting to meeting, and doing their own time juggling, that they expect you to pick up the ball and run with it. Sometimes even getting basic requirements can be a challenge, and on one hand that's very liberating, but on another when you're dealing with limited time, it is costly to have to go back and forth on a bad design, or just a completely wrong direction, due to not understanding the scope or requirements for an assignment. 

Government work can be hard to stomach at times. Big shock, but, yes, things get political here. There are a lot of rules, a lot of cautions, and I've heard numerous times that, ""If this is mishandled, you're going to prison,"" and it's not a joke. It can be stressful.

Zero perks around the office, and it may sound petty, but those coming from private industry might be shocked to see there's no free coffee, no tea, not even water coolers. If you want to drink water, a few groups have started water clubs (no joke) where you pay a little money each month to have access to a water cooler. Same with coffee. Otherwise, you're huffing it to the cafeterias for water or Starbucks for an overpriced drink. Forget free meals. There are some parties once in a while on lab, but don't expect food, drinks, or anything really that you don't need to get work done. Likewise, trips, travel, conferences, and what have you, are all paid for by your projects, meaning you need to have at least three groups sign off on anything you do. As a taxpayer, I'm happy that spending is so closely monitored and controlled, but as an employee it can be a pain to simply do things that might better all of my projects as a whole. This isn't a place where you come and work for a group, and work on several projects while being paid by your Org. You're actually assigned projects and paid a fraction by each, so you really have to constantly work at keeping all your projects up, hunting for new projects when things are ramping down, and manage your relationships with people on lab to make sure you always have work to do. Group supervisors can help, but mine hasn't been very present in my day to day work, and half the time he's busy with his own tasks and can't really spend time with his reports. Great guy, but sort of a hands off and never present supervisor. Perhaps other people have a different experience there. 

Parking is a real problem. There aren't enough spaces. It's a gag around JPL. If you try to park after 9am all bets are off. If you dare leave at noon for lunch, you're screwed. People park illegally all over the lab. There are cars crammed next to cars, parked almost blocking roads, sometimes completely blocking lanes in the parking lots. I don't blame them. I've circled for an hour plus to find a spot before, and didn't. I ended up calling my teams and told them I was going home and working there. It's bad. It's really bad."

5.) Advancement very difficult, both project and line management.

* Collaborate with a wide variety of  smart, pleasant people.
* The work can be demanding but in almost all circumstances is not over taxing.
* Because missions usually all follow a cycle of development, including growth and shrinking, this can be a great place for those who find themselves eventually becoming bored with a single project.
* Work is stable, so one's job is secure.
* The benefits are nice.
* The Lab sits in a great location.","* Though one almost always feels like part of the team, it's easy to feel like a little cog in a big machine.
* Work tends to be divided by managers into pieces that can be individually accomplished, leading to little direct collaboration (though this might be a Pro for some).
* JPL is very set in it's ways.  Change is very slow and usually requires a vocal response from many people.
* Though one's job is usually secure, advancement, particularly from lower levels can be difficult.  Much of this stems from the fact that most JPLers are older and have held onto their positions for decades.
* Another consequence of the unusual age distribution at JPL is that there are more managers than necessary.
* Most of the buildings are old, and although they are well maintained, they hardly inspire those who work within.
* Pay is underwhelming.
* Parking can be challenging."
442,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,No Career Advancement,2016-06-08,2.0,Member Of Technical Staff,"JPL offers the allure of working on spacecraft, instruments, and science related to planetary exploration. A lot of talented, curious individuals work there in many different fields. There is an academic atmosphere and lectures are offered on many different topics by people from Caltech, NASA, and other companies. You can work on a variety of projects including flight software, hardware, research, formulation, system engineering, mission operations etc. You can also write your own proposals, papers, studies, reports, and travel to conferences and other countries/centers. There is a high level of cooperation with other space agencies, public outreach, and educational priorities.","Because JPL is a non-profit government subcontractor, they fundamentally lack the budgets to offer meaningful performance incentives. Wages are low and grow extremely slowly (2%/yr), benefits get pared back each year. This also means that advancement opportunities are not there for all the deserving people they have and get doled out to a select few based on closed-door meetings - often not the most talented but the best-perceived. Heavily male-dominated management are former engineers, and have inadequate training in conflict resolution and personnel development. They rely on fear tactics to create uncertainty about the government funding to keep people from asking too many questions about their future. There is no guarantee of continued employment, even if you do good work, you might still be left scrambling to find your next project, even though management supposedly plans these things. They make a lot more than the engineers although there is no value-added to their work, it is still up to the people to apply for funding and keep themselves employed. You also have to constantly come up with new ideas for space missions to get funding from NASA, even though they often end up making arbitrary decisions to spread money to their other centers. Bureaucracy and too much oversight over budgets is a constant burden, as is the yearly scare at the fiscal year boundary (Sept. - Oct. ) when funding from the government often gets delayed due to threats of a shut down. Despite all this, JPL does manage to retain people for far too long with the promise of a family-friendly environment and a twisted sense of stability. If you decide there are no other options than to settle down in the Pasadena area, you can easily resign yourself to a career at JPL, where you are likely to stay employed on various things for decades, without ever attaining a real sense of being valued or appreciated. You will also end up working many unpaid hours for no reward. I have watched many people with Ph.D.s devote their life to JPL out of a sense of pride and commitment to engineering and science, only to end up feeling bitter and cynical about the politics. It promises exciting work, but simply cannot compete with private companies that are driven to invest in their employees for their own mutual financial benefit."

I was described as young and pretty but smart to a manager of an outside company I'm working with. 

I fix the screw ups done by the senior males and when I am frustrated by it never being acknowledged they say I am too inexperienced to have been given the task. 

When I went to one of our contract facilities I was sat across a table from the director of the site. He questioned me on how I got my job. After a minute it became clear it was not in an interested way it was in a how did you possibly get this job way? I went to the top school in the world for my masters degree. The older male from JPL I was with went to some school so crappy I've never even heard of it and it's in la. They discussed my qualifications for about 30 min while I sat there and let the male folk do their thing. When I complained to my management they suggested I see a therapist."

So, if you are good at your job and are equally good at making your work visible, there is a high chance that you will get a regular offer.

Unfortunately if you browse the company directory you'll start seeing a lot of CSU Dominguez Hills, CSU Northridge, CSU LA, Pasadena City College as educational background.  Not to bash those schools, but I thought JPL had the brightest minds.  They don't seem to anymore, and every third person here seems to get hired due to a family connection.  The overall mission is awesome, but there are also a ton of dead end jobs that support those missions.  There is no career development culture in place, it seems as if everyone is supposed to stay exactly where they are and do the same thing until they retire."

Projects are developed using the same outdated methodology from 20 yrs ago, are constantly ramped up, only to be cancelled the following year.

You'll always have new and cool work to do.  Lots of variety.  If you stay long enough, you'll get to do a lot of different stuff.  R&D, flight support work, and lot of other stuff is available.  It can be fun or not fun depending on the internal customer (personality).

You get to work with brilliant people, and really friendly people, and sometimes both at the same time.  If you meet the right people, they'll help you learn all kinds of awesome stuff.","Overly burdensome bureaucratic process.  Ask why it should take 5 weeks to get permission to buy a box of Legos for prototyping.

Engineers often feel they aren't learning enough from Lab to go elsewhere, since a lot of the work is NASA and JPL specific process.  In actuality, this is likely not true for most.

Brilliant people don't always have good social skills or understanding of social norms.  You will spend a lot of time dealing with unnecessary drama and odd behavior.  The Lab will give preference to genius over good behavior.  So even if you report bad behavior, many senior people are often given a lot of leeway.

Each division has a unique culture.  Members of the hardware divisions, mechanical especially (35x), are socially very aggressive.  You are constantly defending your work against verbally abusive (but very skilled) engineers.  Design reviews aren't quite as bad as Klingon pain stick rituals, but mentally pretty close.

Impostor syndrome (thinking you're too stupid to work here) runs rampant.  Some people internalize it.  Others need to push others down (bullying, malicious politicking) to make themselves feel better.

Advancement is based on visibility.  This leaves a big gap between those who are <15 years on Lab, and those above.  It also makes for advancement via cliques and friendships (in-crowd vs. outsider issues)."

We have a good mixture of research and more concrete project work.  The work/life balance is good, and it is tough to get laid off.  There is not a tremendous amount of competition.","Hard to grow in your career as there are limited sought after positions.  This is a by product of the fact that the size of the lab does not grow.  Software development, especially flight software, is very conservative.  Career growth is more dependent on who you know, how you are perceived, and timing, than it is on technical ability.  Many overqualified employees end up having to do fairly tedious and boring work, but someone has to do it!  Can be a good amount of uncertainty about what project you will work on next at times, which is a by product of doing government funded work."

561,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Nice change from graduate school,2014-11-11,4.0,NPP Postdoctoral Fellow,"Well organized workplace despite the large size of the lab (5000+ employess and 3000+ scientists I think). The pay is good compared to the national average, livable for the Pasadena area. Good work seems to be well recognized amongst the lab. Definitely a more relaxed work/life balance than most other employers for my field. 

It has the atmosphere of academia with the need to secure salary through submitting proposals, but has the experience of being in an industrial atmosphere when required to produce a deliverable. Best (or worst) of both worlds depending on what you are looking for.

The lab is such that if you find something interesting to study, the experimental capabilities are there.","Technology comes secondary to NASA. Even though I have a PhD in physics, I am not considered a ""scientist"" at JPL, I am a technologist. The idea is that science motivation must come first (astrophysics, earth science, planetary science, etc) in order to motivate a given technology. This gives me a bleak outlook on a career at NASA since it is well understood that technologists live off the scraps of the science proposals. While I understand the paradigm, I seem to have more trouble accepting that this is the way it should be than most. 

Although, as a post doc some upper management preaches the undying demand ""publish, publish, publish"" it seems that writing papers is less important to my direct supervisors as they are more concerned with producing results for their funding. Even if I find some interesting new science/device to study, my superior would prefer I not study it unless they can secure some funding to do so. These things tend to give others a leg up when it comes to building a resume for an academic position."

It had managers who really know what was going on under their wings since they already had ""hand-on experiences"" and walked around to talk to their subordinates on the weekly basic.","Now, it becomes just like any other big commercial entity with more paper pushers, more bean counters, more of anything but competent supervisors who really know their stuffs to actually train or mentor newcomers.  They let go key technical people and thought the younger engineers (both staff and senior levels) to pick up and run, but reality sinks in, and some tasks are left unfinished.  Who will train personnel to do the unfinished tasks?   Quick solutions: hiring back the same key technical people  through outside JPL contracting houses.  Legal? Yes.  Ethical? No."

It doesn't feel that they honestly have all employees best interest at heart and that they care.  Tend to go outside for potential employees when they have many at risk in-house.

- Unique projects/missions that no other company has done or attempted
- Unique blend of engineers and top scientists and PhD's in the world.
- Good benefits overall (new employees earn  3 weeks + 1 day vacation and 12 sick days per year)
- Great employer contributions to Key Staff retirement plan
- Casual environment","Like most companies the size of JPL (5000+ employees), there are ""companies within the company"" which means that certain sections or divisions may be vastly different than others.  As a result, it is difficult to provide a sweeping, all inclusive company wide con.  However, here is my attempt:
- JPL is struggling financially right now because although often successful, they have been labeled as too expensive for many deep space or interplanetary missions.  Consequently, they have been forced to compete for other types of contracts and have been failing  because of their excessive cost.   The days of receiving a blank check from NASA to send a rover to Mars (JPL's specialty that requires no competitive bidding) looks to be over or at least suspended for the next 8 years or so.
- JPL has their share of common issues involving companies of this size - ineffective or apathetic group supervisors, too many levels of management on some projects, etc.  However, nothing too far out of the ordinary and most of these cases are isolated rather than chronic."
646,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Working at JPL is a dream come true.,2012-09-25,4.0,Systems Engineer,"Much of the work at JPL involves the intersection of science and engineering.  JPLers work to advance human knowledge of Earth, the Solar System, and the Cosmos.  Coworkers here are some of the brightest and most interesting people you will meet.","As with any organization, particularly a government funded one, JPL has a great deal of bureaucracy.  The NASA budget is at the whim of Congress and the President, and there is typically more science to be done than there is money to fund.  The result is that projects may be cancelled or delayed for years at a time before they come to fruition, if ever. 

At the end of the day, you still get to work on projects that will land on Mars, orbit the earth, or fly by other worlds.  Keeping that big picture in mind, makes it all worth it."

Great success with Mars lander, but there is nothing after this, and many of its really good designers have been let go.","Has lost its direction, and its major funding sources.  Has moved further away from space exploration in favor of DoD work.  Experience base is being lost with layoff of more senior workers in favor of new grads.

Family is recognized as an important aspect of employees lives and management is fairly flexible in terms of time off to spend with family.  The work environment at JPL is very relaxed and takes on a college atmosphere.,There are too many different tools at JPL and no consistency.  Training in terms of the many tools is lacking in that there is no real formal training on how to properly utilize them.  There is a lack of a centralized knowledge community that employees can utilize in order to become efficient team members in a quick manner.

There is no future for this place...there are no projects coming up, there are no real jobs available...managers are downgrading themselves and pushing existing people out the door to keep their own jobs...very dirty indeed.  

There is little to no recognition for good or outstanding work.  Managers will throw you under the bus at the first hint of a ""whine"" or complaint from others.  

Beware...management and HR now work together to rid people of the lab...sections and managers create ridiculous schedules to be met and know fully they will not be...then they scapegoat people they want to fire/layoff because the milestones have not been met.
