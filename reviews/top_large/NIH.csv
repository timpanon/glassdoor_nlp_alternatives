144,NIH,Division of Police: Old and Lazy Workforce,2021-10-08,1.0,Police Officer,"The NIH Police is one of the few Federal Law Enforcement departments where there is an emphasis on patrol duties. There are no stationary posts, like a lot of 0083 Police jobs in the DC Metro area.

Also, the schedule is very flexible and rarely do Officers have to do forced overtime.","Most of the workforce consists of older, retired Police from local agencies that are simply looking to collect a paycheck and a second retirement. Most are disinterested in doing actual Police work and prefer to do only the minimum amount of work necessary. The few Officers that are motivated to grow the department and change the status quo are constantly ignored by the command staff. Dispatchers are also extremely unprofessional and constantly provide incorrect or incomplete information to Officers. 

Training is also a complete mess. When new Officers start, they sit behind a computer for months waiting to be sent to the academy. The ones that lateral over from other agencies also have to wait for months to start Field Training. There is basically no standardized system for new hires. 

Furthermore, equipment and vehicles used are subpar. Many Officers are forced to go on patrol without ballistics vests, simply because they don't get fitted for one or wait for many months for theirs to arrive. The patrol vehicles are also basically falling apart. Every week, it seems a vehicle has to be taken to the shop and doesn't get fixed for several months. The department is full of higher ranking Lieutenants and Majors, but no one is held accountable. Most Officers that are younger leave and get hired with better agencies."

I will say that I did not think I would get the job because it is the NIH. I will say I glad I did not realize how MAJOR this agency is. Fast forward, beast the two interview process and here I am 7 months later. I can see why this office has a two round interview process as well. Onboarding was smooth and I made sure I had all of my documents to avoid issues. As for doing my job itself- I thoroughly enjoy it. I am not use to being in such a collegial environment. The training that was given to me was so involved and in depth. I was intimidated because of the fact I am in a new job and agency. Currently, everything is fantastic. Fantastic team, supervisor and team lead. It has made such an astronomical difference in how I feel and causes me to push harder and stand out. It has been a major confidence booster because I am doing different stuff that I would have NEVER done in my old agency . Everyone works well and the morale is high. I credit that to my supervisor, team lead and the overall leadership in ES. It feels like I am in school because I am learning so much. Our opinions are valued and we all get feedback regarding our work. In the case of this office, I see why there is not a turnover which reflects so well on ES leadership. For me to leave this office, it would have to be equally as on par regarding work environment and quality of life. I will say I have the best of both worlds. I can wake up and not be stressed out and just feeling useless. Incredibly happy here and hoping to grow more and more 🙂!!",Nothing to report for downsides excluding the typical governmental policies.

I have been at the NIH for more than 20 years. NIH has an incredibly important mission for the country and world, and is a great place for some people - but if you want to last here, and not become incredibly discouraged and jaded, that mission has to be enough for you. Good bosses are almost nonexistent (I've never had one in 20 years - but I've had some nightmarish ones), and NIH leadership doesn't care a whit about true leadership. Only very rarely are bad apples fired, and NIH was embarrassingly late to the game in terms of cracking down on harassment and improving diversity (women, minorities, etc.). People, especially yes-women in their 30s, are HIGHLY valued and groomed for very high level positions (that they're not nearly qualified for). White men are also valued.

While PREP Scholars are technically funded for 30 hours per week, we are not generally allowed, nor do we have time, to take on another job for secondary income. For a program that is designed for low-income/minority students-- many of whom do not have familial resources to make ends meet-- a $28,000 gross income is insufficient.

Since there are so many opportunities to move around to different ICs or OD Offices, you could get your foot in and find the best fit down the line. NIH does seem to value a work-life balance. There is also a very diverse workforce, especially in the labs.","It's the government, with all the government bureaucracy, closures, changes in priorities due to a change in administration, etc. There also tends to be a tendency to advance people who really shouldn't be in leadership positions, reward people (favorites)  just for doing their job and not hold employees accountable for poor performance.

647,NIH,"Great place to work, but the usual gov't caveats",2019-03-18,5.0,Program Director,"NIH is a stimulating and purpose-driven place to work.  The vast majority of staff are highly committed to the mission of ""turning discovery into health.""  There are so many interesting educational opportunities -- every day there are lectures and events.  There are good employee resources as well.  We utilize NIH daycare (POPI, which is *excellent*) and when my son was tiny I was able to receive lactation support in my building.  There is a gym in my building that offers fitness classes, and every year they give flu shots free of charge to employees.  The work itself varies a lot; for me this is a positive thing.  I get to read about so many interesting scientific projects and interact with researchers around the country who are just as committed to the mission of doing health research as people on campus.  It's truly a great place to work.  

In addition, NIH takes diversity/equity/inclusion and harassment seriously, and they have a fair system in place for giving out raises/bonuses/promotions.","NIH is a part of the Federal government, and this means Feds and contractors are subject to shutdowns, pay freezes, etc.  In addition, issues with budget can make it hard to effectively move the mission forward.  

Pay is fair but most higher-level employees could be making more in the private sector.  

Benefits are good but there are a few caveats to this.  The biggest one for me is that there is ZERO parental leave.  This is true of all government agencies but it was something I wasn't aware of starting out.  Unpaid FMLA is OK and people can donate their vacation time to you, but overall you are pretty much on your own if you have a child.  

Other issues with working in government include the Hatch Act which limits the types of things Federal employees can say/do during an election."

There is subsidized childcare available on and around campus but the available spots are too limited with around  2 years waitlists. Gives 1099 instead of W2.
657,NIH,Underpaid technician with fancy title,2019-02-25,1.0,Postbac,"Time off to interview, 

I got into the school I wanted","Heavily saddled with repetitive technician work. PI and others lied about what my responsibilities would be in the laboratory but by the time I arrived it was too late to leave without delaying graduate school applications. It was very clear our job as postbacs was to be technicians willing to do tedious labor for long hours at low pay for a letter of recommendation.

PIs regularly abuse postbacs. 0 accountability. Administration will never side with a 2 year postbac over a tenured faculty member regardless of the offense

Lack of mentorship, Baltimore is too far from Bethesda to take advantage of the NIH graduate school resources. My PI offered me next to nothing to help me with my career goals. Treated like technicians not trainees

Extremely political. Science came second to the agenda of people in power. 


Your experience will be highly dependent on your PI. Vet them thoroughly because once you join you are stuck until you apply to school. Avoid labs with alot of postbacs because they are using them for cheap labor.  Look into RA programs at your school of choice before considering the NIH."

669,NIH,Great Place to do research,2019-01-23,4.0,Postdoctoral Fellow,Plenty of funding and flexibility on the science you want to pursue,Lacks proper postdoc management and monitoring of progress sometimes.
670,NIH,Overall a great place to be a postdoc,2019-01-23,4.0,Postdoctoral Fellow,"Labs are essentially not beholden to any sort of grant funding. This is awesome for many reasons: (1) as a postdoc your salary isn’t tied to a specific grant, meaning you have a lot of freedom to define what you want to work on; (2) high-risk, high-reward science is encouraged; (3) PIs (and other people) are less stressed out; (4) in general people are super collaborative bc no one’s worried about where the money will come from.

NIH is huge, meaning you can find someone who is an expert on just about any topic in all of biomedical research, and they’re probably willing to collaborate with you (see previous point). Plus it attracts great speakers, seminars, conferences, etc.

The resources are generally awesome, and the NIH Clinical Center is the world’s largest research-dedicated hospital, meaning every patient that’s admitted comes in under some kind of research protocol. This is pretty cool, bc patients are very open to participating in research (basically by definition), all the necessary research infrastructure is in place, and in addition to the more standard stuff you can also get some really interesting pathology (patients come in from all over the country, and sometimes the world).

NIH has a great post-bac program that tends to attract really bright and motivated recent grads.","Less opportunity to work with and mentor grad students, if that’s something that’s important to you. Labs can feel a bit top-heavy (with mostly postdocs and staff scientists), and then a big gap before post-bacs.

Your mentor(s), especially if he or she is more senior and/or has been at NIH a long time, may be less savvy about the academic job market: what search committees look for, what goes into preparing successful job talks, etc.; especially if you are targeting arts & sciences departments (some of them may or may not have a bit better insight into medical school departments).

The emphasis on high-risk, high-reward stuff – combined with the relatively high number of NIH “lifers”, i.e., PIs and staff scientists who have been and/or are planning on being at NIH for basically their whole career – means it can sometimes feel like there is less of a sense of urgency to complete projects quickly and publish. This is not an entirely bad thing, but as a postdoc you will generally be on a quicker timeline than many of those around you, so you have to stay on yourself to be publishing/hitting certain milestones/etc.

Because this is the federal government after all, certain bureaucratic things (travel, getting purchases approved, etc) can be really annoying and time-consuming.

Health benefits for postdocs and other fellows are not the greatest."
671,NIH,Fantastic place to work!,2019-01-23,5.0,Management Analyst,"The Office of the Director (OD) is constantly trying to find ways to improve the employee experience, through connecting employees to the mission, hosting races and festivals, creating employee assistance programs, engagement activities. 
Senior leaders of NIH listen to staff feedback and constantly try to improve things. For example, the new anti-harassment program.","Experience will vary across ICs and depending on your job series. Some ICs commit more than other to the employee experience, and in a scientific setting some of the Principle Directors are a-holes while others are fantastic leaders. In a place with over 20k employees it can't be perfect in every corner."

They got mad at me unless I worked 14-16 hours a day for less than 30k a year after graduating from an ivy league school even though none of the postdocs worked more than 6 hours a day. All I did was schedule patient meetings and they said if I wanted any learning opportunities I had to get them on my own time which they didn't even leave me time for and everything that went wrong regardless of whether it was my fault, such as patients not showing up to appointments, was blamed on me. They didn't even allow me to go to poster sessions that every other IRTA went to, since I hadn't finished scheduling enough patients which was impossible since half of them would by default not show up anyways. Half the IRTAs in my lab rage quit before their time was up. I wish I had done the same long ago as I got nothing out of it as all I did was scheduling and I got no posters abstracts or publication. I finally rage quit after my boss sent me an angry email for not coming in and working/ managing schedules on Christmas eve, which was announced to be a holiday for every other NIH employee, while my boss himself took 2 weeks off."

A lot of discrimination
Plenty Red tape and made up policies or no policies at all.
Relies too much on Chiefs discretion
No one seems to know anything
Inadequate Management and upper level supervisors
Fight for telework
No actual policies in place
Not much advancement opportunity for people of color or for support staff in certain institutions
No uniformity on policies everyone does what they want.
Little telework options depending upon centers institutes and groups

NIH as a whole has the concept of work/life balance correct, mostly main campus and a few other centers value and respect their employees, their work ethic and their time. Unfortunately every center and group within these centers operate differently and NIH's policies are misinterpreted to fit what the centers want and then they misconstrue policies even more by allowing the Supervisors/Chiefs to create their own policies which more so go against NIH's overall policies. If you are already a Fed think about the center that you are going to work for and the job that you will be doing. There are centers in particular that you want to watch out for such as CSR and the clinical center these centers including a few others mistreat and belittle ESA's, support staff, AA's and a few other job titles. You are not valued like SRO's Research Assistants etc so you are not given the same entitlements and opportunities like them."

With no real way to be replaced, US tax payers continue to pay the salaries of unskilled and nonperforming workers.  These nonperforming workers get promoted to managers by their friends.  Hiring is not fair.  Federal employees lack the skills to do the job and so contractors hired to do the work.  Some contractors have been there for years.  These contractors act and behave like federal employees.  Federal employee who supposed to provide oversight become friends with contractors and fail to provide proper oversight resulting in waste of public funds.

The library and journal subscription list are phenomenal. The folks at the Office of Intramural Training & Education are great and are continuously developing/adding to a first class program - especially the career counseling program.

There are other institutions that likely match these resources depending heavily on the lab you are in (e.g. labs at Harvard, Stanford, Janelia, etc), but I can't imagine many places exceeding the NIH in this regard. The size and diversity of world-class research at NIH is breathtaking, and you'll never have the time to fully appreciate its scope. This can be overwhelming, but the ability to find what you need (or create the resource yourself) is there if you take the initiative.","For a post-doc, there are some important limitations on your path to an independent career that are unique to the NIH (except #5): 

1. There's generally a 5 year limit that no matter how much your PI likes you, can be hard to overcome. Some projects just take a while, and the 5 year limit can be a big problem if you're slow to get publications out. The likelihood of moving up in the intramural system is very small. There's not the equivalent of a research assoc professor - the closest thing is a staff scientist position, and the probability of finding an staff scientist position that  you are qualified for (i.e. possess necessary skills/expertise) is vanishingly small. Thus, after your 5 years are up, you'd better have a plan to move to something outside the NIH. 

2. You are not eligible for some grant mechanisms (e.g. K01) and the K22 has become rare as some institutes have done away with this mechanism. Because there's no equivalent of a Res Asst Prof, you're not eligible to apply for R22 or R01 grants. This means the K99/R00 mechanism is really your only practical bridge to obtaining funding that a large an increasing number of departments now require (de facto if not official policy) to obtain faculty position offers. K99/R00s themselves are becoming exceptionally competitive and are no guarantee of a job offer. Furthermore, the 4 year limit on applying for a K99 puts you on a tight time table (see #3 and #4 below), and I think many intramural PIs are slow/unable to appreciate this fact. Consequently, having fewer options than extramural post-docs is deeply problematic.

3. Because intramural funding is more stable than most extramural ""grants-based"" funding (I'm leaving the HHMI and other major foundation funding sources out as they comprise a relatively small percentage of labs), NIH PIs, in my experience, are more willing to take risks with their laboratories projects (i.e. assign/allow post-docs to risky projects). As a post-doc coming into this situation, you need to be vigilant and understand that it is you who is assuming the risk (and a lot of risk vis-a-vis your future career!). You would be wise to develop (and make sure you have time for, see #4 below) a second, less impactful, but safer project.

4. While many university labs are more heirarchically structured (i.e. you've got undergrad workers, technicians, grad students, post-docs, and maybe a Res Asst Prof or two), NIH labs tend to be flat and heavily post-doc driven. There is variability from lab-to-lab regarding how projects are assigned, but frequently, everyone works on their stuff. This means you will likely not have team members underneath you, and participation in collaborative projects with other post-docs is potentially limited (both you and the other post-docs have to concentrate on your own projects). Consequently, NIH post-docs frequently work on a project by themselves and that limits throughput. If you're competing against extramural labs that can't afford to structure their labs this way, then you're at a disadvantage. On the other hand, you probably have more scientific resources (and money) at your disposal, so you've got to do the math on what you need to hit a home run.

5. What post-docs get paid is an embarrassment for the amount of time they work, the creativity they bring to the project, and the number of years of experience in the laboratory most already have coming into the job. The NIH is probably on the higher end of the spectrum in post-doc salaries/benefits, and this is an industry-wide practice. Still, I personally believe that the NIH sets the standard (or at least has large influence on this) based on its practices."

1084,NIH,"Govt. wasted spending, but 2 stars for funding opportunities.",2016-01-24,2.0,Predoctoral Fellow,"Almost unlimited experimental resources, if you or your PI know how to keep spending that govt. cheddar. Some PIs are making $250K. But most are in the $160K rage. Post doc and others make sub $50K. Staff scientists can make substantially more, but you are still anchored a bit to low numbers from your post-doc salary. It's an idea mixer. Tons of great talks here. Almost all the world's top scientists come here every 2 years to give a talk because they either think it will influence their grants or the get a free trip. Health care benefits (except for dental) are top notch.","Pay is generally bad unless you are a Lab Chief or PI for the number of hours you need to work to be successful. For post-docs and below, it's below minimum wage..way below. The institute will happily spend millions on lab equipment and wasted experiments. There's no one to check. It's not the way science should b done. Information technology is in the dark ages here. It's getting better slowly. Hard to innovate here at a fast pace. People here have innovative ideas, but due to govt. overhead it takes longer to get things done here. I've seen several post-docs simple run out of time here and become really frustrated with ordering and other logistics. Also it can be a little too laid back since you don't have to struggle for grants or money. About 1/3 of the folk here work really hard. Another 1/3 churn and end up with nothing and 1/3 just play and come in around noon leave at 3pm. I think there is also a publishing bias against work done here. Why would you support work done here if you were an outside reviewer and you had to struggle so much with funding? Most PIs are busy on some committee and this can take away from mentorship. The open lab floor plans (housing different labs in one space) are dumb, encourage stealing and stepping on everyone. Food is terrible and sort of expensive because there's only one provider on campus. The administration and purchasing agents are baseline bad. Typical have to beg and lay on the platitudes to get sub-mediocre results from them in an un-timely manner."

1225,NIH,Develop your academic career in a sheltered environment.,2015-03-20,4.0,Postdoctoral Research Fellow,"Compared to extramural research, there are significant benefits to working intramurally: No teaching, no grant writing and yet plentiful resources. Most labs are in the top 10% of their field. There are many institutionalized support structures for trainees, especially for those from foreign countries. The generally spirit is to get people to leave after finishing their projects quickly (2-4 years), but some people decide to and can stay longer. After 8 years it is up (meaning a cushy government FTE position as a staff scientist) or out. Foreigners are generally expected to return to their home countries, unless they can secure a faculty position elsewhere.","Compared to Ivy-League schools and other R1 institutions, you will generally sense a lack of competitiveness at NIH that is an inevitably consequence from the lack of fight over resources. Some people thus get lured into a false sense of security. Postdocs have practically no long-term perspective at NIH. It is up to the individual to not forget that they are facing stiff competition outside the sheltering walls of NIH."

It is hard in the application process to figure out what the lab culture is before you start because most of it is online. In general, I don't think the application process lines you up for a great experience. Online, you have to post your resume, research experience, classes and grades from school, a cover letter, and three letters of recommendation. After you have all of this online, you can begin reaching out to PIs at NIH. However, the vast majority of PIs are not hiring post-baccs currently or ever. There is no list of which labs or institutes have openings for post-baccs. So most of this process is a lot of rejection, or complete radio silence from everyone you've reached out to. It leaves you feeling pretty desperate (and chances are the date of college graduation is looming nearer and nearer everyday and all you want is a job before that day). At least in my experience, I was having so much anxiety I took the first job I was offered, without many questions about the lab, structure, culture, and it hasn't left me very happy.
I would recommend to anyone applying to this program to be sure that the lab you accept is a lab you can see yourself happy doing full time research for a year or two years. This is probably common sense to others, but it didn't really hit me until I got here."

I have been here for 5 years and we have had no pay increases, while the cost of living goes up and up and up. Living in the DC region on the pay they give is pretty much impossible unless you are willing to give up comfort - who works hard enough to get a PhD in order to do that?

Nowadays, support personel (secretary, office manager, HR) has become your boss.  More and more rules are put in place to restrict reagent purchase, travel, etc.
2. Strangely, one can feel very isolated in this place.  A lot of internal bickering, elbowing can be seen in many groups.

Now that I'm in I am scrambling to try and get out and get a better position in an Institute. Even the Center my organization supports is kind of dead-end. A lot of the scientists are only there because their labs lost funding and it is the easiest way into NIH. There is even high turnover among them as they look for greener pastures within the agency. For the admin staff the work is very boring, there is not nearly enough of it and has a narrow focus on something that no one outside of the Center cares about so it is hard to gain transferable skills. They want highly experienced professionals for entry level work. Again, this applies to my organization which is actually being disbanded and merged into the Institutes and Centers it supports.
