- Relatively flat technical organizations. If you don't like going through multiple layers of management to get to a decision maker, this is the place for you
- Asking open ended questions, or clarifications is part of the norm.

Technology is cutting edge with CEO who has genius vision and branding strategy. Fast-paced but generally very forgiving in terms of performance if your efforts are clearly visible. However, missing delivery deadlines are unforgivable.","Can be a toxic work environment. Flat organization where internal fight for attention and back stabbing are common. Upper executive level is bully type mentality with arrogance that trickles downhill.  They don’t know what they don’t know sometimes and if ideas are brought to light,  they ridicule until ceo thinks of it and suddenly they are great ideas.

84,NVIDIA,A Company that Provides Support and Encourages Learning,2021-09-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"NVIDIA plays for keeps. They provide resources to help support employees in many different ways: sessions on well-being, Employee Resource Groups, generous benefits. During COVID, I've been able to have flexibility in my work schedule.

Equally important, they provide resources and tools to help you acquire new skills. There are many opportunities to learn internally (with Tech Talks) or externally (linkedIn Learning, udemy, and Stanford (if you're accepted)).

NVIDIA also provides opportunities to give back to the community. Employees can volunteer during work hours to update maps or build STEM kits to send to under-represented minorities. 

The company culture is important here - it's not just buzz words to make everyone feel good. They expect intellectual honesty, teamwork, and want folks to speak up and speak out.","It's been a little tough joining a new team when everything is virtual. That said, I've taken advantage of opportunities to get involved with a few Employee Resource Groups to start building connections with folks outside of my team.

The other con is that NVIDIA still has some work to do to improve diversity. It's clear that they are taking steps to improve it, but I hope it continues to receive attention."

97,NVIDIA,Ultra Frugal Employer Treats New Employees Like Garbage,2021-08-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"1) In between project cycles, there is nothing to work on (but this isn't really a pro for me, as I felt incredible bored, disengaged and unvalued). I have so many skills but none of them were utilized.... this company has way too many engineers and not enough work to go around (if you've been here less than 5y, you will only get assigned the garbage work that no-one else wants to do, all the good stuff goes to folks who have been there 5 - 20y). They rarely hire new folks (almost never). Great place for lazy people (long-timers) to rest and vest.","One of the worst companies I've ever worked for (people, culture and frugality are among the worst attributes of this company):

1) Ultra frugal company:
 a) Pays much less than other companies (RSUs smallest I've seen) 
 b) Refresh RSUs are practically zero (not even worth mentioning)
 c) ESPP is useless (I was actually losing money on it while I was there)
 d) Incredibly difficult to get equipment purchases approved
2) Dishonest/unscrupulous recruiters/managers
 a) Recruiter actually negotiated lower level for me with HM than was discussed with me and didn't tell me about it! Unreal... same title had 3 levels so I had no idea until a few months after joining. So the RSU refreshers were much lower than discussed with recruiter.
 b) Waited several years for my manager to let me do the work we agreed to upon joining before moving on. 
3) Only long term employees get promoted (or those with same race/ethnicity as VP). 
 a) I experienced complete reverse discrimination while there (VP only promoted those of same race/ethnicity). Those of this race/ethnicity treated me like garbage and the VP (and other similar race/ethnicity managers under him) protected them and retaliated and beat-up on me for complaining. 
4) From what I saw, all new employees get treated like garbage by the long-timers at this company. Ironic since they have been there a long time and are making significantly more than you due to stock run-up. 
 a) A big part of the problem is that this company has no peer review system in place for annual or real-time feedback, so when folks behave in an outrageous manner, there is nothing you can do but try to ignore it. Totally broken review system.
5) People only respect you if you've been with the company a minimum of 5y.... time spent with the company is like a badge of honor. Ideas and industry experience gained outside Nvidia are disregarded/ignored (Nvidia is *not* interested in how things are done elsewhere in industry.... it's their way or the highway type of mentality). In my case, I had ~20y industry experience (specialization) in a particular area, and they wouldn't even invite me to meetings (I practically had to beg to contribute). No one at Nvidia had anywhere near the level of experience or knowledge I had in this area.... folks that were hacks were listened to like they were experts. It was amazing. I was used to being the subject matter expert for a company with 200,000 employees, but at Nvidia...with <10000 employees, they refused to allow me to be a subject matter expert (my director actually rejected my request to contribute).
6) People working here displayed a complete lack of integrity/honesty (although this happens at some other companies too).
7) The labs at NVIDIA are a disaster.  Most look like a bomb went off, and you have to fight to get even a tiny amount of lab space.  Definitely the most disorganized, underfunded and poorly run labs I've seen in industry."

But if you yourself know how to balance work and life, and your manager has the right understanding, then all is well."

Seemed like the aim was to make me feel bad. Depends on each individual’s preferences and sensitivity but this caused a lot of anxiety to a point where I had to quit. 

2. Growth can depend on a lot of other things than the actual talent and contributions such as 
what / who a particular manager favors 
whether an individual is from a “top” school"

* Lots of brilliant engineers
* Strong stock performance
* Flexible working hours/environment","* Engineering culture is very top-down. You will often hear ""There is only one boss at Nvidia - Jensen"". All decision-making is top-down and grassroots creativity is often overlooked.
* Because of top-down culture, teams/engineers experience a LOT of pivots. Most engineers typically work on 3-5 completely different projects/initiatives in the span of 1-2 years. This causes a lot of thrash.
* Politics is obnoxious. Orgs and org leaders have been around for decades and have created their empires. If you are caught between the politics/crossfire, it will be very ugly.
* Culture embraces ""brilliant jerks"". People are aggressive, somewhat arrogant and extremely entitled.
* Not very respectful - I've heard Jensen bad-mouth competitors in company all-hands."

The philosophies that were noted on my way in the door have proven to be how the company operates.  It’s not lip service.,"The structure can be challenging at times.

259,NVIDIA,A Fantastic Place to Work,2020-11-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"NVIDIA is led by a focused and committed executive leadership team who are consistently looking to push the boundaries of NVIDIA's capabilities both internally and externally. 

It is a major driving force behind a broad range of emerging technologies and has a knack for identifying and creating critical technological convergences. 

NVIDIA also has a great company culture where hard work and accomplishing important work is celebrated and where individuals and teams are consistently supported.",The company's accelerated growth is not without its growing pains and the start up-like agility doesn't work for everyone.
260,NVIDIA,Great company with weak software engineering culture,2020-11-02,5.0,Autonomous Vehicle Senior Software Engineer,"Colleagues are really nice, it feels good to work together with them. It is the exact opposite of toxic culture.

The values of NVIDIA (intellectual honesty etc.) really resonates with me.

264,NVIDIA,"Interesting work, great people",2020-10-13,5.0,Managing Editor,"Beyond NVIDIA's development of innovative technology is the vast array of applications that this technology enables that is truly inspiring. From drones autonomously delivering medicines in remote areas to AI-powered supercomputers detecting galaxies in unheard of numbers, the company's tech is a gamechanger for many, many fields. Great people, little bureaucracy, competitive pay/benefits, inspiring leadership at many levels.",Missing in-person interaction with my colleagues but am grateful for the flexibility to work from home full time while the pandemic is ongoing.
265,NVIDIA,Incredible Place to Work!,2020-10-12,5.0,Senior Director,"The core values at NVIDIA - intellectual honesty, innovation, speed, excellence and working as one team - are ingrained into everything we do. The culture is inclusive, the hierarchy is flat, the work is rewarding and the people are super smart. I've been here for about three years and am so thrilled to be able to do the best work of my life.",None that I can think of.
266,NVIDIA,Excellent and Rewarding Company to Work For,2020-10-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not too long ago, I had scouted Glassdoor to get a sense of what joining NVIDIA would be. I agree with these reviews that the work you do in NVIDIA is exciting and will keep you on your toes. The company outlook is great and the emphasis on keeping their culture true to who they are despite the substantial growth is really outstanding to witness. There's a strong emphasis on meaningful work that really motivates employees they're making a difference in their roles.","At times, work/life balance can be tricky depending on the projects you are working on"

And NVIDIA as a company really looks out for its employees, with helpful benefits and support in the times you need it.","Can require extra hours and it gets especially busy around trade shows, conferences."

272,NVIDIA,Create the future doing your life's work,2020-10-08,5.0,Senior Manager Supply Chain,Sr. Leadership is truly visionary; organization is value driven and has a strong uniquely NVIDIAN culture; employee voices are essential to the success of NVIDIA; we are encouraged to do our life's work here; and the fruits of our labor are changing the world. Support for employees during COVID has been amazing.,"Because the culture is very strong and unique to NVIDIA, it can be confusing and occasionally frustrating until you figure it out."
273,NVIDIA,A company to grow with,2020-10-08,5.0,Technical Marketing Analyst,"During these crazy times where the world can seem uncertain, Nvidia has made me feel like I have found a sturdy foundation. They have welcomed me into their team and have made sure that I have been given the tools necessary to succeed. It's a little weird starting with a company during a global pandemic, but my manager has been able to make the process as smooth as can possibly be. My team is amazing and the comradery between colleagues gives me a feeling of belonging that I lacked from previous employers. As for the company itself, I truly believe in the vision Jensen has. Nvidia seems to be expanding rapidly throughout the tech market and consistently showing quality performance in everything they do. This is a company I believe in and in a short time has shown that it is a company I can see myself staying with and never tiring of it.",I have experienced no cons thus far
274,NVIDIA,Why else would I work here for over a decade?,2020-10-08,5.0,Technical Program Manager,"A lot of companies will have upper management proclaim that they value their employees, only to turn around and conduct layoffs and/or pay cuts shortly thereafter. NVIDIA's CEO and upper management have, time and again, emphasized how valuable NVIDIA's employees are, and they have, time and again, proved true to these values through their actions. 

Amazing benefits have been implemented, some borne out of employees speaking up about previously unaddressed needs. Salaries and overall compensation are extremely competitive. Management listens to the boots on the ground, whether the subject is diversity and inclusion, furthering your own professional development through education, or pursuing different careers within the company. Since the pandemic began, every effort has been made to provide for and protect employees as human beings, from ergonomic furniture subsidies and flexible schedules due to family obligations, to careful and strict regulations and accommodations for the handful of essential employees who do come on campus. 

My colleagues are, by and large, wonderful people who just want to do the right thing, all the way up the management chain. After hearing so many horror stories from friends and family on the tech employment carousel, I feel like I won the work lottery, so guess what? I am motivated to push myself, to do my best, and to continuously learn and improve and contribute to my team.","As with many companies, there are some high intensity crunch periods during which there is a very real danger of burning out if you're not careful, depending on the team that you're on. Certain teams would benefit from reviewing these crunch periods, learning some important staffing lessons, and taking steps to mitigate burnout in the future. 

That said, some teams/organizations have better managers and management styles than others, and while I've been fortunate enough to be in A teams for my entire tenure, I also know a team or two that are just a sneeze away from a train wreck.

Last but not least, some may complain that lunch isn't free, unlike a lot of big tech companies, but all things considered, that's a minor (and frankly entitled) non-issue."
275,NVIDIA,BEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD!,2020-10-08,5.0,Senior QA Engineer,"You are on the cutting edge of the latest and greatest in technology. Wages are competitive and fair. management actually cares about each person. You are working with some of the most intelligent down to earth people in the world. Lastly, it is a gaming company the job is challenging but fun.","I simply cannot think of any cons ( I really tried) I have had such a wonderful experience here from day 1. As an African American man, we are not usually treated this well by our employer. My voice has a say, I am compensated for my efforts, and anyone coming to Nvidia will need to know that being able to balance work/life is vital."

Some of the highlights that come to mind on top of my head:
- Detailed feedback on my interviews
- Timely status updates
- Quick/prompt responses on questions","Not started working yet. So, no cons so far."
281,NVIDIA,I love it here,2020-09-29,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"For me, it's all about the people I work with and the impact of the technology that I'm working on.

It's hard to find a company that has both, but I've found both here.",A lot of people here have known each other forever. So I've felt a little bit like an outsider at times. But maybe that will change when we start working in the office again.

290,NVIDIA,Best Company in the World,2020-09-14,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* I believe in what we do. We are building some of the coolest things.
* I believe in how we are doing it. We care about the environment and try to do things in the most ethical way possible.
* I believe management is always trying to do the right thing. They will step in and change things that are going wrong. You can voice your opinion on how things should go and upper level management will listen and change direction when they agree with you.
* They treat everyone that works for the company as their family.
* They encourage everyone to give back to the community and they take care of the communities that we live in and society in general.
* They treat me better than anyone when it comes to compensation. They took a look at how long I was in industry and what I was doing and paid me the going rate for those numbers. They didn't consider what I was making now nor any of my other offers. That made the Nvidia offer 50% higher than my current job and all other offers.","Sometimes there is a manager at a lower level that isn't doing the right thing. Nvidia will work with that individual though and do everything that they can to change the direction and help everyone to succeed though. And if you can't make that work out, you can always switch teams (and there is sooooo much going on that is fun and exciting.... not a bad option)."

Management is very understanding and strides to be ahead of the curve. Many people before the pandemic were already remote working from home once to twice a week. This made the transition during the pandemic much easier. Again going back to having people support one another it was easy to get advice on how to set up your home office and deal with challenges you might not have expected while working from home because colleagues are there to help and support you.,At times around big events it can be a bit hectic but that might just be standard around the industry

The compensation plan is not competitive.  Low OTE's and no upside for Sales Reps.  If making money is important to you Nvidia is not the company to work for.  RSU's are given out to make up for the low target incomes.  They are stingy with the number of RSU's you get after you start.   Get as much up front as you can.

If you are good at kiss-up your manager then this is a great company.
If you got a good leader then this company might work for you, but beware of new automotive division are with most bad people mangers.","No transparency in  performance management process, you would be rated by your manager how ever they like you, no measurable system.
Also no transparency in performance review process that means you will never know what is your rating ,because company policy allows manager not to disclose your review rating!.
So you will be surprised one day that you are out the doors , because you had different opinion from you manger on executing tasks and rated bad in performance rating and no other manger inside the company will be ready to hire you for second chance, since you are already screwed  and you will never know.
Now imagine newly formed automotive division  with mangers only have technical skills and no people management  skills or leadership skills .

Also company itself changing it  goals every two months on automotive products, Good luck asking you manger about your goals ,where you will be provided nothing but retaliation and no way to prove why you got that bad rating, even after you are lucky enough to find out your rating from the classified top secret system."

356,NVIDIA,"Okay for a while, not a place to stay",2019-10-23,2.0,Software Engineer,"- Salary and Bonuses are less than say, Google or Amazon, but still quite good. ESPP in particular is great generally, and has been amazing over the past 10-ish years.
- Fellow engineers tend to be dedicated and skilled.
- Being in a fabless semiconductor company provides unique challenges compared to say, transmitting advertisements 1% faster.","- A switch to ""Agile"" development was done by people who have no idea what Agile is
- Depending on your team, if you don't put 6 hours in per day in JIRA, you will get a nag email. Helping other teams? No way! Going to meetings? Well, not too many...
- Corners are cut frequently. You will never feel proud of your work, always surprised it shipped.
- Does some task require special expertise? Well here is a 1 hour meeting about it a week after the task needs to be done. Maybe just read the slides, no time to actually attend that meeting. Want to read a book to understand the topic better? No way, there is no JIRA task for that.
- Employees complained about lack of Learning and Development resources so, they paid for Coursera. Not enough for all employees, so you may have to wait. No support for learning on the job, so I guess the idea is that you'll log in on a weekend to watch videos that are often freely available.
- Very few retros/post-mortems, multiple chips will go by without your team stopping to explore why testplans are always being trimmed to be actually completed, and even then very few changes will be implemented.
-Maybe you will work 12 hours a day , 7 days a week for months. Well enjoy your expensed lunches and dinners on the weekend, that's all it's going to get you. Counts for nothing towards management, Just say No when they ask."
357,NVIDIA,Amazing Innovation with exemplary leadership,2019-10-22,5.0,Senior Systems Software Engineer,Ownership with failures. Leadership navigates teams to right projects based on their skillset. Pivots quite fast.,Chaos with a few groups and sometimes does not help with the larger vision.
358,NVIDIA,Great innovative company with lots of possibilities,2019-10-10,5.0,Senior Software Developer,"Flexibility and focus on results rather than formal procedures, so it is convenient to work here.
Great appreciation for innovation, research and improvements.
Steady growth in terms of career, and a lot of possibilities for personal development - like internal lectures/conferences, partner programs with universities, web learning portals, domain experts, etc.
Bleeding edge technology and experts in multiple fields, ties to the scientific R&D - and you can take part in any of those fields and acquire knowledge from experts.
Competitive salaries.
Management is mostly built of people with serious practical background, so they have a lot of understanding what is going on, and a vision that is both very practical, AND innovative.
Feeling that you build and shape future.","Mentioned flexibility doesn't work well for all of the people - some people feel comfortable with more strict, managed environment, strictly formulated tasks and timeframes, and don't appreciate too much of the individual freedom.
Resources of the company are more limited to those of a bigger companies which sometimes may be perceived as a good thing sometimes (work smarter, not harder), but otherwise it limits the potential possibilities."
359,NVIDIA,Great company,2019-10-07,5.0,Senior ASIC Design Engineer,"You can focus on your job, not dealing with the company. The engineering managers are also engineers. People work hard and are smart. Compensation is excellent. Nvidia is involved in a lot of very exciting technologies. Benefits are also good, and work hour expectations in my group are reasonable.","Some higher-ups are very opinionated, so significant decisions are often dictated by them. Certain significant people are very demanding, which can create some stress at times. It's a slightly aggressive culture, in terms of pushing for difficult challenges."

Rank and seniority don't mean a lot.  If your idea is good, it doesn't matter who you are or how long you've been here.
Lots of people here who literally wrote the book on their technological specialty.
Zero tolerance for ethnic/racial/gender/age discrimination.   That's not from HR, it's everywhere.    Do or say something that appeals to stereotype or prejudice and people think you're an idiot.   Maybe that's how things are in 2019 techworld, but it sure is refreshing.
The commitment to reducing our environmental footprint is genuine.   The stuff I've fought for at other companies along those lines is already happening here.    Company strongly encourages commuting by bike, public transit, carpool or work from home.","IT is under-resourced, and gets snookered by consultants and the occasional snake oil salesman."

The benefits are good, Jensen understands and cares about employees.","Deadlines can be tight, a lot is asked of employees to deliver at times, so can be stressful like most companies."

371,NVIDIA,Inspiring leadership whom employees and shareholders actually believe in!,2019-09-24,5.0,Verification Design Engineer,"Very competitive salary and benefits for this industry.
Very high level of technical and corporate transparency across teams/sites  (this is in striking contrast to many other so-called leading companies in this industry!)
Everyone believes in and works towards the company's goals and vision.
High employee morale and corporate pride.
Shared sense of success (and failures too) - not a ""me"" culture.
Employees feel valued.
Minimal politics that would block technical people from achieving their goals.
Agile decision making and course correction to stay on track with product roadmaps.
Company does not live in the past or rest too much on past success.
Fair amount of work/life balance (as long as you take responsibility).","Not suitable for people who aren't self-starters - often frustrating when onboarding to a new team to get very little help from peers which results in wasted trial/error.
A lot of tribal knowledge and sparse/outdated internal documentation/websites make it difficult and inefficient to find information.
Matrixed org structure leads to firstline managers with unmanageable amount of direct reports resulting in  very low opportunity for focused one-on-one time, coaching, and development.
Too much focus on projects and staffing at Headquarters - this leads to limited growth/movement opportunities for people outside of California.
Rapid growth is stressing the company's resources and historically closeknit culture."
372,NVIDIA,Best job I've had,2019-09-24,5.0,Technical Marketing Engineer,"I've been at NVIDIA for about a year and a half. Great mix of employees (age, background,  ethnicity , and so forth).  Lots of common-sense perks. Relatively flat organization with a fair amount of CEO oversight/visibility. 

The Santa Clara corporate headquarters is a beautiful space. Look forward to coming into work. Great to have cubicles and not an ""open office"" environment. 

Flexible as far as work@home goes.","None worth mentioning. And, this is based on over 20 years in the tech industry."

Of those minds, they can be on their first week of employment or have been here for 25 years and still have their idea appreciated.  We are carefully planning and trying to move into new markets to leverage all of those minds.","It's a delicate balance to measure risk and reward on every suggestion.  As any company grows, it is important to not get too complacent or morale, profits, and success will all drop."
375,NVIDIA,Excellent company to work at,2019-09-23,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"More interesting work to do than can be done in ten lifetimes. Chance to constantly work at the cutting edge with people who favor results and not drama.

In a way, each team works like a start-up. 
Flexibility in work schedules and places and almost all collaboration tools are supported.",The team start-up work environment might not be the most appealing for some.

384,NVIDIA,Talented and collaborative organization,2019-09-23,5.0,Distinguished Engineer,"The litmus test for good engineers is the willingness to listen and, when the conclusion is different than the plan, to change the plan. NVIDIA is full of engineers who are thoughtful and have the capacity to accept change.","Number one goal is always schedule. In pursuit of schedule, decision makers change the scope of work in order to meet schedule. Sometimes this means useful and important features are pushed to a later generation or architecture. After investing months or years on a feature, it is disappointing."

There's a mindset of frankness and intellectual honesty, a sense of shared purpose and values, and a culture of work/life balance and of giving back to the community -- volunteering, charitable giving, etc.  The company continues to excel, despite many bears and naysayers, and the benefits of success are shared nicely amongst all employees.","For me, there are no cons to working at NVIDIA."

393,NVIDIA,A Great team & Strong Company,2019-09-20,5.0,Technical Product Marketing,"- Excellent company culture :  Flexible work schedules, good benefits, family focused,  and pet friendly in some buildings! 
- Open work community :  Teams are encouraged to communicate and collaborate with each other. Teams aren't silo'd. 
- Advancement Potential : There is a lot of opportunity to grow in this company and there are a lot of talented employees that want to see you succeed. You can find support from your peers everywhere. 
-Personal Growth : A variety of resources are provided to continue developing your skills. You are encouraged to step out of your comfort zone and to try new things. 
-Strong Vision & Driven Peers - The overall vision the the company as it continues to push the boundaries of Computer Graphics, &  AI is a huge factor that keeps us all motivated and thinking about what can be done next.
-Variety in Work- You won't get bored. A lot of teams  work with the latest software and hardware so there is a lot of potential to try new things. This reliable change in pace keeps work interesting.","Resourcing/ Long term Planning - Every project is important and needs attention. Sometimes its hard to find the time to do everything and some teams can be stretched a little too thin. This becomes a bigger issue during launches or shows , when new tasks come in with a tight turnaround ( two-three weeks). During these times working overtime and putting in more hours becomes a must for a lot of teams. 

Pivoting - You need to be flexible and able to pivot with the company. For the most part, NVIDIA has a very steady direction but how we continue to go in that direction can change often and require teams to adapt."

Collaboration across teams is an important aspect of work. And of course, emphasis on innovation and be the best in what they do (push the bar higher).","May be not so laser focused as some other execution companies/teams, e.g. vs Apple silicon engineering group.

I'm 24 and most of my coworkers are in their 30's, with the oldest being in their late 50's. I normally don't mind until I realize that all of my friends have made personal friendships with many of their coworkers because there isn't a big age gap. It can get a little dull around the office as well.  Also the salary is great but there are less perks than other big companies (no free meals,  just subsidized)"

Also, if you enjoy tinkering alone without input from others, NVIDIA is great.","A lot of people and management on the software support side have been there for 10-20 years and are indoctrinated in the belief that NVIDIA software support is a functional organization. It is not. New features and development get all of the attention, and the support organization is left grasping for scraps. The culture of the organization seems to be indifferent/complacent regarding improvement.

We're no longer competing with just AMD/Intel; processes and infrastructure are running about 10-15 years behind other Silicon Valley companies, and NVIDIA staffs these departments as if they were cutting-edge and had the levels of automation and organization that the competition has."

- Base salary gets competitive as you go up in your IC level.
- ESPP has a 2 year lock in window. Not many companies in the industry have that.
- 401K match is a fixed value which is good for people who plan to work for a shorter period.
- Multiple choices to choose from your health benefits (depending on your requirements) and are very competitive. 
- Dinner is subsidized.

Career:
- If you are self motivated, you can learn a lot of stuff.
- Teams are usually small (< 15 under a manager) so visibility to upper management and across teams  is high.
- There are opportunities to move within the company and is highly encouraged by our CEO.  YMMV.
- There are avenues for Learning & Development, but its mostly about Machine learning and AI.

Immigration:
- NVIDIA is very prompt with your immigration applications. There is no lead in period to apply for your H1B, Green Card or any other petitions.

Work Culture:
- Information about projects & products is available to all teams so there is a sense of satisfaction when you know what you are working on.
- There are mailing groups & clubs for all things and you can openly ask for help, be it work related or not.
- Flexible work hours as long as you complete the work within the agreed upon timeframe.","Compensation & Benefits:
- Base salary for NCG or lower level ICs may not match that of bigger companies.
- There is no profit sharing or cash bonuses.
- RSU grant is once a year and is not very competitive unless the stock price goes up on its own.
- There are no free lunches, not since 2009.

Career:
- Not a lot of opportunities for Career growth. 
- Since teams are small, there is no time for anyone to mentor younger employees. 
- If you are not self motivated, it's very difficult to learn/do new things.
- Intra team transfer needs your current  manager's approval.
- Review/Appraisal process is not very transparent. There are no written reviews by the manager.

450,NVIDIA,Overall a pretty good company to work for,2019-07-24,5.0,Senior Applications Engineer,Everyone can make a difference. Most of management is willing to listen to you if you have a good idea and can execute.,"The same as the pro. Everyone, including unintelligent, brash, and loud people, can make a difference too. You gotta stick to it."
451,NVIDIA,Challenging and immensely rewarding,2019-07-11,5.0,Principal Software Engineer,Daily technical challenges keep you engaged. Solving them is rewarding. I loved messing around with computers as a kid. It's a dream to be able to do that every day and get paid really well to do it.,I've been here well over a decade and still can't think of a con when asked.
452,NVIDIA,"Strong leadership, challenging but rewarding work",2019-07-08,4.0,Senior ASIC Engineer,"Very strong, charismatic, and trusted CEO leadership.

The mid-level engineering managers are either still active or used to be talented technical contributors, so they are usually trustworthy in terms of making good decisions.

For such a large company now, things still seem to move pretty quickly. There is heavy emphasis on execution here, so people are conscious about minimizing the overhead.

Again, the emphasis on execution allows the company to invest quite a lot into its internal workflow and methodology.

Very open environment encourages managers and new employees alike to  engaging in technical discussions.

Competitive compensation. The company seems to be focusing more towards family-friendly employee benefits, which seems to be growing in popularity.

The importance of the work is obvious to most people, without the execs having to hammer such notions obnoxiously.","The department directors seem to be throwing around catchy/buzzworthy phrases from Harvard Business Reviews, without providing mid-level managers sufficient guidance on how to address them. I felt that this lack of guidance turns such business school memes into sources of management anxiety, which eventually trickle down as stress to engineers.

Some individual contributors agree that the managers are too busy and bit ""out of touch"" with the happenings in the latest projects. The management career path does not seem very appealing, since the individual contributors constantly witness their managers having to deal with weird crap all the time.

Heavy emphasis on execution often pushes many engineers into shortsightedness. You either get criticized here for not delivering on time, or being ""too shortsighted.""

Weird product/marketing naming schemes aren't always understood by the engineers. They are typically considerate to send someone from the marketing to explain. That is very nice, but it's still not clear whether such minutia is understood by our customers.

The work culture is bit chaotic, and challenges people to adapt to new environment. Those who insist on sticking to their work process at their previous job don't fare very well."

455,NVIDIA,"Strong culture and benefits, challenging but fulfilling work",2019-06-12,5.0,Marketing Campaign Manager,"NVIDIA has an amazing culture, attracting top talent and wonderful human beings. Nearly everyone who works here is a joy to work with; they’re smart, push each other to do their best work, and fun. The benefits are some of the best I’ve seen in the industry (my healthcare providers are shocked by how good the insurance plan is; family leave and alternative fertility plans are phenomenal). The work you’ll do is fulfilling, and you see how you’re contributing directly to moving the needle for the entire company. There’s plenty of room to grow and move laterally throughout the company based on your interests. Managers are fair and great mentors. There are a wealth of people to support you in your work. The culture of sharing ideas and swarming problems to solve them means that knowledge is shared quickly, and the best idea wins (not politics).","Sometimes work life balance can feel out of sync during busy times (events, launches). Official performance reviews only happen annually. The “speed of light” culture is more of a testament to how incredible and hardworking the staff is, but not how the company should operate in general. Mistakes can get made and quality of work lessens when there’s a time crunch on every/majority of projects."

Very open, collaborative environment, you can reach out literally to anybody (including CEO) and get help. CEO reads status emails (!) and engages in discussions (!) with the teams about product directions and strategies (this is in AV org, not sure about others). 
I love the idea of workstream (virtual team) that can quickly summon people across the org, I haven't seen this type of thing in other companies.
I am a senior sw developer with 22 years in the Valley and worked at a few companies here and I can compare. NVIDIA is the best without any doubt.
Benefits are mostly fine, very good health insurance choices, some perks but don't expect a lot. New building was nice, but it felt unfinished, and any improvements take long time. 
NVIDIA generally has less office politics than I've seen in other companies. (Still it exists and frustrating). The 2016-2018 stock run up was nice, I didn't make a lot of money but still I can't complain.
A lot of your personal experience may depend on the team you join. There are absolutely horrible teams to work in (avoid IPP at all cost!), but also there are greatest and brightest teams. I did an internal transfer from an-ok team to a much better team (the transfer process was smooth and everyone was supportive). To compare my RSU increased more than 2x, with better wlb, I got much much more interesting projects, and the brightest minds to work with. So, lots depends on the manager and the team.","Growth for senior engineers like myself is really really not what it should be.
 RSU grants (vest over 4 years) are calculated as % of your salary, depending on your rating you get from 0% to 50%. You get rated NI (need improvement), FC (full contributor) with 2 categories A and B, and TC (top contributor) again with A and B. 
So TC-A gets 50% of salary in RSU grants - this is the absolute top compensation bump you could achieve no matter how brilliant you are and how big an impact you make. 
I think the other scale is FC-B gets 20%, FC-A 30%, and TC-B 40%. NI gets 0%.
Let's say you're a senior making 200K/year, if you're TC-A like myself it means you get 100K in RSU over 4 years, or 25K per year. After a couple cycles (2 years) you'll realize it's really not worth it all the effort and hard work for just extra 10% of salary. Stock can grow of course, but stock can also fall.

Endeavor building was not planned well - not enough bathroom capacity for number of occupants, people end up waiting for 10-15 minutes just to use a bathroom. Really don't know what to say here.

Parking situation is horrendous - again due to bad facility planning. If you come to work at 11am or later, forget about finding parking, valet will be full, and you end up parking illegally in neighbor parking lot. Go to work and fear all day you car will get towed. 
CEO was asked this question - his answer was - don't come to work at 11. Yeah, but we still have our lives, doctor appointments, our kids and loved ones, so it does happen sometimes I have to come to work later than usual."

I love the culture of transparency, where everything is shared with everyone.
You really never feel like they are cheating or trying to take advantage of you, except maybe when it comes to ""unlimited vacations"", which essentially means that the more you take, the worst you feel.
Another strong point is to feel heard. Whether through the suggestion box, through yearly surveys or any other channel, at Nvidia you have a voice.
Overall a great place to work!","Vacation policy.  It would be so much more honest to have a set number of days, with flexibility around it, instead of a vague and abstract concept of unlimited vacation."
483,NVIDIA,Here for the work,2018-12-28,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Exciting work. Interesting problems to solve.

HR responses to various suggestions are very political -- nothing gets done until higher management takes notice. 
Mis-managed/dead projects teams do not work. Company POR changes quickly so it's sometimes hard to avoid such teams when you first join.

Management tends to punch downward onto the team, rather than stick up for them. 

Basic tools are nearly impossible to aquire, at least in the creative department, due to strict budget constraints, despite each record-breaking quarter.  

Much of the old guard is WAY over their heads and were not prepared for such rapid growth. They seem to spend more energy protecting their positions than propelling the company forward. 

Our department had the struggles of an underfunded start-up while retaining the beauracracy of a large company at the same time."

489,NVIDIA,Nvidia is the real deal,2018-11-16,5.0,Senior Systems Engineer,"I'll be up front and say that it has always been my dream to work here. With that in mind, I came in telling myself to look at this place as objectively as possible to not cloud my judgement. After working here for over a year, I must say, the hype is real.

* Super transparent and surprisingly egalitarian

    I've worked at other tech companies where it's all double-speak. Here, the hire ups are just regular dudes with added responsibilities. It's surprising how you'll be chatting with some random guy  and you find out later he's a director or something. I've never experienced this before and it's awesome.

* The technology is incredible and so are the people who work on it

    I know everyone is ""Making the World a Better Place! ™"" in the valley, but seriously though, what a time to be alive! Processors that were developed for insane graphics are now used for the world's most powerful supercomputers. What's even crazier is you meet the people who develop all these tools and again... they're just regular, humble dudes doing their life's work. Outstanding.

* You're not a peasant, you are an engineer at one of the best tech companies in the world

    Coming into Nvidia, I was worried it would be a turn and burn shop like Amazon or IBM. A sort of ""We own you, now work 90 hours a week, drink this kool-aid and love us"", but it's not like that all. You're an individual and you determine your involvement/focus. This sort of freedom is incredible.

* Have I mentioned how awesome people are?

    Seriously though. I show up to work so I can work on cool things and hang out with people.","There are a few, minor ones that are just kind of annoying rather than a hindrance

* Some of the Newer Hires

     So I'm a recent hire, but I've noted some trends with the newer hires. Nvidia has made it to the big time and with that, we can start pulling in people who were originally gunning for the FANGs.  The problem is, a lot of those people just care about RSU's, insane perks and  literally nothing else.

* More on some of the newer hires

     They whine about the dumbest, most entitled, first-world problems. I'm not entirely sure if that Orange Mocha Frappuccino that you were served at nvcafe is entirely vegan, gluten free and fair trade certified. I'm sorry Nvidia is so awful that we don't have personal butlers at our stand by, ready to get us a kale/tofu/avocado toast that other tech companies obviously do. I'm sorry the stock dropped a little so you can't get gold rims for your jet-ski. Oh the humanity!

    I could go on, but you'll see these complaints on Glassdoor and Blind. They just care about perks and RSU's. I don't really feel like they're employees, just mercenaries ready to hop onto next thing once all their RSU's vest."

While most employees work a lot of hours, the company is also flexible with time off or WFH when needed.    Strategies and business direction is openly shared with employees, which is often not the case for a larger company.","The company moves ""at the speed of light,"" but at the same time, sometimes it takes too long to get things done.   That can be frustrating.    However, if one is persistent, you can keep things moving.    The hours are long and the workload is demanding.  That works for some people, but not others.

I like to be w/ the comp because of technology and products that NVIDIA working on.","since we are remote from Austin, Tx there are so many disadvantages of growth to advance further because of super micro manage from team leaders and managements.
* we have a very young and inexperience leaderships w/ bad attitude (not fit in their role).  Because of that many projects are LATE, micro manage to NOT important tasks and we missed out schedule
* our team leader and management often not at work office and hard to communicate, show up 20-30min late in their own meeting w/ smell, sweat workout clothes and we have to start all over because of his action.
* Third party rank and rate our internal employee survey are low in the 20%, but second & third line manager travel to Austin w/ many ignore and un-answer to our concerns.  Perhaps, they just want to show to their VP and CEO that they did travel to Austin site and had a team out to team building activity (like painting and eat until 9p) but there was not much to address our concerns and issues.
* we work w/o a life at home and the additional team building until 9-10p is not acceptable.  We are also have family to take care after work.
*annual salary was nearly stand still in the past several years.  They don't see what we worked to dead, they used comments to us during the performance review that they don't applied to them.
* managements stick to good old boy systems.
* I love pet at home and not at work.  People bring their dog to work that bark and smell like a zoo.  I personally don't think it is a healthy to bring pets to work to distract people surrounding in the company
* you can not pass the parking lot w/o going thru a group of NVIDIA employees smoking by the building

People who work here are generally friendly and cooperative.

Thanks to the company's success in the market, morale at the company is generally very high.

Subject to the demands of your work (see Cons) you have a lot of flexibility over how you manage your time.

Compensation seems competitive for the industry.

The company is a good corporate citizen and does try to give back to the communities in which it operates.

There's a refreshing lack of bureaucracy at the company.

The free coffee on the Santa Clara campus is very good.","The company can be quite disorganized sometimes. Lack of proper planning, an aversion to process, and an overoptimistic approach to scheduling occasionally  causes even the most mundane activity to degenerate into a firefight.

On some projects, management has the unreasonable expectation that staff be available 24/7. On one occasion I was pressured into cancelling my evening plans to finish an urgent update (which was ultimately delayed until the following week).

The professional time off policy for exempt staff means that all vacation time is taken at the employee's manager's discretion. The possibility that some crisis might erupt during time off makes it impossible to disconnect completely. The need to ask a co-worker to provide cover during time can make employees reluctant to take any time off at all.

The company does not always live up to the ideal of intellectual honesty cited as a factor in the company's recent success. In reality, sometimes employees who try to resist bad ideas are considered as ""poor team players""."

There are many bad hard to change codes not having quality. There are many decisions by unskilled decision makers trained by inexperienced who don't hold accountability themselves.
- Short incremental product cycles to stay ahead of competition (Nvidia obsoletes its own product from fear of competition), there are many bugs inherited from past.

The stock is on fire and everyone is thrilled about this. This is a great place to be if you are an intern, engineer, etc as NVIDIA is doing cutting-edge work that supports AI and Deep Learning industries. 

Some ability to work from home but it depends on your manager. Being able to do this infers a trust relationship between manager and report - this is on the wane. 

No vacation time here at NVIDIA. Instead, you can take what you need given your work load at the moment. Some folks put regular vacations on their calendar (a week every 3 or 4 months) just to make sure they're using their time off.  Some folks abuse the heck out of this system. Many people will tend to check in while on vacation, never really disconnecting from work.","It is nearly impossible to grow your career here. Little opportunity or support for transferring into other departments or roles. 

Newer senior management are awash in politics and are more interested in building empires than in supporting their reports. 

No yearly cash bonus. Instead you get RSUs that vest over 4 years. If you contribute to your ESPP plan, they use that in factoring how much RSUs you get at focal review time. Not quite fair as ESPP is voluntary. and can change mid-period. 

Medical benefits are finally starting to compete with the rest of the valley but still lag on 401K contribution matching, cost of medical care for dependants, etc.  

Educational benefits at Stanford are primarily for CS, EE, EEE, AI majors. There is nothing for management or marketing professionals under this program. There is a separate program that covers just over $5000/year for other education, but this won't cover an MBA. It might cover one or 1.5 classes a year at Stanford. I haven't heard of anyone getting their MBA covered through NVIDIA like at other companies I've worked for.

Lunches are supposed to be subsidized, but it's less costly to go out to eat at a restaurant. No snacks provided. 

Because there is no official vacation time at NVIDIA, if you leave or are laid off and haven't used much vacation time, you've essentially lost it.

Meager  to absent travel budgets. The management encourages those on global teams to just do video conferences to save money. CFO is constantly cutting costs and does a great job at this but sometimes we spend so much time on how to cut costs, or justifying expenses that we waste money in the lengthy discussion process."

The goodness comes from the top, with Jensen's unique brand of encouragement, humor, and a bit of fear mongering.  Long-term vision based on principles is celebrated, and hard work is rewarded.  Everything we do is cutting-edge, so the work is technically satisfying as well as being relevant.  In my particular case, NVIDIA lets me work remotely, which few companies these days do.  One other important aspect of NVIDIA worth mentioning is the openness toward respectful disagreement at every level.  There is a strong belief that confronting challenges early is always better than hiding them, and all levels of management welcome hearing about issues from anyone.  What more could you want?","The only thing I don't like very much is the vacation policy.  There is no fixed schedule.

- They want to learn by trying things out without involving outsiders who have been doing this since 10s of years
- They have an integration mindset, which is orthogonal to product development

* Rare to encounter anyone who is ""phoning it in""; very efficient workplace and dedicated colleagues
* Execution speed is admirably fast; I'd be surprised if any peer company (e.g. Intel/AMD/Qualcomm) can deliver new products at NVIDIA schedules
* Flat hierarchy - titles are generally private, and authority comes from earned respect. The company is still small enough for individual contributors to get recognition from the top.
* Every year the company has improved and dealt with problems and deficiencies employees have brought up.","* Global offices and round-the-clock handoff means the work day never ends. It's only possible to unplug if you force yourself to, as there will always be more work than time.
* Constant feeling of being understaffed, even if that may not be accurate. Work is not always load-balanced well.
* Many teams appear to pile on a lot of technical debt and are unable to staff internal improvements.
* ""Speed of light"" schedules sometimes forget to account that we're not in a vacuum :)
* Used to be behind in perks, but that is improving, e.g. shuttle services. Food is slowly improving, although costs unlike some peer companies, and dinner food quality is awful. No snack options besides some antiquated vending machines.
* Conf call + webex setup feels antiquated. Behind on communications technologies, which is challenging when dealing with a global team. Progress is being made but it's slow.
* Underinvestment in social aspects: Rare for teams to ever go out or do team-building activities. Celebrations are rare. Alcohol-free campus dampens any relaxed communication. No holiday party (community service is the replacement, which is admirable, but can't think of why we can't do both...)"

It is amazing to work here as things move at a reasonable speed and practical decisions are arrived at in almost no time. I also love the culture of being honest and straight where work has higher precedence then who proposes it.

NVIDIA is the leader in all of these areas. It is literally powering the next generation of computing. These technologies will change our lives forever. Having an opportunity to contribute and define this next generation of computing is special. 

People are encouraged to ""try"" and learn from their mistakes (within reason), rather than being punished for their mistakes. This is necessary when problems you are trying to solve have not being solved before.    

There is a lot of young people at NVIDIA, but it is not unusual for a person to stay a decade or longer here. there is continuity...

A lot of opportunities to learn new things. I thought I knew a lot when I joined, but I learned much more while collaborating with some of the most amazing people I've ever met.",Not for the faint of hart... Tight deadlines... Sky-high expectations...

The internal culture is fast paced, driven, accountable and dynamic.  There is transparency and a lack of silos that is refreshing",The only con so far is the recruiting process.  It is not uncommon to go a week or more without hearing from your recruiter.  Emails come at 3am and without a phone number(hard to engage directly).  So patience is needed if you are going through the process but it's worth it.

In general the company takes care of its employees (especially when it comes to health benefits).   The culture is also great.  At NVIDIA people are not afraid to make mistakes and the company only asks that if you make a mistake you learn from it.  People are not afraid of calling out inefficiencies where they see it and as an employee I have done this many times.  This truly gives me the ability to impact the direction the company is going.

Finally the salary is competitive with other high tech jobs.",In my 5 years at NVIDIA i've never come across anything that I would consider a big negative.

I left, and was at 2 jobs for less than a year each, before I desperately wanted to come back. Now I've been back for more than a year, and wondering why I ever left. NVIDIA does amazing work, but most importantly, is an amazing employer. There is strong support for work-life balance, but still a good kind of pressure to do a good job. Management is strongly interested in well-balanced employees, and sets realistic goals.","There's not much.

655,NVIDIA,"Solve interesting problems, improve your skills, and get well-paid",2017-01-09,4.0,Principal Software Engineer,"1. Important, interesting problems to work on. NVIDIA at its core is a company focused on making faster computers. That's a deep and broad mission that gives you room to work on a huge variety of specialities. Furthermore, you are helping move the state of the art forward, and contributing to a lot of deeply important solutions: CUDA is being used to research cancer and HIV; to implement AI (artificial intelligence); and much more than I can list here. 

This really is the center of a lot of incredibly important work, and you can feel the energy and excitement from that.

2. Competent, accomplished colleagues: you can easily find experts in various fields, who are very good at what they do. And you can learn some very advanced, cutting edge things from them, and well as lore and history of why things work as they do.

3. The company is getting large, but so far it is still small enough that you can make a real difference. And if you do, you'll be recognized and appreciated.

4. Polite, amiable culture. More smiling than frowning in most meetings, and lots of people really enjoy what they do, and enjoy working with you. Definitely one of the nicest, most friendly places I've worked. There is technical and political conflict, of course, but not the sort that leads to engineers getting stressed out (except for the resulting project schedules--see Cons, item 2, below. heh).

4. There are lots of projects, and they change quickly, too. This is also a Con, though. :)

5. There is a formal Technical career track, as well as a Management career track. This allows you to progress and move up, without transferring over into management, if you like.","1. Many of those colleagues are too overbooked to spend much time with you.

2. Software estimation is an elusive art, here and probably everywhere. This can easily lead to working a lot of overtime, in order to meet an unrealistic schedule.

3. The company does not, in its heart, believe that there is significant value in writing down documentation on how either the chip, or the software drivers are designed. Much of the chip interface, rather than being in a datasheet-style documentation, is implicitly documented in the driver (and in bug reports). The driver was written by software engineers who have a close email and personal links with the hardware engineers who wrote various parts of the chip. Everyone else has to suffer along with second-level information. 

4. Plans and projects change quickly, and often result in, ""can you please get this done in a few weeks? You can, right? Great-thanks-good-luck"". :)

5. Despite some recent improvements, the next chip decisions are still too strongly influenced by the engineers who happen to be implementing it in hardware."

nVIDIA also encourages employee to have internal transfer within the company to retain talents.

nVIDIA also offers international relocation packages to employees who are interested to relocate which most other companies don't offer.

nVIDIA does selective hiring. They never do big layoffs. During the worst time of the economy, they offer other options to employees like cutting some benefits instead of laying off value employees. 

They do not have 360 degree review. The performance evaluation system is fair to employees.",Would be great to offer free lunch to employees as employees are likely to stay and eat if free meals are offered.

9. Pretty good and open communication, not much is hidden, company places a high amount of trust in people to do the right thing
10. Stock in booming, great if you have options or other stock based compensation
11. Competitive base salary (total package a bit behind the likes of Facebook and Google)
12. A lot of talent and experience in both hardware and software (especially embedded), and general fairly healthy balance and support in the organization between hardware, software, finance, HR, and so on.","1. Hard for some teams and people to preserve work/life balance. Some weekend work and email checking. Depends a lot of the team and person.
2. Only twice a year employee stock purchase plan, so if you join at the wrong time you get burned and don't get to participate for six months
3. Stock options are only selectively distributed based generally on how well you negotiated at hire, some people got good deals, other people got nothing, so get no benefit from the stock rally 
4. Office cubes can be a bit cramped, but at least it is not open office so one can concentrate with headphones on and its not too bad. Would be nice to have a bit more space and white noise though.
5. Promotions and bonuses only once per year. Twice per year would be nice.
6. Not much parking during peak times
7. Suffers from demo feature creep, and does a bit of smoke and mirrors in marketing, however the management is aware of the issues and knows how to make real products, so this is mainly an issue in early stage projects where a lot is in flux"

Not really any ""lifers"" taking up space waiting to retire, everyone is engaged and people mostly smile and say ""hi"" to each other in the halls.  Be confident and have thick skin because if your idea or result is poor it will be called out.  Note that this is a ""pro"".","Lots of work to do, the pace is energetic and things can feel chaotic.  Amazing how a company with >10K employees can still feel like a startup sometimes with crude or non-existent processes.

I've personally never heard of another company that even comes close to NVIDIA's student loan repayment program.","I have to preface my cons list by stating that NVIDIA excels in every area that truly counts: its culture, company values, leadership, my own career (and career development), and coworkers. Here's where I see room for improvement:
-Would love free lunch (it's already discounted, but hey, why not shoot for the stars); maybe replace Aramark with a different food vendor

As the World Leader in Visual Computing, the company strategy applies to areas where the company can make a difference.  These include Computer Gaming, to Professional Graphics, Streaming Gaming | Graphics |, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.

By having the opportunity to work on new innovative areas, work continued to be challenging, and exciting, as we solve new problems, and bridge between research and commercialization. The culture is direct, open, and honest with minimal politics. There are a lot of A-type personalities, hence when a problem arises, the team swarms to resolve it. Leadership cares passionately about the health, and well-being of the staff, providing people with flexibility in work / life balance.

This is an exciting, fun, place to work, where coworkers are intelligent, driven, and passionate about what they do.  Perhaps that is why so many people who leave the company, return as other employee's don't match the balance of culture, challenging work, fun, and passion that exists here.","Working here requires resiliency, as you need to be willing to learn from failure, and open to direct feedback. It's unusual for such a large company to have the culture of a start-up, so people need adapt quickly as projects are canceled efficiently when they are not viable, or do not make business sense. 

Some teams, have challenges in work / life balance, and culture, hence like it does at any employer, it matters who you work with, and who you work for. There are some teams who do not learn from their mistakes, and could do better.

782,NVIDIA,Toxic environment in Analog / Mixed Signal Teams,2015-10-11,1.0,Engineering Manager,I can't seem to offer any pros right now.,"I've worked at Nvidia for 10+ years. Nvidia , as a company,  is good. But, what matters is the team / department culture. We used to have a good, low-key environment until few years back. Unfortunately Mixed Signal team has become a horribly toxic environment to work in.There was a reorganization few years back, and then another one...it seems that we are constantly reorganizing so that upper management gets promoted to higher ranks.  Many of the original folks left the company  to join Apple, Samsung etc. and their positions are filled with these new guys.
 
Nowadays, there is a very toxic environment and politics. Managers and directors keep promoting themselves, and if something goes wrong in the design, they point their fingers at designers, instead of owning the responsibility. They also fight with each other to get ahead of others, to the point that it is disgusting. It is the worst environment I've encountered in my 15+ years. 

I think that the best sign of how bad the situation is  can be seen from their job postings.  They have been trying to hire one 'quality' senior engineer for a long time (their postings are all over the place), but no good candidate accepts their offer, and he/she goes to other companies such as Apple, and Micron instead. I guess that people know about the environment here.

I suggest that you build your career somewhere else and don't even waste your time with interviews. But, If you decide to apply and if they give you an offer (it is usually above average, for a reason :) ), use it as a leverage against some other offer and move on with your life. You don't wanna waste your time with these folks.

Anyways...I started to prepare my own resume after 15 years here...."

795,NVIDIA,The next Sun or SGI,2015-09-09,3.0,Senior Engineer,"Lots of freedom, easy to communicate to anyone within the company, and involved in some of the hottest markets in tech.","Somehow the upper management come off as spastic, unpredictable and yet slow to adapt. A confusing and frustrating combination of traits.

Weak people stay around way too long and just get shuffled from group to group until they find a place where they can go unnoticed. Its almost unheard of for people to get fired. Eventually what happens is you get entire teams made up of rejects, often times still in charge of critical components.

The unofficial policy of having a cycling/random hiring freezes results in not being able to hire good people when they are available and hiring whoever walks in the door first when the freeze is lifted. The quality of the average engineer has declines sharply as a result during the time I was there.

The accounting rules imposed on various groups results in this bizarre tendency for managers to blow their entire budget at the end of each quarter because ""if they don't use it they lose it next quarter"". And then on the flip side insanely harsh budget limits get imposed completely without warning when the budget gets cut when its not used.

And Jensen himself is famous within the company for getting extremely upset and yelling at other managers when goals are not met or things don't go exactly how he wants or simply because he doesn't like them that day. This usually happens in large group settings so as to impose maximum embarrassment. Problem is its caused a culture of yes men around him where no one will tell him things are failing until its too late or they blindly direct their engineers to implement whatever random thought that comes out of Jensen's head without questioning or that no one wants to pick up potentially risky projects for fear of ridicule so they just get dropped.

And lastly, the GeForce cash cow has allowed nvidia to put its head in the sand when everyone in the know knows that that business is not long for this earth as personal computing devices get smaller and more integrated. Tegra was to save us from that fate but with that business burning to the ground everyone seems entirely too happy to pretend like the temporary Maxwell win vs AMD is going to last forever. And yes, as AMD slowly dies a painful death nvidia will appear to grow, but once that fire is put out once and for all, GeForce will hit a ceiling and optimistically will decline slowly, but realistically it will probably have a few catastrophic cliffs as new generations of integrated parts take out more and more of the dedicated GPU business until they are no longer a feasible product category entirely. With Tegra dead that leaves only Tesla and Quadro, but those are products that rely entirely on GeForce's high volume to make the businesses make any sense at all. That would turn nvidia into yet another HPC only company and will see the same fate as Cray, Sparc, SGI and so forth.



Beyond that when I finally decided to move on I was blown away by the offers I got elsewhere. I never felt nvidia was short changing me, but the benefits and compensation were simply not competitive. But the real reason I left was I was just frustrated by the bureaucracy and the fact that management was unwilling to admit its mistakes and learn from them."

When I worked here I could come into work and leave basically whenever I wanted, as long as I got to meetings on time and got some reasonable amount of work done.","Bad attitude, not forward thinking, no adjustment for past mistakes, no accountability.  The projects here area always delayed many, many times, and every time management is convinced it is the last time and opts to blindly rush to completion rather than do things efficiently and maintainably.  In this haste, something always gets done the wrong way such that it takes considerably more time the next time, work cannot be re-used, etc.  And then the project never actually completes by this date anyway despite the harmful shortcuts, making them pointless."

Leaders are obsessed about cutting costs. This results in unpopular company benefits, and difficulties in what many would consider fairly straightforward hardware procurement at other companies: not being able to upgrade storage to SSD, only 1 medium-sized monitor provided to each engineer, having to work with 5 years-and-older systems, not enough lab equipment (i.e. oscilloscopes, temperature regulators), etc. Some decisions seem to cost the company more money and headaches, when certain equipment has to get passed around (because there aren't enough), and get lost in the process.

The leader has never been big on work-life balance, and abuses the ""work hard, play hard"" spirit. I have heard several jokes here about the engineers being lured with a carrot, to be beaten up with a stick."

* Paid well
* Forgiving
* (in my case) Great hours, overall. Rarely any weekend or night work.
* Great HR representative
* Unrestricted time off policy that you could actually use reasonably.","* ""All-in"" on splitting work between India & US, even when impractical or counter-productive
* Still tries to act like it's a startup and everybody knows each other, which just means nobody knows anybody else anymore - or who does what (CEO is in denial about this.)
* Did not have enough budget to actually make enough prototypes to do your job.
* Had to repeat myself for five years, plus a never-ending language barrier. 
* Management was aloof. I spoke to my direct manager twice a year. This is not a typo. This is freeing, really, but perhaps that's not actual management.
* Staff is majority non-white (fine), but there are very few women - perhaps the least at any large Silicon Valley business. With broad demographics, I'd like to see more recruiting variety. (note: I'm white male.)
* Perhaps one of the least gay sizable companies in the area, too."

The only company that uses the Tegra chip is Nvidia itself for its own niche products: the Nvidia Shield and Nvidia tablet. It's only a matter of time before this entire division is sold off or shut down.

The documentation group merely cleans up engineering docs, adding punctuation and fixing misspellings. Its run by a sadistic micro-manager who will sabotage your projects so she can swoop in and play superhero to save the day. The only writers who stay are low self-esteem victims and masochists who believe the manager's dysfunctional behavior comes from her deep concern for their well-being. A classic abusive environment. If you're a masochist or someone who feels they deserve to be psychologically belittled, you'll find a home here. All others, keep away."

814,NVIDIA,"Innovative, startup culture",2015-07-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company has amazing, world-changing technology, and it’s working hard to figure out which markets will stick. This requires employees to be adaptable, flexible and really curious, because it’s likely you’ll get to work on something different at some point in your tenure.  This may not be for you, but if that sounds interesting it will expand your resume in ways you never thought possible on orientation day, even if you’re in a non-technical role.  Our culture is pretty unique, mostly non-political, everyone is direct with each other. Mistakes are embraced as part of innovation, it’s not cool to CYA and throw others under the bus.","No company is perfect, but my biggest peeve is that we’re slaves to shareholders quarterly expectations, which means we’re constantly crunching down on expenses each quarter. This drives bad (hoarding) behavior internally, and doesn’t allow us to take a long term look at opportunities and risks and be responsive and proactive v reactive. The company has a short term focus, which comes from us switching into new markets constantly, so we haven’t paid attention to building our brand with consumers like Intel did at this point in their business, and investing in building the people who are here (through training, sabbaticals, etc). Some recent investments and hires give me hope this will change in the next few years."

CEO is out of touch, mean spirited and insecure. His ego is enormous and he has personally ruined the launch of the companies products for the last 3 years because he insists on debuting them himself but his ability to communicate is impaired.

Talented management and individual contributors alike tends to realize issues with CEO are insurmountable and happily leave for better work conditions at other silicon valley tech companies.

877,NVIDIA,A stagnant place,2014-10-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"People are approachable to get the job done
Relatively flat organization
Flexible work environment","Poor work/life balance mainly because they are universally understaffed. Compensation is not commensurate to the amount of work put in. This has resulted in serious attrition issues across the board.
Poor benefits and no recreational / team building activities
Sub-standard working environment that reflects the cheapness, not frugality. 
Decisions are made and changed on the fly. Little organizational learning. 
For all it's bombastic claims, the company is more or less in a rut, as evidenced by it's stagnant revenues and stock price."
878,NVIDIA,Company in transition,2014-10-08,2.0,Engineering Manager,"I have bled green - worked for NVIDIA longer than anywhere and I've been around a long time. I've seen it grow from tiny to huge. The growth was phenomenal until 2008 or so. 
There are some great and very smart people here.
Products are good quality.
Mistakes are used to learn from. 
There is a very distinct culture here. Work hard and well, work hard. Relatively flat organization.
Politics exist but I always felt like I could pretty much talk to anyone in the organization at any time to get things done.","Business-wise - CEO bet the farm and lost (too late) on a lot of recent products. Trying to pick up the pieces now. Problem is, because of the previous success in PC-business, they think they can replicate that success but revenue has been stagnant (+/- within $4B/year) for the last 5 years or so. Gross margins are high - probably because they are so cheap on spending. 
I have had the pleasure of having fantastic bosses for the first phase of my career there and absolutely awful bosses more recently (unfortunately, they think they are good). 
Culture in my group involves yelling occasionally. This was precipitated in the early days by the CEO and seems to be the norm and accepted. On the one hand, when its yelling at the situation I can take it. When its yelling at me for no good reason other than lack of tact, its time to consider my options elsewhere. 
I used to work hard and feel good about it as the stock was going up and it made sense. I could see my impact to the company. I used to pride myself as not being a cog in the machine like at some other companies where you are a nameless engineer just doing your job. I really felt like I made a difference. Unfortunately, this is no longer true for me and I think for a lot of others. People used to stay long and work hard and feel good about it. Now I think there is resentment (for those that work long) and others just pretty much work and go home."
879,NVIDIA,A dysfunctional tech company plagued by its own CEO,2014-09-24,2.0,Senior Engineer,"Good financial compensation.
Good perks on campus including a well managed cafeteria and daily amenities such as dental care, car repair, bicycle maintenance and haircuts. It's not free but makes it easy to get certain regular tasks done without disrupting your day. 
High stress, fast paced environment will mold you into a rock star at your next company.","Offices are outdated, employees work on sub-standard computers and almost everything about the company's spending habits indicates that it's not just frugal but cheap.

Departments are universally understaffed and overworked so expect to work overtime. Environment drives away talent and encourages success to leave to find better working conditions.

Executive management is out of touch with reality in general. All employees likely to suffer from direct micro-management by the CEO sooner or later.

Worst part about NVIDIA is that the CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is wildly insecure, a slave to his own volatile emotions and universally abusive of his staff. He is prone to yelling and name calling in meetings and will personally lead witch hunts that are made worse by the universal desire of senior management to distract him from their own political in-fighting. He will publicly demean others and has made it impossible to form a larger, cohesive team within the company.

The internal reputation of Jensen (as he is referred to within the industry) is very poor and while he is well respected for his intellectual capacity he is also feared and loathed for his mean-spirited, personal attacks and for being completely unapproachable."
880,NVIDIA,Good place to work,2014-09-15,4.0,ASIC Engineer,"Lot of things to learn. Since it is a relatively small company, you have a lot more responsibilities.",Compensation revisions are not great. I think the management has to improve a little bit to retain the talent they have and reward them fairly. I dont think this is happening. Also there are hardly any events for employee satisfaction here.

If you're someone that likes a lot of structure this might not be a good place for you.
886,NVIDIA,One of the best companies in the valley to work for. They work on bleeding edge technologies.,2014-08-17,5.0,,Nvidia is willing to take risks to position itself into future markets.  They are good in learning from their mistakes.,We work on high end products and sometimes get bad press on the direction we are taking. This results in lower stock prices than many of us feel we should be at while working in the valley.

888,NVIDIA,"Busy, lot of myopic fire-fighting, regular late-night meetings",2014-08-06,3.0,Senior Hardware Engineer,"The project schedule is mostly set up around the designers, which makes for fairly reasonable engineering deadlines. The environment offers a very good opportunity for young engineers to pick up the trade.

Much of the company has strong confidence in the CEO.","Poor benefits. Only matches 401k up to $1500/year. Bonuses not exercisable (even for cash), released slowly across 3-4 years. Only upper management receive stock bonuses; senior engineers and below still receive cash bonuses, which are strangely still released slowly across 3-4 year span.

Poor career mobility. Be prepared to keep working on the same thing for your entire career. Also, one should note that busy work is not necessarily enlightening. There is a constant fire-fighting in the engineering due to apparent nearsightedness. Engineer might be stuck babysitting someone else's mistake on daily basis, and there is an odd reluctance by the owners to fix their own mistakes unless they themselves are directly impacted. The sense of ownership and responsibility is surprisingly lacking from many engineers.

Devastating work/life balance. The company has outsourced a lot of the design and verification jobs to India, China, and Taiwan. It has become usual for people in California to get stuck in late-night meeting running past 10 and 11 p.m. for four or more days a week. It does put a lot of stress on the engineers, and employee retention is not superb because of that - we have lost a good chunk of our team to a rival company. Working 10 hrs/day or longer is a norm here.

Young engineers find it motivating that they can relate closely to the end product that they are working on. However, it is very depressing how the company fails to get design wins time and time again, after the company shifted its focus to mobile."

No one takes responsibility of their actions and focuses on blaming the next guy down corporate ladder.
The smart and creative engineers leave within 2 years of joining
Strong emphasis on collecting data that doesn't make any sense
Politics drives this company. 

This place is toxic and poor for new graduates

The motto of speed of light is ridiculous. This is just a term used by management when they realized when the project encounters a major setback because they sacrificed too much quality for unrealistic deadlines and cost.

Since she started running the department a few years ago, she demoted all her supervisors. EmployeeS walked out without giving notice. She involved way too much in APA. I think this could be her side job. Stupid management didn't see this even the employees brought to their attention. It's sad the company is a decent place to work for.

946,NVIDIA,One of the Worst Jobs I've Had,2013-07-30,1.0,Technical Writer,"Decent salary and benefits. Nvidia is a large company, so your experience will be largely determined by which group you work in. I saw some engineering groups that seemed like good places to work. But check out the manager and co-workers carefully.","I worked in the mobile group as a technical writer, but the title is misleading. All technical writing in the mobile group is performed by engineers, and tech writers simply convert it to PDF or HTML and release it to the proper channels. It's strictly document production, churning out docs under very heavy time pressure.

The only docs ""written"" by tech writers are Release Notes-type docs. API References and meaty technical documents are written by engineers. Beware: I was told during the interview that this was a writing position. However, all Technical Writer positions in the mobile group are more accurately described as document-production jobs.

In fact, real technical writing in the mobile group is not valued; no time is allocated to produce proper documentation. What is valued is churning out engineer-written docs at a fast pace.

Sadly, people in the mobile group who can spew out documents at a quick rate are placed in managerial positions, even if they are over-reacting, micro-managing bullies with no people skills. Beware you don't end up working with one of those."

There is simply too much fire-fighting here. Hardware is not designed very cleanly because of this. Some engineers may get frustrated by having to debug a debug feature. Some projects end up looking like a huge stack of bandages because of poor planning, discipline and execution. Very poor documentation, and lack of redundancy - one could also look at this as efficiency and leanness, but this could be problematic when key engineers jump the boat."

Base salary and bonus are lower than many Bay Area companies. Benefits are not attractive. Working environment is not so good: only drinking water is free!  I cannot comment on the overall management, but my manager is definitely doing too much micro-management. If you are only attracted by it's ""fame"", be careful on your offer choice.

 - Relatively flat organization with little politics. You can get attention for your projects even with 8k employees
 - Definitely play hard mentality after you're finished working
 - No accruing vacation. Take it as you need it. (however I've noticed this also breeds a lot of peer pressure NOT to take vacation...so you just have to be OK with that)","- Very stressful work environment. At crunch times, there is ZERO work/life balance
- Teams will be near completion on a project, and then a senior person will come in and completely change direction. It wastes time.
- There are always big ideas that trickle down from the top without consideration for how many resources will be needed to execute. Each person is doing 3-people's jobs.
- Abrasive communication style. Very negative, very aggressive.
- None of the fun perks that other large Silicon Valley companies are known for. No free lunch. No shuttles from SF. No 401k matching (while I was there, although I think this has since changed). No cash bonus (only RSUs)."

(In a way, this often can be counter-productive)  Besides leadership issues, there are also lack of employee growth, you are there to get your job done, the company offers very little in terms of growth, if they want additional management resources, they will just bring a new hire instead of ""promoting"" those who have been there and done a lot from the start. There is little or almost no chance of moving from and to another team - specially if your manager don't want to lost any more people. RSU stock is a joke - it's designed to keep you there for forever.

960,NVIDIA,Great company and exciting workplace,2013-03-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"When I saw some of the negative reviews on Glassdoor about NVIDIA, I was nervous about whether my experience would be similar to those ones. Having worked at NVIDIA for nearly a year, though, I can say that my experience has been anything but negative. I absolutely love my job here -- I wake up excited each day to come to work. My work life balance is great -- when I'm at work, I work hard, but I then leave my work at the office and don't think about it when I'm at home.The work itself is challenging, but I have found that  this helps to motivate me all the more. I have never had any trouble getting help from my co-workers, and in fact, I've found that most will bend over backwards to help someone else when they need it. I've found that most of the individuals I've worked with have been exceptionally smart and I've learned a lot from them, but at the same time, I've found that I have been able to offer a lot back to the group and it's a great feeling to feel that my relationships have been a two-way street. It's also been awesome to work at the cutting edge of technology and to see the innovations the company is developing.  

I'm continually impressed with NVIDIA and I feel I've made the right choice in coming here.","The main form of communication at NVIDIA is email, and accordingly, you'll get tons of it. Effective filters/rules help to manage the deluge."

NVIDIA allows Engineers to work from diverse, international locations.

Life balance is pretty good, because NVIDIA is very philanthropic and encourages it's employees to give back to their communities.  The company hosts several fundraiser and community outreach projects each year and most international locations.  You can bring your dog to work!  

The main campus cafe is excellent, and the secondary cafe is pretty good.  However, NVIDIA does not provide a food subsidy.  Only sodas, coffee, tea and water are free in the cafes, and vending machines are available on most floors in the main buildings.

NVIDIA admittedly pays a a little below the average industry rate, but they supplement it with twice-per-year bonus periods where employees have a chance to earn RSUs.

Onsite services are pretty good: cafes, dentistry, massage, car maintenance, dry cleaning, and more.

The cultural make-up is primarily Asian, with most folks being from India and China, then Caucasian.  Women are not well represented in the Engineering ranks.  There is a very active intern program.","NVIDIA allows Engineers to work from diverse, international locations.  However, that makes if difficult to collaborate on projects.  The company lacks a clear workflow for information distribution with data spread between various teams, their poorly maintained wiki pages, and various Perforce documents, not easily accessed.  

When working on devices, there is no clear project leader to manage the evolution of the life cycle, outside of major milestone goals in software.  It is easy to lose track of small, but critical changes to behaviors, or ODM data settings, for example.  Devices across teams often have various components onboard creating inconsistent testing results, with no primary documentation to refer to to confirm correct components.

Sr management is in Santa Clara, but some middle management and the bulk of QA is in India.  The communication between the two locations is on-going, but India is doing all the tools and automation development.  Their primary focus is their needs, and they try to shoehorn other teams into the tools they have developed, instead of being responsive to the actual needs.  They have determined the project reporting structure and are inflexible to provide something more modern.

QA is being driven towards 100% automation.  Sr Management doesn't seem to understand that this is impossible, and continues to make unrealistic demands of automation teams. This is happening in India and US teams have limited insight into the effort.

NVIDIA has a very low tolerance for QA spending money on its QA efforts.  Resources are difficult to acquire.  The company-wide policy is borrow, rather than buy.  If you don't have to borrow, look for an alternate solution first.  Members of my team often start the day looking for test items that have been ""borrowed"" by Engineers. 

The computer infrastructure is Windows-based, but many folks use Macs and Linux workstations.  Sometimes these other OSes are required, but they are poorly supported by IT. It can be miserable when problems arise."

Not a lot of documentation when starting with a new job. But peer co-workers are generally helpful. 
Thoroughness and high quality work often get neglected in favor of schedule constraints. Consequences are thrashing, fighting fires, and correcting bugs left behind by others resulting in long work hours.
While upper management takes the right decisions to steer projects in the correct direction lower management has to execute and their team members need to do whatever it takes to get there. Some people are not comfortable with the mandated flexibility and sacrifices it requires.
