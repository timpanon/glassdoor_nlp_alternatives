The company has unrealistic expectations of its employees. You’re required to make 50 cold calls a week to prospect while following a script that makes it sound like you’re a robot. If you don’t get any leads off of those then it reflects in your yearly review. They will promise you a promotion to get you to work harder then give it to someone else and then promise you the next promotion is yours. Don’t fall for it, it’s not worth the stress of getting yelled at by customers for NSF fees, or getting sexually harassed by customers, or having to work around sick employees, or having to work understaffed because the company refuses to adequately staff their branches."

The other 10% is doing actual banker activities. Some locations are very slow compared to other big named banks so the goals can be a little ridiculous.

228,,Stay away,2021-11-02,1.0,Financial Relationship Consultant,PTO and benefits are all that this company has going for it.,"Regions focuses their entire business model off of their Greenprint which is a forced survey to customers about all of their financials. This would be a great tool, but it shoved down everyone's throat to the point that it pushes people out of the branch vs in, like upper management continues to say it will. This takes away any potential sales due to a robotic process aimed towards people just wanting to cash a check. If you don't make a sale immediately, you're watched like a hawk. 
Quarterly incentives are based off a stack system where the top half of performers are paid a tiny bonus and the bottom half are reprimanded. This creates a hostile environment where employees aren't a team but just another form of competition. Upper management gives no support, but just moves the goal post for employees already spread thin in order to increase production by intimidation. 
Regions pushes lending, but wont approve simple applications. Underwriting is in shambles and severely understaffed, which seems to be a common theme in every sector of this company.
Regions loves to foster a hive mentality where everyone follows what is told, but the second someone questions the process, you are placed on a coaching plan.
Calls are also severely pushed, especially to prospects who most of the time aren't real numbers. A call doesn't count unless it is an actual connection and even then, if you don't gain a sale, you are doing it wrong. Bad scripts are forced on top of this all and if you don't sale, its because you're reading the script wrong.
Gallup surveys meant to survey employee satisfaction are heavily manipulated and questions are asked more about our immediate management support vs upper management and anything that measures what is actually going on. In our specific instance, because one person transferred and did the survey on their previous branch vs our branch, all of our surveys were made null.
Over all it seems that upper management is aware of what is wrong, but unwilling to change it due to all the money that was poured into a failed system. No care is given to its employees, just more unrealistic goals.
Branches employees are forced into a universal set up with no tellers there for in charge of all transactions, marketing on top of that, meeting ever increasing goals, staying on top of policy through an already confusing catalog that includes past null policy, producing lending without a real incentive to do so, and maintaining sanity. Hands down the most toxic job I've ever had. If you don't drink the koolaid, you will sink."

Company claimed to have an inclusive culture and that employees were encouraged to look for promotion from within. I applied on several occasions, reached out to the hiring managers to connect on LinkedIn or sent an intra-company email and was ignored. Practice what you preach Regions!

296,,Terrible,2021-09-12,2.0,Financial Relationship Consultant,Health insurance is decent. Customers are nice.,"They will lie to you during the hiring process. Once you are hired, the response if you bring up that you were told something would or would not be what you are experiencing is a shrug and ""too bad"". There is no actual training program. You are giving an online website and told ""good luck"". You won't have a dedicated trainer, it is the a ""group effort"" which just means everyone gets to pass the buck. No one is paid to train you and they don't have time with all of the other things they are working on. There are a few good managers in the market, but several are just awful people. I have witnessed some just blatant racism and if they are called out on it, they will retaliate. The company as a whole went downhill fast when John Turner took over. There is a lot of talk about how important the employees are, but we were treated terribly in the branch. Maybe it is just the Shreveport market, but there are only 2 or three managers around here that treat their employees like actual humans and they are all getting burned out. The area director acts like she doesn't like any employees. Oh, and there is NO room for advancement! People are moving to the contact center left and right just to get out of the branches, but it is NOT advancement."

New associates are brought in at a higher pay rate then current employees and regions doesnt do anything to correct this. There is a lot of ""being part of the club"" when it comes to advancement.

311,,You really WORK for your money here!,2021-09-01,4.0,Financial Relationship Specialist,"Regions is great about work/life balance. When you clock out, the day is done. All the bank holidays are great to be off. You start with 2 weeks paid vacation and can purchase up to 2 more weeks if you want it taken out of each paycheck. You also get time off for sick days, doctor visits, etc, but you cannot use those as vacation days. Helping customers reach their personal financial goals is a joy when you actually have time to do it.","You are stretched as thin as Regions can possibly stretch you. One teller in lobby, one teller in drive through, handling lines of customers all day by yourself, and then you still have tons of other jobs you have to take care of besides helping the customer in front of you. Even though Regions starts higher for ""tellers,"" here tellers do WAY more than just count money. They multitask and do other jobs across the entire branch. FRS have to also be part-time bankers and open accounts, do maintenance, open credit cards, handle fraud, research customer issues, research and fix coding error issues for transactions, and do out-bound phone calls to warm leads to bring in more business all throughout the week as well, and that's not even half of it. FRCs have to also rotate onto the teller line and work a cash drawer in between appointments, loans, and doing even more out-bound calls every week. It'll put the best multi-taskers to the test."

342,,Company doesn’t care for employees,2021-08-12,1.0,Financial Relationship Consultant,Company was quick to hire and showed urgency in starting right away.,The branch location that I worked at had a COVID outbreak. The manager encouraged those with the virus to continue working and kept the branch open. When expressing concern due to having high risk family members I was told that there was a business to be ran and to get over it. Ended up getting the virus and refused to go in due to fear of spreading to others. Was told that I was not allowed to miss more than 3 days or I would lose my job. The majority of our customers are retired and I didn’t feel comfortable exposing them to the virus. Out of respect for my community I chose to not go back to the organization. When being hired for the company I never received the resources or materials to contact our HR department due to the company’s desperation to get me on the cash line. I will never go back.

They force you to sell and they want you to do with really shady tactics that do not benefit the customer. Bottom line they do not care about the employee or the customer. They only care about the money.

350,,Terrible experience,2021-08-05,1.0,Branch Manager,"Salary was wonderful, no complaints there. My direct team was great, we all got along like a little family.","My direct “Leadership”.  We had a checklist a mile long every day, but also long and pointless conference calls (I don’t mind calls, but please make it valuable & don’t waste my time) I was just a body in a branch, not an actual person to my direct “leader”.  Days with only two employees in the branch the entire day with no lunch or breaks with completely open lobby and drive up & Leadership didn’t care. Extreme sales culture, pressure to push “greenprints” and products on clients. The call system was absolutely absurd, it would rotate the same clients over and over, no real way to track or place good notes if you were able to have a good conversation. Because I don’t think it was about trying to get to know clients, it was too product push, so there was a very little space to keep notes. They don’t want manager’s to actually coach and mentor the team, they want them to be the business bankers of the branch and open accounts. The systems that we were forced to work on are the most old and antiquated I’ve ever seen, efficiency is unheard of. None of the back office teams work with the branches, it’s almost like a tug of war and nobody is on the same side and the clients suffer. I could continue to go on, but I think I’ve made my point."

361,,Great Company,2021-07-30,4.0,Systems Administrator,Family-like environment. Great benefits and good to customers. Great place to work. Benefits are good.,Pay is not competitive with other peer banks. Company should mirror the diversity shown to its communities by showing the same diversity with employees.
362,,"Started off Good, Not so more",2021-07-30,2.0,Financial Relationship Consultant,"Great work/life balance. Bankers hours are the best along with being off every federal holiday. 
Meeting new people and making a difference in their lives. The job allows you to be the difference between banks. You can choose to be the reason a customer stays with the bank.","Seller mentality. You don’t think you have to be a top tier sales man to work at a bank. That’s a lie. Regions cares more about sales than anything else. Of course you need to drive revenue, but forcing a sales conversation when someone is just trying to pay a bill is a bit much. 

Your job is very much like that of a call center. If there is not a customer in front of you, they want you on the phone. A minimum of 30 contacts is required. Not 30 calls, 30 contacts. If you didn’t talk to a person or left a voicemail, the call does not count. Also, the call lists are generated by the system. If you called someone and they didn’t answer, that person goes on your coworker’s list to be called the next day. Despite the continuous complaints from customers to stop calling, Regions pushes calls even more. Also, those calls are reaching out to current customers and trying to convince them that they need a line of credit, loan, or credit card. So, sales again.

There is also a program that is not helpful, called a Greenprint. Greenprint is a questionnaire that a customer completes to get a clear picture of how they bank and sees if they could benefit from any “help” from Regions. These are required to be done with every customer that sits with you. It is meant to create an “aha” moment from the customer…. It never does. Half of the questions have nothing to do with why the customer is at the bank. There is a minimum requirement for how many of these you complete in a week. Supervisors come down hard when the requirements are not met. 

Regions cares more about the Greenprints you complete and the amount of calls pull you make more than they care about the customers you help and lives you change. Looking for a promotion? Well, they are going to look at the calls you make before they look at the actual work you do. 

It’s become so bad that employees are lying about how many calls they make and greenprints they complete. Management knows this but continues to report the numbers so they look better. It makes it look like the system works, but it does not. It’s broken and something new is needed."

Work with some great people. Ample sick and vacation time for all employees. You can even purchase additional weeks of vacation after a year of employment.","Horrible management and training. Regions will hire you and not divulge what is expected of you to satisfactorily perform your job. Since covid they are hiring people who are totally unfit for management and who will throw you under the bus to keep their jobs. If you currently work for Regions you should know that new hires will be making a higher salary than you and you will ""unofficially"" be responsible for training said people.
Horrible morale and management does not care. If you have issues and voice them they will tell you that you are wrong and you are responsible. I would NEVER recommend you work for this company in the Birmingham area. I hear other places are better and actually care for their employees. I am happy if that is true."

They want everyone in a branch to do everything, thus eliminating the teller position. They're phasing it out but what a bad idea. This means less opportunity for those with no previous banking experience to start at Regions. They also pay poorly, don't promote easily, the management is useless, and the bonus structure is so lacking in comparison to other banks in the same market and footprint. They don't pay enough, and have no respect for their employees. They're constantly whittling down the number of people in a branch to run it so branches are chronically understaffed.

-Support from manager and regional managers (though this is branch based)
-Technology is pretty good
-Exec leadership is phenomenal","Benefits not great, and the sales are extremely unattainable if you work in a medium to slower branch. Yes, part of sales is creating your own opportunities, but to have the same goal at a busy branch as compared to an extremely slow branch is asinine. On top of that, you can hit the “goal” but not hit the “incentive goal” at the same time. I was not made aware of this before I started, and had I been, I would not have taken the job. In addition, an extremely toxic employee was allowed to work the company, destroying team morale for 5+ years, while manager after manager did nothing about it, until finally one leader came in to address the issue. 

There is an EXTREMELY high focus on reaching outbound customers. You are expected to reach 10 people each given workday (not including Saturday). The goal is to have them in for a financial review, which is great. However, once you have reached a customer, they will cycle back into your call feed within a MONTH. How would you like to be badgered by your bank once a month trying to solicit to you? I’ve had to put multiple CUSTOMERS on a do not call list for Regions which is just flat out embarrassing. In order to move up, you have to hit a certain goal for 3 straight quarters, which as I remind you, is virtually unattainable, despite being average to great at sales. There is also high turnover and frequent short staffing issues, resulting in employees having to be pulled from other states in order to cover. I worked probably 4-5 Saturdays in a row at one point, and became totally burnt out."

414,,"My experience has been good, but your experience will vary.",2021-06-28,4.0,Financial Relationship Consultant,"The best reason to work for Regions is the pay. Their pay is far more than most banks that I’ve looked at and almost twice as much as the previous bank I worked for. They give a lot of advancement opportunity as well. Matter of fact they push for your promotion. This is true across the board. It’s a huge focus for them as a company. If it wasn’t for the pay, this company would have a 2 or 3 star rating from me.","BY FAR THE BIGGEST CON is having weekly activity goals. They want you to make 35 answered phone calls every week, have 10 financial discussions every week, as well as 10 appointments every week. This is because this is a sales focused position. On paper it seems like having all these calls, financial discussions, and appointments would drive success and bring in more business. However, there’s no correlation. In 2 years of working here and hitting close to or above $20,000 PE (PE is a metric they use to track your sales. $20,000 is typically the quarterly goal) every quarter, I can say that I’ve made 2 successful sales from all of those useless phone calls. Several people have told me the exact same thing. All employees fake their activity numbers for the most part because of the amount of pressure that is put on you to get them. You can get $20,000+ PE (which is actually the number that gages your success as a salesperson) BUT if you didn’t make enough calls, you won’t be getting a raise. The financial discussions they want you to have are done through a program called a GreenPrint. It’s a very cookie cutter way of doing things. The GreenPrint is the BACKBONE of Regions bank. This is the most important number to fake lol it was originally a tool for new bankers who either didn’t know what all questions to ask a customer or simply didn’t know how to navigate a financial discussion. After a year or so, you could step away from the tool and have these discussions organically. This is obviously the more professional way to do things. It was originally a great tool. Now it’s become this number that they want you to get AT ALL COSTS. On paper, it makes sense to push this. Unfortunately, it doesn’t correlate. I’ve been meeting my PE goals and faking my numbers since a few months after I started there, and so have every one of my co-workers."

From shoddy equipment, slow connectivity, no WiFi in the branches, to inadequate systems and poor online banking platform. Resources and support staff outside the branch, that you are dependent on to serve customers, are basically incompetent or flat out don’t care about their jobs or supporting frontline staff.  Electronic resources are ineffective. Call center will constantly push issues to the branch that we cannot fix or control, based off their unwillingness to have difficult conversations or solve issues themselves.  Sales reporting is often inaccurate and not adjusted to reflect vacations, staffing vacancies or onboarding of new hires, resulting in skewed data that your performance ratings are based off of."

Regions has received Gallop's ""Best Places to Work"" award several years in a row.
Managers are required to discuss career development every year, and associates are encouraged to keep their skillsets updated within the company HR platform for higher visibility of qualified internal applicants as needs and opportunities arise.","Some roles have limited upward mobility. Many roles (for example, in IT) are hard to break into without several years of experience. The annual merit increase is generally capped at 2-3% for great performance, but can be 0% if performance is lackluster or you have already peaked your salary range based on your assigned job code. Rock stars are not often rewarded with tangible bonuses or pay increases. The best way to ensure you are getting paid what you are worth is to transition to a different role every few years--even if not moving to a management role, a lateral move to another department often offers higher compensation for the same qualifications and skillsets. 
I know of one scenario in which someone accepted a job in another department, but ended up taking retention offer instead to stay in their current role with a new title and a higher pay grade offering an immediate 10% increase in salary."

457,,unrealistic expectations,2021-05-31,3.0,Branch Manager,"Excellent Covid 19 communication, took appropriate precautions during the pandemic",A Branch Manager cannot possibly get all tasks done in a day. Employee attrition is high. Incentive/ Bonuses are far and few.
458,,So so,2021-05-31,3.0,Financial Analyst,Pay is pretty good. I can say that,"Old systems , do not care about employees"
459,,Good Benefits and Pay is more than fair relatively speaking,2021-05-30,4.0,Financial Relationship Senior Consultant,"Good Benefits, Pay is relatively fair",Nothing enough to be noted here.
460,,"Great benefits, terrible position.",2021-05-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great pay and benefits. Lots of sick time.,"Unrealistic sales goals. Bankers are forced to take on the job of being a teller, while making all of your sales goals at the same time."

463,,"""Diversity and Inclusion"" Fake Wokeness Front",2021-05-27,1.0,Financial Representative,A 9-5 except for the peons that have to work on Saturdays.,"Regions' ""diversity and inclusion"" talk is just a front to give the old white men that run the company a way to get rid of the peons(who are mainly minorities and women) on the front lines, without appearing to be racists. They pretend to be ""woke"" old white men while saying all the employees are one big happy family, but are trying to find trivial reasons to fire and discipline the workers that actually deal with the customers.

Regularly processed 250-400 transactions a day personally, with only two other tellers (also with 150-200 each) but was told I don't have good enough conversations and don't make enough calls.

Regions corporate is moving towards a universal banker system, which will call for the bankers spending some of their time on the cash line while tellers become bankers themselves - but goals will not be moved at all despite losing a week or two per month that would normally be spent opening accounts and filling applications."

Staff are so focused on these goals because they are force fed to you all day through huddles and pressure from managers. There is absolutely no team work as everyone is focused on meeting their own goals and it results in poor customer service when employees dislike their job so much. This was truly the worst environment I've ever worked in, and I've worked at Wells Fargo."

Regions is a place where unquestioned loyalty is rewarded. However, if an associate questions the efficacy or veracity of a system, that associate is blacklisted. Upper management wields far too much power in areas where Human Resources should govern. A simple personality conflict can derail your entire career at Regions. The CBM controls the mobility of all associates in the managed district. When associates look to grow, the CBM must agree or the promotion will be nixed. Many CBMs are territorial over their associates, with some possessing a slave owner mentality, as if they control your entire career progression. Well, they do. They prevent transfers. They undermine promotions. They do all of this without oversight or explanation. They gaslight employees by constantly moving expectations. Once an associate reaches the objective, measurable thresholds for advancement, the CBM must perform a “wholistic” review before the associate can promote. If the associate is a producer, then often the CBM exercises control over the associate to force said associate to remain in the district. This solely benefits the career progression and bonus payout of the CBM, while installing a glass ceiling over producing associates. 

Regions often pushes out pilots to associates that have bugs, glitches, and fail to meet minimum beta standards for usage. In R&D, Regions employs the learn as we go mentality. 

Regions data mines its customers without their informed consent. When, this was discussed amongst my colleagues, no one seemed to care. In fact, those at the CBM level and higher increase pressure to data mine as a part of a formal metric system. Yet, Regions has not informed a single customer as to the nature of the data mining. 

Regions is reactive. Every system in place has been put there to prevent a Wells Fargo type of fiasco. However, Regions’ sales practices are just as demanding as those that were at Wells. Regions employs a CYA approach to sales. “Make sure you follow the process,” but also, “make sure you produce at [X] level.” You can either be process driven or ends driven. Following this hybrid approach is disingenuous at best, unethical at worst. 

Regions is full of “yes” men and women, at all levels, and that devalues the creative process. Moreover, it fosters a conform or leave managerial model. There are no leaders at Regions, only supervisors and bosses. They love to bark orders (eh, provide coaching plans), but when an associate is in the muck, they choose to let that associate get swallowed up instead of getting in the muck with him or her. It’s sad and disheartening. 

There’s a better way to lead, Regions. You are doing your associates and customers a disservice with the current model."

You get to help customers choose financial products that work for them and help them meet their financial goals for the present and the future.,"Training is weak. I was stuck in front of a computer screen for my first week, but I already knew the job, which helped. Deadlines and sales goals are unreasonable, and you will be written up if you fail to reach your goals. Your years/progress with this employer mean nothing when they want to crunch numbers; you're just a number. You WILL be micromanaged, patronized, scapegoated, and gaslighted. Management will ask about your career goals, and talk about a plan, but will not help you move you into the positions you desire. Only favorites will get promotions and awards even if they use unscrupulous and illegal ways of achieving those goals. My branch's atmosphere was toxic, especially management, but not all locations/people are like this. You will be working at least two positions and only be paid for one. Job titles matter to your colleagues. Bonuses are low for the hoops you have to jump through to get them. If you have issues with stress or anxiety or any other medical conditions, this job is not for you. Many warned me before I accepted this position, but I didn't listen; they left because of the stress. If your anxiety or medical condition interferes with your work, then they will be more eager to help you out the door instead of helping accommodate you."

If a customer comes in and has a serious issue or needs help, but they have you in a call hour, you can not help them and you will get in trouble if you do. But if you get a bad survey after making a customer wait, then you are in trouble too. The goals they set are unrealistic. There is no way to meet them at all. but they just keep going up. They schedule you what to do with every single minute of your day and will reprint your schedule each day. They will tell you how many calls you should have in an hour, and expect you to have a detailed conversation with each one. You have to have a 10 minute conversation with your manager after each customer you speak with on the phone or in person, which is just them telling you how you should have sold something else to the customer even if they are in bankruptcy! If you do actually get someone on the phone that wants to talk to you and goes over all of their finances and you get them a mortgage and a new account and a car loan and send them to meet with someone about investments, but don't have time to call anyone else that hour then you are told you are lazy and not doing enough activities. But if you call 10 people and don't do a thing for them, you are treated like you are amazing. They have cut so much staffing that you are never able to get all of your work done because you are doing the work of three people. People will get overwhelmed and cry in the bathroom.

685,,A Dead End,2021-01-13,2.0,Financial Relationship Consultant,"1. Health, Dental, 401k (however they only start matching after you've been there a year)
2. PTO and sick days
3. The work is easy","1. The pay is trash. I feel poor working here. You can't pick and choose when you want to work weekends for overtime so there's no way to increase your pay. 
2. The technology is prehistoric. Slow, laggy, inefficient, and badly made. Just terrible. Looks like it's from the 90s.
3. I found that the people who work here are very small minded. They are notorious little do-gooders who have no creativity or ability to innovate. They never challenge the status quo and are thus always painfully mediocre and uninteresting. The business encourages people to report one another and tell on one another for every little mistake made.
4. The customers are honestly annoying. Mostly bored and angry old people who don't understand what email is constantly nagging you for silly things they could do on their own in 5 minutes. You spend 60% of your day resetting passwords and checking balances.
5. There is hardly any real finance involved with the job. And they don't teach you anything about the little that is there. They just expect you to call and sell like a mindless robot. They raise your goals and then lower the reward for meeting them. It's absurd. There's no real benefit to meeting the goals but also no real punishment for not. I always surpassed mine but most of my colleagues didn't and nothing happened. So what's the point?
6. The culture is bad. Many employees have worked here over 15 years doing the exact same job and they still don't know how to do it properly. I figure it's because they aren't qualified to do anything else, which scares me because I've been here 10 months and have been trying to get out for 4 of those. This job doesn't prepare you for any next steps. My current manager worked here for 16 years before getting her promotion and she's awful at leading.
7. They promote people based on years they've been here, not talent or leadership capabilities. My current manager is a passive aggressive nightmare who picks and chooses who is held to company standards.
8. Many branches are just cliques and you will be the new person who isn't included. As a new employee, I was held to standards that the other employees weren't held to.
9. Regions is racist and doesn't care about black people from my experience (employees and customers). I worked in both a predominately white and black area and the differences were stark.
10. There's more but I'll end with the fact that I don't think Regions is cutting edge or keeping with the times in any way. I planned to bank there originally, but after working there, I would never bank at Regions. What's in it for me? I really can't understand why someone would bank at a place where putting 50k in a money market gets you 0.01% interest. I found an online bank where I get 0.8% interest in my savings and 2.8% if I sign up for direct deposit. Even the stock market on average grows about 6% a year. Working at Regions feels like a dead end and as a college graduate I'm really disappointed I ended up here. I'm capable of so much more and Regions doesn't care and won't ever cultivate that."

Working at Regions made me completely change my career path.  It deeply affected me.  Everyone there is miserable. The upper management are sleazy, lying, tyrants. Nothing you do there is ever good enough. Oh, you’re hitting 22k in points? That means nothing because your Guided Discoveries aren’t averaging enough per day so we’ll put you on a coaching plan and make EVERY interaction with a customer be subject to manager review.  You’re a licensed banker but having to work the teller line all day so your outbound calls aren’t averaging 25 a day? Reprimanded. Coaching plan. You’re a failure. By the way, completely broken calling system.  For my 2 years they just kept saying “yes we are aware there are issues”...you get the same exact leads everyday! (Also, in 2 years never heard if ANYONE getting a promotion...plenty of demotions though)
Yes, this place is toxic. Trust me, I’m not just some rogue disgruntled former employee. Everyone there shares this sentiment. Before leaving, I reported several major violations my regional manager had been committing. Nothing was done. This person repeatedly lied to me, then threatened me, transferred illegitimate points to “their hires”, and the final straw was they wanted to pull me out of the branch on a day we were short staffed to go make “monitored calls” to customers...despite the fact that 3 weeks into the quarter I already had 9k in points, not even counting a pending private wealth referral. Why? Because nothing is ever good enough, and all they care about is spreadsheet management and exerting control over you.
Working at Regions made me want to never work for any corporate job ever again."

I was in an assistant management role and I did everything in the branch with no recognition, while my manager went out to happy hour. The regional manager knows the managers are never in the branch and doesn’t do anything about it because she doesn’t work either. They district manager doesn’t know how to speak proper English.

915,,Small Bank That Thinks Its a Big Bank,2020-04-11,2.0,Financial Relationship Consultant,"Training was more on the job than sitting at a desk and doing web-based lessons or unnecessary class work for weeks on end.

Work bank hours.

Company allows time to get adjusted to the metrics before being held to performance numbers.","Management at branch, district, and regional levels are out of touch with needs of clients and constantly overemphasized individual and branch metrics that anyone who has worked for the larger more national footprint banks would realize quickly are irrelevant.

Compensation for what is technically a sales position, is not only incredibly mediocre for a mid-level personal banker role, but company manipulates numbers to increase odds of you either losing a percentage of bonus comp. or losing it completely.  If you're looking to make actual banking sales compensation, this isn't the place for you.

Management pushes 'proprietary' applications for use during your daily activities, such as ""Guided Discovery"" which is just a questionnaire youd get opening an acct online by yourself and Refer a Friend program, which is a mess and hardly ever sees the clients actually get compensated as promised cause the requirements don't get disclosed to the clients or are too hard to satisfy for the clients to qualify anyway. Meanwhile, the banker doesn't get compensated on achieving the prescribed goals set by management for discussing each of the above with the client, as it isnt an official part of the bank's compensation plan. 

Very difficult for any mobility within the company. Management is almost never interested in seeing you advance, because it takes time away from you meeting their own sales goals. Meanwhile, entry & mid-level management positions like Team Leads and Branch Managers are hired off the street constantly, often times without prior knowledge that a position opened up and with the hired parties having less or sometimes even no banking experience."
916,,Excellent Company to work for,2020-04-11,5.0,Branch Manager,Regions is one of very few company's that lives by its core values. They have a genuine care for their employees and customers.,"occasional focus on seemingly pointless items to help fix a certain ""report""  then a bunch of micro management around it when it comes out.

917,,Great Culture! Cares about Employees,2020-04-06,5.0,Data Analyst,"All the my coworkers are great and I am really happy to work here. They have work hangouts often and have a great benefit package. 5% match and automatic 2% of salary every year. Standard 15 days paid time off, 12 days sick time, and bank holidays like president's day/ Columbus day.",Regions is trying to play catch up when it comes to technology and innovation. They also have an outdated fee and branch model like most traditional banks. The biggest risk to them is Fintech.
918,,DO NOT WORK HERE,2020-03-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,NONE. I CAN NOT STRESS IT MORE,"Managers pick favorites, goals are steep, expected to solicit sales calls and rated off how many people you talk with."

1. Good morale
2. Open door policy
3. Opportunities are endless","Not a lot of cons from me. I would say though, cold calling regions customers to offer them products and/or services is a fast way of loosing customer."
920,,More bad than good,2020-03-23,1.0,Financial Relationship Specialist,Pay is well above minimum wage,"Bonus system is ridiculous, branch managers get their bonuses based off of branch performance even if they push everything off onto others and force customers to wait 30 minutes for someone else to take them. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic regions “offered” time off if you weren’t comfortable coming in. Only catch was they said you could take unpaid time off if you didn’t want to come in, then they changed it to allowing you to use your sick time (even though you aren’t sick) or vacation time (even though you obviously aren’t on vacation) and did not offer any paid time off to supplement families who have to have a paycheck. 

Management does not care or listen to anyone. You cannot get ahold of anyone in upper management above your current station. They offer for you to rate your manager and give feedback on them but, while I believe it says your anonymous you are not really because there are only 8-11 people you work with and people will say if they said the bad thing about their managing style or not."

You spend your whole day solving problems that could be solved in 5 minutes if anyone had any clue on what they were doing. Back office consists of individuals who don't know anything nor care about the client. Their processes leave you scratching your head until your hand gets tired. Middle-Upper management consist of individuals who shouldn't be allowed to manage a fast-food restaurant. The only thing they care about is themselves, least of all clients. Please tell workers, who make 15 an hour, about your 1million dollar house for the 100th time or maybe about your next destination trip. Compile that with the fact that they all work (if you can call it that) less than 30 hours a week.  Somehow they are still allowed to make key (horrible) decisions that make your job  & this company even worse."

You have to meet a certain quota of conversations per week. Reaching those goals are a little out there. The main way you will reach your goals is by making phone calls.

Schedule did not vary at all which is nice, and great finance is taught here.",From the third quarter I knew I was lied to about our bonuses. If you take this job do not expect bonuses. Their incentive program is a complete scam. In all of the Indianapolis branched fewer than 5 employees on average qualify for a bonus and even when you are granted a bonus it is not even enough to cover your gas to work. Their life insurance commission is also a scam. I was told that if I sold insurance here I would get paid a cash commission. The only thing I received was a 3$ bump on one paycheck.  Even with Higher performing bankers raises were few and far between with a lot of stringing along. A lot of the employees here are currently looking for other work.

They never have enough people in back office and employees will wait 45 min on hold for a department they must speak to- then corporate took away the ability's to contact anyone in back office by phone so you are literally sending requests to a black hole waiting for responses when you have a desperate client staring at you demanding answers now.

990,,Leave the politics with politicians!,2019-10-12,2.0,Contact Center Banking Professional,"The nature of the work is service-oriented.

Small payouts for high performers","Upward mobility is based on favoritism, which allows those who are not qualified for roles are given roles over those who are high performers who deserve the promotional roles.

Stated as a non-sales position which is a fib.   Very high expectations with a challenging and discouraging incentive plan.   Many employees have voiced their concerns and struggles, but are overlooked due to the high goals that are planned to be met.    

There are employees especially in senior management that will sabotage former employees' employment records to prevent the employee from being rehired.  

Lack of growth and development opportunities.

The culture is damaging and biased.

Office politics is detrimental to employees' performance and morale.

Managers are unreasonable when it comes to pushing employees to meet goals that are unrealistically challenging in nature.   

The turnover rate for the contact center is EXTREMELY high! This should raise red flags to corporate for an investigation and requires an HR plan (retention is a huge area in need of improvement) to reduce the turnover rate.   

Pay is NOT Competitive

Little to no flexibility in working hours.

A high school-like environment where popularity rules over efficiency & effective performance.    If you are not liked by the ""Clique"" for any reason, they will prevent you from moving up even if you are the best fit for the role.  

A lot of great performers have left for competitors due to destructive and limited culture."

• relationships with customers
• opportunity to advance and advance quickly","The biggest con is that, like so many other banks, Regions is beginning to rely more and more on technology to help their customers but it's at the expense of customer service. That bothers me given that I'm a customer service oriented person. 

The staffing model is a HUGE issue. Optimal staffing for my branch would be 7 employees. We, currently, have six. If we have to send someone out to another branch; if someone is on vacation; if someone is out sick, they'll let us run with 4 people. 

On slow days (T,W,Th), only two people will be behind the cash line - one covering lobby, the other covering drive thru. If Regions had their way, we'd only have one person back there covering both sides. It has been stated to us time and time again that the philosophy is this - with the advent of online banking, mobile banking, and the DepositSmart ATMs, Regions has given customers plenty of ways to do banking that don't involve coming to a branch. If they have to wait in a long line in the lobby or the drive thru, that's their own fault for choosing to come to the bank. Seriously. That's the philosophy.

Additionally, they change the incentive pay out hurdles every quarter. This last quarter, they changed them halfway through the quarter because they'd already blown their payout budget for the year. When employees said ""forget the incentive pay and give us raises,"" we were told that, without an incentive, we'd have no reason to hit our goals."

Vacation time
Employee accounts","About a year and a half ago I'd have had no complaints. But looking at the difference between then and now, it's quite sad how much of a gradual reduction in quality the position has experienced. They are trying to push so many countless initiatives, that it gets confusing just keeping track. The most egregious of these is the one job family. I was a teller at a previous bank, and it was not for me. Easy work, entry level, but not for me. Within the last year and a half, our tellers have ALL been raised to $15/hr just to equalize everything. The problem is, they did not give blanket raises to the people who were just ever so slightly above that mark. So you'll have it where a teller is making $15 an hour, while a banker (which is 95% a sales job) is making only a couple dollars more an hour. That is not balanced for merit, considering ""incentives"" for Regions are 1. Very small quarterly payouts 2. Based on a goal, but not a % of what you sell unless it's an annuity product, just added through the quarter and converted into Profit Equivalent (PE) 3. Also affected by the ENTIRE branches customer service score. Not your own. Yes, other people getting bad customer service reviews can lower your already small sales bonus that happens four times a year total. 

That's not even the kicker. The ""one job family"" is FORCING the bankers to take time out of their days to go run teller transactions, do change orders and miss opportunities for a new customer coming in, sometimes for an entire day. So the already difficult to meet goals are now impeded by the requirement of going up to teller row and being a teller, even though they hired you as a banker (Financial Relationship Consultant). If you are offered this position, think long and hard. Just know that coming in, you will make maybe $3/hr more than the tellers who are doing entry level work, but you will also be taken away from your desk and forced to also be a teller."

Their main goal is for you to sell as much as possible.  We had a micromanaging, pushy, manager with unrealistic expectations.  We also weren't afforded the same benefits as corporate employees.  For example, when a snowstorm came through Birmingham, an email went out stating that all of the corporate employees would be going home due to the threat of inclement weather.  However, branch associates were required to stay.  By the time we were released to go home, the roads had iced over and we were trapped.  I know many of the corporate employees ended up stuck, too, but we were released more than an hour after they were.  Basically, if you want the great work/life balance, employee appreciation, and less stress, go to the corporate side and not the branch!

So while you might grind you’ll never get noticed unless you’re in an affluent area where big chunks of goal walks through the door daily. You’ll be micro managed to death unless you get a veteran manager who never has been, In a little over two years we had three big company changes as far as presentation to customers, directives and top down.

1163,,Financial Relationship Consultant,2018-12-20,1.0,Financial Relationship Consultant,Work hours are daytime.,"Recruiters sell you on company culture being a great place to work and Regions being a progressive company with great advancement opportunities. They also sell the low salary on the ease of getting bonuses, which is far from true. Bank walk-in business is declining rapidly and they want you to be a inbound sales person constantly calling customers. They also want you to be tellers in addition to being bankers. So essentially be prepared to do every job in the building. 

Managers are giving the freedom to operate their branch any way they see fit so branch culture is nothing like the corporate image presented about the company. Employees lie on the Best Places to Work surveys because it is so easy for the manager to figure out the ""anonymous"" responses. They will single people out and attack until you quit or get fired. So if you aren't like well enough by your manager or the district manager you can forget advancement even if you are qualified. They would rather promote a less qualified individual that they like or are related to than you. The underlying  culture is very antiquated based on old school methodologies. If you are smart, energetic, love challenges and embrace change find another company that embraces these qualities. This job will dull your skills."

My manager that I worked for embodies the qualities of Jim Crow’s past and present.  He constantly showed that there were different rules for white people.  He constantly made up reasons based upon metrics that he just pulled out of the air to justify his disparate treatment.  His manager allowed such treatment such as when he called me stupid in a meeting.  He even saw me walking down the hall and said you know it is not over.  I even went over his manager's head and said that there is something wrong with the way my manager was treating me.  Nothing happened.

Little did I know the company was switching to the Universal Banker model 5 months later. This consists of being both a teller and a banker. If I knew I was going to get scammed into this, I would have left the interview right then. When we switched to the new model, NOBODY got a raise and responsibility kept piling on. They expect you to be able to be a teller while also hitting branch goals which were insanely high. Customers were taking their accounts the other banks because of this new model, it is not working. I was given a promotion then it fell through the cracks because the branch was too new and they wanted to keep me there. I had a start date and had cleaned out my desk when I was told sorry, there's too many ""moving parts"". You get written up for the stupidest stuff and it is impossible to advance in the company. If you are a single young person with no kids and no life, this is the job for you. They don't pay employees what they deserve and the micro-managing is overwhelming. We found that there were small microphones at our desk to make sure we were having the full financial conversation with customers.  I have had homeless customers use the bathroom and get sick/spit on my desk. You are forced to sell products to customers that they don't even need or that would even worsen their financial situation, just to keep your job. For what I dealt with I feel like I wasn't even half compensated for. Their goal is to have one person do everything to consolidate job roles and cut costs. I have never felt so taken advantage of in my entire life, it's crazy how refreshing it is now to work at a bank that appreciates me and treats me how I deserve. I know employees that have been there for 30+ years and have gotten laid off for no reason at all but to save the company money. If you want to work for a company that micromanages, has insane expectations, want to be stuck in the same role for 20 years, or just doesn't have any interest in helping you advance your career, this is the place to be.

It's A write up! regions has zero consideration and empathy for their employees,  they don't care about the employees that make them look good and go above and beyond to make score card and a good GALLUP score.  They need to really think about the way the employees are being treated,  I've had great managers at regions and they leave, bc of awful and unthinkable goals and I hope mr.hall or someone from his office is reading this and I would love to have a chat,  one on one,  been with regions/union planters 20years and I smh at u and hr,  hr is not a employees advocate,  we have no-one to legitimately talk to in confidence.

Pays the bills. Goals are easily obtainable if you work at a branch with lots of wealth and home ownership in the area.","If you come from any of the big 4 banks, Regions is tragically behind in everything, only small time bankers or first timers into retail banking will be happy.

Archaic technology (for workers and customers) that slows everything down and frustrates customers, and backwards policies that are downright puzzling.

Fees are the lifeblood of the company and ROMs do everything in their power to not refund them. As an FSS or even managers you have no ability to manage your own clients and resolve basic fee situations. 

Too much time spent on useless things like audits and becoming glorified hybrid tellers with new changes that are rolling out. As a “banker” your job is to intercept clients and while doing their transaction try to convert the conversation. This is literally what you pay tellers for and have referral goals...

Funding for accounts is bogus and is setup so that they need to keep over a certain amount to keep credit for an account. HELOANs are also the biggest push for the company, they know they don’t have the customer base for their targets so they expect you to network heavily to get the business and get COIs. If you aren’t in a wealthy area don’t expect to do spectacularly credit wise and be prepared to lose lots of accounts you open.

Phone calls at Regions are 100% pure telemarketing to open products over the phone. As foot traffic slows (it’s happening at every bank in the US) you’re expected to make over 30+ contacts AND have opened products or taken loan applications.

Branch Managers are nothing more than glorified bankers, they spend upwards on average of 80% of their time out of office to get business or attend meetings. The impact is for employees you get virtually little to no coaching. In a sales environment and retail banking, coaching is key for success and BTLs and BSLs simply don’t cut the mustard when it comes to that.

Virtually no movement upwards as many people simply don’t get promoted that often, and branches are closing down left and right. If you literally just want a paycheck and do the bare minimum or just getting started, Regions is the place for you. Veterans look elsewhere unless you use it as a stepping stone."

I looked at the job requirements for a teller and I couldn’t find anywhere where it said a teller would be standing all day long on concrete carpeted floors.  Maybe upper management should try standing all day.  There just seems to be zero compassion or empathy for employees.

Not sure what else I can say to make up the total words needed!,"Corporate & upper management set unrealistic goals. They want you to be ""relationship people"", but building relationships is not really what they want. They want you to sell the customer everything under the sun. And if you don't ""profile"" every customer extensively, they're asking why. They also want you to give a sales pitch with every customer, that includes, ""Here at Regions we provide, advice, guidance and education"". Which sounds like we're really trying to help, but you feel like a robot and telemarketer. And they expect you to do your everyday in office sales, but then you're so expected to make 30+ calls weekly, while also, running teller transactions at your desk & if goals are not being met you may be asked to stay for call nights. God help you if you know how to actually run a teller drawer, because some of my coworkers were expected to do that too, due to always being understaffed. Also, regardless of where your branch is located, every branch employee has the same goals, so if you're in a slow or rural office you have the same goals as someone in a busy, city location. And they just expect you to make more calls to get your sells; I'd say, I left more messages for people than I ever got to talk to someone, much less sell them something. 

Turnover was crazy while I was there. I'd been in banking for many years and had worked for a couple larger banks, and had never witnessed that much turnover. And it was awful because upper management talked about employees they didn't like and especially after they left. Wish I knew what was said about me. Ha. My point is upper management was very unprofessional!

There is a lot of pressure coming from higher ups and it's very sales oriented. Sales are pushed every day, and if you don't meet daily goals you are punished, but meeting your sales goal gives an extremely low payout.

The benefits are good as well as the retail sales culture.  Communication among various management levels is fairly open.,"Upper level management, similar to any other major bank, does not want to take the time to understand each branch's unique demographic/client base.  When goal increases occur quarterly, an even distribution is not the reality.  Stretch goals become dreams, and should you find yourself at an historically low production branch, you will be constantly chastised for not reaching the ""goals.""  

In addition, great associates positioned in difficult branches will not have the same opportunity for advancement as associates positioned in branches with solid organic traffic.  To promote someone based on merely looking at a scorecard instead of viewing the candidate on a holistic level is, to me, not good practice.

As with any bank, there is high retail staff turnover; however, when an associate clearly exhibits problems on a performance and/or operational level, it is nearly impossible to correctly discipline that associate.  HR is more afraid of the potential litigious nature of an under-performer deserved of termination rather than the good of the entire branch."

I'm sorry if I did well don't tell me how to do my job. Customer upset b/c you call them every month about selling a product they don't need.

Traffic is down 40% in all of the branches since 2008 so because of that, they are making their platform bankers perform cold calls to all existing customers to try and convince them to come in for a loan. Not only do you have to call these people and beg them to come in, you have to go over a financial map with them over the phone. (You HAVE to do it the ""Regions way"") or you will be coached and eventually written up. They also set unrealistic sales goals . These goals go up every year while they make the products worth less each year. This means you will work twice as hard to obtain any type of commission (which is also a joke). Lastly, Most of your training is web based ,after that you pretty much sink or swim. So you are never properly trained to do what they want you to do. I will be quitting very soon. I also heard they are laying off 260 employees to save money."

You do get some vacation and you can use it.  If you work hard and do your job you probably won't get fired.,"Regions has a management culture that tends to make a big deal out of small things while letting large problems slide.  Where most companies are more interested in profit and loss reports, management at Regions focuses on playing games and giving employee surveys on whether your best friend works at Regions or not (yes, we are actually questioned about this every year).  You will sometimes get a sheet of paper telling you that you did a great job but you rarely get monetary compensation for it.  Management tends to promote people for superficial reasons, not for clear business reasons.  We have lost so many intelligent, talented employees over the years while promoting people that have very little job experience much less banking experience.  Rather than selling products based on needs, customers are often pressured into opening accounts using fear tactics or just generally confusing the customer into it.  Constant turnover is big problem.  There really is no such thing as a senior contact center employee; and that's why no one, including management, has been there long enough to give the customers sound banking advice."

We are expected to push and shove ANY referral opportunity, use phone tag lines, as well as a formal placemat sale usage all while attempting to provide amazing customer service. Depending on your branch location and season you may be able to reach your goal, but I feel that I am constantly nagged and berated to reach the goal no matter the cost. Also once you reach your goal you are paid an petty bonus, which you are also taxed for. Our Customer Service Survey (KDS) has a very unfair scale, where you are expected to receive a 5 rating out of a scale of 1-5 (1 being the worst and 5 being exemplary) else it is considered a 1. We gather once in the morning to discus our sales goals and commitments as well as once in the afternoon, these meeting cause so much anxiety for the tellers because you are expected to repeat your tag lines, confirm your daily commitments and listen as your manager nags on about goals. Regions is VERY sales driven to say the least and if you can tolerate this constant pressure as well as make your sale, then and only then will you be able to develop within this company."

1961,,Best Company I Have Ever Worked For,2015-10-20,4.0,Bank Teller,"Having been working at Regions for over a year, I can honestly say that this is the happiest I have ever been n my work life. Regions places a great emphasis on balancing work and personal life, and they walk the walk, not just talk the talk. Even part time employees get 2 weeks paid vacation every year, 5 paid sick days, and 9 paid Federal holidays off. They also prefer to promote from within, and are very encouraging to employees to try and work their way up in the company.","The only cons to working at Regions are

- the pressure to get referrals (on the teller side) and sales (on the Financial Specialist side)
- the fact that all employees have to stay in one position for a full year before they are allowed to apply for another position"
1962,,Awesome,2015-10-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, management involved in your success, potential for growth, great vacation pacakage,",If you don't work a regular shift your options for overtime are limited. A lot pressure put on accomplishing sales goals
1963,,Overall a good company,2015-10-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Direct management is excellent- Regions has many good people working there.,Upper management is totally oblivious to what is actually going on in the company.  Business Banking is falling apart and the company's reputation is declining in the business community at an alarming rate.  The drain of talent is an organizational risk that will soon be made apparent.  There are far too many layers of management.  The organization is too political.  The technology is DOS 1980's technology that will apparently never be upgraded.
1964,,Branch Team Leader,2015-10-16,4.0,Branch Team Leader,Great company that has been doing the right things to stay relevant in an ever changing banking environment. Great emphasis on training and getting sales techniques down. Management is generally exceptional with only a few bad apples.  They do like to promote from within if you have the right management in place.  Some areas are different in that aspect though.,Not as great of an opportunity for bonus' as they advertise.  Anytime something is working good to increase bonus' they will change it up the next quarter to either make it harder or lessen the amount of the bonus.  It always seems like they want less people to hit bonus instead of more.
1965,,Great company with the great values,2015-10-16,5.0,Branch Sales Manager,"At Regions you have the opportunity to better your career and advance if you put in the effort. The company is focusing on building the best bankers in the industry with superior training/mentoring programs. Grayson Hall the companies CEO has done a great job simplifying the focus of the company so the lower level employees understand our current mission creating unity among the entire company. The company cares about its employees and understands the importance of employee satisfaction and its correlation with increasing a stronger bank. A strong incentive program rewards those who see the value of making our customers lives better through the many services we have to offer.  Combine this with a good salary,401k, health insurance, vacation, and sick time makes Regions a GREAT PLACE TO WORK!",Recognition and incentive is given for reaching Quarterly sales goals and not for increasing total branch revenue and other metrics.  Managers lack control in making credit decisions.
1966,,Regions,2015-10-16,3.0,Branch Service Leader,"Meet great people, great for networking, ok incentive program, etc.","Branches aren't on one accord, too many gray areas, some managers don't care about an employee's progression, etc."
1967,,"Pretty good company, OK experience. Would have rather been at a local community bank.",2015-10-15,3.0,Financial Services Specialist,"Regions is a good company if you want to work for a chain bank that has a lot if branches and great move up (or move around) potential. I would rate it top amongst chain banks with starting salaries, great people, and honestly you do have some if you and your branch are like a family and I was lucky to mine was On desk side, management is usually very flexible if you have an emergency or anything comes up and you have to leave early, which is a true blessing because not everyone has that with their employer. The work life balance isn't that bad at all, M-F 8-5 and about one Saturday a month 9-1 isn't to bad. Customer wise you will meet some nice people that you really do get the chance to help, and although I do not work there anymore I am still friends friends with my old co workers to this day. And last but not least, if you decide you like banking and want to stick with it, you will meet so many new connections with people that work at Regions and people that work at other financial institutions. I noticed at Regions that many higher up people came from other banks or financial institutions, which says that most people who do well in the industry if they are not promoted by their company then there is another financial institution out there that will scoop them up based on their numbers and experience. So long story short any experience in this industry is good experience.","Well the hardest part of the job for me to cope with was the cold calling mainly because I was not made aware of it during the interview. If you work at a slow walk in traffic branch then you will spend 80% of your day calling random customers who are ""pre selected"" for loans, credit cards, HELOCS, and you will have to convince them that they need the loan or cc. Regions refers to this as a ""needs based conversation"" which is bank lingo for sell them on a product we offer so the bank can make money off interest, which is how banks make money. I only stayed at Regions for a short period of time not because of bad relationship with fellow employees but I just did not like the industry from a chain bank standpoint. There is so much stress that comes from the FSS job outside of actual sales that it really made. By that I mean that I always had this feeling of either being fired or sued because in the industry you have access to EXTREMELY personal information and if you even stand up to get a tissue and leave a piece of paper on your desk then someone is chewing you out. Lastly, the customers, one main reason that you have to get on the phone to get loans is because people really just don't walk into banks to apply for loans anymore. Correction people who have good credit and can get approved do not walk in. The one I heard from a superior that I tell anyone who wants to work in the industry is this, Only two types of people walk into banks looking for a loan rate shoppers and psychopaths and that could not be more true. Most of your customer walk in traffic are people complaining about overdrafts because they don't know how to manage their own money. Most walk in traffic is people with ridiculously stupid request that don't understand that it is a bank and not Walmart and their are somethings we just cannot do. All in all I thought I was going to be a banker but in reality I was a salesman with a suit/tie and desk."

You are expected to sell something to every customer every time even if you have already talked to that customer 5 times before.

Goals are always changing and they are completely unattainable. Even if you didn't reach your goal the previous quarter, they will make the new goal even higher and then write you up if you don't achieve it.  The only way to succeed is to lie and mislead customers. 

 
Management is a joke. They definitely pick and choose their favorites. If you kiss enough tail to be a favorite, the rules do not apply to you and you can get away with murder. If you're not a favorite?  Good luck. Do you need to move because you're spouse's job relocated her? Oh let's go ahead and write you up so we can block that transfer because we are already having enough trouble finding new people to hire. 

They tell you that you work bankers hours. They don't tell you about the weekly 6:00 call night and the mandatory no excuses taken monthly 7:00 call night. It doesn't matter if your children have parent teacher conference night at school or anything else. Sorry, you are going to have to miss that newborn care class you needed to go to. We have call night. In addition, there are daily call blocks where you are expected and required to be a telemarketer and harass your customers to sell them products. As much as they preach to customers to not give information over the phone, they expect you to ask about all bank accounts, mortgage, credit cards, loans, and investments. If the customer does not want to give that information, management does not understand why. 

The vacation policy is a joke. In December, you are expected to plan out and schedule exactly how you are are going to use your 10 vacation days over the next year.  You can't have more than 2 three day weekends (unless you are a favorite, or a manager). You are also required to use half of your vacation time before the end of June. Also, you are required to take at least 5 consecutive days off at one time. Thanks for letting me use MY vacation days the way I need them."

They spend the money to train you to get you licensed.,"Don't bother! They are prejudice especially against African Americans and people with dreads and disabilities! Come on, it's 2015.  Explains why jobs (especially teller positions) are always available. I suppose this is job security for HR. This is true of employees in Arkansas, so I don't want to taint the entire company, just this market.

Pay is low for current staff and outsiders make more than those already employed. Come in for the experience, move up, get the title and get out. They don't work to keep what they invest in. 

They add more and more duties and give less and less in pay and bonuses.  The bonus structure continues to change so that you get less and are barely rewarded for what you do.  What's the point of promoting the bonuses during the hiring process but you have to risk life and limb just to get $1500/qtr for managers and less for other positions."

I get that coaching is a great thing but it became a little constant and overwhelming. They also HEAVILY pushed referrals on you.

Days went by where I was on auto pilot and not ""enjoying life"" (another core value) because I'm assisting the woman with 5 kids who wants her overdraft fees refunded while others are on the phone making calls to priority customers and booking loans.

There weren't very many advancement opportunities unless you're willing to relocate to Nashville, TN or Birmingham, AL. Each Area differs from others. Unfortunately, my area seemed very political. I applied for Assistant Branch Manager six times and finally decided to leave the company right before receiving an offer the last time. They say they want you to be well-rounded. Really, they just want you to have high investment sales. It doesn't matter how genuine you are with customers....that will not get you promoted. They state they don't want you to product push but that's exactly what they'd like you to do. This leads me to believe that all they care about is numbers and what you can get out of the customer instead of actually helping the customer with what they need."

Upper management only promotes people who are there friends

You will rarely get a descent raise 

You will constantly be short staffed and will NEVER get a lunch break, plus you'll have to work every single weekend while your manager doesn't work any.

You will constantly get all these things added to your work load and no pay increase.

It's very sales pushed so if your more about doing what's right for the customer don't work here.

If you report anything to HR it won't be confidential and whoever you reported especially if it's management you will be given a very hard time and your days are numbered."

Branch Managers have been there for years and are just sitting around not progressing. No advancement in the company because branch managers are comfortable in their positions for 15+ years. When a rare advancement opportunity does arise, they play games with you. They only advance people who been with the company for years because it's only fair. You will be told you have to do you time. Vacation policy is the worst. You only get two weeks. You also get sick time but it's use or lose. Incentive plan is a joke.

They claim to have a good work/ life balance but this really depends on your branch manager. Customers have a tendency to not fully understand their account's fee schedules and this leads to unhappy customers."

They are very good at keeping up with your training and focusing in how it can help you do your job.,The management didn't take control of situations letting them just get worse. Some people are overworked while others just get to cruse through without much thought to others.
2159,,Great place to work,2015-02-10,4.0,Bank Teller,"Regions is a great place to work. I was very well trained as a teller. Their training was very thorough and hands on and I was very confident when I began ""manning"" my own teller window.

2162,,"Job was terrible, frustrating and insulting.",2015-02-02,1.0,IT Helpdesk Support (Level I),It's a big company so Regions isn't going anywhere. The cafeteria in the ROC facility is decent. Office is clean.,"I worked here for four months and I left with no notice after I dealt with one-too-many entitled executives. You see, the Level 1 Helpdesk is the bottom of the barrel at Regions, and no one ever lets you forget that. You'll get everyone from lowly tellers to Senior VPs talking down to you, making you feel like a jerk for having them wait on the phone for 5 minutes and not eliminating all future technical issues. You'll never feel happy about working in this role.

The monitored/recorded and nonstop calls will drive you mad. There's no incentive to get through calls fast, because you are only allowed something like 2 minutes between calls for a break. Long-time workers know exactly how to ""pass the buck"" regarding harder-to-resolve issues and purposely deflect lengthy tickets in an effort to keep their call/resolution times down. It's all a game, and unless you are just as shady, your performance will always look inferior, even if you ACTUALLY resolve users' issues.

Oh, and the management are super anal about being on time. One time, due to traffic, I was literally 2 minutes late. As I walked to my half-cubicle at 8:02am, my boss was waiting there for me, arms folded, and scolded me for being late. Let's not forget that the ROC facility is located just off the worst expressway I have ever encountered – I-65 – and the two lane road that takes you from there to Regions is often congested like crazy at 8am and 5pm each day. Oh, and that it literally takes 5 minutes to walk from the parking lot to the farthest corner of the 2nd floor where the Level 1 Support area is. It was insane getting to/leaving work. The ROC is a terrible place to work for that reason alone.

In the end I got past my 3-month review with glowing reviews because I paid attention and could do the work well...but the non-stop barrage of unhappy/jerky people to support will drive most people mad."

I had worked for 2 different groups and was always given opportunity to try out various training programs. The training classes were either in another city, in the same city or you will do the training class from home.","Communication - Being a very large organization, getting the information to pass to various IT departments caused a lot of headaches between various IT groups.

It is the most stressful environment that I have ever worked.  Many of the supervisors are incompetent, but they are allowed to stay.  They are allowed to get rid of associates so that they have to take no personal blame.  And the sales system is horribly flawed. But they will still hold you accountable even though they can't always tell you why your sale didn't validate.  The supervisor you get will play a great role in your experience."

Working with her was the worst year and a half of my life. The bank was so much better to work for before the merger with Amsouth. We took on AmSouth's policies and procedures. I felt like their motto was, ""how many different ways can we say no""? It was easy to get promoted provided you did you job, however the promotional raise is only 2%. What kind of bs is that??
