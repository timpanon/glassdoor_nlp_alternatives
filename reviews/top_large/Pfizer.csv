536,Pfizer,Solid Employer with Career Development Potential,2021-10-13,4.0,Project Engineer,"Excellent opportunity to develop your career in the pharmaceutical industry. A lot of effort is going into improving the culture for the company as a whole and to improve current performance related to colleague engagement, compensation and recognition.",Objectives for the company as a whole are sometimes lost and not cascaded down to the site level which makes it difficult to understand the direction individual sites are heading towards. Culture needs a lot of improvement to improve pride in working for the company for the majority of colleagues.
537,Pfizer,Great place to work and grow!,2021-10-13,5.0,Vice President,Working at Pfizer has been tremendously rewarding. I have the opportunity to take on different roles every couple of years - so I am always growing and learning about new parts of the company.

543,Pfizer,Are you a new grad? Welcome to a NEW PFIZER EXPERIENCE!!,2021-10-11,5.0,Data Scientist,"Starting post pandemic, everyone will have the option of going into the office anywhere from 0-3 days...essentially making everyone remote. If your manger is okay with not coming in at all, then you're fully remote with the option of going into work at whatever Pfizer site is nearest you. Ever since our new CEO stepped into the role in 2019 we are in a whole new Pfizer. He is striving to build a distinct culture of growth mindset, learning, and inclusion. May not seem like a big deal but it is when your employer invests in ways to upskill yourself whether they apply to your role or not. You're also encouraged to learn about anything you want and ask for projects outside the boundaries of your team/group. Networking is super easy, never had anyone turn down an 'ask' to meet. People are generally very engaged. I'm in the first 3 years of my career at Pfizer (started here) and have found it very fluid to navigate. Oh and the work life balance is out of this world. If you're black or latino .. their affinity resource groups are extremely powerful and visibly supported by senior leadership and afford you a ton of visibility so definitely join them! Pro tip: make friends in HR!!!!","For the immense flexibility, great networking opportunities, work-life balance, benefits, vacation time, .... they will not compete with tech salaries ever. So if you're thinking about a tech salary here, look elsewhere. Pfizer makes up for it in other places, depends on what lifestyle you're hoping to have."

People here are very proud of the company which turns a blind eye on what‚Äôs happening in other ‚Äúnon-giant‚Äù  pharma companies"

820,Pfizer,Solid company with focus on values,2021-06-23,5.0,Senior Scientist,"I've never been more proud to work at a pharmaceutical company than being at Pfizer during the pandemic. Albert Bourla (CEO) truly seems to be focused on getting medicine to patients in need and ""moving at the speed of science"" rather than caving to outside pressures. The company supports a healthy work-life balance and provides good benefits and perks (monthly happy hours pre-pandemic, walking challenges to earn money off your health insurance premium, $500-1000 cash bonuses for going above and beyond your job).","It is a big company and there are a lot of middle managers who tend to focus on either their own egos or their limited perspective, rather than soliciting feedback from the people in the lab who actually do the work. There is a lot of internal politics, particularly in groups with people who have been with the company for a long time (i.e. lots of change-resistant people/managers). There are frequent reorgs/layoffs, so there's always an underlying fear that you or your group could be deemed unnecessary next. It can also be difficult to work across groups (often due to the politics), which can limit career and growth opportunities."

834,Pfizer,Boring,2021-06-19,2.0,Senior Director,"Resources galore if you want to do something. Budget cuts are really making things different but it's because the company was previously very flexible with their budgets and ""innovation"".","Ask yourself how many times a day you want to turn into a different person at work. It's virtue signaling 24/7 and talking ""strategy"". 

What strategy? This company will not fail. It's a behemoth. 

Develop more and more projects to ""innovate"". Seems as if my peers were more concerned about delivering for the sake of recognition than for the sake of building something if value. 

Middle Management is the wild west and leadership teams are baby sitters.

- Healthcare benefits are decent. Stock vesting schedule is very long. 
- Job is great if you are a ""box -checker"", or on the marketing side of the house","- I've worked at a lot of large companies, but the culture within the technology group here is unlike anything I've ever seen. Toxic, treating employees like they're nothing...it's just awful. Leadership is tone deaf to the feedback and sentiment of the broader working population. More broadly speaking, Digital / tech are viewed as second class citizens within the broader company. People are outright rude and mean. 
- Employees are reluctant to share ideas because there is the constant stealing and rebranding of work. Motivation is of course low when employees see this - why work hard when you're going to receive 0 credit for the effort put forward?
- Not a single person within the org cares about career development. There is no career progression or pathway outlined whatsoever. Progress only happens when people change roles, with most of them looking to leave Digital.
- Technology is seen as a cost and a burden, rather than an innovation tool. 
- Leadership is super tactical and constantly managing to budgets and headcount. The constant reorgs result in a lot of lay offs and shuffling. 
- There's a huge disconnect between ELT messaging and the SVP/VP level management. Executive leadership touts change and flexibility, while SVPs/VPs are old-school and rigid in terms of their approach
- Innovation is tough of course because of the industry regulations. Legal and compliance are a part of the problem, but the org fails to look elsewhere at the outdated, antiquated, and time-consuming processes that have been put in place yrs ago and no one has thought to change."

The CEO and direct higher level leaders reporting to him are in alignment. Those below that level - not so much.,"Agility is being ‚Äúrolled out‚Äù by a huge vendor company who stood it up for them. The vendor is top notch, but the agile program is definitely ‚Äúvendorized‚Äù with a specific structure and layers of steps and PowerPoints . The Pfizer leaders taking over the agile program, not so awesome. 
They are open to future coaches changing the structured program accordingly so this is a huge plus. 

The Agile Leaderships‚Äô actions clearly demonstrate that some of them are ‚Äúgods‚Äù and people must adjust their behaviors to align to THEIR preferences. There is no level playing field for agility to grow, and no chance to form, norm, storm etc‚Ä¶. One mistake leads to high scrutiny. then two and 3 mistakes, and then you are placed on a termination plan 3-4 weeks after joining. Scary! 

Middle leadership also appears to be scared of their own talent they hire, and does not know what behaviors come into play with agile leaders or today‚Äôs ways of working. They are not willing to have meaningful conversations or allow for mistakes that help people to grow."

Opportunities for advancement and internal hiring is constant and available. Opportunities to grow are there IF you really shine and are excellent. You also need to be known, build a brand, and have a cereer mentor AND sponsor. Otherwise promotions are hard to come by. Yearly education benefits are available as well. Super incredible work life balance (not like banks or consultant companies) and Pfizer is very flexible. Get most of your work done at night? Then take the day to do other stuff. Meetings with China at midnight? Sleep in until whenever the next day. Pay is decent, not the bottom of the curve not not like banking/consultant level either and our engineers get paid similar to the likes of other tech companies. But it‚Äôs worth it for the benefits, the leadership, flexibility to have a whole life outside of work. Also crazy maternal and paternal leave (6-9months off with pay). It‚Äôs a company filled with lovely, committed, & intelligent colleagues who bring A LOT of value to Pfizer‚Äôs culture and shape the core essence of Pfizer‚Äôs new brand.","It‚Äôs not like other companies where there is a specific promotion timeline, to move up in pay grade levels you usually have to apply internally for another position at a higher grade level. Other option is promotion within your current role ... but even then it‚Äôs never certain and entirely depends on your performance (has to be above and beyond) as well as who ‚Äúhas your back‚Äù when it comes to discussing your compensation."

- Management: Despite the first year of 3 at this site being under strict and unpleasant management treating salaried exempt employees like hourly employees, the greater bulk of management truly cares about their direct reports and employee moral/Greivances.","My team is so small this review could used to take action against me but there are some serious cons

- Career Mobility: 90% of the time a professional job is posted, there is already an internal candidate the hiring manager knows they want. This makes moving across departments or into an area you don't interface with regularly extremely difficult.
- Work life balance: Team was treated as hourly employees in terms of being scheduled and working 6 people 24/7/365, and were classified as salaried under the guise of ""Career Mobility"" instead of the fact that it would cost them ~$30k a year to pay us the overtime as OTE employees

- Site Specific Issue: Pfizer Kalamazoo location formally Upjohn/Pharmacia employees that have stuck through the merger are mostly nearing retirement. A lack of a concise means of preparing replacements for this large departure of employees over the last several years resulted in a significantly longer lead time in getting these roles filled and up to speed. Not to dismiss the loss of first hand knowledge of critical infrastructure and equipment over time."

Manager is very political and will argue and point out why you are wrong about your opinions. Everything is an issue and if you say one wrong word she will accuse you of all sorts of hateful things (she called someone an emotional hijacker).  One sales rep was a perpetual bully and loved to police coworkers, at an off-site we had last year, she was bad mouthing my colleague to me and would make up blatant lies to make others look bad behind their backs. She was a constant nuisance, a tattle tale and a compulsive liar. The manager promoted her to a field sales role which I find disgusting as she is the cancer of the company. No one talks to her anymore about professional/personal things for very long. Manager is afraid to expose the bullys and is weak, she doesnt always know whats going on as she never sits with the team. Other people in the team have left with depression and anxiety because of our manager. she would take people into a meeting room (they wouldnt know what for), she would yell at them and put them down. The common bullying style she had was to become louder and more aggressive in a desperate attempt to bully the other person into submission. I avoided talking with other people for too long because bored employees rat on each other to managers; it does nothing but break trust and waste everyone's time. Our manager is more concerned with finding someone to blame rather than take any responsibility. Only unhappy and miserable employees rat on their colleagues. Its the quickest way to destroy morale.  I got ahead in this team by flying under the rader and not socialising as much with toxic coworkers and was offered a perm role in the team."

In addition, the addition of compensation time for constantly working overtime is thrown out by leadership, despite leadership themselves coming to work late and leaving earlier than everyone else.


The amount of backstabbing is beyond reproach. Leaders will go as far as to fabricate false , yet negative information to their colleagues, and this results in lower level colleagues doing the same via gossip, and going as far as to ""spying"" on each other for managers. It does not matter how well your work ethic is, or how well you get along with the overwhelming majority of the people. The smaller ""clique,"" along with the managers will find a way to bring you down and give you a miserable time if they felt you have wronged them in the slightest ways. Even if you challenge (courteously and politely, of course), on their ""science,"" or whatever science they claim.


Location is well...not good, and because of this, talented and bright individuals are a scarcity. Anyone who has those qualities has already left for other opportunities outside of the area.


During candidate interviews, managers will go as far as to claiming that very few people have left, despite extremely large troves leaving.


As a final note, sexual harassment is not uncommon there, and oftentimes goes unpunished for long periods of time. An individual was finally fired for constantly sexually harassing women across multiple groups, but  has been doing it for 20+ years before his termination. Everyone at the site who was aware of the individual was well  aware of his behavior."

Although the firm encourages through its policies a ""straight talk"" in the subordinate-line manager relationship without the fear of retaliation this does not happen!

1.

Very often the management is not liable for any decision they took and hold accountable their subordinates.
2. Most times, employees are ridiculed and mocked by their direct boss and have to bear repercussions such as: allocation of daily tasks exceeding  the 8 hours agreed in their labour contract, public humiliation, no annual salary indexation (altough the firm includes it in their budget and it is approved by senior management from NY headquarters) just because the boss doesn't want to grant it!"

Each person feels powerless to make real change given all the layers.  Work arrangements are too flexible and result in majority of business being conducted over WebEx, largely because of fractured nature of group spread between NJ, NY, and Tennessee.  People in NJ might have a boss in NY or TN, who then has a boss in NJ, etc.  I've never seen anything like it in my career.  This all leads to virtually no business relationships being built and diffuses accountability.  No camaraderie within department; morale is low depending on which office you are in.  People brought over in acquisitions seem to just be hanging on until retirement, unenthused about anything.  Processes are inefficient and highly rigid, leading to the strictest deadlines I've ever seen in my career (leading to work/life balance problems at times, as you will work Friday nights and weekends, when it doesn't have to be that way) and resulting in tasks being beneath what they should be for a given experience level.  Extremely uninspiring work.  Way too many layers of management and way too many meetings of various size circles that are completely unnecessary - there should be more small-team meetings with real purpose.  Training/guidance is almost nonexistent, as everyone seems too busy to meet their workload to guide the various new people that have been brought on board.  Some managers are completely unequipped to manage and are just someone you report to on paper.  Budgets are tight."

Overall the company really does believe and strive to be a ""good actor"" and improve lives and health.  The integrity of most top leaders is authentic and they are well intended.   Most employees also really care about who they serve - patients.","The discomfort with candor unwillingness to really honor ""straight talk"" gets in their way.  Most concerns remain below the unspoken for fear of loss of job or respect.    Many years of continuous cutbacks combined with the company being entirely driven by shareholder return and street analysis makes for a very uncertain / unstable environment.  As much as they want to treat people well and live their values - those always take a backseat to the $.    So, as a result, there is no benefit to speaking up,  ""truth to power"" etc.... especially to middle and upper middle level leaders.  Senior leaders are probably OK with candor but those below them are too concerned with their own security that they don't encourage the same candor.   Many cutbacks in staff but not work.

- very smart people, some of the best I've met in the industry; very committed to bringing cures to market
- a global footprint that helps you understand how one makes and sells medicines across the world (so some very strong global exposure)
- great benefits and recognition of the need for work-life balance, though work can be intense at times
- a learning environment that allows colleagues to grow themselves. It's not just a paycheck at the end of the day - growing skills and learning is what kept me happy
- commitment to compliance and ""doing right by the patient"" regardless of other drivers
- focus on diversity; the leadership team is diverse, the board is diverse, and every hiring decision is reviewed with a lens of inclusion and diversity. It's not just women and minorities, but hiring with a focus on getting different viewpoints and talents on the table
- New York City (though that's a con too - it's getting harder to commute in from the suburbs)! But the energy in the city is amazing, and I miss it.","- lots of reorganization; we restructured almost every year from the mid-2000s onwards. Sometimes it was needed but it was also disruptive at other times. Not sure there's a way to avoid it given Wall Street pressures
- large company politics, which one will see in any large pharma. By and large, it worked out ok for me, but it may not be a place for someone who cannot maneuver in such an environment

We are proud that whatever our role is at Pfizer, we all share the common purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that significantly improve their lives. Having access to groundbreaking science, cutting-edge technological resources, as well as working side-by-side with the industry‚Äôs leading professionals, allow our colleagues to achieve their most important professional and personal goals.

Pfizer‚Äôs commitment to global inclusiveness allows for a culturally rich working environment. Each distinctive background lends itself to a new idea, and no idea is too small or too big. We encourage communication and results-driven working styles and are able to offer our colleagues an adaptable environment where they can function at their highest level.

Recognizing the importance of cross-functional exposure, we provide our colleagues with the opportunity to participate in rotating assignments so they can become well-rounded, and gain exposure to the ‚Äúbench to bedside‚Äù process. This means marketing executives have the opportunity to work next to leading scientists and vice versa. We all have a something to learn and something to teach.

3184,Pfizer,Manager,2017-01-05,3.0,,"Good benefits package - healthcare, free admission to museums, gym in the building (membership fee required), legal services and discounts on mortgages, etc.",Management does not seem to care about its people and does not invest in training for new or poor performing managers.

3189,Pfizer,"World Class, but still Family Oriented",2016-12-29,4.0,Senior Scientist,"The Sanford, NC site has been a top producer for Wyeth/Pfizer. Executives seem to be taking notice and giving this manufacturing site new opportunities. This is leading to a positive attitude throughout campus after years of major cuts following the Pfizer acquisition. Opportunities for secondments and lateral moves to different departments are readily available. Work-life balance at this site is spectacular and management sticks to the family-first mantra. Benefits are great and the bonus structure is better than many in the industry.","Following the acquisition by Pfizer, the site has gone from being over-employed to being far too lean. A bitter taste and poor reputation due to years of employment reduction has tarnished the Pfizer name in the Raleigh-Durham area and made it extremely hard to compete with some of the top Pharma companies in the area. Coupled with a less than ideal location (40 miles southeast of Raleigh), high potential talent choose to work for other companies in the RTP area instead. This has resulted in a workforce that is much older and tends to be more local to the Sanford area. When jobs do become open, the pile of resumes are filled with less than ideal candidates where you must still choose the least-bad one to fill the position. Or if you do find a good fit, they too often decline the offer presented to them."

- Being employed at Pfizer is like playing musical chairs. Roles and job titles constantly shift. Departments are organized and reorganized non-stop, being laid-off or forced to re-interview for your own job is a constant fear.
- Matrix work environment (common to all Big Pharma these days) makes it difficult to hold people accountable for their work since most of the people you deal with are outside of your functional line.

The plant is expanding at a breakneck pace.,The plant is expanding at a breakneck pace. Make no mistake this is a manufacturing plant and you will be treated accordingly. The trainers on night shift aren't qualified to train anyone. They are to busy trying to make themselves look like heroes rather than show anyone what they really need to know. New hires will be expected to take tests on new SOP's with old tests or old SOP's with a new version of the test. Operators will be put in a noisy room with no hearing protection and a handheld radio that they will then have to use to talk to the people outside the controlled environment. All the while giving the supervisor an up to the minute play by play of everything that makes the old equipment stop running. Management only recently tried to implement a downtime tracking and inventory tracking system but don't know how to use either to drive down delays or order materials for the equipment. Everything is done by hand. There's little to no automation in the facility. 12.5 hour shifts coupled with meetings/training that run after or before the shift starts are common. The record keeping is sloppy and many of the forms haven't been updated to match the new product code format for materials being used.

People are leaving in droves to work for other companies that are offering 20 - 30% more in pay and Pfizer is offering no compensation adjustments to staunch the flow.  My department is very short staffed, overworked and burnt out.  When positions opened up, instead of promoting experienced people from the department into them, they hired people from outside instead.  Pfizer is against development from within.  Learning more about the minutiae of your job is considered development, rather than getting a promotion.  ""Up is not the only way (referring to development)"" is strong in the culture but is detrimental in my opinion.  Management has no clue or doesn't care, even after years of employees telling them that we are understaffed.  The company is paying for it in errors made, investigations, etc.  There's little flexibility in scheduling because we are ""the front line.""  Standard Work (efficiency program) has only made the work environment worse, with inexperienced people doing jobs infrequently across the department creating more errors and investigations.

Its first-class products and ground-breaking therapies set the tone in the pharmaceutical industry!  First in-class products tend to be the standard with Pfizer and they create markets and change the physician treatment paradigms by providing them with dialogue to better engage their patients.  Their disease-management programs and community outreach are second-to-none.  Pfizer's philanthropy is also tops in the industry!  They give more money to charities and donate more medicines to third-world countries than any other!  That is by far, one of their top corporate mantras!","The continual acquisition of companies over the last 15 years has watered down the core Pfizer culture.  The ""If we can't beat them, we'll buy them"" approach upsets the corporate culture each time there is an integration of upper-level, mid-management and field forces from other companies creates a mixed bag of parts.  It takes awhile to get a sense of normalcy, then as soon as things calm down, Pfizer acquires another company!  It can be quite disconcerting, but it is obviously necessary to keep the company profitable and the shareholders happy."

The official line of top management /HR is that each individual is completely responsible of his/her own development. That's true up to a point.

No work life balance, forced overtime during the weeks and almost every weekend.  (was told I would work Mon-Fri that didn't happen)  They try to run around the clock with very little resources so the resources they do have are very overworked and stressed to the max.  Then when you do get forced you usually end up sitting around waiting for all the managers from all different departments try to make a decision what to do next and not one of them wants to make a decision in fear of a higher boss not liking that decision made.  Always wait till the last second to announce overtime so you cant plan anything.  Only for sure way to get time off is to use a benefit.  
Very slow to provide resources as promised in the contract if they provide them at all.  If you don't park the way they want you to you'll get written up by one of their security super troopers.
Don't really get to use much maintenance skill here most of the real maintenance work is contracted out.  They will put you through school but you wont get to use anything you learn because Pfizer doesn't want the liability.  Don't think the place will make it another 5 years the way its being run."

There is good cross functional collaboration around projects.  The company is large and because of its size can leverage for access to a wide array of resources that may not be available at small companies.","Pfizer was once a great place to work, however, today in order to make Wall Street's number the company is too focused on short term gains that are gotten by cutting and squeezing efficiencies out of programs.  Five years ago there was quite a bit of ""fat"" that could be trimmed, however today the programs are so lean that they really do not even have the minimum amount of resources needed to be successful.  The cuts are beginning to run so deep that serious mistakes are being made that I am afraid may lead to safety issues.

In addition Pfizer is also having a cultural crisis.  They have implemented two policies called Own It and Straight Talk, which on their surface sound great.  However, in reality the corporate culture is still to do things as they have always been done.  The company is closed minded to innovative ways of doing things and many in management only want people who say yes to anything, not employees who are trying to make the best decisions for patients, the company and shareholders.  Unfortunately it is a ""what is in it for me only"" mentality.   I am less than bullish on the company prospects as the company continues to shrink and not invest in new assets."

Nepotism and upward management and politics drive poor decision-making. Too many people with shallow knowledge of project specifics involved in decision making. OWN-IT cultural initiative borders on Thought Police at times - lip-service in public, but I have never had a private conversation with any colleague who thought it was useful for every single colleague to spend a day away from work at a stage-managed OWN-IT day. Like all big companies, prioritization of portfolio is a preoccupation, fear of investing in the wrong thing and burdensome governance slow down the process, damaging competitive edge and requiring in-licensing to fuel portfolio, often not scrutinized thoroughly enough.

Their compensation philosophy is to bring people on below the mid-point in the salary grade, and pay no more than the mid-point.  They define the 50 percentile (compared to benchmarked companies) as competitive.  This seems fundamentally flawed as other companies are paying more for top talent in the same position (I have been a top performer every year I have worked there).

4037,Pfizer,30 years with Pfizer,2014-10-25,3.0,,"Pfizer is a Fortune 50 company and industry leader with global operations and the resources to train and equip their personnel to the highest standards. In 30 years with the company, I learned an enormous amount about healthcare, disease management, business management, leadership, advocacy, communication and so much more. Their compensation and opportunities for personal and professional development were outstanding. Even though I was 'downsized' after 30 years, I cannot harbor contempt for a company that taught me so much and enriched my life tremendously.","Despite the many Pros of a career with Pfizer, I can only rate the organization with 3 of 5 stars because during my later years, as the company expanded greatly and acquired numerous other companies, I was increasingly surrounded with colleagues who lacked the professional standards that Pfizer taught me in my early years. Leaders at the highest level of the corporation created an atmosphere of distrust and a sense that the company was 'circling the drain'. While patent expirations, pressures from managed care, negative public opinion of the industry and gaps in scientific discovery were putting substantial pressure on the company, fewer and fewer of the leaders seemed able to provide calm guidance and honest leadership but instead, seemed to panic."

Moral is very low, high stress and constant tension causing a lot of issues with bullying or lack of professionalism.  Draconian budget cuts leading the ""leaner"" workforce to crumple under combined work loads.  Constantly lacking the tools to do your job adds to the pressure.  Supervision responds to concerns by telling you your job could easily go to Mexico.  Pressure to cut corners compromise the overall product quality.  This feels like a company on the verge of catastrophe.   Most of the blue collar work force is made up of temporary workers with low pay and no benefits hanging on for years hopeing to be hired in.  Super high turn over rates mean constant training, total lack of experience, new workers training newer workers.   Management happy to reassure you that your totally replaceable.

In return, they all agreed to become administratively independent.  Unfortunately the execs still believe that the one and only team assistant is their personal assistant and require instant responses to their demands even though the one and only assistant is receiving similar demands from 20 other people.  They try to get their demands met instantly through chastisement and badgering, which is a sub-optimal management style.  If the one and only assistant pushes back, s/he is maligned.  

 Believing that the company can function properly without adequate administrative staff is misguided.  There are too many bad business practices to track here, so I won't get into the sadistic systems.  Suffice it to say that Pfizer has become the Walmart of the pharmaceutical industry.

The group I was in, played an extremely vital role in many projects, was constantly asked to go above and beyond job descriptions, and were always being told how vital we were to the success of our site. However, when it came to compensation, yearly reviews, and pay raises we were ALWAYS told that a 1-3 percent raise was standard across Pfizer and that it was out of our direct manager's hands.

If you are interested in pharma this is still a great (though not as great as it once was) company to work for.","The message for the past several years has been 'Do more with less.' This isn't necessarily always a bad thing, but sometimes can be. People are asked to do too much, the company is sitting on piles of money and not retaining people where they are sometimes necessary. Pharma is constantly going through LOE situations, it is insanely highly-regulated, and can be unstable.

Senior site management is open to suggestions and promotes education and innovation.","Flattening has reduced opportunity for advancement.  Reduction in force has reduced opportunity even for lateral movement.  If you're in work related to manufacturing, you're stuck where you are.  Layoffs have become a yearly occurrence.  Management is making stupid decisions.  Want a new laptop?  Tough luck this year, even if your equipment is slower than a snail.  Also, layoff all the people in manufacturing who know what they're doing.  When things fall into chaos, hire all new people who have no idea what they're doing who use up all the time of the few people left who do because they're busy training the new hires.  Then scratch your head and wonder why everything's going to hell.  Introduce all kinds of new systems for purchase requisitions, documents and other things then sit back and watch all the frustration when people try to learn several new things at once.
