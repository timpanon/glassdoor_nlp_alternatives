1,Procore Technologies,Amazing Company,2022-04-06,5.0,Sales Engineer,"Such a great company to work for. Amazing culture, great leadership.","None as of now, great company!"
2,Procore Technologies,It’s all smoke and mirrors,2022-04-06,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good work/life balance 
Unlimited PTO","This company is ripe with microaggressions and at times blatant racism. If you aren’t a white person, you will never get a promotion and if you happen to slip through the cracks, they will make you constantly prove yourself worthy of the job. 

The pay is abysmal. They change the compensation scheme every year, each time making it even more confusing. 

The “culture” is a facade. Procore is run by inexperienced leaders who are only there because of their longevity with the company. They have absolutely zero experience in running a company at the stage Procore is in and are running Procore to the ground. 

Values are weaponized regularly. If you disagree or express concerns about anything, you are deemed a troublemaker. As a result, decisions are made in an echo chamber. 

Their commitment to diversity is a joke."
3,Procore Technologies,Great place to work,2022-04-05,5.0,Product Designer,Some of the best people you'll work with,The campus is amazing but now everyone is remote which isn't nearly as fun.
4,Procore Technologies,Good Company,2022-04-05,4.0,Events Producer,Good Company where growth is possible,Always changing which leads your role to change
5,Procore Technologies,Upper Management misaligned with ground realities,2022-04-05,1.0,Senior Software Engineering Manager,Average benefits in the tech industry. Still good enough for someone starting their career.,"Upper Management has little to no clue, broken performance and comp process, Retention and Growth is least of the Management concern."
6,Procore Technologies,"Great place to work, awesome culture",2022-04-04,5.0,Senior Project Manager,"Great culture and continuing to get better, addressing diversity, inclusion, belonging and employee engagement initiatives. I really believe in the product vision, mission and values (openness, ownership and optimism).",Lots of changes happening due to recent IPO and needing more resources to scale up.
7,Procore Technologies,Great culture,2022-04-03,5.0,Product Consultant,Great culture and career opportunities,No cons as yet. Not there long enough
8,Procore Technologies,"Great culture, great clients",2022-04-02,4.0,Customer Support Representative,"Culture, clients, office events, room for advancement",Staffing shortages at this time make the workload a little heavy
9,Procore Technologies,"Great Leadership, Wonderful people",2022-04-01,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"There are so many great things to say about Procore. I had supportive leaders and direct managers who were open and transparent. My teammates were great to work with and there was no drama or unprofessionalism on the teams that I was on (at least from what I knew). Happy hours, get togethers and team activities were super fun when we had them pre-covid and virtual ones were nice too. I love that leadership supported remote work.","The only reason I left was because there was a lack of opportunities available in the areas that I was interested in. I spent more than 3 years showing interest in other roles, networking, taking on projects and even worked part-time on projects that I loved with leaders who supported me. Unfortunately, when it came time for me to apply to roles, I was either encouraged to not apply because I lacked the 5+ years of experience or I wasn't given a chance to interview at all. This was discouraging after I spent a great amount of time doing the the work that I apparently didn't have enough experience for. After a while these are the things that make you realize it's time to look elsewhere."
10,Procore Technologies,Customer Success,2022-03-28,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"Flexible/hybrid work model (office or home), great benefits, focus on culture and people is front and centre.","Still quite US centric with a lot of roles still based in US timezone/locations despite the move to remote-working post COVID, which can lead to slow turnaround times for relatively simple requests.
Some suprisingly outdated & manual processes for a SaaS company, resulting in a lot of admin in certain roles. Slow to recognise and make internal improvements on this."
11,Procore Technologies,Great Culture and Growth Opportunities,2022-03-27,5.0,Software Engineer,Great Culture and Growth Opportunities,"Things move slow, typical startup."
12,Procore Technologies,Great company,2022-03-24,5.0,Analyst,The best company I have worked for,Nothing to say here at all
13,Procore Technologies,Great Onboarding and Continuing Professional Development Opportunities,2022-03-24,5.0,Implementation Manager,Great Onboarding and Continuing Professional Development Opportunities,No cons identified so far
14,Procore Technologies,Great culture and work/life balance; low pay and unmotivating compensation structure,2022-03-24,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"In terms of leadership and culture, Customer Success is one of the best departments at Procore. Our managers truly care and demonstrate this by consistently advocating for CSMs. As a whole, Procore is a great company with awesome benefits and a supportive work environment that values work life balance and consistently innovates on ways to improve life for its employees.","I have been at this company a long time and there is a significant disconnect from the top down of executive leadership recognizing the value that the CS department brings to the org and compensating accordingly. The CSM role at Procore has become increasingly more sales-driven, rather than relationship-driven, which makes the role more challenging to maneuver and build trust with clients. In addition, the compensation does not match the evolving JD, and the recent ""releveling"" felt more like a PR stunt since it put the majority of CSMs on a track to make less OTE than ever before."
15,Procore Technologies,Great Company,2022-03-22,4.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),Great company culture and product,"Sales department got to be a bit big, making quota attainment tougher and ratcheting up pressure. Standard stuff in a growing company, though."
16,Procore Technologies,Great Culture Compared to Other SaaS Companies,2022-03-21,5.0,Senior Manager,"I love Procore. There is an incredibly strong culture here that advocates for winning together vs the common cutthroat competition you often see in high-growth tech companies. There is not a single person I work with day-to-day that I do not respect nor is there anyone who I’d actively work to avoid. Middle management here isn’t so far removed from the work that they don’t actually know how the sausage is made and more often than not have the capability to make it themselves - which you don’t often see in similar companies. 

Beyond the culture, Procore has a really strong market opportunity and has been doing a solid job capitalizing on it.",The executive leadership can sometimes appear unfocused and/or is surprisingly in the weeds on projects that would be too small in another environment.
17,Procore Technologies,Great Culture,2022-03-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some of the most focused and compassionate people. Driven toward goals, caring about career progression and fun.",Need more diversity in leadership.
18,Procore Technologies,Great Culture - Poor Pay,2022-03-14,4.0,Majors Account Executive,"Great company culture, great product, great people",Procore is not nearly competitive compared to peers in relation to compensation. Salespeople grind at Procore and make 60% of what they should.
19,Procore Technologies,SDR,2022-03-14,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),- If you want to be an AE this path leads straight to it,"- Leadership in this department is very political
- if you do not want to be an AE it is very had to get the leadership assistance to move"
20,Procore Technologies,Great company with room to improve,2022-03-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great perks, smart employees and senior leadership give updates frequently so as you feel connected to high picture.","Cultural shock when you are coming from outside company with established processes although Procore is evolving some of the processes now. Procore can do a good job of communicating the spirit of it's core principles especially ""Openness"" . People sometimes weaponize it to share and extract info in public which should be discussed in private settings.

Procore can do a good job of defining & communicating ""Roles and Responsibilities matrix""  on different levels to avoid any confusion & inefficiencies. 

Interview process can be more streamlined with other middle tier companies where future immediate team members are also part of the process regardless of hiring role."
21,Procore Technologies,Great Place to Work,2022-03-12,4.0,Staff Front End Engineer,"Great culture
Great focus on people--both employees and customers
Great values--Openness, Ownership, Optimism

A lot of attrition. A lot of both hiring and people leaving."

25,Procore Technologies,Great Company! Great Leadership!,2022-03-05,5.0,Implementation Manager,"The culture, the benefits, the people. Definitely one of the best companies I have worked for.","Just haven't found anything I would find a con at this time. No company is perfect, but Procore Leadership is so in tune to their employees, so it's just hard to find anything to complain about."
26,Procore Technologies,Love Procore,2022-03-03,5.0,Executive Assistant,Every good thing you hear about Procore is true. They truly care about your work life balance.,I have yet to find any cons.
27,Procore Technologies,Great company,2022-03-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great company, solid product. really enjoyed the people there.",Highly competitive product landscape with lots of competitors
28,Procore Technologies,Very high turnover,2022-03-01,1.0,Sales,"Nice platform, good tech stack.","If you get a good territory, you’ll do great. You can even get multiple promotions within a year. However, if you get a wrong territory you will not last. 
The worst thing is, the management genuinely doesn't care about the people. They make mistakes with the territories, leads and other alignments and then when things go south, they blame it on the reps, rather than fixing the issue itself. 
This is evident by a very high turnover in the last year, which isn't normal for a company claiming to have such a ‘good culture’."
29,Procore Technologies,Highly recommend Procore,2022-03-01,5.0,Product Support Specialist,"Work/life balance, Unlimited PVT (PTO), health insurance options/cost, availability for remote work, positive culture",I do not have any major cons for this employer.
30,Procore Technologies,Best place I've ever worked,2022-02-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Procore really prides itself on its culture and values - and in my experience working here, it has lived up to those. It values its employees and strives to be a great place to work.","Honestly, very few cons except for lacking clear career path. The pace is change is so fast I've had several managers in my 2 years here, which has made it difficult to advance for me because I never have an advocate for long."
31,Procore Technologies,Great Experience,2022-02-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Top tier culture and benefits. I have been with Procore for over 2 years and look forward to growing my career here for many years to come.,"With rapid growth, comes lots of change. The skills gained from balancing change have been invaluable."
32,Procore Technologies,Wonderful Company,2022-02-23,5.0,Product Designer,"Benefits, Culture, Vision, Product, Customer, etc",I can't say anything I don't like
33,Procore Technologies,Good people but better when in office!,2022-02-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I worked for Procore for 2 years in the CS department. I can't honestly say a better place to work in especially during the pandemic. I had a great team and manager so that might've affected my experience. But I can say it was a good company overall. My experience was better when we weren't WFH tho.,"WFH situation can feel a bit isolated and empty, but that could probably be said for every job at the moment."
34,Procore Technologies,Good company,2022-02-17,5.0,Financial Analyst,"Culture of trust

36,Procore Technologies,reviw\ew,2022-02-17,5.0,Account Executive,"great benefits , fantastic work culture",no work life balance at the company
37,Procore Technologies,Bad,2022-02-16,1.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"-The people
-The locations
-Nice offices
-Industry leading product","-Pay
-Artificial culture
-political
-Little consideration for input
-articulation from leadership to the front line is poor"
38,Procore Technologies,The 5 star reviews are fake,2022-02-15,2.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"good training program 
they give you “procore perks” 
give you a computer and everything you need to start 
free lunches and breakfast on certain days of the week","If you’re coming for the “company culture” don’t bother. It’s made clearly every day that they no longer care about the culture. 
It’s all a favorites game. Men who fail their goals just get moved to another team while others are fired completely. 
Making everyone go back to the office but making us pay for parking. Procore perks are given the option to pay for things like pre-care , students loans, workout memberships and now it will all be going towards parking. 
The “uncapped commission” is a complete joke.  
Management who is completely unfit. HR and higher ups just let the team suffer.
They talk so highly about moving on in the company and but make it nearly impossible to move on. Once again, if you’re a favorite they’ll move you on even if you’re on a performance plan and have missed quota constantly (which you aren’t supposed to do) but people who work hard are getting passed up daily.
They’re hiring more and more people outside of the company. All they care about now is how to make the investors happy since the IPO."
39,Procore Technologies,Once you peel back the pretty cultural facade you'll find a toxic blend of the most senior leadership,2022-02-13,2.0,Senior Manager,"The office location in Carpinteria is absolutely beautiful. 
The Procore product offering truly is second to none.","Very young and inexperienced executives ""lead"" by creating a fear-filled work environment. This fear permeates down to the director/manager level. Individual contributors (IC) are generally shielded from the leadership drama. This is why Procore tends to score highly in workplace satisfaction surveys... because more reviews are provided by satisfied IC's."
40,Procore Technologies,Was a top company but now barely able to keep up that Culture,2022-02-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"CEO and 2-3 others in the C-level are great guys to work for. They have built the culture that has resulted in whatever success, so far.
Benefits/Perks are great too. (but no more a differentiating factor as other in  companies also offer the same).","With growth and the hires at Sr. Dir/VP levels in last couple of years doesn't seem to care about folks who built Procore when it was much smaller. As they are also given lot of power without checks and balances resulting in some long-timers, top talent who have put in seminal work in the last 4-5 years leave because of bias, soft-discrimination, nepotism with no regard to Procore's culture."
41,Procore Technologies,losing it's great culture,2022-02-12,3.0,Senior Account Executive,- Great salary and commission structure,"- Joined the company a few years ago and as the office and region has scaled up, there's been a lot of change for the worse. Lots of disgruntled top performers and less of an overall good vibe to work in. 

- No real career opportunities or progression available.

- Management become a bit of a boy's club."
42,Procore Technologies,"Amazing culture, people, and purpose!",2022-02-11,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The culture across the org is amazing. From leaders at the top to coworkers, the people are generally so welcoming and great to work with. The purpose of the company is also great, helping improve the lives of everyone in construction.","Since the IPO, it's been harder to retain employees which sounds like is common. This has meant extra workload on people and generally more stress than before. While work is being done to improve the workload, the expectations to achieve the company goals are very high and does leave you stressed with more work but fewer people to spread that workload."
43,Procore Technologies,Good place to be,2022-02-09,4.0,Software Engineer,Fast growing company with great people.,"The pay is pretty average, not competitive with other similar tech companies."
44,Procore Technologies,Great!,2022-02-08,5.0,Customer Success Manager,Great place to work for,All good veery good no problems
45,Procore Technologies,Procore,2022-02-07,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Awesome culture and great teams. 1 to 1 alignment between AE and SDR is a great system. Unlimited time off, competitive pay, and a group of people that truly care about your success.",I don’t have a bad word to say.
46,Procore Technologies,When they say culture they mean Koolaid,2022-02-04,3.0,Senior Account Executive,"- Great perks
- Pay is decent 
- At first, it feels like its all too good to be true (lots of smoke and mirrors)
- Some cool people","Look at glassdoors reviews as broken down by gender and sexuality and it will tell you everything you need to know about this company. Men rate the company at 4.9 while women rate it at 3.6. Heterosexuals rate this company at 4.9 while LGBTQ individuals rate it 3.1. What might be most interesting is that you can't break the company down by ethnic diversity because there isn't very much. The company is very white, heterosexual, and male. They pretend to be a company that values diversity but it's all talk.

If you question leadership, they will question your commitment to the company values ""openness, optimism, ownership."" Values at Procore are weaponized and used against employees, even when they can't see it. If you are sick and do not perform, they will wonder why you didn't ""own"" your mistakes. If you ask about diversity, they will tell you to be ""open"" and assume the best of intentions. While they might have added a few more women to leadership over the past few years, I assure you this company is still very much a boys club. 

Working in sales is a grind. You spend more time documenting your role in salesforce than actually doing it. It's been a few years so things might have changed, but I kinda doubt it."
47,Procore Technologies,"Love my team, less hot on the bureaucracy.",2022-02-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love everyone on my team including my direct manager
Unlimited PTO which I have not ran into pushback when using 
401k matching is not high but it exists which is nice","Two pay periods for 2022 have passed now, and my compensation has not been adjusted to meet the 2022 California state minimum salary requirements. I've followed all the ""correct"" channels to have this addressed, however I have been kicked around between teams and am yet to receive a substantive reply from anyone in HR about this after a full month of trying. One would think that potential labor law violations would be taken more seriously?"
48,Procore Technologies,Great Culture/ work life balance,2022-02-04,5.0,Implementation Manager,Procore preaches about its company culture and work life balance. I was skeptical but it’s true. They genuinely care about their employees happiness and well-being and it’s a great team to be a part of,"Not as much room for growth as they say there is. Takes years to get promoted, lots of external management hires which is discouraging for ICs"

- Many smaller teams have management that is never available or involved
- Who you know will get you a promotion more than how you work for many
- Men routinely are promoted over more deserving and experienced women
- Very low pay for the workload and role

They are putting forth genuine effort to ensure there are career paths within CS, so people don't end up feeling pushed into Sales or another role in order to progress.
- Work/life balance is taken very seriously - whether you have a kid at home quarantining, a family member ill, or even just need a mental health day, you are encouraged to put yourself and your family ahead of work priorities. 
- Can't say enough good things about the culture - I truly feel the values (Openness, Ownership, and Optimism) being exemplified by leadership and trickling down. 
- Strong investment in diversity, inclusion, and belonging that feels sincere.
- I truly can't imagine being anywhere else, especially with the uncertainty in the world. I know I do not have to sacrifice personal commitments in order to thrive here.","- Very few, but we do tend to have flash in the pan initiatives that are rolled out before they're fully fleshed out with the necessary infrastructure in place to support them.

85,Procore Technologies,Don't believe the hype,2021-12-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The pay is getting better, and the benefits are constantly being evaluated and updated to better serve the employees. Employee quarterly stipend is nice but confusing and oddly restrictive.

Remote work is nice while it lasts. Equipment and software is great.

The product itself really is something to get behind.

There are some leaders that still have spirit, energy, and warmth that are pleasing to work with.

Office location and facilities are nice.","There is a big problem with lack of opportunities for growth. Internal mobility is rare, people apply to internal roles without getting a single interview. The gaslighting around advancement is real. We are told that we need to own our careers... but also told that there needs to be a business need for any future role. This makes no sense, as it's clear when there are open roles, they go to external hires or contractors. Then there are teams operating severely understaffed that need headcount -- but are denied. If you happen to be doing work above your job description, they will fight you on changing your title or pay. 

Procore orientation and external messaging make it seem like the employee experience is amazing and we live the values. There is no effort put into employee experience, morale, or celebrating wins in our organization. People seem too stressed out to even take a pause for celebration or take their earned time off. Another reviewer expressed it well: every single person on the team needs feedback, recognition and to be treated like they matter. Our leaders don't do this. Decisions are made that directly affect our team and no one even bothers to call a meeting to discuss and address any concerns."

100,Procore Technologies,"If you have a great manager, you'll thrive",2021-10-25,4.0,Revenue Cycle Supervisor,"When it comes to company involvement, Procore takes the cake. Looking pass all the ""Kool-aid"" of the tech world freebies (snacks, reimbursements, and activities) Procore has some, if not the best. During COVID, they allowed for all employees to be 100% remote if they needed/wanted to even after COVID restrictions. The reimbursements to compensate for some of the lost privilege's/freebies is one of the highest ($$$). They continually have ongoing self development seminars and trainings where I gained a lot of the knowledge I have now to be a successful leader and colleague. The best part of working here was the people, like any company you'll have bad eggs but working with people who are passionate and care about their job was so important in sometimes stressful environments. Whenever my team wanted to plan an event, whether big or small, Procore always covered the cost. Team virtual coffee breaks, happy hours/dinners, team bonding outings; you name it, we've done it.","Don't be fooled, there's a pay gap here, which was one of the big reasons why I left. The male counterpart here does get treated better than the female counterpart in regards to opportunities, promotions, and pay. I also expressed these concerns with management over the course of the time I was employed here and only when groups of people started putting in notice did anyone start taking it seriously. The level of responsibility, knowledge and the requirements of my position were of that of a manager but was denied because Procore would rather hire outside talent than promote within. If you're a strong, smart, and driven woman working within the Finance/Accounting department be prepared to be under valued, under appreciated, and looked over for raises, promotions, and growth."

118,Procore Technologies,Absolute Nightmare,2021-09-21,1.0,Customer Support Representative,I have met some great people. I got a free backpack during orientation. I get a paycheck.,"Working as a CSR at Procore makes me literally cry everyday from the stress of the job. Myself and my colleagues are exhausted from being overworked. 

The level of micromanagement is ridiculous. They measure your metrics (which is typically of a support job). They also do QCs which basically is just them deducting points from you because they have a different opinion on how to handle/word the chat even if your interaction with the customer was fantastic and you solved the customers issue. You will also get a message if you are 1 minute out of the correct status in salesforce asking where you are. Also they message you if you are 1 minute late. Work force management is constantly posting that there are X amount of chats waiting which just adds to the stress because there is nothing we can really do about the amount of chats we have. We are all doing our best and yeah we know it's busy. 

I was lied to during orientation. They tell you it's harder to get a job at Procore than get accepted into Stanford lol what a joke. Please do not make the same mistake I did and take a job in support here."
119,Procore Technologies,Great Overall,2021-09-21,4.0,Software Engineer,Lots to learn and plenty of hard problems to solve.,Procore has recently hired a lot of Staff and Principle Engineers who seem more keen on establishing themselves as 'Thought Leaders' then actually implementing anything.

While growth is important to scale, so is investment in your current staff and creating internal opportunities."
122,Procore Technologies,Great Company,2021-09-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company appears to genuinely try to support and take care of employees. The perks, benefits and supplemental resources are impressive and speak to the companies willingness to spend money to keep employees happy and efficient.

Procore is growing at a fast pace and that can be felt in the opportunities and challenges that present themselves. 

I'm content with my compensation and feel like an appreciated member of my team.","The company seems to be struggling to manage the scaling process and projects often lack strong management which can lead to inefficiencies.

Those inefficiencies can lead to bandwidth constraints and being spread thin which in turn leads to a lack of structure that can produce feelings of being overwhelmed and directionless."
123,Procore Technologies,Mission based company that genuinely cares about its employees and customers,2021-09-16,5.0,Marketing,"I've never worked for a company that comes back to its mission so often. It feels like the leaders and the people who work there are genuinely invested in the industry they are building products for, and employees take great care of each other. A lot of companies call themselves customer obsessed, but Procore actually is. I started working here a number of years ago, and have since come to love and admire the construction industry-- that appreciation is infectious at Procore. I've worked in a number of companies in my career, and I've never worked somewhere where they put so much time and attention into employee communication and the continual improvement for employee experience. If this was my first job, it would have been a challenge to move elsewhere, because it sets such a high bar when it comes to taking care of employees.","We've grown very quickly and that has come with some natural growing pains. But, these are not unique to Procore. I experienced them in the last company that I was with that grew at this pace. Some employees thrive in this environment and others don't. If moving quickly doesn't excite you, this may not be the right company for you. On the flip side, Procore is not a company that is stuck in its ways. There is lots of room for growth here if you're willing to raise your hand and try new things. They're open to new ideas and creative thinkers you will never be bored and you will learn more than you will in most other places."
124,Procore Technologies,Best company ever!,2021-09-16,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"Ownership, Openness, and Optimism -- these three core values are known and practiced throughout the company, from the CEO on down. From 600 ppl to over 2100, as Procore has grown it has continued to maintain its original culture based on those core values. 

Procore invests heavily in employee education and happiness, including a thorough week-long onboarding for new employees. Procore also works very hard at diversity, inclusion, and belonging -- so that everyone in the company, regardless of protected category or not, feels included, valued, and safe.

Finally, Procore treats its customer as partners, with periodic ""labs"" where engineers work closely with various customers to achieve rapid, specific improvements, making customer success as important as our own company's success.

The company, especially in Engineering, practices a ""blameless"" culture, preferring that everyone learn from mistakes, requiring retroactive reviews as part of that process.","Some VPs, directors, and managers appear to spend more of their time on organizational issues (eg: ""growth hacking""), staff social issues, and less with building relationships with individual contributors (ICs), mentoring, and helping to resolve technical issues."
125,Procore Technologies,"Get in, get out.",2021-09-16,1.0,Customer Support,"If you're looking for an introductory into the tech space, this company can be for you.","Other than the one pro; I wouldn't listen to what they preach. Support is an absolute dumpster fire. We can't recruit fast enough from the amount of people who are leaving. Compensation is NOT competitive for the workload we're responsible for.

Career growth isn't what it's marketed to be. Orientation makes it feel like this is the best place to work, but Procore is nothing but smoke in mirrors.

They preach about unlimited PTO, but get on to you if you've taken too much.

When problems and concerns are brought up, all you get is false promises of improvements, but no results."

- World class onboarding experience- you love the company in your first 2 weeks

- A genuine interest for your career goals- but the drive must come from you!

- The product is absolutely exceptional, best in class for commercial construction","- The biggest issue for sales people here is earnings. The OTE is great, but really genuinely difficult to achieve. My best judgement would be that 20% or less of reps hit their annual quota and therefore their OTE.

- People don't get managed out or fired here, and there are a few bad eggs that don't make the cut

- For Emerging & Mid Market, you only get ownership for upsells for 6 months, though often clients want to take a staggered approach to implementing

- Product feedback happens, but they havent been listening to crucial elements such as multiple tax codes, makes it difficult to sell product lines

- Field productivity is massively lagging behind

- The company has grown really fast, and there are some significant interdepartmental inefficiencies 

- Implementation managers struggle to get customers implemented in the 4-8 weeks promised, especially if they buy financials

- There is a difficult fit for non-commercial/multifamily construction"

140,Procore Technologies,Becoming More Disappointing,2021-08-30,3.0,Customer Support Representative,"Procore takes care of their employees. Great benefits and perks.
Flexibility. The company cares about your wellbeing. Great learning opportunities. Dogs allowed in certain offices.

I can't speak for everyone on this but my direct manager is fantastic. She truly cares about the wellbeing of her employees and wants to see them succeed. She will help her direct reports in anyway she can and will go to bat for them. She is encouraging, motivating and supportive. By far the best manager I've ever had.","After being hired, if you are looking to move into a different department than the one you are already in, prepare to struggle a bit. More often that not are internal candidates being overlooked if they don't already belong in that department. The internal hiring process is very unproffesional. I applied for a position and waited three months for a follow up. It wasn't until I reached out to the recruiter was I told the position was already filled. Another manager said it would be a week when he would follow up but that week turned into three. If this is how they are treating their internal candidates, I hate to hear how externals are being treated. Just very unprofessional. 

For positions outside of your current department, you better have everything they are looking for down to a T otherwise you likely won't be given a chance regardless of your performance or the recognition and awards you receive in your current role. 

Procore claims to be a humble company but I don't agree with that anymore. While it may have been true in the past, they are now becoming very pretentious and don't take chances on their own employees and also don't give them the respect deserved in a fair and informative interview process. They are losing a lot of great employees because of this and I can't blame those employees for leaving."

Most people are kind, helpful and  willing to pitch in.","This company struggled finding competent and experienced managers in the 4+ years there; I saw turnover due to this. Departments were often siloed and chaotic workflows abound; However, that is to be expected with a company like Procore dealing with exponential growth into many new product offerings and international markets.

I often saw my manager take credit for other people's work and PREVENTED my career growth: told team members I was seeking a different department's job opening BEFORE my internal interview and before anything was determined. Terribly unprofessional and created unwelcome tension within the team. On one occasion, this manager also wanted our team to work until 12:00AM for month-end close deadlines. It was unnecessary and everyone on the team was burned out."

The company is growing quickly, which creates its own set of issues and internal struggles; however, these challenges are one of the reasons I took the job. While there have been internal squabbles everyone has been professional and wants to work through these issues for the betterment of everybody individually and with Procore."

156,Procore Technologies,Excellent,2021-07-24,5.0,Account Executive,Company culture is put at the forefront of everything that is done. No employee goes unaccounted for.,None that I can see.
157,Procore Technologies,Love/Hate Relationship,2021-07-23,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"Let me start off by saying that this company has built a beautiful culture and has some of the best perks you could imagine across tech companies. The people here are incredible human beings and I've been so fortunate to work with all of them.

Work/life balance is also incredible. Flexibility to work remote if needed and never felt like I have to walk on eggshells to take time off like I have at other companies.","As mentioned above, I have a love hate relationship with this company. Here are some cons:

Employee Pay: 

Procore prides themselves on being a ""people first company"". While they live up to this in most aspects (culture + perks), the pay here is pretty crappy (50th percentile, I believe). If you TRULY value your people like you say you do, you would pay them what they are worth. I also had multiple conversations with my managers about pay increases during off times of the year and they would always push them off and say ""let's discuss this during merit increase time"". For my team specifically, we had a handful of people leave the company right before merit increase time and I still wonder to this day how all those merit increases that those folks would have gotten were distributed. Fact of the matter is, don't ask for a raise unless it's during merit increase and even then, there isn't flexibility to increase that as it has already been pre-determined by the budget/your manager.

Management/Team:

Managers are smart, intelligent people but have been brainwashed by upper management. About a year ago, we had a team merge where all the implementation managers and customer success were told we would be doing BOTH jobs. Yes, that's right, both implementation processes and CSM responsibilities. This process was so sloppy and unthought out and we were not paid for the additional responsibilities. This led to a lot of turnover, as you can imagine and the turnover has only continued and will continue.

Promotional opportunities:

Procore doesn't really talk about this much, which is a bummer. You should WANT to promote your people and actually help them to get there, but instead, the managers on my team are at war with other managers where their people go because they don't want to lose their own people. Very selfish. Fact of the matter is, if people aren't getting promoted at Procore, they will leave for better opportunities and better pay. If you follow any Procore employees on Linkedin there are at least 4 new posts a day of ""today is my last day at Procore"". The job market is hot right now and your employees are getting messaged by recruiters for opportunities with more responsibilities and better pay. I would recommend stepping up your game here if you want to keep your people."

The new normal of working remotely has been extremely beneficial to many here and I'm very happy with this change.

165,Procore Technologies,Be Wary of IT,2021-07-14,1.0,Manager,"Great benefits, good compensation. The founders are great beacons for the company and have started things off with a wonderfully open and caring culture that really tries to take care of the employees. Wonderful people at various levels around the company. I worked with some of the most empathetic, passionate, driven, and innovative managers and ICs of my entire career in my time at Procore.","Once you look beyond the founders, you find problems. Procore is not a startup anymore (it's now public) but it still suffers from many issues caused by scaling up significantly without building solid foundations. As a result, the support functions (HR, IT, etc) keeping the ship afloat feel a good deal of pain trying to fix process kinks, operate day2day execution, and innovate to the level that is regularly demanded (there's generally an expectation of going from crawling to sprinting... without walking or running first). 

There are negative politics at the upper levels between departments that make simple job execution painful, stressful, and at times impossible compared to expectations. The relatively new Chief HR Officer is someone to be cautious of. She presents a very forward, employees-first, face but is undermining the company's culture behind the scenes. There was a recent ""calendar lockdown"" event spearheaded at her request, and when the employees demanded it be reversed, she blamed it on an ""IT misunderstanding."" She now seeks to exert more monitoring of Slack (ALL conversations) than I think anyone could ever imagine. Which in and of itself isn't a problem, as long as there's transparency and openness regarding the plan (according to Procore's values). Time will tell if that's how the execution is done. 

The IT dept in particular suffers from (IMHO) leaders who were great for ""Startup Procore"" - scrappy, get things done... but not so great for ""IPO Procore"" where topics like structures, processes, and resource capacity become much more important. Original staff from early on are now in unsuitable roles due to what can only be attributed to cronyism. IT Senior Leadership gets frustrated at a lack of progress and turns to blaming middle management for not doing a better job (the buck stops... in the middle?). As a result, the empathetic, passionate, driven, and innovative people I mentioned above slowly get beaten down until the fire disappears from their eyes and they stop trying, and have already left, are looking to leave, or wish they could leave but don't because their equity chains them to Procore. 

There are new leaders coming into IT that are breathing common sense and fresh life into the teams -- but there are more seats that need to cycle to solve this problem. I wish everyone there the utmost luck and success in their careers, and suggest any prospective applicants to negotiate for every last penny you can (you're going to need & deserve it), and truly understand the expectations as early as possible."

However, this is the sort of problem that is trapping the young workforce. Procore is an attractive and hip company that looks like a fun place to work that cares about you. Yet depending on your role and department, your everyday happiness and self-worth can be drastically different than what is advertised. 

I was hired as the first of my position for my department and built the position from the ground up, with little to no management or direction. After 1.5 years, I felt I had hit the glass ceiling. I tried countless times to establish some sort of career path for myself and was met with absolutely no support from my manager or any members of my department leadership team. My HR business partner also gave me and my manager false information around the path of my position.

After a few months of trying, my manager frustratedly told me, “just because you’ve been here for a long time and are doing a good job doesn’t mean you get a promotion.” The disconnect here was so apparent- I wasn’t just trying to get more money or a title change- I was trying to find out how to grow in my role and help both myself and my department thrive. I tried to make this clear, yet nobody took the time to listen to me.

The paradox of feeling so worthless and unimportant while members of your team are coming to you daily for support or help is both confusing and emotionally taxing. This led me to finding employment elsewhere. I am extremely disappointed with the ways that Procore treats employees in roles that aren’t the hard hitting jobs- yet still have extreme importance internally. Save the trendy tech buzzwords and actually listen to your employees when they are asking for support. Establish career paths for everyone- not just the roles that bring in the most revenue."

It's incredibly exciting to be part of the digital transformation for the construction industry, and to do it as part of such an authentic, optimistic, and talented team is such a treat.","If you're looking for predictability and stability in your work life, Procore may not be for you!

243,Procore Technologies,Great Culture Through and Through,2021-02-09,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Procore has a wonderful culture where there is a strong team environment, we celebrate each other's accomplishments, and a focus on improving inclusion all around. Procore has invested in its culture of supporting employees and creating a safe environment. From top down, hiring focuses on people who will bring their best foot forward towards our values: Optimism, Openness and Ownership. Most, if not everyone has been willing to lean in and support one another here. 

What's been most impressive is the consistency of this amazing culture through a pandemic. Procore has been creative with company, department and team meetings/gatherings to connect and inform one another. There have been plenty of Zoom: games, sharing talents, happy hours, trivia, etc. too throughout this time which has helped us feel connected to others through a time of solitude and separation. There are plenty of perks at Procore especially when in the office (lunches, snacks, gym, etc.) and they brought these perks to us as we WFH with an expansive program of opportunities for active, family centric, or even dog centric lifestyles :) We also have people hosting Lunchtime Yoga! It's a wonderful place to work for many reasons but the culture is truly what inspires me every day to do best by our clients, colleagues and the organization! Definitely give Procore a chance in your job hunt!","We cannot be on campus right now. Unfortunately we will not be back at the office for a while due to COVID.

I've been here for over 2 years. Management really do put people first. How? Performance reviews post Covid for our sales team is done compassionately. keeping in mind how hard it is to sell when projects have been stalled/stopped due to the shutdowns. Management are very accepting and caring regarding pregnancies, mat-leave/pat-leave. Meeting free Thursday afternoons are in effect to help with Zoom meeting overload. On top of the generous benefits and vacation we are offered, we have extra perk dollars we can use for our wellbeing and work-from-home life. In meetings where there is discussion about staff underperforming, it's about how to help them, not how to penalize them. There is a big culture of openness where management is transparent about what's happening in the company and they are always looking for feedback as well. The diversity and inclusivity talks happen regularly and I respect that we have them despite some topics being difficult. The company really prioritizes hiring for culture because they want to keep the culture and teams positive. The training and tech stack given to all employees is substantial - they really set you up for success. It's fun to work here too with annual company events and regular department events. The culture is more informal than formal but everyone is highly professional and passionate. One of the things our leadership constantly says at our monthly company meetings is to prioritize you and your family.","This isn't a con but even though we're a large company, we move at the pace and passion of a start-up"

Clawbacks - Procore will punish the AE 1.25X if a customer decides to stop paying their bills, even 10months into 12 month agreements. This is terrible and they would rather take the money back from their own employees rather than go collect bills like a normal business.

The next day they have an all dev meeting (which included the QA) and told them that they had more money, were bringing back raises, and were hiring 200 more people.

298,Procore Technologies,Great company,2020-09-14,5.0,Product Manager,"Vales and culture, leadership, talent",Some struggles being a globally distributed company but leadership is trying and learning.
299,Procore Technologies,Not all is Rosy in the Operations org,2020-09-14,1.0,Senior Revenue Analyst,"The CEO and the Chief Culture Office are both people that make you want to believe in the culture amid COVID.

The IT and R&D Departments are run solid with job descriptions that match actual jobs, growth plans, and while the work can be challenging, their leadership is strong and advocates for results and growth top-down to ICs.

The individuals in every org are amazing. They can make you feel like you are a part of a family both pre and post COVID even with the switch to WFH.

Prior to COVID, there was a balance of WFH and Office for specific jobs, right now its entirely work from home and will be until there is a vaccine.","The operation departments including Insights, Systems, Marketing Ops, Field Ops, and Enablement Teams are run by their leadership, with such a fear culture that hard work is not recognized, there is clear favoritism and directors are afraid to advocate for employee growth or training out of fear of retribution since it would potentially utilize the influence they have built that they may need down the line with the upper ranks.

An example of this was right after a specific high-level individual joined, an extremely talented employee was told she was being given a senior title. However, there was a caveat. She was told that they meant to HIRE her as a Senior and therefore there would be no pay increase with this ""promotion"" which meant she was going to continue doing senior-level work, but at considerably less than her counterparts at that IC level in the org with that title. Her direct leadership went along with the party line with the pick your battles mentality. At the same time, all job openings were shut down for ROSE even though the departments and stakeholders were inundating their employees with work for an upcoming transformation.

When the transformation occurred in operations, there was no consultation with the actual Individual Contributors. This is not uncommon and happens a lot in businesses (and I suspect it will happen again here eventually), I personally have been a part of some prior. However, the leadership of operations took no time to get to know the people before making this change and shifted passionate people that were good at their jobs into roles they were either unfit for and/or not passionate about. 

To follow up on this change, even 10 months later, there are no job descriptions, there is no leadership or guidance or training for individuals shifted on how to succeed. This has lead to an inequality of workloads where some people are drowning and constantly lost, while others seem to have time to write books or watch videos during their workday. Some of the best of the org's employees have suffered months of depression, overwork, and failure to meet goals in a timely manner due to these shifts and lack of follow-through. 

We have passionate content and training talent now in systems and field ops that were given no support, no training, and immense amounts of work to pick up new skills such as stakeholder alignment, data analytics, vendor management, and business analytics which had lead to many of them to barely stay afloat. It went from an org filled with passionate individuals to people that are just trying to get work done and survive. The fear culture, lack of training/experience, and the overabundance of work keeps the management of these individuals from assisting them to move back into or help them find new roles elsewhere in Procore which is detrimental as that will only lead to further loss of talent which has already started to occur.

When COVID hit, company-wide there were discussions around solvency that were alleviated considerably, however, everyone was told that to prevent layoffs in the future all promotional raises, merit raises and bonuses were shut down regardless of exceptional annual review performance. This was common across the board for many companies at the time. What is different is that they did however offer UNPAID promotions with the promise of compensation down the line to some individuals who they felt should move up the ladder title wise. 

In operations, this meant giving nearly every employee who was an IC2 an IC3 title regardless of whether they had the years of experience, work ethic, or even the passion to drive strategic change. It not only degraded the people at that level already, but it also degraded the people that earned that title when people who literally slack off at work get the same accreditation and IC level without having to maintain the same standards or the output the same effort or results.

When the well-publicized layoffs occurred at the end of July with the justification of a transformation. Note, every company uses this verbiage when this occurs. While in some areas, it was truly warranted, the operations org used the transformation as an opportunity to rid the department of junior level staff to open budget to hire more senior-level individuals that did not need as much mentorship versus investing in their staff by developing a true growth plan for each dept which is found in other orgs. 

These layoffs cross-org hit the team morale extremely hard, esp when it was shown that the org was keeping on well-known individuals that literally were not productive, competent, or perform well or timely at their job. From a business perspective, the move was understandable. From a moral or long term strategic growth perspective for this org it went further to showcase that hard work and dedication and requests for guidance when prioritization is not clear are not going to be answered and there will be retribution. 

Fortunately for some of the individuals let go, it was a blessing in disguise because they were able to find jobs at other companies that paid them 25-40% more than Procore originally was paying them to do work that they were already doing but be passionate and feel valued

To make matters worse, the company announced the following day after the layoffs to the remaining company employees that it was going to be reinstating promotional and merit raises in September and backpay for those given unpaid promotions from July (months after the promotion was given, but hey at least something). Anyone that put in their notice after the layoffs who had received a promotion was degraded by having their dedication to the company questioned regardless of the work done or accomplished prior in their tenure, had their market value questioned, and was treated harsher than the people that the company had recently laid off even though they looked around at other companies due to the lack of any documented career growth, job descriptions or overall structure with prioritization in or outside the operations org. 

People that had built solid relationships were then used as political pieces in a game that had no winner for Procore or for the employee when management belatedly offered options that did not align with their career growth to stay. Words were twisted and untruths were spread around that differed from what was actually said or done. The people that stayed on that were promoted were giving insultingly low raises in an effort to show good faith, but turns to be a slap in the face when you see how much others make in other companies for the same job.

The biggest detractor in operations is the weaponizing of the values. If anyone speaks out with the hope of affecting change to increase morale, efficiency, and effectiveness, then they are labeled by management as not optimistic enough. Toxic positivity takes over where you are shamed for wanting better for your peers and yourself and receive retribution on top of that criticism when in fact you are the definition of true optimism by reaching out to people in power hoping for some sort of change. 

Requesting better change management, governance, and ideals that allow people to be treated better when injustice is done is the ideal of being optimistic that the company is willing to be better. However, operations twist it into you being the problem by acknowledging and trying to bring any and all issues even up. 

Another detractor would be that operations and IT orgs are constantly at some type of power struggle over resources and ownership and there is a lot of duplicative or ineffective work done due to lack of productive collaboration in-spite efforts by some on each side. Systems and engineering teams struggle on designing long term strategic tools together and even though one team clearly has a more mature outlook and background on how to handle the long term sustainable growth, there are arguments from the operations side over earlier inclusion that would help reduce duplicative efforts. This causes the individuals in each org to have to take part in the management disagreements, creates a further culture of unhappiness as well as duplicative work when the simple solution would be to work together cohesively to ensure the company meets its OKRs."

Development doesn't deliver on promises and maybe it's because they just flat out can't with the foundation of garbage holding this house of cards up. Besides spotty performance and availability, customers and employees could gain (even without trying) access to data from other customers. Insane!
2) Senior sales management is an extraordinarily arrogant version of toys that would have been kicked off the island of misfit toys by the semi-functional toys. Endless repitition of mantras by those who never carried a bag only go so far before becoming diatribes of BS that anyone with a brain begins to loathe until they cringe upon hearing the voice of the individuals from which they emanate.
3) CEO is a charming guy who tells a good/great story. You want to believe him and that his team is capable of delivering. Problem is that he's been loyal to a fault for promoting people way over their capabilities. That's starting to change and he (or the investors) are holding them to account, but it's too little too late unless they can pull off the ""changing out the engines while the plane is flying"" feat that's brutally difficult to pull off for fake cloud solutions.

310,Procore Technologies,CULTure vultures.,2020-08-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The campus is very nice.,"Inexperienced workforce! Most people that are in management positions have been there for a long time and were originally hired because their friends brought them onboard. This is fine when the company is small but the cracks are definitely more apparent now. A lot of people are fresh out of college and Procore is their first job. So many immature, egotistical and spoiled employees. 

Don’t even waste your time trying to suggest how to improve anything. Your opinion doesn’t matter. Unless, of course, you work for your friend. 

They speak of this amazing culture that they have built but since everyone has been working from home, the “culture” is none existent. A fancy campus and snacks does not mean great culture. Culture is something that you grow and nurture and it is something that everyone lives by. You can’t just chant “people first, Ownership, Optimism & Openness” and claim that as culture. It is more of a “CULTure”. It is far from any of those statements. I have never worked for a company that is so detached from reality.  This was the most immature, fraternity-like culture I have ever experienced in the work place. For some reason, people at Procore have a huge ego problem. Construction will still go on if Procore wasn’t around. Its not as “groundbreaking” as you think it is. 

They say that they are working on diversity and inclusion but I still see no real progress.

Throughout this COVID emergency, Procore has reacted quickly and responsibly, supporting employees as they work from home with ISP benefits and subsidies for WFH equipment.

The recent layoffs highlight another obvious issues with the business, which is that Procores absurd prices and annual contract structures do not have the capacity to sustain any uncertainty in the economy. They positioned these layoffs as a ""restructure"" but it is clear that the business is struggling to keep up with its massive overhead, and is seeing some very tough times. This is not to say that they will not bounce back, but things are grim around here. I have a lot of love and respect for the founders of this company, and the business model itself, but like any company flirting with an IPO, the hatches are battened and the perks are slowly slipping away.

If we had no plans to do lay-offs, why are we now saying we had planned this for awhile?

Values and Actions Mismatch:
- We say we're a people first company, yet we did abrupt layoffs with no warning, and no manager support. When talking to managers and directors they just say they had no idea this was coming.
- We also are arbitrarily doing layoffs, without considering the individuals. They got rid of PM 1 and PM 2 roles, even though some of those PMs were operating at a more senior level. We can't be people first, if we don't actually consider the people we lay off.

- Great mission
- Great location
- Great people

The company touts culture, and it really does have a lot of extremely driven, smart, successful (often very junior) people. Dogs, snacks, and events (pre-covid) were very nice.

If you're someone that wants to get in the trenches and figure things out for yourself, you can thrive here, as there isn't a lot of direction or oversight from upper level management, and you can pick the projects you want to work on (or don't do much of anything as many decide to do).

I can't emphasize the 'not do much of anything' enough. I think these people really figured out the key of Procore. They seem so happy. Show up late, with a dog, eat the snacks, surf lunch, leave early. No promo? No worries. They're living good.","- High churn rate
- Culture of resentment
- Not competitive pay (or often even market rate)

If you're someone that doesn't like 'doing not much of anything,' as much as it's great to get hands on experience and get in the trenches, the whole 'openness' of the company empowers people to tread on you consistently if extra effort doesn't come to fruition. If something does come to fruition, good luck getting recognized for it, and the likelihood you're rewarded in terms of compensation for extra work is very slim.

As with any company that has experienced growing pains, the exact thing that made it great to work for Procore is what they're losing as they grow. The workforce has become fatigued and disgruntled to the point that touting the culture makes them collectively resent it.

Often times people are paid well below their market value, but can justify it because of the culture and perks. With COVID, this is no longer the case; after IPO, I doubt it will be the case, so you're just left underpaid in a high COL area."

Hard to feel ""part of the mission"" if targets are ridiculous and promotion is almost impossible, 15 months MINIMUM cold calling into accounts that have been absolutely destroyed by previous employees.

377,Procore Technologies,"Great company, great people, tough transition but they’re managing it well.",2019-09-09,4.0,BDR,"First of all, what you read about the culture is true. My time with Procore was great and I’ve made lasting relationships with the people that I worked with. I’ve worked in several different sales orgs and this was one of the best.  Sales by definition is a higher pressure environment than most, but the people here made all the difference.  The management team tackles that pressure head on, with interesting and creative ways to keep the energy high and an actual “open door” policy when it came to addressing issues.  While the pressure typical of any sales org I’ve been in, the people here and the effort they put in minimized any negative impact that pressure typically creates.","It’s still sales. Pressure to hit sales targets is going to be part of any sales org. It’s tough and for most it’s not the right environment, but that is not unique to Procore.  

Procore has had HUGE growth, and while I was there was working hard to maintain the culture that they guard so fiercely.  But, growth does create challenges that can’t get fixed overnight.  Rest assured that if you want to work here you will be surrounded by people that want you to be successful, want you to grow in your career, and will work to help make that happen.  

If you are a driven, goal-oriented professional that understands that sales has tremendous growth opportunities and the ability to determine your own income, the sales at any company is good for you.  Sales at Procore will GREAT for you. 

If your not sure sales is the right career move for you, but you’re looking to break into a great company, Procore in a different role is probably the the right move."
378,Procore Technologies,Great place to continue your career,2019-09-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you have some years of experience under your belt and worked at other orgs -- you'll have a deep appreciation for Procore.  This is a great place to use your skillset and experience to make impactful changes in a fast-growing business.  There are endless opportunities to lean in and drive change -- at all levels. It's a relief working under leadership who hears your recommendations and allow you to take the wheel and drive -I've worked at a few places where this is completely non-existent! Procore also values flexibility and prioritizes work-life balance -- it's nice not having the guilt or stress of managing personal obligations with work.

It's sad to read the claims about ""fake reviews"" because it's simply not true. Procore has an open environment where all feedback is encouraged -- the good, bad, and ugly. Yes, experiences vary by department, role, and tenure -- but this is at every company. This is a fast-moving environment - so if you're unable to be nimble, multitask and work autonomously -- this isn't the place for you. And that's okay. There are plenty of folks out there who prefer to function that way and are chomping at the bit to join Procore.

I can't help but think that the majority of these reviews are coming from folks who haven't worked in other professional environments. The grass isn't always greener.","Experiences vary by department for sure. But it's certainly not as drastic as other reviews make it seem.  There are a bunch of middle managers who were promoted early on out of necessity, not skills. But we just hired a bunch of super experienced senior leaders who are reigning these folks in."

I just received an email from procore  months after leaving that stated that they didnt pay overtime correctly when I worked there which is not surprising given all the commission issues everyone had.

Pay is at 'startup' levels as the company identifies itself with but employee count is nearing 2000 rapidly and the pay is not competitive for some positions compared to larger more established corporations. 

Depending on the team there is a wide discrepancy in manager experience.

HQ location is sublime with an ocean view, running trails, yoga studio on campus, and delicious snacks. Friendly, passionate, and bright coworkers you can truly connect with and look forward to coming to work with.  If you are beginning your career this is a great company to do it at, however if you want to advance in your specific field you will need to make a career change to become truly exceptional at your job. Procore tends to put a lot of different things on your plate at once that inhibit your ability to specialize. Also, the management tracks are tougher to get into as an internal employee getting into the company now as there are a lot of tenured employees who got in earlier. Even if they don't have the relevant experience to back it up, they are automatically given the title/promotion and Procore has now made it harder to get no matter how hard an employee works","There is a severe lack of vision and direction from upper management on how we should be executing on goals. The core values are misused and misguided. We should not be blindly optimistic when we are flagging severe issues that need to be addressed. We should not have to time after time take ownership of tasks and projects that do not fall in our job description while there is no rec out for a hire to take on the job duties (especially when our base salaries are FAR below industry averages). We should not constantly be expected to be open about issues when there is no confidence that sharing them will make a difference.  There can also at the HQ location be issues with gossip, politics, and a ton of organizational changes that make being open difficult at times and HR visibility is close to none."

Benefits from the company are in-line with other tech jobs in the area. Cool office space, free snacks, all the stuff you'll see at any other generic tech company - all of which is a pro.","I've never seen a company weaponize their values as much as Procore.

Optimism = You will always follow what our delusional and unqualified management decides and do it with a smile on your face, or else.

Ownership = You will take on any and all duties no matter if they're your responsibility or not.

Openness = We will always say that we're transparent, unless it's about something we don't want to be transparent about.

There are a lot of happy go lucky reviews on here and honest, when I first started working for the company I would've posted the same. You get caught up in the whirlwind of being hired (I don't know if they still do the whole ""We have a lower acceptance rate than Stanford nonsense), but I'd pay attention to more of the reviews here from longer tenured employees, as I find them to be more honest and accurate.

Management is unwilling and unable to adapt to changes, and is mostly staffed by folks that just got the job because they've been around a long time with no real qualifications."

403,Procore Technologies,A once exciting company now flirting with mediocrity. Many notable R&D members have left in the past year.,2019-06-20,3.0,Product,"I worked in Procore R&D for half a decade and I will try to be as fair and honest as possible. If you really want to learn what it's like at Procore R&D, read ahead:

-Undoubtedly some of the best personal culture I've ever experienced at a company. Working at Procore, you'll make legitimate friends and have a blossoming social life. This is the most difficult part of leaving Procore. 

-Very, very strong engineering principles. Execution is another story, however. For those of you coming from traditionally waterfall environments, Procore will still blow you away.

-Great place to build up your skills and learn on the job. If you are fresh out of college, the amount of trust they have in your abilities is a great opportunity. You will be working on complex projects day one.

-Very passionate workforce. There is a never-ending stream of new and novel ideas coming from everyone on how to improve the software. But again, execution is another story.

-Product Marketing sits with their R&D team. Never seen that before and it's honestly a very smart move, hyper-modern,  and a bleeding edge arrangement.

-Incredible health insurance, especially if you have a family. Average 401k match. Car washes, haircuts, massages etc., but you have to pay for them. Good enough gym. Yoga studio. Coffee, beer, kombucha. Free lunch 1x week. Facility perks still pale in comparison to Silicone Valley.","From here, it may seem like I am being hard on Procore, but I spent many passionate years working there. It pains me to describe it like this. I know what it's like to work at a high performing company—and Procore is not it. Here are a few reasons why:

-Procore is an incredible company to coast and collect a paycheck. This may be a pro or a con depending on what you want out of a company. I personally found this to be utterly demotivational and mediocre. 

-There is a heartbreaking lack of innovation, big picture thinking, or delivery. There was a never ending stream of groundbreaking, industry changing and very reasonable opportunities identified by product, engineers, designers and customers but somehow Procore always failed at executing that last 20% of anything. Our features were were an almost-delicious meal that was taken out of the oven too early. This 20% is due to a lack of... you guessed it, product vision.

-Procore's young and inexperienced product leadership regularly botches releases (pivot, pivot, pivot!), makes decisions without data, chops things up to chase MVPs, and fails to communicate company vision. This has lead to many, many canceled projects in the last few years, software rollbacks, last minute redesigns, and so many other signs of a directionless product leadership.  The amount of times I heard ""maybe we can solve this problem by adding a field"" was mind-numbing.

-A far above average (usually 1 or 2,  this year 10+) number of notable PMs, Designers, Engineering leaders and even a VP of product have left in the past year. Many reported feeling like they had reached a career ceiling at Procore or had incredible frustrations with R&D leadership and direction. Most of them were also a minority, women or both. Coincidence? Maybe. 

-Tone deaf executive leadership. It's a rich, white and (mostly) men's club with many of them having lived in elite Santa Barbara or similar areas for many years. Think yacht clubs, terraced walls surrounding mansions, and luxury cars. Most of Procore's workforce doesn't even come close to that sort of lifestyle. As a result, I've never really felt that our problems were their problems.

-Procore is an uneven and varied playing field. There are 25 year old managers that started as interns 4 years ago during Procore's early startup phase. Good for them, I guess. Half of them have no clue what they're doing and are winging it. There are Engineers, PMs, and designers with 15 more years of experience than their managers. The points don't matter and the promotions are made up. 

-Procore truly struggles with measuring employee output. I've witnessed many passionate and effective contributors be snubbed for promotions or sidelined. Instead, there is a high return on playing political games at Procore.

-Pay is below industry standard. To their credit, they've tried to correct this lately in many departments. Still below industry standard.

Take these factors, roll them up and realize you can easily fly under the radar doing nothing. Even if you are a passionate contributor, you will soon realize that success is not tied to performance. Combine that with the sleepy beach town that is Santa Barbara and you might as well kick back, collect a check and drink wine at the funk zone with your co-workers for a few years. It's too bad, because construction technology is legitimately interesting and you'll quickly see that Procore could be so much more impactful."

Parking is FREE. If you are frustrated with taking a FREE shuttle that gets you to work in approximately 3min then my friend, you need to get outside of the Santa Barbara bubble for some time and try living in a city.

- $5 meals","- If you're a developer outside of their Santa Barbara office there is little room for advancement. As a company that's more than 10 years old, it should've been imperative to foster a remote working environment to compete with modern companies. Employees outside of HQ are constantly left out of the loop

- There is no salary transparency. At one point an email was sent out to employees where it was announced that women at Procore were 'satisfied with their pay'. 'Satisfied' is a feeling and not an actual data point. It's well-known that salary negotiation plays an unfair advantage for women. It's fine for someone to be satisfied with their pay, but with no salary transparency, there's no confirmation that salary was fair across all genders.

- Management is a major issue. In engineering, it seems like there's a straight path from engineering to engineering management when those are two different roles with completely different skill sets. This leads to issues where you have managers that are 5 years into their career and there's no support given to them. This creates a culture of managers actually just acting as senior engineers and those under them aren't given any career development support. 

- Party culture: At a company all-hands, someone in management actually said something along the lines of ""If two beers get you drunk, maybe you shouldn't be here."""

I don't mean ""culture"" as code for, ""we're all robots,"" but in terms of an ethos of behavior and doing business and treatment of others. As the company scales there are some hiccups, but coming from another hypergrowth company, it's refreshing to see that folks at Procore *care*. They may not have all of the answers all of the time, but having managers and execs who generally understand that people, not robots, work for them, matters. Every person has a different experience at work because we have different roles and different personalities. This place is no utopia--but that's because utopia doesn't exist. I'm writing this review because I lived on Glassdoor when researching companies I was interviewing with, and I always wonder about the agenda of someone posting. No one knows I'm posting, and I don't plan on telling anyone bc it isn't their business. But to the folks out there wondering if Procore is the right place for them, you only know if you try us out.

Maybe it's time to just put it simply: no one remembers trips to the beautiful campus or free lunches on their death bed. They care about mastery, autonomy, purpose the flip side of the contract the company signs with its employees. Perhaps instead of being so blatantly positive it's a good time to consider why talent is leaving a company with such great prospects. Being so hung up on 'values' turns culture (which evolves by the way) into propaganda -- but it's telling. Dissent is not really welcome despite much talk of openness. Return on politics is high."
419,Procore Technologies,Procore is a solid place to work in SB county but the parking drama is a mess.,2019-04-03,3.0,Software Engineer,Procore is a great company and they try hard to do right by the employees in most ways.  The executives seem open to feedback but are slow to react.  Our product is hands down best in class and we're bringing in better talent every hiring cycle.  Lots of growing pains for sure and some amateur departments making bad calls that end up getting people worked up on glassdoor but that's the risk you run when you have weird policies that upset people.  Benefits are okay.  Pay is fairish.  Perks are pretty good but not LA or Bay Area perks.,Some of the old school people are tough to deal with and haven't really worked in tech before.  They come right out of UCSB or a bar or restaurant and were lucky to be in the the right place at the right time.  You can see procore moving past these legacy hires and hiring above them but there is still some resentment and resistance.  Someone else said it can be fratty and surf culture heavy and i think thats true.  the company is still young but theyre trying and that means something.  HR or Recuriting or Communications whoever it is needs to chill with the positive posts on glassdoor people aren't stupid you can tell they are fake `keep doing what you're doing` or `keep the culture` or `some people can't follow the parking rules` these posts are all just PR propaganda and damage control.  The parking thing is a mess you can't just boot people and think no one is going to complain about it and warn other people thinking about working here.  i dont think i would have stopped to write a review if i didn't see all these damage control posts here.
420,Procore Technologies,"Fantastic company, despite the ""parking problem""",2019-04-03,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"As an employee that has been at Procore for 5+ years, I have been given the opportunity to see it grow and change into many different companies. Each one of those companies have had their distinct challenges, and each time we have been able to get past them. Each one of those companies has set ambitious goals, and we have crushed them. It's honestly been amazing to be a part of and I have been able to learn so much!

However, the most impressive thing that Procore has done is it's ability to retain it's culture. The Senior Leadership Team cares about each and every employee and it is obvious in the things that are valued and the way the company operates. Culture starts at the top and Tooey and Steve are nice, good, honest people that care about their employees.

Procore also does an incredible job protecting itself. Every company makes bad hires, what is a sign of a good company is how bad hires are handled. There have been many good people who would have been fired from most other companies, but Procore sticks behind its values and tries to help you before they part ways. Management understands how hard it is on a team and firing someone is a really difficult thing, but Procore strikes the balance well between rehabilitation and protecting the company.

The list of good things is really really long but here is my last one.

Autonomy, Procore really does value autonomy. They want you to feel like you have a choice and that your voice matters because it does.

If you can, get a job here because it really is paradise.","Have to apply a lot of sunblock because of the glare from the ocean.

There are soooo many dogs it can be really hard to focus sometimes cause you are just so incredibly happy watching dogs do dog things.

People are really friendly so it can be a little hard getting out of water cooler talk sometimes.

Have to deal with a few people that feel ""personally attacked"" because they don't like following parking rules and think they are more important than everyone else."

If you’re interviewing here make sure you take into consideration that you have to park more than a mile across the 1 and take a shuttle back and forth to get to your car everyday.  If you're senior enough you can make the problem worse by negotiating a parking pass during the offer process.

During last week's company lunch a Procore branded parking boot was displayed prominently next to our food with a bow on top.  As lunch announcements start the Workplace Experience team goes on a rant about how they're going to start booting cars again and they've even created a slack channel for those who get booted.  The fact that Procore even has boot clearly shows the ""Workplace Experience"" is failing at its most basic responsibility: providing a productive and positive workplace.

I'm ashamed to work at a company where senior leadership gave the ok to not only buy the boot but get up in front of a room of our colleagues and threaten them.  The boot program and the the threats are inconsistent with our values as a company and this is certainly not the Procore I joined 5 years ago."

From a business perspective, the opportunity for Procore and its people is huge and they are doing a fantastic job on capitalizing on that (this truly is a market leading product and organization). But what really stands Procore apart is the culture and the way it invests in and treats its people. Being flown out to HQ in beautiful Santa Barbara, California for two weeks of high-quality on-boarding and training was amazing. Procore has also done a great job of bottling up the awesome culture from HQ and exporting it to London. The London office is great and has all the perks you'd expect for a leading technology/SaaS business - snacks and drinks, weekly breakfasts and lunch's paid for by the company, etc. And the best thing of all is the people and  atmosphere.

The London office is building out which means having the chance to make a real impact. The team is incredibly fun and friendly and as they've located here from other offices, it's an exciting mixture of culture and experiences.

- Decent perks for the area (though admittedly, the perks are fairly basic in comparison to LA/SF tech companies)
- If you love the area and don't ever want to live anywhere else, this is def the best of SB/Ventura
- Very little micromanagement. If you get your job done, you can decide for yourself when/how you work for the most part","- The culture in most of the company is great, but its definitely *different* in engineering. There's very much a vibe that you must conform, and anything else is ""counter procore culture"". The procore values of ownership, optimism, and openness are used equally as weapons or almost threats as they are used to hold people to higher standards. Optimism = censorship, ownership = ""it doesn't matter who's responsibility it is, if you're bringing it up, you're now responsible for resolving it"", openness = ""in the spirit of openness"" even suggesting that anonymous feedback be an option is counterculture.

- Much of senior management was promoted from within, so for many, this is the only tech company they've worked at. There's an air of ""well this is how we do it here"" which has to be taken with a grain of salt when the people saying it have only worked at Procore

- Too much autonomy in an organizational sense. Procore offers a lot of individual autonomy, which is great until you have 40 teams in engineering all operating on different schedules, cadences, planning styles etc. Where one team will have standard 2 week sprints, another will have month long sprints, or could be operating waterfall.
- Salaries are not competitive. Ask in your hiring conversations for what you'd like to make in a year, and don't settle for a counter offer. The only opportunity you'll get is during the hiring process.

- The opportunity for advancement is very much overstated in the interview process. They use examples of how senior management started as entry level employees, but that never happens now. I'm certainly not shy to go above and beyond, but the level at which you have to do that to even get a moderate annual raise is a lot. Title bumps are extremely difficult to achieve.

- Last but not least, parking is a HUGE issue. 90% of people are forced to park at satellite lots that fill up by 9am, and then shuttle to/from the main office. Count on adding an extra 45 min to an hour to your commute to take the parking/shuttle situation into account."

Love the atmosphere of positive language and pushing growth and improvement. 

The company makes a significant effort to invest in its people and its customers. They have a team dedicated to the work experience and programs to benefit everyone's wellness. Greatly appreciate the effort made to encourage people to go out and volunteer for the local community. 

Leadership team proactively tries to be as transparent as possible. This is helpful to keep everyone speaking to the same goal. Real effort in ensuring everyone here feels like the work is value.

Everyone has the same goal, do the best job that you can.","Unfortunately, our greatest strength is also our weakness.  Everyone seems to have a voice and an opinion on how things ought to be.  For the employees who have been here the longest (depending on your team/department), you might have people with zero experience who are trying to re-invent the wheel by coming up with random ideas.  Nobody can seem to agree on a direction.  Management seems lost on ideas.

If you are working in Sales, be prepared to be frustrated with the entire quoting  process. The Quoting Tool is a complete FAIL.  You constantly have to redo Quotes and Order Forms due to the extreme amount of bugs and errors you will run into.  Pricing and discounting of these services is another headache, and especially when you are trying to explain the Order Forms to customers?  A lot of valuable time is wasted.

What makes this company so amazing is our culture and the people who work here - it goes deeper than just the amazing perks we get. From the top down there is a solid belief in the product we are creating and that in order to make the best product we have to value our employees. It is the small things that the company does that really makes me feel like I am apart of something great and not just another cog. Things like Snow Day, the president of the company taking time to give us announcements during lunch, visiting one of our other offices and the employees their taking time out of their weekend to show you around the city. I am so proud to be apart of a company like this and it inspires me to work my hardest every single day.",The only con really is that we do suffer from some growing pains as we are scaling quickly - but if we weren't growing then we wouldn't be striving to be the best and it would probably get boring fast.

My squad members are amazing.","Giving autonomy to all devs regardless of their experience results in people reinventing the wheels, inconsistency in the codebase, anti-patterns and many more. 
Maybe it's just my team, but me being the #1 contributor to all the projects of the squad ever since I joined 5 months ago doesn't seem to matter to the manager. There's a bit of favoritism towards people who are non-performant but have been at Procore and friends with the manager for quite a while, and there is no objective evaluation. Conversations and discussions are important, but they are meaningless without end product and result. But hey you can always switch teams, and I might too."

469,Procore Technologies,Yes.. It is that good..,2018-07-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"The company gives you everything you need to be a happy employee AND MORE.

Almost all team members, especially managers and leaders, have an extremely positive and welcoming attitude about them.  This alone makes going to work everyday not feel so much like work.

Tooey (CEO) along with all the other leaders are extremely sharp, friendly and approachable.  Leadership is extremely transparent and makes an effort to make sure all employees, no matter how low on the totem pole, know what is going on at the company and what the goals are.  For example, a few months after getting started in engineering, the CTO sits down and has a lunch with you and a few other of the recent new hires and answers questions and openly listens to any concerns you have.

Leadership seems to care extremely about providing the absolute best possible product and being extremely ethical and fair in everything the company does.

Leadership and management never seems to get stuck in their current ways of doing things.  They are always looking for advice and ways to improve.  A new employee could start on day 1 and leaders would listen to any ideas for improvement.

There are entire teams of people dedicated to making sure you have everything you need to be productive and happy at work.  There is a dynamite facilities team, an amazing food and beverage team and then extremely attentive and quick enablement managers that make sure you have it all.

Lots of people around Santa Barbara have labeled Procore as ""Brocore""... Once you get on campus and start working, this label does not ring true.  The company is diverse and there are many strong people from all backgrounds.

Work life balance really depends on your individual department and team (just about like everywhere else)...  I am fortunate enough to have a team that everyone shows and puts in 40 SOLID hours of productive work and goes home.

And the BIGGEST pro of Procore, is the opportunity for career growth.  Procore is all about making you better and letting you follow your interests.  Lots of people get hired for a certain position, then decide they want to grow into an entirely different position and Procore completely supports it.  Start off as a QA and want to become a Software Engineer at some point?  It happens, and Procore has your back.","There is only one female on the executive leadership team.  I am sure the company realizes that they need to start getting more females in there. (I am a male and I am saying this.)

Unlimited PTO can be bad... Some people get hurt by this due to the dynamic of their teams.  Maybe add a minimum requirement of taking 3 weeks."

Working in the heart of downtown is great and the office is new and modern.","Middle management is running the Austin office into the ground. Almost all of the managers started at Procore 3-5 years ago and have been promoted into management simply because of tenure and timing. They have no experience managing people, have gotten little to no training and are running good talent out the door. These middle managers seem to have either “drank too much of the koolaid,” have their hands tied and are unable to do right by the good hardworking employees, or simply don’t care to try to help. The pay scale is not competitive in the Austin market and it’s common to have brand new employees come in making significantly more money than people who have been around for 2+ years. The commission plan makes no sense, is unfair and HIGHLY volatile. Removing commission and increasing salaries is the easiest fix for the vast discrepancies in pay among people who do the exact same job but management won’t listen."

You can get overloaded and need to remember to advocate for yourself as everyone has a lot going on so proper management support can fall through the cracks.

I worked at two other companies in my career (one for 4 years and one for 11 years) and they were average companies in that they had their pros and cons.

Everyone from each branch of the business is flown in from all of the different offices (from Australia to Toronto to Willmar, MN) and goes through the same exact week long orientation.
Out of a fairly large (38 person?) class, I was thoroughly impressed with every single one of my peers in what they brought to the organization. Not only that, all of the training team and groups from different business units all came with an incredibly enthusiasm and attitude that permeates.
At the end of the week, we went on a full tour of the HQ and were lucky enough to have Tooey, the CEO, meet, walk around with, take pictures, and talk to us individually.
That was just week one.

On my individual team level: I've been at Fortune 500 companies, 5> start ups, and everything in between, but I have never experienced the level of camaraderie, teamwork, and general positivity seen at Procore.

In areas of employee life that can get diluted at scale (e.g. learning and development, company culture), Procore has invested repeatedly.

I've been at the company nearly two years and have watched it grow from just a couple hundred employees to over a thousand. 

With that kind of growth comes incredible opportunity to make something exceptional of your career, but it comes with risk. Many companies growing to this size begin to lose the culture that made them great. 

Procore is a rare example of a hypergrowth company that drives unparalleled business outcomes while putting the employees first. I've never been part of a better culture, especially at a company thriving this much.","This isn't really a con, but maybe a warning for the wrong type of person. With the growth we have achieved and the amazing opportunity still ahead comes aggressive goals. Procore is not for the faint of heart.

570,Procore Technologies,Startup times 10. Be aware before approaching us.,2017-05-21,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"-High prestige startup: getting well known in SF/the valley. $1B+ valuation unicorn
-Most perks given by a single company in SB county... period.","Below are not ""cons"".... just be aware before you jump in or start pestering me or other Procore employees for a job.

The company feel is a tech startup... times 10. Since there are many hired straight out of school/UCSB (cheaper and easy to mold), be sure to be well read about the ""disadvantages of working at a startup"" before jumping in (google around).  Good articles available on jobhero, monster, etc.
Qualities of a startup that Procore definitely has:
(1) Looks very cool on the outside/social media. But the long list of ""perks"" are not free. There is a very high bar for expectations to perform. Questionable job security across much of the company. (dogs, lunches, and strong health package all come with a catch)
(2) Very long hours and unspoken competition. Claims that there are lots of opportunities for growth... which will require alot of time/stamina to keep up or be  ahead . Everyone is smart, so your performance must be very ""extraordinary"" to move up. Many departments seem to classify performance binary: either not performing/needs improvement or extraordinary performance. Pressure is high. 
(3) Roles are sometimes undefined and change fast. No guidance on new projects: you must figure it out and master it on your own very quickly. (the line used is ""you learn something new every day"")
(4) Cult-like, must drink the kool-aid, alot of pressure to fit in/assimilation. High number of applicants/competition to join the company means that ""cultural fit"" (work-life integration) is important (including but not limited to: SoCal, surfer, UCSB/greek alumni). An unspoken pressure towards work life integration, not work life balance (majority of employee roommates and friends outside of work are their coworkers). Therefore, being in a strong click is critical.  Life outside of work/coworkers may be questionable.
(4)  Those that joined before VC funding always talk about the good ol' days. They seem to enjoy better job security."

It's apparent from the moment I interviewed. the benefits are great, but the way they make you feel, like the sky is the limit and how all ideas and thoughts are considered. The president came in on day one and made a great anecdote. I'm paraphrasing here, but it went to the tune of there are many ways to do almost anything, and usually a best way to do anything, but it takes the trial and error of trying all the ways to find the best way and Procore is not afraid to try all the different ways to find the best.

A great place to cut your teeth.","Thought I would help set the record straight on the healthcare offered by the company.  

You are provided with their one and only PPO.  They pay 100% of the ""monthly premium"" for the employee ONLY. To cover a family, however, the additional fee is very minimal.  

Now, to clear things up for everyone--healthcare is NOT 100% fully paid.   You still pay for office visits, medicine, deductible, etc. You do have a low deductible for this PPO, and your out of pocket max is a couple thousand for individual each year.  What does this all mean?  It means there is still out of pocket expenses: Office Visit/Meds + Deductible + 20%. The upside is you save money by not paying the monthly premium for the employee.

The 401K Match:

They contribute .25% for every 1%--up to 8%.  As an example, let's say you make $100K/year. To take full advantage of this offer, you contribute 8%, or $8,000, and company will contribute 2%, or $2,000.  Or you contribute $4K, the company chips in $1K

For comparison, other companies offer matching of 50% up to 6% or 100% match up to 4%.

In this scenario, if you contribute 6%, or $6,000, the company would contribute 3%, or $3,000.  Or, you contribute 4% and companies matches 4%; $4,000 + $4,000. 

As you can see, not the best matching out there...and it could be worse with zero matching.

This is important if you are just beginning to save for retirement.  You can see how it can cost you thousands of dollars a year, and tens of thousands over the long term..and if you plan on staying here a while--it can hurt your retirement from a financial perspective.

Vacation:
Sure, there is ""unlimited"" vacation, but really...most people won't take more than 2-3 weeks off per year.  The downside for *you* is that you will not accumulate vacation hours, and thus, if/when you do leave the company, they do not pay you for your vacation hours.  

So, there is a give and take here.  You get shiny objects (free lunches) --but it is going to cost you without really knowing it."

602,Procore Technologies,"Big company, startup culture, beachside view.",2016-11-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Tech is competitive. There's always a shortage of engineers and a plethora of opportunities. Like many other tech companies, Procore has all the perks. Snacks on site, beer, haircuts, unlimited PTO, etc. But there are three things that have kept me at Procore. 

The first is freedom and autonomy when it comes to engineering decisions. For the most part, engineers are trusted to solve the problem in the best way they see fit. Additionally exploration of new technologies is encouraged (within reason).

The second is the focus on communication and collaboration. People are always open to lend a hand when it comes to whiteboarding a problem, and you can generally count on someone in your squad, chapter, or tribe to have your back when you get stuck. Additionally, when it comes to architecting large solutions no opinions are seen as more valid than others. We try to get every idea out on the board and weigh out the pros and cons equally.

The third is the people. It's easy to lose the feeling of community in a company that's growing this quickly (I started at around ~100, and now we're pushing 700 employees). But the culture that I felt when I joined is still there. It's hard to describe in any other words but ""good vibes"". People here are generally laid back, passionate, and positive.","No company is without its share of cons. Procore's culture promotes a fairly loose leadership style, which may be seen as a negative for those who require more defined tasks and objectives. Individuals who see themselves as self starters will be at home here.

Another potential con is the core codebase. It's a Rails app that was created before Rails 1.0. With an platform of this size and complexity, there's going to be places in the code base that are pretty rough. Exploration is happening around creating microservices when possible, so I'm not terribly worried about the stack.

Additionally the location can be seen as a con. Carpinteria is a sleepy town directly in between Ventura and Santa Barbara. There's hardly any traffic either way, and the drive is all beach side. The downside is Carp is far removed from the metropolises of LA and San Francisco. As someone in their 20s, this can be a potential deal breaker when it comes to nightlife, art, and entertainment. The upside is if you don't mind sacrificing a bit on the nightlife front, Santa Barbara is an amazing place for people who love the outdoors."

There's also the growth. That growth doesn't come at the expense of a work/life balance. Procore also serves the communities where its offices are located through the Procore Cares program. It's a great opportunity for employees to feel a deep connection with the community. 

The company and people (and the great product) make me happy to come to work each day.

608,Procore Technologies,Stack Overflow at scale,2016-09-10,1.0,Software Engineer,Working on the beach is amazing! 99% of the people who work here are genuinely good people.,"There hasn't been an original line of code written at Procore since about 2012. The big challenge here is scaling the core Ruby on Rails application from a few hundred thousand users to a few million. I don't know when it happened, but at some point all of our developers became exclusively reliant on copying code from Stack Overflow.

I come across Voodoo Code all of time, and it's not legacy -- it's by design. I honestly don't think the engineering leadership here believes code can be valid unless it was written by someone else and up-voted 25 times. 

We've long since exceeded the boundaries of what Rails was intended for. We've gotten to a point where we're constantly recycling ideas that worked once-upon-a-time and applying them to out current situation with brute force. 

Procore looks like a start-up, smells life a start-up, and acts like a start-up. But joining has been the biggest mistake of my professional career. Creatively is actively stifled, new ideas are constantly maligned, and our CEO and President are 100% hands-off when it comes to development. Their trust is misplaced."

611,Procore Technologies,Awesome Company In A High-Growth Trajectory,2016-08-22,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Many companies have a ""Mission Statement"" full of nice-sounding ideas, but Procore is very serious about their Values, which are: Ownership, Openness, and Optimism.  

During the 3-day on-boarding process, the company President and co-founder spent an hour with us explaining the founding of the company, the meaning of these values in more detail, and that everyone from the leadership on down, is empowered to identify issues and fix them, without waiting for permission.  This is *not* a ""centralized command-and-control"" kind of company; rather, Procore emphasizes good communication and decentralized decision-making by the people closest to the best information needed to make good decisions.

I've been part of many companies, both large and small, from early-stage startup to a well-established public company, and this is the best I've ever seen.

I'm very impressed with the quality of the people and the overall mindfulness in this company.

In addition to the above, the Procore invests tremendously into learning and development, into supporting a balanced work life, subsidized lunches, and many other amenities for employees.  Finally, the HQ buildings sit on the Carpinteria bluffs, with stunning views of the ocean, and within walking distance of the shoreline.","The only thing negative I can think of is that the company is growing so quickly, that it's a challenge to keep that small company feel where you know everyone's name and have good connections."

I need to stop working and enjoy the training sessions on the lawn after work. I should also linger and socialize more at Wed lunch, instead of wolfing down my free lunch and charging back to my desk to embrace my tasks. Cons are on me, not on the company. I am way too excited."

Some of the smartest, nicest, funniest, hardworking, and genuine people you'll ever have the privilege of meeting. You read about places like this and think, ""can't be real"", and then you show up and experience it, realizing, ""holy sh*t, it's real"". It feels like Wonderland in the best possible way. The product itself is absolutely incredible. I don't work in the construction industry (obviously) and even I want to buy it. One of the best decisions I've ever made is coming to work with amazing people every day and feeling honored to work hard by their side.","The product itself is so remarkable that it's a lot to learn, especially for someone without a construction background. Also the company is growing so rapidly that it's hard to keep up with who is who and what everyone does. It just requires a little more effort than smaller companies and is so worth it!"

Individual contributors are amazing people along with the majority of middle management. Great product that solves millions of problems daily. The company provides a great foundation for people to grow their skills and experience. Fantastic location, facilities, and perks. Their values are a no-brainer and the culture is contagious.","New features being pushed live daily and QA is lacking in use cases and time. Absolutely no down time in the work week (energizing, but exhausting at the same time). Growth is happening too fast where employees can hardly be proactive, let alone reactive in an effective manner. Lacking objective/effective leadership due to the extensive number of under-qualified people being promoted. Sales-driven. Product managers and sales reps are highly valued, while the rest are easily expendable."
643,Procore Technologies,Not all it's cracked up to be...,2016-05-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great location, beautiful campus, cool technology. Software is easy to use as well. Procore's software is far beyond other company's construction management software. Lots of expansion, has happened as well. The free snacks are cool too.","It's a bit like the movie Pleasantville. Everyone's told it's the best place to work, and they expect you to reiterate that. People walk around with smiles and act sincere but it feels like a facade. There is a lot of internal judgement and your always feeling watched and sized up. Their ""openness"" pillar is one sided. Your expected to share everything with management but it's not reciprocal. The sales team is arrogant and told to ""Make the sale at all costs"" (a modern day version of the movie, ""Glengarry Glen Ross""). Everyone is pressured so much for growth that new hires get lost in the shuffle."

2.) Culture: The culture at Procore is awesome! I've worked in the Bay Area, and other startups in the area, but nothing comes close to Procore's culture. The vibe is fun, laid back, and easygoing. It's not the type of place where you feel guilty for leaving at 5... most people do, and there's a great work-life balance here. Everyone is cheery, the perks are amazing, and we have lots of fun events!

3.) The values. Procore is the fist company I've been at that has distilled its core values down to 3, that everyone truly lives and breathes. After you've been here for a bit, you can really see that the core values are more than just words painted on a wall, like at other places. The values come from the top down, but are reflected in every employee's actions.

4.) The Office, Perks, and Benefits. The pay is great, more than my previous place in the SB area, and the Office is totally new and decked out. Weekly company lunches, delivery on other days of the week, fun events and after-work workouts are just some of the things that make Procore unique. 

5.) The leadership team! They actually know my name, and even stop in the hallway to talk about more than just small talk. They're friendly, fun, and active in social events. They're also around the office frequently, rather than constantly being across the country doing business elsewhere. It's nice to feel connected to them!",1.) Hmm...

693,Procore Technologies,Best company that I've worked for so far. Best tech company in the Santa Barbara area.,2015-01-07,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Great culture
Awesome office
Fair, attentive, and supportive management on all levels
Tremendous growth
Maintains start-up feel without the lack of benefits and compensation
Snacks, food... food
Very dog friendly and always has been

I've worked at a few companies around the Santa Barbara startup scene now... and Procore is by far the best. Its culture is open and friendly; its management from mid-level to senior executives and friendly, supportive, and genuine. 
Office lunch every week that feels like a family meal. Procore also wants you to get to know other employees... it has a program that sponsors your lunch (on the non-company lunch day) if you take someone out that isn't in your department. 

People are competitive but in a collaborative way. They realize that stepping on each others' toes is not a sustainable source for success. Everyone is always trying to create situations where everyone benefits, not just themselves or their team. 

Highly recommend.","Can't say much. I've only had great experiences working here so far. Sometimes a new dog will accidentally go number 1... or number 2 in the office, but that's always cleaned up right away and people have a good laugh about it."
694,Procore Technologies,Full time: Great company with a great culture.,2015-01-07,5.0,Product,"Company really encourages you to grow personally and professionally. Personally: There is a lot of encouragement through benefits to be healthy as well (juice delivery to the office for a discount, in-house gym, MindBody card allowances, PTO, yoga, company sports teams, location of the office right on running trails, weekly healthy company lunch, open work environment, etc). and a fully stoked kitchen with stoked with carrots, celery, hummus, cereal, milk, peanut butter, beer, green tea, trail mix/granola bars, chips, sandwich supplies, coffee, and more. They also host company outings (hiking, hockey games, etc. depending on your department). They always encourage you to learn and grow from the managers. It doesn't seem that anyone (including Tooey) has a closed door policy. I feel like I can walk up to anyone with my questions at any time.","Some of the benefits that they used to have (like quarterly raises) have been abolished due to the growing company. However, they have also added benefits since the rapid growth as well (MindBody cards)."
695,Procore Technologies,The best company I've ever worked for,2015-01-07,5.0,,"This is by far the best company I've ever worked for.  I'm surrounded by smart, driven people who want to help the company succeed.  Senior management is approachable and makes an effort to ensure that Procore is a great place to work while also emphasizing individual and team performance.  An example of some perks of working at the corporate office: free snacks & drinks as well as beer for after work, you can bring your dog, unobstructed ocean views and huge glass windows all around, and weekly catered lunches.  Those are all nice to have, but the best part of Procore is the people.","I'm really nit-picking here, but sometimes people stick to their own department instead of branching out to meet new people in other departments.  To encourage everyone to get to know each other, the company started a program where they will pay for your lunch if you invite someone from the company you don't know for the purpose of getting to know them better."
696,Procore Technologies,Great company,2015-01-02,5.0,Intern,"Nice people, product is good, company growing rapidly","isolated. most of the interns are from one school, UCSB."
697,Procore Technologies,Wonderful experience; highly recommend,2014-11-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company culture and values are the most appealing pros. Excellent accountability and ownership, and encouragement and support.",Very few to no cons so far
698,Procore Technologies,Great culture!,2014-06-05,4.0,,Procore is located right on the coast with amazing views of the ocean.  Everyone is willing to hep each other out.  There is no micro managing.  People are happy and excited to come to work each day.  The software we sell really helps our clients.,"It can take a long time to start making good money.  There is a ton of information to learn because you need to know about the industry, construction, which is pretty complicated.  They like to bring people in as interns and other lower positions and then its up to you to work your way up.  The onboarding process is probably 2-3 months"

701,Procore Technologies,Great Working Experience at Procore,2014-05-08,5.0,Mobile Engineer,it's an open environment so basically you can walk up to anyone and ask questions. I think that kind of openness really promotes efficiency.,Not identified any so far.
702,Procore Technologies,Great place to work!,2014-05-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Super friendly environment, free lunch on Wednesdays, open-door policy, and dog-friendly. You can't beat the location and weather.  Lots of hiking trails along the coast for runs or walks.  In-house gym.  CEO and President are approachable and hands on. We all work hard and are encouraged to have fun.  Great lines of communication.  Company thinks wisely about how to spend its resources.",No sick days or personal days given.

- Young and intelligent employees
- Rapidly growing company, so there is a lot of opportunity
- Procore is focused on the well-being and happiness of all employees!",No cons that I can think of!
704,Procore Technologies,It Doesn't Feel Like Work,2014-05-07,5.0,Engineer,"The people, the environment, the tasks, none of it feels like work, it is just fun. Cannot believe how much I have learned in the short time I have been here.",I get distracted with the ocean views and like to be outside as much as possible.
705,Procore Technologies,I love Procore's relaxed environment.,2014-05-07,5.0,Tech Support,"Relaxed,

Play hard work hard mentality,
great boss
great co workers,",Sometimes an issue can be out of your hands and it can be frustrating
706,Procore Technologies,Loyalty is rewarded,2014-05-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone has similar levels of energy and enthusiasm for a common goal. The executive team is readily available to help anyone in the organization. Lastly the mission, vision, and values are not meaningless and reflect the real reasons we all show up to work every day.","Salary is still low and not competitive, though improving. Opportunities for advancement seem less available than in the past. Lastly, the company will need to provide 401k matching, family health insurance, etc... to stay competitive on the comp, especially as the average age of employees is increasing."
707,Procore Technologies,"Here's a project, go for it !",2014-05-06,5.0,,"Relaxed supervision, driven people, fun people, successful .",Sometimes things get said and are not followed through on.
708,Procore Technologies,Great place to work and learn,2014-05-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,There is a solid mixture of fresh young grads and experienced young professionals creating a great learning environment for new hires. The construction knowledge gained while working here isn't necessarily the most valuable but the overall business lessons you learn while fulfilling your responsibilities and interacting with people in different roles with completely different sets of responsibilities are huge.,"The construction industry as a whole moves slowly (projects take a long time), is inherently distrustful (there is a finite amount of profit on a project and everybody wants the biggest slice possible), and is rarely forward thinking (construction is 3-7 years behind other sectors technologically) . Procore cuts against this grain so friction is inevitable."
709,Procore Technologies,An opportunity for growth,2014-05-06,5.0,Key Account Manager,There's a lot of autonomy and management expects you to just get the job done and do it well.  Everyone has a voice and can help guide the future of the company.  It's a great community.  The work is interesting and challenging.,"Procore is still growing rapidly, and as such, sometimes processes break down.  But overall, the processes are still much better and less bureaucratic than most companies."
