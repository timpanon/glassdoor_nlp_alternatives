The leaders allowed us the freedom to take care of the work as we best see fit. Other employees take time to help you. Everyone was great to work with, and I genuinely enjoyed coming to work on Monday. 

Work on cutting-edge technology reaching many millions of people.

Flexible PTO is better than many other large tech companies and allows for more flexibility and peace of mind. On-campus benefits such as gym, cafeterias and coffee shops are great. 401 (k) match, ESPP program and donation matching are good. Vesting schedule is 3 years instead of the usual 4. San Diego is a great place to be and vastly better quality of life than the Bay Area and LA.

Once pandemic remote work ends in April, they plan to allow a hybrid work approach where you only need to come in two days per week. Depending on your team, this might be even more flexible. This is a much better policy than Apple's.

The business outlook for Qualcomm is bright. They are the inventors of 5G and are expanding into strong new markets such as auto. The acquisition of Nuvia will lead to chips that beat Intel and AMD.

Work with very smart and diverse people. There is so much going on at Qualcomm that you can always find a different team doing something that interests you.

The CEO is an industry genius and gives candid Q&As during quarterly all hands. 

Dev environments are usually Unix-based.","As with any large company, culture can vary between groups and teams. You can't generalize for a company of this size. 

Being a chip company means that most teams will not formally allow fully remote work once the pandemic ends. They expect you to report to an office because your work will likely involve interfacing with hardware of some kind.

A minority of especially entitled employees suffer from ""we aren't Google"" syndrome and choose to complain and moan that the (already great) benefits and compensation aren't as stratospherically high as one or two other tech companies. Ironically, expect to hear these same employees also complain about ""morale.""

Employees outside of the San Diego HQ miss out on some of the benefits that come with being at a main campus.

The annual review process is time consuming and basically shuts down the company for one week."

Managers aren’t given any training, and employees are told career development is their responsibility. 

If you just want a job you don’t need to care about, this is probably fine for you. But Qualcomm is where people’s dreams of career advancement and development go to die."

- Qcom internal tools suck.
- If you have counterparts at different geo locations, work life could be difficult sometimes. While it's advantageous to have team spread out across multiple locations, it's very important have proper etiquette here.

Qualcomm as a brand is big on your resume.","The local management is excellent at trying to trick employees into thinking they are compensated well and learning a lot. Also they are not transparent.

No learning. Almost everything you do in Qualcomm Singapore is re-use from Qualcomm US. As such, there is no skill you are picking up. You will be in difficult situation with a lack of skills to move around, and suddenly in a position where there is too much to learn in too little time.

There is too much work, and the compensation is does not match that. 

Also, doing so much work, you will never have personal time to develop skills. And you are not going to develop any skills at work either. There are tools that are used (not developed by you), tests that are run (not developed by you), and data that is collected and shared to other teams (not analyzed by you).

Overall, if you are looking to learn, this is NOT the place to be.
Skills are very important, so dont expect to pick any here.

Last but not least, people tend not to share things with you, and that hinders progress. Not a collaborative environment, within teams. Across teams, it is collaborative, because the company cannot function otherwise."

- Decent salary with yearly review
- Good company culture, good people, very little red tape compare to other companies","- Wage increases and bonuses are based off of an opaque algorithm (based off of inputs from your yearly review). Qualcomm simply offers you an increase off of this algorithm and does not allow you to negotiate at all.
- Qualcomm also gives out large sums of RSU’s instead of cash bonuses. This is supposed to incentivize you to stay with the company and work to increase the stock price, but ultimately it’s a way for them to have you chase a golden carrot for the rest of your career. You essentially lose large amounts of money if you end up quitting, and the value of your bonus is tied to the price of the stock which is subject to fluctuations in the stock market.
- It is unlikely for you to end up in a high level position as there are too many people at the company for substantial growth
- Qualcomm uses ancient custom software, and in general has a terrible development environment that makes the job unbearable
- Because of the bad development environment, a lot of the work ends up being administrative, rather than being

I have no idea how I was even hired. I walked into their headquarter’s lobby to use the bathroom on my way to enlist in the Navy down the street, and I wound up running a logistics meeting for three members of the board forty minutes later. Crazy how a little bathroom chit-chat can change one’s life.","There are some real pieces of doo-doo still around from the old days. These people are still calling native americans “indians”. Get with the times, folks. 

Also, the company slashed my snack budget by 80% Yoy, and I’m obviously the one who approves the final budget (CEO). Somehow they still snuck that past me. I found that petty. Technically, it’s insubordination. And sure, I do have an affinity for rare juices that often times are flown in from abroad - but it’s super rare and classy juice. Basically an investment. I’m talking flavors of kool aid and capri sun you’ve never heard of, as they were never released to the public. Some billionaire russian oligarch bought the rights to these secretly flavored capri sun for his children, and capri sun corporate said, “heck yea, we’ll take the money up front, we’ll just give the public a clear version of fruit punch and call it a day”.
That’s the kind of juice I was getting my hands on. Collector level goods. And for my own colleagues to go behind my back and say, “No more fine-juices”… it feels like a knife to my heart. I still had enough of a budget to get a solid snack rotation in the works, but it was never the same as the good times: fine-juices on tap in my office, a few small chocolate fountains, and a 24/7 salad bar. Rarely used, but it definitely made me feel healthier just having it around. 

At the end of the day, the snack budget cuts killed my motivation to remain employed at Qualcomm. That, and they discovered I never graduated from college."

It was a fun, great place to work, and a highlight of my career while I was there. The office building where I worked has been completely dismantled and no longer bears the Qualcomm logo.","The only real downside is that if top management makes a poor business decision, which is something that every business faces from time to time, everyone suffers, but the bad stuff rolls downhill and the ones making the lousy decisions stay on, but thousands of others lose their jobs, which is what happened to my job and over a thousand others.

- Upper Mgmt tends to blame their many ineptitudes on the lower ranks instead of taking responsibility for their unrealistic timelines which causes line managers to work their employees longer hours (working 50-65 hours a week [sometimes more if on the embedded or testing side of the house] is not uncommon even during COVID)"

1749,Qualcomm,"Overall, a great company",2020-12-09,4.0,IT Engineer,"As someone in the field of IT, Qualcomm is a great place to work overall. The company is massive and there's a lot of things to do and a lot of directions you can go. There's great great opportunity to learn and the company is definitely trying to keep up with latest trends; we are frequently among the first to try out new products and one of the earlier adopters of new protocols and technologies out in the field. If you truly enjoy what you are doing and want to get ahead, Qualcomm definitely provides you with the tools to do so. 

Recent reorg in IT has made work-life balance better, and the shift to a flexible work schedule seems to be permanent, which is awesome.

Decent benefits.","Overall compensation is a bit below market rate for the region, though pay increases the past few years have been well above average, maybe a result of the company settling the lawsuit with Apple and prevailing over the FTC.

The large scale of the company and it's monolithic structure can be frustrating at times to deal with. Sometimes difficult to find out who is in charge of what. Work sometimes gets bogged down as there can be many groups that require approval to implement. Large size of teams sometimes allow situations where certain employees can get away with doing bare-minimum work while others pick up the burden. The term ""rest-and-vest"" is used derisively here, and many employees are just waiting to retire."

1864,Qualcomm,Freshers (Caution),2020-10-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"No pros for a fresher except their mid-day free lunch. 

If you join as a fresher, assume your life is doomed ( They will take your confidence away. And make you feel like a slave in addition to the hostile environment they provide to you). If you want to join in this company, you better have an experience of 2-3 years and take their senior engineer role. Don't ever take their 'Engineer' or 'Assosciate Engineer' designation

Now, If you think I am writing this only because of my poor academic profile or having one bad experience in the company. Remove that from your mind. I cracked JEE with a rank below 500(gen. category), and I am one of the topper in my batch during my stay in IIT. And in Qualcomm, I worked in one of the best team (which is a emerging). I have been a crucial cog for some time as well.","Caution(freshers -don't join): Don't sway away by their no. 1 position in the processor market
""From 'making freshers feel hostile or not fit for the role given' to 'giving lots of work on a single day expecting to be like a senior'"" - They do all these to a fresher.

Now, I am writing this only to caution freshers. They have zero tolerance to you, and once they feel you are lagging in some topic, they have this culture to not assign the work that you are lagging(they don't make you learn. Instead, they expect you to not lag every day, even if you are sick. And you need to fake if you want to be successful). Once they feel that you are bound to move out of the company, even-though it's after an year(u r thinking to move), they stop giving you work and make you feel stupid to be in the company. 

They will treat freshers with no respect. They will make freshers work like a slave (just like the ancient feudal system, here leads and managers are feudal lords and their juniors are their workers, who are bound to work for their lords). 

Freshers don't stay in this company for more than 2 years. They will get zero knowledge about the industry, if managers feel the fresher is bound to leave in such a manner(Managers will somehow make sure of this by not exposing you to the state-of-the-art). You need to be a fake of yourself to survive in this place (ironically, HRs want employees to be themselves and not a fake). You need to make your manager believe that you will stay in this company for your life-time(literally, lifetime). You need to fake in every meeting that you have understood the presenter's theory. If you question them, if he is your senior, then he will get angry and not give you work. Upper manager don't take you or your work or your ideas seriously. They make you feel you deserve a low-grade work and will take your confidence away.

I have experienced everything from being a worthless cog to becoming a crucial cog and again becoming a wortheless cog in the team after a while due to some personal reasons. But, one thing I can say is that I faked every minute, every day in this company, and faking in this company is taken as a success trait (for all the employees). As a fresher, my ideas were questioned in an illogical way by my seniors. Though after a while, they implemented the idea, my lead took the credit for implementing it (such an inhumane political act. The culture in this company itself is more political than hardwork. 

Company lives on hard-workjng people, but gives credit to political people ( from money to power). They will say they are crediting the management, because they are the one's who manages you. And you need to fake that you are in a complete agreement with this view.

I once again urge freshers(especially IITians) to not join this company. Along with your overall confidence and self-respect, you will also lose your health and will be prone to some life-style diseases (Such a hostile culture for an immature fresher)."

New merit review system removes manager ability to individually reward high performers (it is all decided by compensation team).  High performers are given minuscule salary increases below cost of living increase; how does this

Really fun technical problems, engaging challenges, and lots of intelligent people to work with. Good opportunities for learning and growth, though dependent on where you are in the company. The pay is great, though the benefits have been declining slowly, but overall compensation is pretty good.","When I started at Qualcomm, they were on the Forbes Top 100 Companies to work for list. They haven't been back since, and it's clear why: they stopped treating their employees as a valuable asset, and instead seem to be treating them as expendable assets. I've watched almost half my team go to other companies, but no one in management seems to be panicking like they should be.

Qualcomm seems to have no common processes, nor the flexibility to let small groups decide their own processes. ""Agile"" and ""Scrum"" are words that are used without any of the actual benefits of those processes. The inefficiency in my group alone is staggering, and proposing improvements gets opposition from the 10+ year veterans who think they're still working at a scrappy startup company. 

Which leads to the other thing: Qualcomm is an enormous company with tons of revenue, but there are still, for some reason, pockets of the company (or maybe it's universal, for all I know) that act like it's a startup where everyone needs to put in ridiculous hours all the time. If Qualcomm can't meet their deadlines with people working normal hours, then that's a management issue, not employees not working hard enough. There are times when long hours over a short, pre-determined period can result in huge efficiency gains, and that can be worth it. But when it's considered a negative on your performance  review that you're unavailable on weekends, while the rest of your work is stellar... well, it makes sense that people (those who could) would try to find a more sane work environment."

It's spirit of innovation upon which it was founded still resides with many of the employees, especially at headquarters. It continues to be the leader in mobile technologies--modems and connectivity like 3G, 4G and the coming 5G. Qualcomm treats its employees very well and is generous in terms of salary and benefits.","The company is in a bit of turmoil due to the on-going external attacks regarding its Licensing business, which delivers the lion's share of the company's profitability. In addition, te on-going delay in the acquisition of NXP, which was to help the company expand its footprint and TAM, has slowed the company's momentum. Note that the delay was due not to the company's short-comings, but by international politics, as China is the one remaining region to approve the acquisition. This challenge, combined with the on-going lawsuits over its licensing practices with Qualcomm's leading customer, Apple, has blended into a difficult, perfect storm for the management team."

3169,Qualcomm,Avoid This  Sinking Ship,2018-06-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,1.  Pay is above average for the area & benefits are comprehensive.,"1.  Incredibly political atmosphere fosters hostility and resentment among employees.  Many of the ""Qualcomm lifers"" are there to ""rest and vest"" and are incredibly resentful of newcomers.
2.  Extremely top heavy company with excessive amounts of upper management who expect the few non-management employees to do all of their work for them with no assistance, or guidance.  Many Managers, Directors and VPs have no direct reports, and many departments have more management-level employees than not.
3.  The company panders to the short-term whims of their investors, at the long-term cost of the company.  One only needs to look at the on-going ""cost reduction initiative"" to save $1 billion to realize this.  The company announced the initiative a few days before being slapped with around $1 billion in regulatory fines.  Instead of adjusting their business model to prevent even further regulatory damages (QC has been slapped with major fines by Korea, China, and the EU to name a few), they insist on continuing with their controversial business model and instead choose layoff thousands of employees once more.  Additionally, as part of the initiative there are no opportunities for internal transfers resulting in a mass exodus of much of the company's young, top talent.

The bottom line:  I had high hopes for this company when I first started.  Unfortunately, Qualcomm is a sinking ship.  It's only a matter of time before all of their top young talent leave for another company that will do right by it's employees and investors, a company with a sustainable vision for the future, in addition to equitable pay."

There is a significant need for process improvement as one team works on one block and there is little communication or overlap so there are so many issues. They just let go of a lot of the people that were trying to fix this issue so it is not going to improve. This last round(s) of lay offs were not low performers as they have been in past. There were a very high  number of people who were recently promoted and or I know were getting 6/7's ie outstanding reviews and high performers and were working weekends and all hours like most of us. It was a wake up call that performance or even how much your job is needed has no impact that you can be cut to make wall street and executives happy - so the loyalty factor myself and other team members who know we can easily get other jobs have stayed but a lot of people if they are not on visas or other significant reason to stay are looking.

Free gym, good 401k match, good pay, decent bonuses and stock options, excellent health care (free), many employee programs, lots of tech training, nice campus, onsite cafeterias - you name it.","The company is a dinosaur. The management structure is deep with many redundant levels and political power structures. Decisions are not made for technical reasons but rather to benefit your Director or VP. There are periodic layoffs that tend to hit the lowest performers first, but they also lay off those who do not ""fit in"" (ie. anyone who actually has good ideas and is somewhat vocal.) Job performance is increasingly about perception rather than results. Career advancement varies great between departments. If you are lucky enough to have a benevolent manager you'll get promoted every few years, if you have a bully you'll be forever stuck in the same role (ie. 10 years or more) since you're not deemed worthy despite all your excellent reviews. Qualcomm could easily reduce headcount by 75% and still keep their core businesses: Modem and MSM.

People in this circle are one of the dumbest in the industry who will eventually blame their failure (almost every project is a certain failure) on employees.  Annoyingly, You will always be compared against these people by your manager.

Managers are the worst, at times abusive. Outright liars.

 - Excellent Compensation

3600,Qualcomm,Great Company - Undervalued,2017-11-25,4.0,Staff Engineer,Another US based company with same achievements would have leveraged the success much better than Qualcomm did. But it is also true it is one of the most gentlemanly company in US today. The management is candid and try to be honest. The compensation is above average. The quality of work is above average for most.  At least until very recently there was a sense of purpose - bigger than thy  - culture of excellence in hardware design.  Although the floodgate of lay off has opened two years back - company is still one of the best in the world.,"Two main problems:
1. As the company is now middle aged - it is top heavy. At Staff and Sr. Staff Level opportunity of growth (in terms of quality and breadth of work) is getting limited by days. The attrition and frustration is increasing by days. Not long ago, about 5 years ago employees who went gaga about Qualcomm and were irritably proud and short sighted (most folks here only worked in Qualcomm and no other companies, possibly 80% of engineering workforce) about Qualcomm's achievement are now growling about almost everything. 

This is because of #2.

2. Company is trying to break free of its dependency on phone/modem business. Until that happens and revenue stream start to show that this phase will last."

The IT department at Qualcomm used to be world-class. They've outsourced it and nowadays it's a total waste of time; ""let me research that"" is a typical answer when you ask IT a question - total waste of resources. Laptop refreshers take 5+ years and engineers get stuck with old, outdated equipment. CEO & Jacobs each took $59 million in bonus a few years ago when employees were getting laid off. HR typically shows you their middle finger if you ask for a market adjustment (I'm at 92% according to them, and I asked for one - they gave me %0.1 raise ... yes, that's tenth of 1 percent). Initially when they downgraded the health plan a few years ago, the physical flyers that were mailed to us read something along the lines of ""the details of your health plan UPGRADE""... downright twisted. All that said, HR is making promotions beyond Staff level very difficult to impossible - good luck with that career growth if you join"

People are leaving, at least partially due to the large amount of work, endless meeting, late night conference calls and etc. Meeting scheduled for 1 or 2 hour usually ends up taking more than four hours in the evening time with Asian team. Don’t expect to take fallibly responsibility such as pick up kids from school and etc if you work in the hardware ( especially the chip) team.

When people are leaving, no new resource is in and the people retain has more in his plate, until he got burn out and also decides to leave, this forms a poor loop..

Too complicated design flow. Even re-use an IP and doesn’t make any change, the long checking list from design review is impossible to finish during normal hours, not talking about new IP development. Mid management continues to add items on the checking list to address new poped up bugs in product, without adding new resource, they just want to make sure new items are added that can catch the bug, don’t care how much more execution work added on engineers. And they don’t ever consider some items on the check list is not necessary and can be removed/replaces by the new added ones. The results are the list getting longer and longer, engineers who execute the work are more and more overloaded, until burn out.

Compensation is, if not poor, at least not good. Compensation is competitive if compared with average semiconductor industry, but since Qualcomm looks itself as tier one semiconductor company, HR should compare the compensation with top companies such as Apple, Broadcom, TI and etc. Before joining QCOM, I worked for another large IC company in a low cost state, my first year package after graduation is more than the first year at Qcom, when I already have couple years experience. Ironic, right? At 2015 year end, after one year hard working, bonus is only 3 digit number, yes, you read correctly... this is in San Diego, a high living cost place."

2. 110 rs. daily free food
3. Adequate medical insurance
4. Team outings","1. Bureaucracy and politics
2. Management is so crude and no matter how talented you are and how much you work. They will promote you only after completing 3 years and more.
3.   Yearly review cycle and that's also not sure how much hike you will get as it depends on overall earnings which are shrinking year by year in competitive mobile chipset market.
4. Huge work load. you take one week leave and management thinks you were not working from last 6 months.
5. Learning areas are very shrink and regular work load is more. which will make you tire and unfit to outside world job market.
6. Most of the teams has no coding work, So you will forget all the programming knowledge and while looking for new job, you will have to study all your programming basics again.

3834,Qualcomm,Do not pursue employment at Qualcomm,2017-07-15,1.0,IT Engineer,Past reputation.  If you enjoy spending 50% of your time in conference rooms without windows that smell of mold filled with broken stained chairs and tables that are falling apart - this is your company!  Company looks great from afar but once you actually start working it's a different story.,"Qualcomm will own you.  They will state in your legal documentation that you are free to do what you want on your own time as long as it doesn't conflict with Qualcomm business but if you do you will be fired without notice.  Qualcomm wants you to be Innovative, but if you do so on your free time, they will fire you for even working on a simple free app for a cell phone that has nothing to do with their business.  

Their pay is low and their health insurance used to be good but deduct 5k from your salary since they now have a 5k deductible before you get any benefit from their health plan.  

You will be given little or no opportunity to progress your career as promotions as they are issued out as a popularity contest.  If you do a great job, work late hours, but don't interface with outside teams you won't even get a chance of being considered for promotion.  Leave the company and come back a few years later and they may hire you at a better title, that's really the only way.

You will be required to work overtime as everyone at Qualcomm is.  Qualcomm only allows their time tracking to show 40 hours a week (I can only imagine for liability purposes) so even if you work your butt off you won't be able to prove it.  Qualcomm hires a lot of people coming from other countries and works them to death.  When employees finally figure that out, they leave which is why Qualcomm has such a large turnover.  

Not a great experience at all."

4006,Qualcomm,Family Company Turned Sweatshop.,2017-03-21,2.0,Senior Engineer,"You get to sample a little bit of everything as a design/analysis engineer. The technologies that Qualcomm is involved in are cool and you get an opportunity to see where the electronics industry is headed in the future. I would say there's a lot of flexibility and job training, depending on what team you're on. There are really smart people at this company...for now. If you're in it for U.S. citizenship it seems that their immigration support is great, but you will work for it. 

The pay is okay compared to most companies.","The CEO is absolute GARBAGE and so are most of the SVP's. They don't know what they're doing with this company. The culture is dead, benefits are going downhill, engineers are no longer motivated to work, and top talent is leaving. Not to mention the CEO did nothing when immigration was threatened and he paid himself $60.7M during the year of layoffs. The previous CEO cared about his workers, this current one does not. 

The cultural downturn is a drag on your work ethic because everyone is moping around. Teams are now hoarding information in fear of being let go. They're acquiring companies left and right and the jobs are moving overseas. I honestly would say unless you're in it for the H1B and U.S. citizenship, run far FAR away if you have another offer in hand. 

Projects get cancelled before they're completed, even if QC is trying to enter a viable market. I think the company is however large enough that it will survive. They're not opening reqs, so if 10 people from your team leave and there were 20 people to begin with, you're stuck with the work of those 10 people.  Apparently when Paul and Erwin Jacobs were running the company it was more family oriented and the employees were valued.

If Intel catches up to QC's modem technology or they lose the Apple lawsuit, the company is dead. That's sort of a scary thing considering how they're investing billions into it as well. The constant threat of layoffs and lack of perks that other tech companies provide will add way too much stress to your life that it's best just not to care much about your work, which means your career won't grow as best as it should."

Because management only cares about meeting its numbers. They do not care if they kill their staff in the process of doing so, by making them work insane hours and jump through hoops just to meet expectations. As long as they hit their goals and look good in front of their managers, they're happy. Management will lie to you about promotion potential from day 1 (interviews). They will keep dangling the potential to be promoted in front of you, just to get you to work harder for them. In the end, you (along with many others who were promised the same thing) will be sorely disappointed.

Management is terrible in this company. The place is heavily political and hostile. The environment inside the company is dog-eat-dog. For each person who gets a ""good"" performance review, an equal number of people must receive a ""bad"" performance review no matter how well they have done since people performance has to follow a bell curve distribution. This leads to cutthroat internal competition. Backstabbing within the team is encouraged and rewarded. My manager asked me blatantly to spy on my coworkers, find mistakes in their work, and write those things in reports behind my coworkers back since I am popular and respected among my peers. When I refused to do so, he threatened me that he will lower my performance and I will miss a promotion. I tried to look for another group to switch to within the company but failed. Switching groups via IOS is extremely difficult and almost impossible without the help of your manager, so if things aren’t so good between both of you then forget it, you better find job at a different company. 

HR folks are useless and liars, don’t ever think of going to them with a complaint. They will almost always give you the wrong advice and will contact your manager behind your back and tell him that you came to them with a complaint even if they promised it will be confidential. HR department is just there to protect the company from any possible lawsuits; they don’t give a damn about employees. HR is a useless department completely.  

If you don't want to get chewed up and spit out - and that can happen at any time - don't work there. The pay, which is below average, and benefits aren't worth the stress; it can make you physically ill. If you want to be a “good” performer by their standards, you are constantly stressing about being visible, not upsetting the wrong people and trying to stay ahead of your peers by any means, and if you have ethics, generally you don't do well. I know people who have done some truly unbelievable things to get ahead. If you aren’t cool enough then you will be singled out and targeted even by people you don’t work directly with. Be careful; don’t let yourself to be an escape goat for their failure.  People advance in this company by backstabbing and connection with corrupt middle/upper management. You have to be your manager’s favorite pet to get a promotion. A bad manager can really prevent your career growth no matter how well you performed or what other people think of you.

The performance review process at Qualcomm is entirely flawed and completely subjective. Managers have the right to veto and override all 3rd-party feedbacks on an employee. They use this to create phony PIPs to eliminate anyone who dares to question their practices. 

They hire a lot of fresh college grads with PhDs to do menial bench test work and treat them like indentured servants because most of them are foreigners and they need visa sponsorship to stay in the country. Qualcomm likes to hire PhDs straight out of college to make sure that they don’t have previous work experience so they don’t know that the workplace could be better elsewhere, and work them 24/7 in a killing environment. What they say in the interview is completely different from what the actual job is, a lot of sugar coating. The work is boring, repetitive, requires basic programming skills or not at all, copying and pasting. Basically the positions are low level engineering job that a technician with an associate degree can perform, however the internal policy requires that the job is filled with recent grads holding advanced degree. Utilizing your knowledge is frowned upon because that threatens your lead/manager’s image and makes him look weak. Most likely your work will be stolen by your lead.  Managers are unappreciative, insulting and downright rude. If you have a PhD don’t waste your hard gained education or time here.
 
Foreign nationals in the company from India and China alone constitute more than 90% of the work force (diversity?!!). Those foreigners gang together, speak their own language in meeting rooms, labs, and hallways, and, shamelessly, hire and give promotions to their own kind. They hide work related information and keep the information within. They also gossip and share departments’ internal matters with their buddies in India and China. That creates a hostile environment for people who aren’t racially/ethnically related to the group members or not from the same region/village.

 Mid-level and upper-level management are insecure and totally useless and clueless, they are there just to collect status from the engineers who do the actual work. Those managers create a lot of useless meetings, wasting the engineers’ precious time, while spending the majority of their day resting and vesting.

The list goes on and on. That caused a few people to commit suicide by jumping from the 11th floor balcony in San Diego campus. That just shows how horrible the environment is for foreigners to kill themselves in a company that claims to be one of the best 50 companies to work for in the world! If you are well educated, have morals and values then think twice before joining this unhealthy environment. 

Working at Qualcomm feels like living in a third world country on an American soil."

3. Only some of the employees work. The rest are to send the status report to their bosses
4. Even the experienced people have no proper technical knowledge.

6. Racist place. All the people who come from a certain place group together and they don't like others
7.  Career stagnation. After sometime, you don't know how you can keep working on the same thing for the rest of your career

First of, they have many of their people leave good feedback here to cover up their terrible biz practices. So I would go to other websites and/or get hold of real people working at Q for more accurate info. Overall, don't expect a long term career since the good spots are already occupied by chinese and indian people who are horrible at mid to sir management. Dont expect to get rewarded properly for your time(a LOT of your time) and effort, and when it's time to let people go you are most likely the first since they protect the people in their small circles. They also hire many H1B to replace Americans and/or old people. It's still a bargain to hire young fresh H1B at even the American workers' price since they work extremely long hours so company get huge investment return out of them at the same price, and American workers simply wont work 60+ hours weekly regardless of pay. The reason why H1B work extremely long hours because Q threatens to not petition for H1B their green card unless they work extremely long hours so Q can get much greater investment return, and therefore there is no reason why they want to hire American workers even at the same price. So Green Card IS the ultimate leverage Q has against H1B and highly qualified American tech workers who can't find jobs taken by H1B."

- You will only gain ATE tester experience. You will get cornered into ATE and your career will not have other possibilities and you will get stuck in production manufacturing environments. 
Even though Qualcomm makes cutting edge technology, as a product test engineer your knowledge will be constrained and you will gain no knowledge of design, architecture etc.

- Great city to live in. But you will not have time to enjoy it. We got calls during weekends and also got calls around 3-4AM to resolve tester issues so that production will not stall. Qualcomm took no measures to arrange a night shift and if you don't answer the call, it will be noted in the system and you will get chopped eventually.

Generally good-natured people at the lower levels. Work that can occasionally be very satisfying in the end product, with a product and technology that is arguably fundamental to modern society.","Merciless workload, which is not a problem by itself, but in many roles, that hard work resulted in limited intellectual pay-off and recognition. In the 1-2 years leading up to when I left, the company was in a constant state of cost-cutting which meant a lack of people for the work to be done. This of course led to constant stress and long hours in an endless cycle of tape-outs, sampling dates, and process changes. In more than a few former colleagues, all this stress directly impacted health. 

For most roles, the overall company culture values quantity of work and expertise in a narrow set of skills vs. a diversity of experience and employee development, which makes it extremely difficult to move within the company. Applied to dozens of internal opportunities during my last 6 months when I wanted to try something new, but got only one interview. I consequently started to doubt my own abilities as an engineer until I was hired by an arguably more-prestigious employer, which made me realize maybe it was the Qualcomm (especially QCT/QTI) culture and not me."

Surprisingly sometimes few managers will ask you to stay on weekends and ask you to brush, take bath, and sleep in the office. They say breakfast, lunch and dinner will be provided.
Though facility is there to order food if you stay late few managers don't like to approve your order.
Again surprising thing is, few managers who have late night meetings they will go out to eat and come back to work, so eventually in that team you will finally stop ordering food even if you stay late because of work.
No manager asks you to stay late in the office, and at the same time you have to meet your deadline. If you miss your deadline couple of times that's it, you can search a job outside, no need to talk to them.
Few managers expect you to be superman, I mean even if you are new to that domain/project/team, from the day 1 they will expect from you an expert results even in design/architecture.
They over commit the dates to customers and force employees to meet the deadline.
They don't increase head count and don't give you time to learn and do the things.
In skip level meeting if you say anything, that's it you are done. Hope you may be scolded or you will have a discussion with your manager to understand that your understanding is wrong.
If you want to move another team, it's your dream will never come true. If you are so lucky you will get moved so easily."

2)Expectations are more, since your peers are living to work, you also have to live to work.
3)No training for tasks. You have to dive and swim. Cannot expect proper guidance to everyone.

Competitive total compensation in San Diego although benefits have been cut down significantly recently. (Compensation per unit hour is bad).","Favoritism has become the norm starting from hiring to assigning project tasks, and of course to promotions. 
Technical skills and knowledge has little value now. If you are technically sound and hard working/executing, but without the skills of buttering your bosses up, you won't reap any rewards these days. 
Introducing bugs and fixing them elevates visibility and is much more rewarding than doing quality work with no bugs at all. Complete U-turn from the original naming of ""Qualcomm"" as it derived from ""Quality Communications"".
Upper management is surrounded by cronies and they cronies sell mostly their own interests to them. They present others works as their own achievement. So, the engineers who are doing the actual job are rewarded very little or nothing compared to how much hard work and sacrifice they make. 
The upper management is out of touch from recent technologies and not motivated either. This is killing innovation and ingenuity here. Their and cronies narrow views have become the views of the company overlooking any other options/ides.
There are too many VPs and senior directors who do not contribute, but draws huge salary and benefits at the cost of salary/benefits to young and mid-level engineers. Career advancement is almost saturated.
Engineers are over worked days, nights, and weekends while the benefits go to others. Considering the long hours and weekend works, the compensation is not good at all."

Calls are then lost and must be chased daily for weeks before anything happens.
Director to President level managers all act like they are petrified of being fired and are much more worried about covering their rears and looking good than about actually solving any problems. Bucks get passed instead of issues being worked on, it's like being in a giant game of pass the parcel with the prize inside being a ticking bomb.
Promotions are rationed and handed out to favourites rather than on the basis of ability.
Everybody is terrified of making commitments in case they can't meet them, so rather than make a decision people call a meeting and try to delegate or escalate until they are off the hook.
San Diego is the centre of the universe, but don't have a clue about time zones and expect UK to work on their schedule then act all hurt if we don't want to routinely turn up to meetings scheduled at midnight.
Management keep saying ""no more headcount reductions"" rapidly followed by another round of sackings. Do they think we are too stupid to notice?

No choice in laptops (must be HP/ThinkPad) and even new hires are given recycled laptops.

Benefits aren't great anymore. Health benefits are still paid for, but if you need to do any sort of medical procedure, be ready to pay out of pocket until you hit the deductible.

No sense of brand ambassador. Management makes complaints about a certain company's phone line cutting into our profits, yet an entire row of employees is using that company's phones.

Talent pool is dry, people don't want to work at/for Qualcomm, so all the new hires are essentially leftovers from other hiring pools.

Work/life balance is a myth here, does not exist. Manager is constantly complaining about staying at work until 9-10pm as if they're hinting they want us to stay with them.

- A tough company for females!
- A Culture of Fear: an environment where high level executives decide it is OK to yell at everyone in every single meeting instead of leading by example and identifying the real problems that are occurring within Qualcomm.

Observation: Glassdoor has listed conflicting pros and cons for Qualcomm:
 pros 'good work life balance' and con 'bad work life balance'.

 It could be due to fake reviews from Qualcomm officials who are desperate to cover up. Speak to an actual employee working at Qualcomm before accepting an offer. Also each team is different.","- Steve, Paul and entire Management team has poor vision. They don't know they are not up to mark. They cannot visualize the future of technology. They are OUT of ideas and so now they have resorted to copying.
- As the company looses market, they are cutting costs everywhere and punishing employees.
- Due to a Poor Brand Image and lack of vision the products in a few years are going to suck more.
- The cream (best of the best engineer/other staff) are gone/leaving. What is left is un-qualified people who are highly political.
- Racism is high and each team is polarized with people from the same race.
- Beware if you are an engineer/senior/staff : Managers will use you and dump you after they get promoted.
- Poor Work Life Balance and Un-ethical colleagues.
- No bonus/RSU and promotions for 2016.
- Software Engineers can learn nothing at Qualcomm.

Unfortunately, there are a quite a number of poor managers who tend to promote people like them, resulting in more poor managers, but this is a common corporate problem that is not unique to Qualcomm.

The company is going through some rough times at the moment and is trying to modify their business as the mobile phone market matures.  This has resulted in reduced profits, which in turn has resulted in decreased bonuses and stock awards.  This action is completely understandable, and I do not fault them for having to do this.  Unfortunately, for certain employees whose overall compensation is heavily based on receiving stock, this has resulted in a compensation level that is no longer competitive with the market.

Engineers are paid much less than the Silicon Valley competition, execs paid more.

H1B program is being abused both to shackle immigrant employees and to depress wages.

Eagerness to work and being a solid contributor is taken for granted immediately. Promotion, pay raises based solely on number of years with the company not on performance, which drove out a lot of the brightest engineers.

Total compensation package is in a constant deterioration since the past few years.

Constant risk of being laid off with no potential reward to make up for the risk is something you have to accept

There are a lot of smart, talented, and energetic employees here who care a lot about the work they do.","While employees have shown their passion for the work they do and their commitment to Qualcomm, it has really started to feel like unreciprocated love.  Management has become very bottom-line driven, in many instances penny-smart, pound foolish, and it has sent a terrible message to employees that they are not valued.  When I moved across the company to join Qualcomm, it was a company advertised as one of Fortune's top 100 companies, and I was awe stricken by the fact they paid 100% of healthcare costs for employees and their families.  Neither of those things are true anymore, and the negative changes have piled up in the last 12-18 months (cuts to benefits, bonuses, stock, headcount reductions, reputation)."

I frankly don't understand the role of so called project engineers and project managers. In some money losing groups these folks outnumber engineers!
These folks are technically so poor, they don't have a future outside this company. But they are sitting here and drawing fat paychecks. Rampant favoritism in hiring and intra company transfers. I heard stories from some guys who moved from India that their buddies who had moved earlier and by now become managers, made it all too easy for them to be transferred to San Diego.

Very flexible work hours, most people get along very well, intra-team.","Easily the most mismanaged company on so many levels I have ever worked for, or are familiar with.  The practice of promoting from within, while honorable in intent is often disastrous in practice when it appears to have been based either on time-in-service or quasi-nepotism.

- Management is unstable and tends to pursue goals half-heartedly, then cheap-out, I've seen it happen a dozen times.  The 810 chipset fiasco is the latest in a long series of examples.
- Annoying history of advising management to go in a certain direction, almost getting fired for ""saying something crazy"", then whole company was forced in that strategic direction 3 months later by the good sense of outside competitors, it happened many times, my career was almost destroyed each time, especially after I was proven right.

I worked there for a total of 12 years, and the only way for an american to get promoted is to leave the company and then return in a different department.  It's astonishing that they can pay a senior engineer $130k but managers start at $180k, the company is top-heavy with slick, overpaid managers who contribute very little to the bottom line.  In my experience, you can get a great review when there is no money for bonuses and no stock available, but when there is something valuable on the table, it always seems to go to ""friends"" of management, and I mean that not in a good way ..."

5126,Qualcomm,"Mostly good, but lots of changes recently",2015-11-04,4.0,Staff Hardware Engineer,"The work environment in Raleigh is quite positive and collaborative.  This team started out small, so while we're under the corporate umbrella, the culture here is different than San Diego.  Sure, there are some politics, but those seem to occur mostly when dealing with corporate in San Diego.  

Qualcomm has always tried to compete with the big players when it comes to hiring, so benefits have been more in line with the Googles and Apples of the world than they have been the industry average.  Lots of small perks (free drinks, yearly picnic, etc) and the biggie--free insurance, even for the family.  These are quickly eroding, however. 

We get to do cutting edge engineering work without having to live in a city with a huge cost of living, and we make products we are really proud of.","Local perception is that Jana partners came in and wants to squeeze us for all we're worth then get out.  Layoffs didn't hit Raleigh too hard (yet) but some of our work was transferred to other sites, so rather than having a tight knit local team, we're spread across time zones.  That was the environment in my previous company and I don't prefer it.  The small perks are going away little by little--many of us watched this happen at previous companies and we know that once cost cutting starts it usually never stops.  Hopefully that won't happen here, but most of us assume it will.  Insurance is still free but starting next year pays out virtually nothing until you hit a (middle range) deductible.  

Overtime is generally expected.  I sometimes get ""vacation notices"" for people who will be out of town for the weekend.  A lot of people here are in the habit of working at least a little every day, and many of them work an excessive number of hours.  Hard to say if it's expected by management or just a self-imposed drive to keep up with everyone else, but it's way more normal here than at my last company.

Adding a little bit to address my ""culture"" rating below.  I gave it low marks because the culture of the company as a whole is ""California"".  Everything is CA-centric, and there is little effort put into making the ""satellite"" sites integrate into the corporate whole.  My previous company did a much better job of being a group of sites with similar culture throughout.  Qualcomm is CA all the way, and CA values are often at the extreme of the values of the rest of the country (example, we hear about saving water constantly, when it's really only an issue in CA right now).  The culture in Raleigh is mostly task oriented.  We get along, we work together.  We help each other out.  It could be better but for the most part it's very good."

The Company rested on it's market dominance for too long, and their IP advantage is no longer substantial in a commodity market where product cost is paramount.  The restructuring effort underway will result in being better positioned to succeed, but the old inefficient habits die hard.  The leadership is taking bold steps to implement change but it could take longer than it should to complete and expenses are still very high.  Ultimately the company will be able to weather the shakeout of weaker competitors in the mobile phone business and expand into new markets but it really comes down to smart leadership.  This group is pretty good so the future is probably a good long-term bet.",Slow consensus decision-making process hampers agility.  Some long-timers need to move on.

This despite the well known risks of depending on just two major customers for the bulk of its phone business. The results are now painfully obvious to see.

5301,Qualcomm,Company's culture if changing,2015-09-24,3.0,Business Development,"In past years, I would have given this company 5 stars in every category.  The past 2 years has been extremely difficult with many employees being laid off, most of them quietly without much fanfare.  Of course, there's the huge layoff that occurred in September where over 4000 will lose their jobs on November 20.  Overall, the company has been a wonderful place to work -- great benefits, smart people, unique culture, and a passion for innovation.  In recent years, because of change in executive management ranks, the company is losing its unique culture.  Due to the focus on cutting costs, the benefits have been scaled back significantly, the passion for innovation is not as infectious as it used to be, and it is clear the culture at the company is in transition.","People are afraid to lose their jobs.  People are grateful for surviving the latest reduction in force only to worry about whether or not they'll make the next cut.  After cutting its workforce by 15% in September-November time period, the remaining 85% of the employees at QCOM are asked to continue doing their jobs with fewer resources.  The competitive environment is tougher now, and it will be interesting to see whether or not this company will survive the long term."

The first in the form of a benefits cut that took our health benefit from one of the best in the country to one of the worst. The second in the form of the announcement that there are no more bonuses. The third in the form of the rest of the investing world recognizing that our business decisions are really bad and dumping our stock like a load of moldy garbage, causing us to fall nearly 50% since the moment the Jana Group bought us out and replaced our board's visionaries with spineless used car salesmen."
5306,Qualcomm,Prgram Management perspective,2015-09-23,4.0,Senior Program Manager,"As of a few years ago the company culture was collaborative, respectful, professional yet casual. The health benefits, bonuses, and the RSU grants were excellent.","The last few years the company culture has shifted to being more autocratic and new management in different areas has thrown the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to best practices and lessons learned. Some top level meetings are now chaotic and carried on in an unprofessional manner. Bonuses have been substantially reduced in the past two years, and the health benefits will be changing in 2016.

Fact: there is no opportunity to review upward... so assumption is that all mgrs are doing well. hope the next couple of workforce reduction rounds gets them out - it's a toxic environment. 

Steer clear - benefits will no longer be premier (high deductible and moving to banking your $$ for medical expenses), annual reviews starting next year (no longer twice yearly bonus, RSUs, raises), unlimited vacation (so they no longer have to pay you if they lay you off), limited sick (no longer allowed to take as many days), etc.

When I was first hired around 2008, the company was also going through tough times. In the economy at the time, nobody really knew what was happening. To hedge against things possibly getting worse, the company held off on giving bonuses for one review period. They had a meeting and explained the situation to the employees, and as a show of solidarity, the executive team all took a 25% pay cut. We respected this. Once things were more stable, not only did they bring back bonuses but they made the next one bigger than normal to make up for not giving one during the previous cycle.

The way the cuts are happening this time is very different. Basically, I would describe it as being penny wise and pound foolish. There is now an approval process to get an AA battery for a pager, a new laptop now requires VP approval, and sodas are being removed from conference rooms. They are cutting in ineffective, but visible ways, which is the worst way to go. Additionally, health benefits are set to decrease as of the first of the year.

I was given all the support I needed to do my job, and my managers did not micro-manage or ask for constant updates. I was given goals that helped me to grow, and if I needed advice, my managers would make themselves available to help. There are a lot of perks, especially working in the San Diego office, where there is a lap pool, volleyball, tennis, and basketball courts, multiple gyms, and also, now they have a new soccer field, etc. There are also lots of interesting conferences and lectures that are available for any employee to attend -- if you can find the time. My advice if you join Qualcomm -- take advantage of all the amenities!","When I first started at Qualcomm, it was still going through tremendous growth. Now the growth has stopped, and they are having to cut back. It will be a challenge for a company geared for growth to now have to pare down and transition to being cost-driven. I'm hopeful they will be able get back to more growth, but it seems it will be difficult since the cell phone market is mature now and seems to be at a plateau. They are trying to grow the adjacent markets, but only time will tell if they are successful.

It's a big company now, so engineers tend to get placed into very specific roles, and you might do generally the same thing unless you make a move. If you're looking to grow in your position or get a promotion, you will need to take initiative, be very motivated, and be patient."
5436,Qualcomm,Feedback from a long term employee,2015-08-20,4.0,Staff Engineer,A employee oriented company. As a market leader and pioneering company employees get opportunities to work on state of the art technology and tools. Apart from periods of intense work phase most of the time it provides good work/life balance.,Salary and other financial benefits is not very good compared to other comparable companies. It is unclear as to where the company is heading towards and the work spirit is increasingly going down.
5437,Qualcomm,Great Company,2015-08-19,5.0,Staff Systems Engineer,Qualcomm is a well-run company.  It gives its employees flexibility to explore new ideas while providing a general framework in which to get things done.

Good Benefits (although they are getting worse over time).
You work with really smart people.","They just announced 15% work force reduction (layoffs).
Politics, Politics, Politics.  If you want to get promoted you need to learn to play the political game very early. 
Culturally the company is stuck in it's old ways.  There was always a focus on ""out executing the competition.""  This sounds good on paper but results in a lot of short cuts and TONS of technical debt in both HW and SW.  This leads to further band-aids/hacks which just perpetuates the core issues."
5441,Qualcomm,Full-fledged member of the Cult of Shareholder Value,2015-08-18,2.0,,"Up until this point the engineers were extremely talented and knowledgeable.
Working on some of the latest technologies that are widely used throughout the world is very rewarding.","Uncertainty of job security (company is going to lay-off 1/3 of it's employees.)
Even the smartest engineers have a difficult time advancing due to extremely competitive review process.
Compensation is not very compelling.

The new CEO and CFO don't seem to be acting as though they are concerned about the long term health of the company. Activist share holders, that don't seem to understand how a company like Qualcomm really makes money, have recommended Qualcomm sell off all of its profit-loosing divisions and focus on its profitable patent business. In other words: Qualcomm will soon be the patent troll to rule everything in the cellular technology field, but will have sold the profit loosing divisions that develop all of the latest cellular technologies."
5442,Qualcomm,Still a great place to be,2015-08-18,5.0,,Great group of really smart individuals who are driven towards a common vision.  I've had the opportunity to drive my career myself which has given me tremendous success.,Getting ahead at Qualcomm requires an element of showboating; no one gets ahead by keeping their head down and doing good work.  This creates political tensions which can detract from the job at hand but I don't think this is unique to the company.

5528,Qualcomm,Senior Engineer,2015-07-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- had good benefits
- good salary, but probably less than what of comparable companies
- worked with nice people, at least in my group
- depending on your group, you could have a good work/life balance.","The work at Qualcomm is tedious and dull, not much unlike an assembly line. You will work on modifying legacy spaghetti code to add small new features. You will sit in front of a computer all day, answering never-ending emails and instant messages, in which people can't even properly write, saying things like ""qq R U in"".  Your mind will turn to mush as you quote Q-acronyms all day, and multi-task endlessly. You will click many buttons with your mouse. Is this how you want to spend 9-10 hours per day, 5 days per week?

Talent is not a prerequisite to work here, despite the propaganda stating otherwise. I believe this to be true for most ""tech companies"", particularly the large ones. You will be trained on Qualcomm's in-house tools and processes, and this will be the primary focus of your job. Anyone could work here.

Qualcomm claims to be an American company but hires very few Americans. Easily >95% of the engineers there are H1B visa holders. Most of the Americans they do hire are contract employees who receive no benefits at all; no vacation, no health insurance, no sick leave, etc. Qualcomm benefits from the American corpitocracy , which is funded by American tax payers, yet provides very little in return to American in terms of jobs. Well, perhaps they indirectly provide more service industry jobs. Also, Qualcomm hides billions of dollars overseas so as to not pay American taxes. 

Additionally, an IEEE study (and other studies) show that there are plenty of American engineers, meaning very few H1B visas are needed. So, as American colleges spit out more ""STEM"" professionals, with massive amounts of debt, fewer of them will be able to find jobs because of companies like Qualcomm. Who benefits from all of this? The financial sector does. 

Know that if you work here, you are contributing to the worsening state of things in the world. You are contributing to the increasing wealth gap between the 1% and everyone else. For example, while bonuses for engineers decreased every review cycle I worked there (despite increasing review ratings), executive pay skyrocketed. 

Let's think about what these large corporations like Qualcomm do. They take priceless ""commodities"" (at least in the corporate mind) of human lives and natural resources (plants, animals, minerals), and convert them into pointless gadgets in exchange for worthless currency. This currency has value only because people agree it does. Additionally, corporations exist only because people agree they do. We spend our lives working for a fictitious entity that makes the world a worse place, in exchange for fictitious currency. It is silly. Don't do it. 

If you don't mind doing tedious mind-numbing work (updating XML and spreadsheets, spending <10% of your time writing code), because you get ""fat"" paycheck, then work here. If you don't mind knowing that you are trading your life away in order to make the rich richer, then you will like it here. I

And, now Qualcomm is laying off 15% of its workforce, and bringing hedge fund members onto the Board. Is this really where you want to work? 

How about instead, you live an authentic life. Let's quit believing in imagined realities: the corporate people, the fiat currency. Instead, live locally and for each other. Our society worships corporations (imagined constructs) above what is real. Quit doing it, and make the world a better place. If we quit believing in them they will die, not unlike faeries, such as Tinkerbell."

Good pay.","Under the new CEO, there has been a company-wide mandate to make sure that everyone is titled and paid ""appropriately"".  While that may sound relatively innocuous, in reality it seems to have been an excuse to cut costs via layoffs.  It also seems to have lead to quite a bit of micromanaging, which is quite a change from how things used to be - employees used to have more freedom to get their jobs done as they saw fit.

Add in an increasing number of seemingly pointless status meetings, and the job started to feel less about pleasing customers and getting things done than it did about pleasing management and focusing on process over results.

Reviews are done not so much on an individual basis, but rather on an ""enforced curve"".  All people of title X are measured against each other, and there's only an allowance for a certain percentage of those with title X to receive merit increases, bonuses, or RSUs.

Great travel benefits while you travel for work, I heard that’s changing too.  Great health benefits, $0 deductible, $10 copay for doctor visits, $10 for medication; I hear that’s changing starting 2016.   Pretty good pay, but if you work 60 to 80 hours, it isn’t worth that much.  Free gym, that’s still the same, yay!","Some serious non-sense meetings.  I don’t think I have seen as much time wasting and mud slinging meeting as the ones that Qualcomm have.  Decisions need to be “socialized” in a “democratic fashion.”  I can feel my stomach tighten at these buzzwords.  The managers were not big on taking responsibility, so it’s my responsibility to convince all participants.  Sounds great in theory, but in practice, this just means you got to do the hard work to convince more people, or one week later, you are sitting through another meeting talking about the same thing.  I rarely see meetings produce to-do list and action items. Most meeting last 30 mins or an hour, even though they really could be shortened.  I’ve seen level 3 engineers’ days being fully booked with meetings, and sometimes double booked, so they better do work during nights and weekends.  But really, the worst part of meetings is mud slinging shouting matches that occur when some features break.  One time we had frequent crash in a handset; it was traced to a watchdog condition.  One of the conditions that might trigger it was a full heap.  So we reasonably asked if the responsible parties could check memory leaks.  I could swear someone was getting bloody murdered by the loud shouting and responsibility deflecting.  Waste of time all around.  

Stodgy, antiquated, monotonous software strategy!  I worked in QIS (Qualcomm Internet Services), a purportedly web services division of the company.  But there was much attitude against integrating emerging practices and technology.  We even had a meeting back in 2013 from legal telling us not to participate in open source forums (not code contribution, but just Q/A forums), not to sign an 3rd party agreements (which effectively means not to download Android SDK, iOS SDK) without informing the legal department first.  Of course, the bigger disappointment is that even when I was leaving, I hardly saw modern practices like continuous delivery, continuous integration, DevOps, continuous testing, etc, etc.  Each handset software release takes weeks in straight waterfall (dev -> test -> integration -> release).  Even with a lengthy schedule, software often ship with major undiscovered bugs.  I used to snigger at the term “feature complete release;” because it might as well mean crash after 5 minutes.  I feel senior employees at Qualcomm San Diego can really benefit a lot by taking an externship at lean startups and actually learn something about efficiency and process automation.  

Duplication of efforts.  Where do I begin on this one…  There are often multiple internally developed or internally available tools for you to do the same thing, but good luck to you if you need help setting it up.  To give you an example, I needed to do some integration testing with some QC partner corporations.  One of the tasks is automated dialing and torture testing.  Supposedly there were 3 tools available for me to use.  One was developed by a separate QC division; and it was obviously meant to do some serious heavy lifting.  I couldn’t use it because our liaison couldn’t get the help, and the customization effort to get it to use look into LTE protocol instead of CDMA was high.  Another tool was developed by an outside consulting firm; we couldn’t use it because it didn’t have the right driver.  Yet another internally developed tool was not used for a reason or another I couldn’t remember.   So I had to write a script to do automated dialing.  Just to think, 3 separate groups got credit for developing their tools (and got credit), then moved on, and never thought about supporting them again.  Apparently my experience was not unique.  

Slow pace of advancement.  As a lot of people have mentioned before, doing hard work for long period of time often don’t get you the advancement.  Fixing software bugs and pushing out new releases from 9AM to 9PM day after day will maybe get you to the next level after 5 years.  Majority of Qualcomm departments are not growing, so your advancement opportunity is limited.  Much of the employees at Qualcomm are pretty young, so advancement through attrition is really not an option.  When I was quitting, I was offered advancement to stay.  This really doesn’t inspire loyalty."

Worse, HR seems to insist on hiding this, trying to make it seem like things are actually being changed in our favor. Very sleazy feeling watching them claim added benefits when you can easily calculate that it will cost you more money. 
- Employee morale is plummeting and the executives seem completely disconnected and unaware
- HR is rigid and inflexible, so it doesn't matter how you perform or what your background is, you have to follow their timelines and structures. This makes it feel like hard work isn't rewarded and encourages people to just skirt by.

- E-mail hell. Nobody uses proper bug tracking software, release software, and documentation is poor and scattered everywhere, so everyone e-mails everyone with everything and you end up with hundreds of e-mails a day, maybe 1% of which you actually care about. It wears you down after a while

- This is not a software company; they're a hardware company that writes driver software. So expect poorly written and poorly designed code written with a ""just make it work"" mentality

- Too many products and little-to-no code reuse, so instead of focusing on having one good codebase, you'll end up with 50 crappy ones

- Everyone is really stressed and tense, so the culture around the office is not the most pleasant

5611,Qualcomm,Engineer,2015-06-15,4.0,Engineer,Good company. Challenging work. Great Products,Hierarchical management. Work life balance.
5612,Qualcomm,Suffering from big corporation symptoms in various ways,2015-06-15,3.0,Software Engineer,"1. Good starting point for new grads, easy interview;

2. Good pay in San Diego area;

3. Free on-site gyms;

4. Good benefit and on-site hospitals;

5. Nice and talented people to work with, and you can learn a lot of new things.","1. You will regret for being hired so easily and cheaply in a couple of years;

2. Low pay with trivial increase/promotion opportunities compared to the Bay Area, while San Diego's rental home and real estate markets aren't cheap at all, compared to the Bay Area; you save $10,000 per year at maximum in renting a home at San Diego, but your annual salary is at least $30,000 less than your peers in the Bay Area, and every one can do the math;

3. Workload is heavy all the time, and that is the way how the Project Management wants to hire you. You won't have time for exercising in the gyms;

4. Benefits will be significantly cut starting from 2016. In the past, $0 out from the pocket; the 2016 deductible plan requires self-pay for the first a few thousand dollars. The company seems to encourage senior people to leave by themselves and discourage employees to take sick leave and see a doctor by announcing this benefit change;

5. Apart from those good people, there are too many bad people as well. Some guys refuse to collaborate every time, and they just blindly throw issues to other teams and wasting other people's time, even without doing a simple checking by themselves; some guys with Electrical Engineering background are really bad in their coding styles. Those poorly written implementations create a whole lot of traps for other people, and they are creating bugs everyday for their owners too;

6. A lot of politics. When an issue comes, every team declines their responsibility. A poor guy with a politically powerless leader will usually make the fix and gets blamed at last.

7. Too complex and unscalable systems with crappy design. Every team stays in their own technical area, and do not know what other teams are doing. This partially contributes to the politics mentioned in (6).

8. Greedy and unrealistic scheduling with no software engineering methodologies. For instance, to bring up a feature with teams from layer-1, layer-2 and layer-3, and a high layer has functional dependency on a low layer. If the water-fall method can be used, i.e. let layer-1 to start first, and resolve all their issues before delivering things to layer-2 and layer-3, things will be much easier. The reality is that, the Project Management always wants all teams to work in parallel and expect things to get done within a month. It seems like the Scrum method is always the choice at QCT, and in fact every day is a mess with this SW engineering method. In order to have the bring up to happen, every team is making temporary but dirty workarounds, which should be replaced or discarded in the near future. So, why not start earlier and leave more time for the ultimate clean solution? It turns out that, all the efforts for those dirty and temporary solutions get be wasted.

9. Long hours throughout the year, and promotions takes long for ordinary people. I am not a racist but I did realize that some guys with the same race as those mid-Management guys seems to be favored by the mid-Management, and they can enjoy their days lazily and get promotion even quicker than other employees who work really hard. For ordinary people, it usually takes 5-6 reviews to get a promotion, no matter how hard you work. It's not worth it to work so hard, and sacrifice your health and your family.

10. A lot of global testing/technical support offices, and they are generating issues at late night or on weekends. All issues are shoot back to San Diego and you are expected to resolve them ASAP. Why can't those offshore teams resolve issues locally? Why can't they wait until business hours in San Diego?

11. A lot of inefficient weekend support which turns out to be a waste of time. When those leaders tried to resolve an issue during weekends, it takes a long time for engineers to wait for each other. Time for relaxing the body and recovering from tiredness is wasted in such meaningless waiting. An issue that can be resolved in 30 minutes in a business day will take almost a whole day to get resolved on weekends. So why not do the work quickly on Monday? Engineers cannot take a rest on weekends, as a punishment, they won't work efficiently during business hours in the next week. What is gain, what is the benefit for rushing on weekends? Even worse, weekend support is forcing good engineers to leave the company.

12. No investment to the growing technical areas from the high management. In recent years, QC has been creating trivial feature combos, which Customers do not even pay attention to. Those nasty combos had created millions of bugs, and had exhausted QC's engineering work-force. As in a negative feedback loop, everyone is busy fixing bugs everyday, and won't have time to invent for the future.

13. Bug fixing is preferred over a clean design. Things happen too quickly, and there is always no time for a good and clean design. There are far too many poor designs were implemented in products, and they simply do not work in reality. Various teams are forced to hack out dirty workarounds that might break something else tomorrow. Test teams are testing the same thing over and over again, before things can work."

It seems no one is capable of making any decision and everyone is chasing others for approval. There is a lot of confusion around decision making and it feels like the dmv. None of the current leaders have any vision. Infact none of the current leaders have an accomplishment to show around creating a successful new business. They know how to scale one but that is not useful when the core business is under threat. The CEO has probably spoken in coded words to employees after every analyst call. It was hardly inspirational. The corporate research group is a joke and has lost its way. I know a lot of people in the research group either biding their time or wanting to leave.

5650,Qualcomm,Engineer,2015-05-29,3.0,,Good technical growth opportunities here,Work environment is stressful with highly demanding management
5651,Qualcomm,Not what it used to be - 20+ year employee review,2015-05-29,3.0,Staff Engineer,"In the beginning this was a fun, exciting, rewarding and fulfilling place to work; there is something to be said about being on the ground floor of innovation.  For true creative minds, being involved in the development and production of cutting edge technology is the ultimate ""job"".  For the first half of my life at Q, I didn't consider it a ""job"", it was a journey.  In the later years, it turned into a job.  As the company grew, so did management and egos, so did time lines and stress levels.  

Qualcomm went from being the leader on the table to a feeling of always being behind the 8-ball.  Hard for some of us old timers to adjust to - this is true.  Bring in the new, young, fresh blood to pick it up - I get that and see that it should happen.  But....  all of the innovation, bright minds, creativity, inventive vibe dissipates with each new wave of fresh blood brought in.  HR stopped hiring creative, intelligent souls and hand picked what I now call place holders.  Working the numbers game, tightening the reigns or nooses if you care to view it that way.    I have no qualms with the HR dept, never once in my 20+ years of working there did I ever speak to an HR rep for any reason.  I trusted and worked with my supervisor/manager.  But I always had the distinct impression teams like HR were only out for themselves or other agendas.  I honestly can not remember the number of managers I had (more than 10) but every single one of them said the same thing - don't involve HR if you don't have to.   Telling stuff right there.

Pros - there are good people there, they still have a chance at getting back to being an innovative company, bring in the creative minds who will create the next big thing.","Management, red tape, deadlines, I have an interesting take on ""work-life balance"".  For a time, I was working in a lab, part of a team helping to create a new technology.  We worked 6,sometimes 7 days a week, 10-12 hours a day and I loved it.  Why?  Because I was part of something fun and cutting edge.  Fast forward several years where I was in a sustaining role, working your basic 9-5, 5 days/week.  Longest days of my life.  Good managers and good HR personnel recognize where and how to place their talent.  

Somewhere along the way this went out the window.  Did anyone notice how happy I was and how much I excelled in my job when I was basically LIVING at work?  Did anyone notice how my reviews flat-lined when I was placed into a functionary role.  What are all the metrics about if you don't process and utilize this information?"
5652,Qualcomm,RF engineer,2015-05-28,2.0,,The position is rewarding and everybody appreciate your hard work. You can easily soar up if you are a hard worker. You should have a good teamwork.

- 401k match superb and plenty of low-fee funds (read: vanguard) available.
- ESPP is amazing, %15 discount with look-back
- Depending on the team you're in (read: not division but actual team) you might have relaxed deadlines.  Note that this heavily depends on the quality of code that the team has.  Teams with crappy code deservedly do a ton of firefighting.
- HR si very good about raises.  They make an effort to adjust your salary to market (in addition to inflation) without you asking.
- Bi-annual bonuses in both cash and stocks (RSUs). 
- Most people honestly enjoy working here.","- Lots of layoffs recently, job security is iffy.
- Company profitability on a downward trend
- Benefits getting slashed recently (new CEO not very employee friendly at the moment)
- Again, depending on the team you're in, you could deal with really crappy code that'll make your job soul sucking.  There is a ton of legacy code being maintained with no intent to erase technical debt.  This is *not* a software company.  The policy generally is: if it works, ship it.  On a flip side, there are teams with superb code.  Quality of code varies drastically by team.
- Pay is average.  The benefits probably make up for it.
- MIddle-management make waaay too much money (in bonuses) compared to doing work.  Not to mention, management vs low-level peons seems to be 50/50 split, which is just astonishing, given that they are relatively hands-off the products. 
- Performance review isn't merit based.  If could prove P=NP in your first review, and you'll only get a 3.5/5.  On the flip side, you could take a dump on your manager's table on your 6th review and you'll still get a 5/5.  Scores are manipulatied to show ""improvement"" across reviews and do not reflect the amount of work you've done."

Even their 401k matching isn't that great.,"The Corporate IT department is underpaid and understaffed. The majority of the employees are disgruntled and spend their weeks (and weekends) stuffed in cubicles with frowns on their faces.  

The management is morally and politically corrupt. Consisting of a cultish group of Qualcomm ""lifers"" (many have been there 15+ years)  who really only lookout for their own. Many have no credible management training and no degree above high school.  They were simply just there long enough and eventually pushed into management. To these people, nothing else matters.  This group is essentially closed off to outsiders, so forget about being in it. They also enjoy flaunting their money to everyone (BMW cars, $10k watches, Tesla cars etc...) thus lowering the moral of their staff even further. 

Qualcomm boasts the phrase ""work life balance"", however to management, work is their life so the phrase is all but irrelevant to them, which in turn filters down to the employees.  So employees get worked to the bone.  

Promotions, performance and appreciation (and remaining employed) are honored on a strict ""who you know/blow"" basis.   Hence, if you grease the right wheel or know the right people you can get 3 promotions in 3 years, even if you do nothing. But if you aren't a wheel greaser, or you challenge their ancient system, you may get one promotion in a decade, despite busting your butt."

Good learning programs and education assistance programs.","I worked at Qualcomm Atheros from 2013 to 2015

There is lots of office politics as they've hired so many extra engineers, project managers and there's matrix system where everybody has two managers- direct and indirect. You work mostly with the direct manager but the indirect manager rates you every six months. Which in my case didn't work well as my direct manager wasn't aware of my full responsibilities. People who play politics and do most bootlicking seen to get promoted.

Worked on two wireless connectivity chips. Both got cancelled after tape out and marketing takes irresponsible decisions for product roadmap.

Salary is below the market range and the HR was rude to not even negotiate the salary while joining. 80-90% are Indians and Asians on visa. Many Indians are brought every year on business visa for up to six months in a year and exploited. They are paid about $25 in daily allowance for meals where as a local employee get that amount for one meal on travel.  

There is no work culture due to demographics as well. People just come to work and hang out in groups for coffee etc. No social experience and many are too reserved to talk.

No real talented people except design engineers. Test engineers are below par and just having a MS degree doesn't mean you're employable.

Don't transfer internally to another group. They will make your life hell. Better find job somewhere else.

Senior managers are there just because they've been there for so long and don't seem knowledgeable."

The benefits are excellent (ESPP/RSU/401K among best in the industry), great health care, and a nice campus. Team is very receptive to assist when needed. I feel that I can develop a very strong career here with live long learning by working with this top-tier talent. We have a great CEO that values what is important for long-term growth versus what makes stock holders happy.","The culture here seems to be ""work first, family second"" without directly saying it. While no one will force you to work long hours, the culture seems to dictate it. I know people that had to work over holidays and sacrifice family trips. While this isn't uncommon in our industry, it's sad to see it continued here. The social events that Qualcomm holds for their employees are very far and few between (I know some groups have more than others but my group has very few). I've worked for other semiconductor companies where this was the opposite. 

As a result of the culture, it seems like employees want to get their things done and go directly home. There is very little socializing out side of work or team-building. When I've tried to organize events for my group to meet even for a simple happy hour, it was met with little enthusiasm. I know work isn't meant to be ""social hour"" but it is nice to have team camaraderie. Life isn't all about the 9-5 (well, more like 8-8 here)."

When you are up for promotion, the first thing they want to know is ""how long have they been in the position?"".  So much for merit.  This kills motivation and promotes cruising for a few years.

Women seem to get stuck in middle management.  I think the old sayig that ""people hire those that are like themselves"" is in play for the executives.  This is also true of the various cultures hired.  Each group seems to hire their own culture and even speak in their native language in San Diego.  If you go to the cafeteria, it is like the Wild Animal Park where the same ""types"" of people congregate together, just like at the park where similar type animals congregate together.  Nothing wrong with that except that mentality seems to translate to hiring.

- You will learn a lot about the product and how to tackle some complex challenges.","- Experience depends A LOT on what group you are in and how well the work is aligned with your interests.  It is very easy to become pigeonholed into working solely on an obscure feature (such as some module of a particular chipset that does X).  
- Effort over results: promotion is largely based on how long you have been at Qualcomm, not necessarily your effectiveness as an engineer.  There is also the pressure to show that you have been working hard by sending useless e-mail updates at late hours.
- Very process-oriented: on an e-mail thread with a technical issue, a common tactic is to incrementally CC higher-ranked engineers/managers to passive-aggressively attempt to expedite progress.  What starts as an e-mail exchange about an issue reported by a customer rapidly turns into a 50 e-mail long thread with at least 2 VP-level engineers, 5 senior staff, 10 senior engineers, etc.  Too many meetings.
- Large duplication of effort;  there are a lot of similar projects between different divisions, such as QCT and Corporate R&D.  
- Relatively low salary;  HR needs offer more compelling reasons to stay at Qualcomm other than the San Diego beach lifestyle."

6066,Qualcomm,Good work but Indian office is junk due to inefficient HRs and Stupid Managers,2014-09-06,3.0,Lead Engineer,"- One of the best company in embedded industry 
- Better than average pay
- Little bit good HR policies (but these HR policies are also available in all good companies so it does not make it stand out of the crowd)
- Good work depending on teams.
- Free food 
- Pay and stock options .
- company is very dynamic .","- Bad work life balance . Indian managers try to boast their performance so they keep the team strength less so work pressure will be more . in US this is not the case so US office is better .
- All 3rd grade works which are passed on to India for maintenance when they become obsolete (but in most of the companies this is the case in India) , but still there are teams where works are really distributed in equal quality in between us and India .
- Don't go by the work place rankings because they are too old and valid for US . In India in true sense its a very bad place to work . HR's don't have any voice , if you think Qualcomm has better hr policies then most of the Indian start up s now a days has these kind of policies so this does not make them any different.
- pay wise also its not that great as now a days you will get similar pay in many companies but yes they pay good amount (not bad)
- If you have any problem or concern there is hardly any mechanism where it can be addressed , as i said HR department here is useless they don't do anything .
- Cafeteria food is really bad , Unless you are a bachelor or u have some problem u will never like to eat . even that's worse than college cafeteria. 
- Team outing are plagued by budget constraints, there are 3-4 team outings every year  lunch , lunch , half day , full day . half day full day outings are meaningless once you stay more years in company and same thing happens every year . they will take you to a resort but if any sports needs extra payment that cannot be done , So virtually u only goto one place play cricket which normally comes with package and come back. , even no one is interested also  .
- Many managers are with medieval times IT company attitude , they don't see whether work is done or not but they are more interested in keeping you busy . In qualcomm 85% of time u will be busy there will be never a free day , even all the days you have to put more than 10-11 hours for work . but if at all one day you are free if you  leave office on time (Not early) then some managers start giving you junk work just to keep you busy .
- no proper documentation in work you do, so you have to learn all by yourself.
- Slowly they have made the company like a school with lot of tracking , they are increasing manpower who will track but really less engineers who work below , So its becoming like a reverse pyramid .
- Ratings are 2 times in year so you will get some hike every 6 months  , but ratings does not match with your performance . There are minimum fixed no of cycle after which you will get promotion so its irrelevant if you work word better or bad . if you are top performer also if that takes 2.5 years to goto next level and average performer will make that in same 2.5 years or 3 years in worst case .
- There is a false hope in some employees also HRs try to show during offer letter that there is opportunity to change teams after you are bored in same kind of work or shift to other geographical locations across sites for your career growth based on your interest . This is almost non existent . Once you apply for team change ,your ratings will be affected by current managers , there are few good managers who will be encouraging you to change teams but that's very less .Opportunity across geographical locations are almost NIL, Don't be fooled by the hollow statements . Now with all checks  in India office its almost impossible . Upper management in India has made such process that no one cannot even think to apply across sites ,
- most of the  Indian managers don't have any voice , they are always running the rat race to prove some non existent things . Simple formula is u work on same thing as ur US counterpart is working , then tell Indian upper management that you did it yourself .
- There are no recreational options with in office , No Foosball table even . There was one Foosball table earlier but as people were playing much it was removed on pretext of productivity , Such is the attitude of managers here .
- Occasionally there are few activities by HRs like CSR activity , dance etc . but due to enormous work pressure employee participation is NIL ,  Even people don't get time to attend few HR sessions where they talk about any changes or policies .even your managers will never encourage you for that , But if there are any meeting conducted by your managers manager then your manager will pull you to the meetings to increase the crowd .
- There are 20+12 leaves per year but most of the times managers start cribbing if you take more leaves . this does not happen in US . 
- US/Canada offices are better as they have better work , better culture and managers are not like Indian IT managers .

Bottom line is its a good company but a not a best company as believed to be . There are lot of Indian companies now a days who pay similar and also has better work culture and policies . US offices are far better . So if you are looking for job in  Indian office join only if you don't have any options ."

Qualcomm has been carving a stronger and stronger market position for itself.  This makes the company comfortable in taking risks (nor all of which pay off) - hence innovations is highly prized (second only to execution) 

Compensation is good. The company adjusts to any changes in the external marketplace readily and quickly. This means that it shall not be the ""most' you can get - but you will be very close - and hopefully the other intangibles will more than make up for any difference. 

People at Qualcomm are very helpful and collaborative. Team spirit is present everywhere. Generally speaking everyone is competent and many are arguably the best in the business.","With a few exceptions, Qualcomm does not make end products directly. It must read the minds of large cell phone makers, network providers etc.  There is always a difference that must be compensated when shipping the product. 

So, in several teams - especially which work on customer facing roles,  life shall be very busy - and even chaotic - with a lot of pressure.

- People can steal work and claim it their own. Advertise your work to more folks than your lead.

- Some QCT managers, have no management skill. They  have the title to just increase their influence.

- The kind of schedule and culture Qualcomm has needs techie people with deep knowledge on their system, partly because lack of documentation.
- Excellent R&D in San Diego
- Great place for self-motivated people

Giving a good rating to this company because the pay is good. Otherwise it would be a 2 star company.","- Unresponsive HR
- India office is not an R&D as such - just a backend office of San Diego. Discarded and repetitive tasks are moved to India. Quality of work is bad in India. Mostly it is commercialization support.
- Top heavy, managers have become too distant from tech and lost touch with reality.
- Most Indian managers have given up on aggression and act as puppets of San Diego counterparts.
- Both HR & management have a great open door policy for management and tech improvements but nothing will ever come out of it.
- India office gives only lip service to innovation - an annual frenzy for one or two months, there is no real planning or long-term engagement to foster innovation.
- Too much posturing in India office. reality is - its just another Indian service company with better pay.

Unlike many places where people work without degrees (eg Vons, gas stations, retail, etc) there is opportunity to move up  (even though it may be competitive), you can get actual raises (not just like 10 cents or something silly like that), and you will be recognized for the work you put in. Although you must start as a temp, if you last a year and your managers roll you over to regular status you will instantly enjoy 11 holidays and 2 weeks of vacation. Qualcomm also has an awesome healthcare plan and generous 401K match. Oh and free food and drinks! So good....And you are only expected to work 8 hours a day (not including lunch).

Qualcomm does not understand or value marketing, brand, sales - it's a technology company.
Many divisions are started by FOP (Friends of Paul (Jacobs) inexperienced senior management, who have no experience in marketing or branding, and come up with their own marketing ideas, fail to properly fund, follow through  or persist with the marketing or brand campaigns, don't listen to the marketing experts, and then fold the division when the sales don't work out.

Felt like there were too many people on projects for the scope of work. Made it difficult to own things and provide a meaningful contribution. The projects I was on seemed to move really slowly and my management often blamed the PM for this. We had PMs rotate on and off a lot and quit in this environment. Only one of them stayed with the company for more than a yea but this person found a way to transfer.

Qualcomm has the best engineers who will help you learn and grow! People here love what they do, and usually if you even have like a 50% interest in what you are doing, you will really enjoy working at Qualcomm. Generous vacation policy and work policy is pretty flexible as long as you get the job done.","First couple of years are the toughest and you should be ready to work crazy hours, but once you are up to speed, it gets easier and you can dictate your schedule.  Expectations will be high, but with all the help available, you should be fine. If you want to grow you will have to take the initiative as Qualcomm thrives on personal responsibility. If you do not drive your growth, you will not enjoy working here and will be miserable soon enough. Like with any big organization, there is cross-functional politics but usually engineers are spared from most of the carnage. Work hours can get quite out of whack because lot of work is done across sites around the world.  Lots of meetings."

-Great half-year review cycle w/ pay raise
-Great location (San Diego)
-Pretty decent salary
-People are really smart

Didn't know what to expect going into Qualcomm right out of college but I couldn't have asked for a better first job experience. I had a lot of control on how I wanted to implement the tasks I was assigned (language, frameworks, etc) and also received a lot of help from my peers when I was stuck.","-Same routine every day made work stale pretty quickly

Work got a little too ""comfortable"" (which makes me feel crazy to write in the 'Cons' section) but I wanted to take advantage of my early 20s and experience the crazy rollercoaster world of startups."
6262,Qualcomm,Great company going downhill fast,2014-03-13,2.0,Staff Engineer,"Decent healthcare benefits, ESPP, 401K matching","The company culture has declined drastically in the past 5 years. This is an extremely political place to work, and if you're in with the good old boys, then you're set; if not, get ready to see your career stagnate. Reviews are not based on merit but instead on one's manager's and VP's perceptions. Very few women in senior technical roles, and very basic benefits for parents.  Lactation rooms lack sinks and are adjacent to offices or meeting rooms. Instead of getting on board with equal maternity and paternity leave like most tech companies, the company provides the minimum mandated state leave and no more. HR is worthless; instead of addressing harassment and discrimination complaints, they state that they cannot protect the employee against retaliation (untrue in California). Multiple incidents of bullying, discrimination and harassment, even a couple of suicides, have not resulted in any attempts to improve the work environment. People are forced to come in when they are sick, work on weekends and nights, and work during vacation. Not to mention that compensation is not adjusted to market rates for employees who have been in the company for over 4 years. As a result, newer employees are paid 10-30% more than equally seasoned employees who have been loyal to the company for years. Hopefully Qualcomm can clean up its culture and get back to the great company it was - trimming the fat (and there's lots of it) will get the company back to its core values and allow it to innovate."

6339,Qualcomm,Excellent place to work at! Excellent growth. Excellent Exposure,2014-01-08,4.0,Senior Engineer,"There are a lot of Pro's of working in Qualcomm India Pvt Ltd.
1. Best compensation and benefits 
2. Excellent work to be done. It depends actually which team you are a part of.
3. Good chance to work on latest and cutting edge technology
4. You would learn to response under pressure
5. Flexi work hours
6. Everyone gets their own laptop and work from home facility
7. You can even work with your own personal laptop. 
8. All communication happens over emails, so no one can steal anyone's credit.
9. RSU options available. 
10. ESPP's also available. 
11. Hikes happen 2 times in a year which is good.
12. Most folks in US are very easy to approach and talk to. 
13. Free breakfast and Lunch. 
14. Transportation subsidy. 
15. Mobile phones/ iPhone Subsidy.
16. Gym present on campus","Most of the Cons are as follows --> 
1. If not in the right team, you can end up being in support work in Qualcomm India Pvt Ltd. 
2. Work pressures in Qualcomm India are High.
3. Not all people are easily approachable in QIPL. 
4. US teams don't bother too much about hierarchy, but Qualcomm India still has that. 
5. Can't interact with most employees over talk because of language barrier. Most of them start/discuss in regional language and not in English
6. Learning curve is not too steep. If you are in development team, you would learn only your module. You may not have a chance to learn other Modules/Technology."

It depends very much on the specifics of your group and management. If you join as an expert in your field you may find yourself working with inexperienced generalists who do not know what they are doing and rely on your expertise but who are then able to take all the glory. This is compounded by racial cliques in some small teams. From my management I got very mixed messages, heaping praise on the one hand then stabbing me in the back when it counted.

2.) Lack of transparency and dishonesty; lots of closed door meetings where you are excluded because its more politics than work. 
3.) Backstabbing & gossip - lots of it. 
4.) Your direct report may not want to share knowledge necessary to do the work because they fear you will take over their own jobs, for the same reason they will not document work. 
5.) Culture clash - if you must work here you must be well versed in Chinese/ Indian values/ culture, for example, if you say what you honestly think and are completely honest, it may be considered a 'loss of face' and you will be punished. You dare not argue a valid point with superiors too.

It is a great place to work, and there are many things that are good for the employee: great employee relations, HR helps ensure manager apply consistent rules, and the benefits are good. You get a review every 6 months and get formal feedback each time.","Here are the surprises: the management mindset is very much to reward the fire fighters, not the good managers who prevent the fires in the first place. There is great focus on execution and the delivery of quality product. However there is less attention to addressing inefficiencies. QCT runs many projects in parallel and does a good job as this. If I compare lower profile less interesting but high volume projects with the high profile, more interesting lower volume projects - the latter always get into trouble (because they are complex) and so get all the attention, and these team members seem to be better rewarded than the low profile teams who do a good job (and so don't need management attention)."

You can often be assigned to a unfamiliar project with very little idea of what you're supposed to do.

To be fair they're getting better about documentation now
Code quality varies across teams, drastically. A lot of legacy code needs be maintained. 
Work load very unpredictable. There are weeks when you have nothing to do, and weeks where 24 hours isn't enough in a day.

4.) From staff engineer and above, you just need to get hm's delivered  and would be called either hm/super hm lead without doing any work.
5.)Good salary + stocks + half yearly apprasial & bonus.

If one can just ignore on the cons, mind your work and doesnt need to have a social life at home/office would be a good place to work.
Atlast all of us work for money.","1.) Exponential growth in terms of hiring, which needs to seen with a caution. Not sure for how long smartphone revolution continues and such inorganic growth will sustain without layoffs.
2.) Not a good company to start career as one would get expert in running scripts and filing jira tickets rather than understanding the issue and fixing it yourself using your own brain.. Best would be to join QCOM after 5 years of exposure at small companies where there isnt a flow to support you.
3.) Inefficient / technically unfit  managers spoil the culture, who is only concerned about deliverable's like a serrvices company  and not keen on making an engineer learn/understand and fix. Most senior managers who came through acquisition
4.) Most engineers work more than 15 hours a day. 

5.) Lot of regional bias attitude and most doesnt speak English most of the time even in meetings.

They are busy playing politics all day long and trying to force their agenda on others. Most managers act like individual contributors whose directs exist for the sole purpose of cleaning their leftovers. 
Agreeing on expectations, providing feedback, asking instead of commanding and coaching is something I haven't seen from any manager in this company. This is all a result of a poor management culture and promotion for the wrong reasons. The organizational hierarchy is so vertical that most managers have fewer than 4 directs. This means you need to to fill an awful lot of management positions from a pool for technocrats, how well can this turn out to be? Senior management is completely detached. To illustrate it, 16,000 company employees (60%) report to a single manager who sits 3 levels below the CEO."

- great pay for the kind of work you do, its a bargain actually.
- awesome benefits, has a nurse-practitioner on site for any illnesses, injuries","- low sense of accomplishment
- software is mostly involved in testing/bug fixing, if lucky you may get to work on big projects but you have to chase down managers for more important work
- repetitive work, one chip after another is mostly the same stuff on different hardware
- poor coding practices in certain teams, bad function names and mispellings get propagated because nobody ever steps up to fix them.
- 3 years average promotion time for engineers, which seem to be longer than alot of other companies, this adds to the lack of accomplishment
- line management, your line manager has no clue what you did in the past quarter nor do they care.  They evaluate you based on an online form filled out by your colleagues and given the impersonal nature of the evaluation (no personal interaction), people get bored of bubbling things in and writing canned answers they just dont try to write anything amazing about you.

- Line management - your review, bonus and raise are determined by a third party whom you see only during review period. Your manager/tech lead has very little impact during the bonus/promotion meetings. 
- Compensation is very low compared to salary in Bay Area. San Diego is not that much cheaper to live 
- New innovation in hardware only. As a software engineer you will only be responsible for bug fixes and hacks the hardware and system team will reincorporate into the next design]

6451,Qualcomm,"Good for Developers/Engineers, not for IT Staff",2013-09-16,2.0,IT Architect,"Qualcomm has world class software developers and hardware engineers that make amazing products. The company culture is to give these engineers whatever tools they need to get the job done in the right way. Some may call them ""spoiled"", but this boosts their productivity. Healthcare is nearly free (minimal co-pays, no cost premium, good coverage for other services), company culture is great, working on a lot of leading edge technologies. 

A lot of ""Q"" this and ""Q"" that (e.g. QLife, etc.) and they order in lunch often, have free sodas and snacks, and a lot of people get real offices vice being in a cube farm. Certainly not a Google where you get completely free meals and you can bring your pet to work, but a good innovative culture. Twice a year bonuses, cash awards, and stock grants are great. Qualcomm really puts a lot of time and effort into the twice-yearly review process. They really do a 360 degree view of the person with third party input. Most thorough review process I've ever seen.","Working in IT at Qualcomm is filled with cons and few positives. IT staff are second class citizens, playing second fiddle to developers and ""real"" engineers. Yes they bring in the money, but a professional IT degreed engineer is not compensated or looked at in the same way as a developer. Since the ""real"" engineers are fairly spoiled, IT is constantly being pulled at their whim with little planning or time to do it right. Highly reactive, which often results in less than optimal IT solutions. Engineers then look down upon IT for providing half-baked solutions, even when we were totally left out of any up-front planning and they need something ""yesterday"". 

Corporate IT is also highly siloed, and people get put in a box and rarely let out. If you are an Exchange administrator, then you have zero insight into storage, virtualization, networking, etc. Or maybe all you do is administer load balancers. Very little cross-discipline training or exposure. This stunts IT skills and IT careers. Everyone has their rice bowls, and getting major tasks accomplished that cross multiple groups is very painful. The helpdesk tries their best, but lacks good training and skilled staff. Extremely high turnover, and not very happy customers. 

Because the perks and company are good overall, the poor IT performers stay and rarely seem to leave. Getting HR to fire someone is nearly impossible and takes 6-9 months if not more, even if the person clearly is not even remotely performing at their level. HR is highly risk adverse, which causes major pain for staff managers and makes the teams suffer. 

Bottom line is if you want to work in IT, don't go to Qualcomm. If you are a skilled software developer or hardware engineer, Qualcomm may be your perfect job."

Performance reviews are twice  a year, but might not be getting more increment than companies with yearly reviews.","Work life balance is bad, and I have feedback about this to my supervisor, only to be told that ""that's the way it is"". The twice-yearly performance review system is a farce, the increments are more like yearly increment being spread out twice, and the increments are never worth the hours that we put in. Increment amounts are also dubious, and can differ > 5% between employees with same work function. The general focus is not on the engineering work, but on creating ""visibility"" for yourself, which seems to be the top ""unwritten"" agenda; if you've done good work and you don't sell/promote to your supervisors, its your own fault because its not their job to know and recognize what you've done.

The culture of the company is excellent - employees at all levels are encouraged to exercise judgment, make decisions, provide opinions, share information across departments, and also to continue to develop their own skills in many areas.  Primary employee benefits such as medical, dental, vision coverage, and compensation are first-rate, plus there are the additional benefits of  stock options, bonuses, and many other extras.  In general, this is a company that understands that their employees are their greatest asset.  Many of the folks in management have good management skills.  As hard as people work at Qualcomm, most people really like working there because of the dynamic and challenging environment and the sense of accomplishment and teamwork.   There are very good training opportunities within the company.  It would be difficult for anyone to not learn a great deal of useful knowledge and skills while working there.","Employees work long hours, typical of most high tech companies.  Evenings, weekends, and holidays are not sacred either.  At any level of the company you can be expected to be called when you are needed.  This is not exactly a con but more the reality of being at a successful high tech company.  It is, however, very busy and very stressful, and if you don't thrive in that kind of atmosphere then it is not the place for you.  There is increasingly a more political atmosphere, which is really a shame.  It was probably inevitable with the growth of the company over time, but it has greatly lessened the enjoyment of the workplace overall and added to the stress level.  I feel that as the company has gotten so much larger, there is not enough understanding at the executive levels of the day-to-day trials at the working level and middle management level.  This has also added to the frustration of people who put so much of themselves into their work."

You can end up working 100 hours  week along with full night outs. Even after doing a night out , you might still be bashed by your manager for not doing this and that.

Because of the aggressive work schedules , people are expected to be available almost every time, whether its late night or weekend or holidays. Management is treating engineers like slaves. Forget work life balance, this is not the place to be in when you have a family. 

They do not care whether you are sick , or dying due to a heart attack, they will still call you to check the ETA of your deliverable!

Due to big volume of work, quality takes a beating, the emphasis is on 'somehow' completing your work, and the only thing discussed in the meetings is ETA. Everybody is working in a factory mode, slogging round the clock , without any innovative thinking. This place works likes a factory!!

Generous RSU's and their vesting period are one big reason why people wont leave Qualcomm even with this bad culture."

The main problem was most of my technical leads were inexperienced and untrained as leads, were not clear on their expectations, were unhelpful technically, and were excessively critical.  Several of them were literally the worst leaders imaginable.  I was not given time or resources necessary to learn new technologies before being expected to perform on them, and management was unsympathetic for my attempts to seek help.  There was no work life balance.  I worked extremely long hours without receiving even a 'thank you' in most cases.

If you are smart enough to figure out the chaos then this is the company for you.","A lot of them. Some of them are my experiences most of them are what my friends are going through now. 
1) Will make you more lazy if you are in the wrong team 
2) Boss will give you a dumb job some times
3) Beware of your own team members. You never know who will pull you down.
4) Things do get done because there is always a crazy push and managers here try to hire more folks than to sharpen the brains already present in the team :) (i hope you get my point)
5) Some managers here never are so pro for your career growth although during the interview they sing to your tunes.
6) Coming to your office don't be surprise if you are crammed and HR doesn't even care about the ergonomics no more :). 
7) One more thing if its too hard to believe trust me I have a lot of time in hand and i have been growing crazier. Even some of my so called team mates (very smart PhD's Mit stanford grads) enjoy their lives and act off to show they have work to do in meetings, in reality that would have been  completed the assigned task  in 2 hrs already.So you get the point. 
8) One more e.g. Say If you want to borrow a pencil for another team typically you go ask for the person whom you know in that team. But here they send out emails which include a big group to let every one know that you are working and it is frustrating.
9) Currently an example for a good culture turned bad, and hiring a lot of asians directly from India/China (Indian's and chinese) has made it even worse. They don't have any other hobby, i think work is the only hobby or habit and now the company looks like sweat shop . Being an asian i feel very sorry for them. I second this.
10) Last but not the least:No room to grow :) so experienced folks what so ever you guys are low balled all the time and think twice before that move. Learn more about the team better.
11) There is a lot of redundancy. 
12) Some of them think Industry=Qualcomm. I am just surprised.
13) Hires a lot of outstanding PhD's for test engineering (some times its dumb) and they lose their hard gained knowledge."

The engineering rigor in anything like design reviews, chip tape-out reviews, customer issue triages bests other competitors very easily.Plus the benefits are incomparable - no co-pays for PPO health care, EAP resources, greatly subsidized movie tickets etc. For such a large company, decisions are taken mostly right and the dividends have paid off.","As many have noted, work hours at QCT tend to be extremely long (though in reality not as bad as some of the other competitor semiconductor companies) and you will be stretched to the maximum unless you push back. 
However it must be said that when you face family issues as a result of the work pressure that were piled on previously, the company does respond in a very caring fashion to you (at least my manager did) and gives you all the time you want to sort out your personal life. 
Ultimately, I did make a decision to leave QCOM to take up a job in another city for serious family issues, and I was touched that even the VP talked to me for three days continuously to persuade me to stay and even offered me to work remotely. I would have stayed back, had my personal situation not arisen.

Moreover, since pulling out the improbable is rewarded, team-work suffers, not only among team members, but especially across teams.

Qualcomm is an excellent company which has execution at all costs as its DNA.  This has served the organization well as they have been able to capture the cellular market with being able to deliver extremely quickly while others have struggled.","The dark side is the human cost of the execution driven culture.  There is absolutely no respect for the personal life of the engineers.  People are supposed to be able to drop everything at a moment's notice to work round the clock for months including days, nights, weekends etc.  

Mid-level managers threaten (by extensive name dropping), cajole and browbeat people into making them work crazy hours.

The reason for all this is the explosion of products in the last few years.  There is surprisingly little commonality and leverage between products and the feature combinations are so numerous that a lot of engineering time is spent repeatedly integrating and verifying legacy features.  In addition the development environment and tools are abysmal.  Given the stressful environment and lots of grunt work there is very little professional growth."

I'm still in contact with my old co-workers there and it's the same story: long hours, constant pressure to meet aggressive schedules.  

If you are hell bent on working at Qualcomm, avoid the QCT division.  They work their engineers like dogs there.  I was part of the modem group when I left and they had the most aggressive working hours.

While I still worked there, a QCT engineer committed suicide in 2010 which made big news, but there was another recent QCT suicide in June of 2012 that was hush hush possibly due to timing of a big PR announcement.  This is what my sources who still work here tell me.  Very sad."

If you like company politics, come here, its a playground for that.
Business/Administrative folks have better work life than engineers, engineers are underlings.
When it comes to layoffs or team shutdowns, engineers are protected but project/administrative/non-technical mgm't personnel are let go.
Interdepartmental job transfer is great for lateral transfers.
If your idea for a new business is chosen, and QC will fund it, you can lead it (this is the correct way to build up your job title - like a start up)","-What used to be a wonderful place to work has dramatically changed in the last 5 years
-For salaried engineers - no such thing as work-life balance, you are obligated to work 6-7 days / week
-new hires get burned out quick, turn over has steadily increased.
-middle management delegates heavily to lower subordinates.
-HR is honest, they will tell you are being paid below average, they will not adjust your pay to the market rate unless you've demonstrated exceptional performance after several years(you will need to decide if its worth it).  They will tell you the RSU's can makeup for it.  But that's not cash in hand
-the competition is super stiff, your performance review is ranked against the entire business division; not your team mates.
-Expect executive management to micromanage; but not to help assist
-Consultants/temps really just work 8 hours, they generally lose the drive to go above and beyond to help you (as they too will burn out), you will need to have skills to be self sufficient.
-Expect caste-like treatment between manager and employee
-You will need to be versed in Indian conduct/relationships, otherwise the you might be caught off guard being that you're located in San Diego."

2)There is a lot of stress on minute issues or the same issue coming up in a different ways. 
3) Promotions are based on number of hours put in. No respect for quality of work but stress on quantity of work. This goes back to the point mentioned above. Since mangers are technically not smart, they don't have clue about time taken for a task.

Team dynamics: Every group has its own kind of politics. Usually it will involve middle management, who does nothing but manage. Most of these people lack technical skills to remain in company, but due to extremely bad review process, they will linger on. 

Most of the middle management is content to manage up and give more work to people under them. So most of the engineers leave after 2-3 years. Bad talent sticks around."

ESPP is good too (stock is doing very well).  Free gym membership.  There's a good work/life balance here.  Compensation is also pretty good (but I can't comment on the bonus plan).,This was one of the most boring jobs I ever had.  It turned out to be more of a sustaining/maintainence role.  Bug fixing occupied about 80% of my time.  There's very little feature development going on in San Jose.  Most of the significant work is happening in India.

Dynamic, performance driven environment creates challenge and professional development.
Learn and be involved with exciting and innovative new technologies.
Worked with very intelligent, talented, and sociable people.","Although work/life balance is stressed company wide, many positions and groups require extensive hours with very volatile, stressful working conditions. Some positions require more and more responsibilities the longer you are there with very limited resources. If you take the time off, you will have to put in the time you missed to keep your head above water and face the wrath of not meeting your deadlines, which, in turn creates more stress.
Some groups have no teamwork. You get siloed into a very complicated technical position so no one on your team can back you up or even knows exactly what you do. Conversely, you may not have a full understanding of your coworker's responsibilities. Everyone is too busy for crosstraining.
Upper management does not approve headcount for department head's needs.
Workplace stress is common. I have been in the workforce for 22 years and my position here was by far the most stressful job I have ever had. Again, this differs from department to department and will depend on the group and manager you are working for.
Interpersonal conflicts and power struggles were commonplace.

There is no accountability, and it feels as if everyone is at war.  In addition to the hositile environment, there are many mid-level managers that treat others like dogs.  Nervous, negative yuckness is what it feels like as soon as you walk into the building (Q) , Whats worse is, your made to feel as if your contribution to the company means nothing; yyou are a dime a dozen.

The work culture and growth potential have, naturally, evolved accordingly. This means:

(1) Although the company is innovating in multiple new technology areas, in most parts of the company, innovation is recognized and rewarded only in the more traditional (3G, 4G) technologies.

(2) Qualcomm has become a very top heavy company. Due to the incumbents who started in the company early, and never left, low outside opportunities in the San Diego area, and simply the company being a great place to work, the layer of SVPs and VPs is huge.

(3) There is a good chance that younger and very talented engineers will be (are) frustrated, as promotions are, to a great extent, a slave of ""protocol"", which is applied in equal measure to everyone - regardless of talent.
