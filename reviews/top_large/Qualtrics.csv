16,Qualtrics,"Awful pay, convoluted product, little transparency. Do not recommend.",2022-03-18,1.0,Technical Account Manager,"Many people you meet will be smart and amicable. If you don't mind living in Utah (with its lack of diversity and its Mormon bent), the Provo office is kind of cool, with a small garden, open floor plan, and lots of space.","The compensation and benefits component is a HARD 1 out of 5. Qualtrics is notorious for paying below market rate. In every single role I know of, including my own, people are underpaid compared to the industry, role, and other companies, even if you factor in location. Just FYI, Provo is becoming a higher COL area and yet Qualtrics' salary bands don't even meet industry standard either. 

If you ask your managers about this or give them feedback, they may listen but they'll go to the compensation team and then the compensation team will give them BS back about how they find a ""market reference point"", yada yada. Change does not fee like it's going to happen. This is ironic, given that two of the literal company values are one team and transparency.

Global operations (where TAMs and ""product specialists"", aka Quni aka grunt customer support work, live) is a horrible department to work in unless you're ok with below market pay and really enjoy never-ending work of triaging client issues AND being client-facing. Honestly, the product specialist job is one of the worst ones out there – it's volume-based and metric-driven based on how many support tickets you take per day and what your customer satisfaction (CSAT) score is, which is not totally under your control. And they hire for bright people for this product specialist role, which is just a waste of their potential in a stressful, thankless job. TAM is similar in still being client-facing and client-supporting, and a lot of the TAM team is burnt out.

Qualtrics overall has been an extremely disappointing place to work, and underwhelming for the company that claims to be ""the experience management company"". I definitely want to say more, but it's hard to capture everything I hate about working here, although I'm glad that some of it has been captured in the other recent one-star reviews, which you should go read!

The last thing I'll say is that if Qualtrics GENUINELY wants to become ""tHe dEsTinaTion WorKpLacE"", then it NEEDS to embrace remote work, transparency, and higher pay with a healthy salary growth potential, and lose some (really, a LOT) of its corporate veneer that is very obviously and grossly driven toward maximizing profit."

- Work life balance can be poor

- Pay can be below market depending on the team

Overall, Qualtrics will be just fine. People will come, and people will go. However, in my honest opinion, if you're moving your entire life to Utah in order to work here... really consider that this will probably be a 2 year stop for you. Maybe 3. This can be great if you're starting your career, but it might not be worth uprooting your life for mid-career. Up to you."

- Nice benefits 
- Good learning opportunities","-Not living up to values. Transparency is talked about but isn’t always practiced e.g. had a member of leadership who refused to confirm what performance rating I was put forward as during a performance review 

-Incredibly difficult to get a promotion there. A member of leadership openly talked about how difficult it is to get promoted at Qualtrics in a team meeting. Promotion should be incredibly easy to achieve when you’re consistently outperforming your targets...I was really surprised by this messaging

- I was in the company for 23 months and 1 week at the point of a promotion cycle. Although consistently overachieving on targets quarter after quarter and having received an “exceeding expectations” in my 3 previous reviews, I was passed for promotion because the grade I would have been promoted to required that I needed to be in the company for at least 24 months. The company refused to put my performance ahead of process and forgo the 3 weeks I was short - at that point it was time to say bye to Qualtrics

-When I joined the company, the job spec for my role required at least 7 years experience. At point of leaving, that was dropped back to 4 years experience which meant that people with less experience were being brought in at more senior positions. Incredibly disheartening and frustrating for that to happen when I couldn’t get a promotion because of being 3 weeks short on tenure but having consistently proven myself as an over performer in the role - other people were experiencing similar challenges and it made working there very toxic for morale."

No matter what they say about a rubric, is pointless. To get promotions you have to get exceeds. To get exceeds you have to differentiate yourself from your peer group.

Sacrificing your goals to save company clients or key projects helping in turn helping others does nothing but highlight your miss, and involve you in a failure.. 

If your in the Provo office realize the majority of your peers are in Seattle and have no problem throwing you under the buss for ""their own"" . 

Feedback is usually some ambiguous reference to an item on the rubric with no Concrete and disputable or provable actions. on how you did or did not fail.

Customer Success can be a challenging job, but I feel very supported by the company and after being here several years have seen Qualtrics take action on processes that were not designed well and caused customer/employee frustration.

They are only ""people first"" focused when it comes to how they market themselves as an employer. When you get behind the scenes it's not at all true. They think of employees as investments, not people, and they treat you as such. Their supposedly unique performance and promotion review cycles are just stack ranking with some extra frills to try to hide it. If you don't mind the average corporate working experience you'll probably be fine here, though you could probably find plenty of other places with the same work culture that will pay you more.

6. Benefits and pay are perfectly fine with me for a company as big as Qualtrics. There are a lot of perks that have been introduced recently that are super helpful. 

Bonus: Many people not coming from a company that actually provides its own software probably do not realize that the platform doesn't have very many major issues with it when implementing it.","1.

Also faced antisemitism in a few instances directly as well as through the broader Utah community. Of course it’s not every person at all, but it’s enough that it impacted my experience. 

A lot of chaos and difficulties transitioning from a mid size company into an enterprise size public firm. 

Lacking senior leadership vision, very inconsistently applied other than hype and kook aid. 

There is a culture of celebrating those that put out fires but not those that are planners. 

Burn out is real.

Feels like it's a sales-first company, built around helping sales reps get the biggest paychecks possible. Even people in roles that are very not sales roles are still pushed to ""get in front of customers"" and be involved in deals. Sales revenue is one of the only metrics used, anywhere in the company, to measure performance. Sales org is definitely more important to Qualtrics than product / engineering. 

Qualtrics talks a big game on winning talent, but it's losing. Real talent planning doesn't happen. Qualtrics salaries were already lower than competitors, but 2022 salary updates were half the inflation rate and lagged far behind industry-wide salary growth in 2021. Despite efforts to improve benefits, medical coverage is worse in 2022 than it was in 2021. Little or no paths or opportunities to grow or progress in your career without leaving the company. Very little support for learning, growth, or development. Learning is dependent on either switching roles periodically or being lucky and having one of the rare managers who is good at coaching/mentoring.

Qualtrics is working on a lot of these things, but the company is also going to hemorrhage employees unless they fix some of these problems fast."

121,Qualtrics,Great Company,2022-01-05,5.0,Program Manager,"- 

-The kind of place where if you don't like what is happening you have a chance to change it. There is so much growth and so much to be done that leadership embraces people who see a problem and want to make sure that it gets fixed. 

- The Leadership really practice what they preach and want to ensure every employee has a positive experience at Q. There are plenty of things that are a work in progress but they are listening and trying.

- Fast paced, high growth and easy to believe in the future of the company. Anyone with strong work ethic and even basic talent has opportunity for upward trajectory.

- My team has great work life balance which is really stressed as part of our org culture. Not all organizations have this however.","- Rapid growth leads to constant operational gaps with new ones being created all the time and the old ones becoming more and more painful as time passes. There are teams working to fix these but too often leadership does not channel sufficient resources to these efforts until things reach critical mass. Which can be frustrating for impacted teams.

- Recruiting is slammed with all of the rapid hiring and it can be left up to managers to source their own candidates and move people through the hiring process. This can create a poor experience for candidates and employees alike.

- Family leave benefits are far behind the industry standard. It makes it hard to attract and retain Women who are in demand at all tech companies right now."

- Attention to employee engagement within the company.

- Competitive pay and benefits.","- Struggles a lot with legacy codebase, and management seems to focus more on satisfying the customer with new features than addressing the outdated architecture.

- Promotion and leveling requirements are absurd. An engineer has to act at the next level for a year (could have changed recently though) before actually being promoted to the next level. Why should someone continuously act beyond their job description for a chance at a promotion to make that their official responsibility?

- Touch and go on a per-team basis, but documentation tends to be lacking so ramp-up can be very rough. Engineers operate on a lot of tribal knowledge and person-to-person knowledge transfer."

The organization fosters an environment of trust and support - at least that has been my personal experience with my team and manager.,Compensation is on the lower side. However benefits continued to be improved and made more affordable. Diversity needs to continue to be accelerated - especially at the highest levels in the organization and on the board.
148,Qualtrics,"Inexperienced Engineering Managers, Tech Leads, and horrible OKR system caused a clinical depression diagnosis",2021-11-30,1.0,Software Engineer II,"""XM"" means ""Experience Management"" not ""Experienced Managers""","During my almost 3 three year tenure at Qualtrics, I had 4 managers and 3 tech leads.

Each manager was less experienced than the last. Each tech lead was less experienced than the last.

Promotions were based on who showed the most promise. Not who completed the best or most effort consistently. Close to zero data was used to make these promotion decisions.

The quarterly 360 performance review system is a complete joke. The OKR system is broken. 

I went through 10 review cycles at Qualtrics. During the first three, I was exceeding or meeting expectations. As time went on, the expectations of output grew wildly. Every quarter you just stretch your OKRs to exceed your own performance from your previous quarter, even if you are meeting expectations. By the time of my 6th review cycle, almost two years into my role, my responsibilities on my team grew by a multiple of ten. Yet, I was held to a much higher bar because five previous stretch goal quarters had been ""meeting expectations"".  After quarter #6, my mental health had declined beyond self-repair due to this incredibly soul-destroying system. I disclosed my clinical depression diagnosis to my direct manager. He shrugged it off and did not discuss my options with me. It didn't affect his trajectory after all, right? Aaaah, I can smell the Amazon from here. Anyway, due to this morbidly terrible goal-setting system they have, due to the garbage dump of a management team, I became unable to stretch my goals further. The following two quarters I became an ""under performer"" while holding over triple the responsibilities in my job role than the day I was hired. By my 9th quarterly review, working the hardest I have ever worked for a company in my life, I was placed on a PIP due to purposefully saying ""No"" to further day-to-day responsibility requests from management.

I left my role clinically depressed, an alcoholic, and with imposter syndrome that affected the trajectory of my career in a hugely negative way.

If you are a New Grad looking for a job, avoid Qualtrics at all costs. For your own good. Beware. 

If you are a mid-level engineer looking for a new role, go work for Amazon. Same management experience, better pay.

As I am submitting this review for a role I left in 2019, I am happy to report I have recovered from my depression caused by my job at Qualtrics. Two years later, in 2021."

- The genuine push from everyone at all levels to be transparent about how decisions are made, what the company is doing well and what the company needs to improve on.
- Senior leadership sets diversity, equity and inclusion goals for the year (hiring, promotions within the company, etc.) and actually tracks and reports how we are doing against those goals.
- Leadership uses our own product to collect feedback to determine what areas need to be improved and then actually acts on that feedback. Shows that they truly believe in the product while also making employees feel heard.","I'm sure there are some out there, but I haven't run into any cons yet!"
166,Qualtrics,Engineering here is great!,2021-11-16,5.0,Software Engineer I,"I can only speak from the perspective of one in the engineering department, of course, but the management structure, the managers themselves, and the laid out path of promotion are all very good in my opinion. I love the team I work on and the teams I work with. There isn't a feeling of being micromanaged and employees are expected to uphold their responsibilities themselves.","The bigger the company gets I can see it become hard to feel ""heard"". Though Qualtrics being a data company does a good job at collecting that data from us as employees on how we feel things are going on."

- Really, really good work/life balance on my team. Some departments aren't near as good though. 
- Good benefits, stellar stock plan at IPO.
- Great opportunity there - XM to the moon!","- the DEI culture can feel exclusive at times, not inclusive - there's definitely a feeling that if you don't think a certain way, you aren't welcome. It's arguably not just a feeling - one guy shared an idea that wasn't in the mainstream and he got severely attacked (verbally) by a ton of people across the company. I felt terrible for him, and also decided I'd just keep my mouth shut if I ever have a political idea that is different from the mainstream. I heard a quote recently - ""inclusion does not mean agreement."" I think this quote really needs to be shared at Qualtrics."

Products regularly rolled out in a haphazard manner with no thought to value of said product nor position in the company portfolio and greater survey tool market.

You will definitely learn a lot. Qualtrics is also very supportive of changing roles (flexibility to move around company) and of personal growth.,"Qualtrics preaches the ultimate employee experience yet they don't exactly practice that. There's hardly nothing that's competitive about their benefits/compensation package, in fact it's subpar in some ways. They severely underpay their entry level employees by $10-$15k making it hard to ever reach an average salary. For a lot of entry level roles, they have a pretty standardized salary that's non negotiable so just know what you're getting into.
Also, post pandemic there's no full remote option which also isn't very competitive."

205,Qualtrics,Customer Support,2021-10-04,1.0,Customer Success Manager,"Qualtrics itself is a very cool company: lots of perks for coming into the office, free swag, etc. The people they attract are exceptionally bright and eager to do the job well. Outside of Customer Success, I can imagine that the company would be a good (if not great) place to work.","Where do I begin? 

To start, this role, Customer Success Manager, should really be called customer support. Unless you’re an MBA hire, good luck getting your customers to want to discuss anything other than their support issues. Don’t think because “I came from I banking/consulting that this won’t be the situation for me”: trust me, we all came from that same background and this is how the job works. 

You are the bearer of bad news for all things related to your customer This is a job where there are literal unsolvable problems and it is the Customer Success Managers job to tell the customer that not only is their problem legitimate, but that there is no way to solve it without them spending money. Qualtrics refuses to move the extra inch to see if they can help their customers spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. If the company isn’t a “cool” brand, good luck finding any additional resources.

This job is all about how much more you can sell. Each quarter you are required to expand your book of business by X dollars (different per level). It’s almost the same amount as an AE without the perk of commission and the expectation to be a strategic partner (aka support rep) with your customers. You could be the most strategic, phenomenal CSM at Qualtrics and get average ratings if you don’t sell.

You work with very new/low-level support reps who refuse to help you or the customer and make the job just about impossible to accomplish. 

While they may say they are always willing to help, I have found minimal support from my manager and they don’t seem to care about their people at all more than on a friend-to-friend level.

Also, the pay is average at best. They boast about the low cost of living, but really PROVO has a low cost of living. If you want to be in a non-LDS area, it’s a very high cost of living (plus an hour+ commute to the office).

Lastly, it’s very much so a culture of get on board or get out from the C-suite. Make sure you’re ready for some brainwashy comments when you accept your offer."

Lots of perks you won't get at other companies.","There is a complicated system of tickets to get anything done and some support functions are understaffed, so it takes a lot of creativity and over-communicating to get approvals on things. They are working to reduce this friction but still needs a lot of work to simplify processes. 

Pay levels are determined in a pretty arbitrary way despite the hiring rubric they use, and what is needed for promotions is not always a clear path. Mobility between departments is always lateral at most, and sometimes constitutes a pay cut conceptually speaking."

Good people around you, except a majority of sales leadership are good old boys that can be narrow minded because Qualtrics is the only place they have ever worked.

Very good for your resume.","Old boys club with how you are set up for success in sales. Over hiring of sales reps. They have stated in group meetings that 40% of reps hitting is a success metric. Majority of top reps and leadership are people who have been at Qualtrics for several years and their success is dependent upon their timing and territories. This leaves many managers with major skill gaps when attempting to set you up for success. As well as a big problem of people being narrow minded and their britches being too big for them.

Sales and cross functional departments do not play well together. Sales are seen as a necessary evil and are treated as such when bringing in other departments into deals. I have seen some very bad sales behavior so this could be a result of that.

Terrible departure experience. I gave a month's notice when I was leaving. I never received any outreach from corporate or anyone other than folks that I had worked with that were wishing me the best. No exit survey, no exit interview, nothing. Even though we sell this. The only contact I ever received from Qualtrics was a legal letter threatening me against taking employees to where I was going, etc."

253,Qualtrics,Strong Company Culture Some Issues With Middle Management,2021-08-23,4.0,Data Scientist,Qualtrics offers competitive pay and I believe they will continue to grow.

262,Qualtrics,About the best you'll get from a corporate environment,2021-08-07,4.0,Technical Recruiter,"The best thing about working here is by far the other employees, they're extremely component and just friendly regardless of what location or department they're based out of. Everyone I've worked with has seemed intrinsically motivated and do well for themselves in terms of getting more responsibilities or career growth opportunities, so it's nice to see people promote internally. There is a culture of accountability, which I personally think is nice, especially at the senior leadership level.","A lot of the less positive aspects about working here are about bureaucracy or lack of communication between departments, but I think overall this is the best it gets for a corporate work environment. Not necessarily a con, but be warned - this is not the place you want to be if you want to ""rest and vest"" regardless of what position or level you hold. There's a lot of talented and hard workers here, so you really have to earn your keep (promos and bonuses). I wish they'd just opt for full-time remote work at this point."
263,Qualtrics,Good place to start,2021-08-05,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Fun place to work as an entry level employee,Robotic job function even at an entry level
264,Qualtrics,I love it here.,2021-08-04,5.0,Team Lead,"Qualtrics has all the benefits of a large, high growth, tech company. Great benefits (like infertility benefits that have been a life saver) and super reasonable cost. PTO. Unlimited sick leave. Hybrid work. I've never had more balance in my career than I do now.",l would love to see better/longer maternity benefits (though they aren't bad.) I enjoy being in the office but I have LOVED working remotely and don't want that to change. Internal systems need work - we definitely feel the pain of being high growth.
265,Qualtrics,"Great place to start your career, but probably look elsewhere to grow",2021-07-24,3.0,Software Engineer II,"1. At least the team(s) that I was on, you really get to have hands-on experience with the technologies that you're consuming and using to develop software. Whereas some other companies may have many a blackbox that encapsulate a lot of the ""magic"" away, at Qualtrics you get to work on software engineering in its entirety - from designing the product/service to setting up the CICD pipelines to writing the code to building out the corresponding suite of unit/integration tests to configuring alerting/metrics.

2. Opportunity to work with highly intelligent and capable engineers some of which are thousands of miles away from you. This is especially true since I worked during 2020, but it's even more true when you realize that Qualtrics has engineering offices in the US, PL, and UK. It's amazing, and some of my best interactions were with individuals > 5000 miles away from me.

3. Stock options. While the pay is extremely mediocre, the stock options were really beneficial, especially given Quatrics' background (acquired by SAP then subsequently IPO).","1. Obvious variance in the performance of its engineering organization, especially as it applies to higher level engineers and managers. I am sure other companies have issues when it comes to performance evaluations but oh boy is this the case at Qualtrics. Most I know just work at Qualtrics long enough and surely you will be rewarded; certainly, this reflects a tenure to merit mentality that you will notice runs rampant throughout the company. Some L4/L5/L6's are getting paid wayyyyy too much for doing absolutely trivial/mediocre work.

2. Lack of focus at the management level. I am a bit surprised looking back at how disconnected my manager was from my team in terms of truly knowing what/how our product works and consequently what to focus on in subsequent quarters.

3. Tendency to hire in instead of incubating home grown talent. I've heard stories of some engineers being hired in as an L4, for example, and months later, an L5 is hired in even though the two worked at the same company before and started at the same time. Qualtrics, having an engineering office in Seattle, absolutely loves to hire in ex Microsoft/Amazon/Goldman Sachs since having a history with these companies somehow suggest that you're technically fit for a role at Qualtrics.

4. Lack of diversity. It's extremely difficult to attract talent to the Provo, UT office. The reputation of this state/location precedes it, which is why a non-trivial amount of employees come straight from BYU. Go cougars :D 

5. In general, unqualified individuals in leadership positions. No elaboration needed on this."

268,Qualtrics,A Glorified Call Center,2021-07-19,1.0,Software Sales Development Representative,"Experience in Salesforce, ZoomInfo, and Outreach. Some good coworkers.","Qualtrics is a glorified call center. From the moment I was hired, the only thing I was good for was the calls, opportunities, and pipeline I generated for my team. I was encouraged to work overtime if I was not where I needed to be, even if that meant working on the weekends. There was no work/life balance while being an SDR at this company.

There was also no team atmosphere amongst my team- it was every SDR for themselves. While other departments were different from mine, I was in a vertical that was not doing as well and that stress fell on the SDRs. 

The training at this company was only two weeks. After said training, we were then thrown on the phones with little to say. My advice would be to extend the training and allow SDRs to ask questions and feel comfortable before they start calling outbound.

Some managers at this company are new to management and it shows. Find managers who have past experience in leading teams and know how to correctly uplift their coworkers."
269,Qualtrics,It's great if you fit into the culture,2021-07-15,4.0,Solution Architect,"The are very driven by their pillars, Transparency, All-In, Customer Obsessed, One team, and Scrappy.

Whether you are up for promotion yourself, asked to evaluate someone who is up for promotion, or are a manager helping a direct report navigate the process, everything about it is awful. I love most things about Qualtrics, but I'll be actively looking for another job because of their awful promotion process"

276,Qualtrics,Great business outlook. Increasingly difficult/challenging place to work,2021-07-09,3.0,Customer Success,"Qualtrics is thriving and still has a long way to go in terms of growth. We're well-positioned as a leader in our category. Working for an industry leader has many perks on its own. Our customers are some of the most emblematic brands in the world. That's something you won't miss at Qualtrics, which was important for me coming from a top-tier consulting firm.

Compensation is competitive and it's great to see a shift towards helping employees feel ownership by awarding equity as compensation.

Perks and benefits are fairly standard for any good tech company. Although our health insurance has gotten significantly worse since I started here.

Our founder is also the Utah Jazz owner, so we occasionally get to attend games. The Qualtrics suite if you're lucky.

Finally, the experience bonus is one of the most unique things here. You get a $1,500 annual bonus that can only be spent on an experience. It gets people to try new things or travel to new places.

We are making a lot of improvements on the DEI front. It's always discussed in our leadership meetings.","Work-life balance is something we pay a lot of lip service to, but that keeps getting worse. It's a pretty intense job and it feels like you're on-call all the time. That's weekends, vacations, out sick, etc. 

Remote work is also going away, partially. There have been clear indications from senior leadership that there's some lack of trust in our ability to continue to operate effectively without coming to the office regularly. This one stings.

There are some serious growing pains we're experiencing after the IPO. A shift at the senior level management towards short term profitability and quarterly earnings. We talked a lot about this prior to the IPO, how being a public company wouldn't change us and we shouldn't let the IPO distract us. It fees like our brand and values are getting dilluted in the pursuit of growth. 

I'm not sure whether it's related to the IPO/SAP Acquisiton or not, but benefits have gotten more expensive, promotions are rarer than ever and it's very political. I hated a lot of what I had to do to be promoted and wouldn't do it again. We've also gotten clunkier in our execution. Some of it is CYA now that we're a public company, but a lot of it is run-of-the-mill corporate red tape.

Our values, culture, and products used to be what attracted and kept people here. Now, it's more comon to hear money and the vesting of equity shares as the main reason to stick around. After many years here, it's very sad to see."

Horrific turnover in many levels of the sales departments - you are constantly talking about who just quit, who may quit, or who is about to quit. Constant transition of accounts as a result.

296,Qualtrics,Great Workplace,2021-06-23,5.0,Recruiting Specialist,Best company I’ve ever worked for,There are no down sides
297,Qualtrics,You are overqualified and underpaid to work in a call center and be subject to a client's whim every day.,2021-06-22,2.0,Product Specialist,"The people have made this job bearable because everyone gets it, and they're so down-to-earth.
The benefits and mobility are okay, but you have to stay in for a while to see those come to fruition. If you go to the office, there is free food, which is nice.","Upper management wields a lot of power and is very disconnected from probably one of the most crucial roles that make Qualtrics what it is. As a result, you're essentially being exploited as they pile more responsibilities onto you. I was told by someone from upper management that ""we only hire the best, and the grind is worth it for upward mobility"", but after seeing so many changes to the company and salaries being lowered significantly and benefits are being revised, that argument doesn't hold up. 

There are specialists who are bilingual and are forced to work twice as hard without incentive because the company initiatives on recruiting multilingual speakers fall short. While there is more initiative, the burden still relies heavily on those specialists as training takes more time, and it's rather unfair to see this happen with some of my colleagues.

If you make it out of this position, kudos to you! The metrics system and added expectations and forced overtime will stretch you thin, and you will be burnt out. You will feel ashamed for not meeting metrics whether it's intentional or not; it takes a toll on your mental health and you will still feel bad if you take time off because you'll feel you're making it worse for your colleagues by adding more to their workload. Don't let the phrases on ""having to grind"" in order to see the payoff make you feel lazy or like you're not doing enough.

This job pulls you in with the illusion that you will be able to collaborate on projects with other teams, and have so many opportunities to pick up new skills and badges, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Because of capacity, you will become a ticket taking machine, and will not have those opportunities unless it is an extreme case, and even then you will be limited. In addition, you don't really have a healthy work/life balance as they say. It's rather disappointing to be sold on that, and having that opportunity taken away. 

The company is not diverse, but they are striving for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion which is good. However their recruiting and hiring efforts are still rooted in meritocracy and bias, and it's a shame because these hiring standards largely exclude minorities and less privileged groups who would otherwise be great for this role but don't meet the unnecessarily high standards due to systematic injustices in place. This job isn't really hard in terms of material, and many can be trained to use the platform and become proficient in it to offer support. You don't have to be a college graduate from UCLA and graduate Magna Cum Laude for this role, and you are more than likely overqualified for this position.

For a company that prides itself on and sells products that try to improve Employee Experiences and Engagement, it's rather ironic and sad that there is quite a bit of employee dissatisfaction and little action is being taken."
298,Qualtrics,Inexperienced managers,2021-06-22,4.0,Sales,Great culture and very friendly,As it grows fast people with little experience are put into leadership roles.Terrible system for promotions where you have to write your own reason but are only give a certina number of words. it's more a lesson in writing good English than self promotion.

Unrealistic hours/workloads have been put on project management teams.
- Upward mobility is dependent on ""quadrant performance"", expect a lot of micro-managing and a lot of hard work on your end
- Lots of promotion requirements are set unrealistically high in order for internal teams to buy time to fully vet out the promotion process for multiple verticals. You will have to fight for what you want and your ""internal brand"" will always be a factor. Be nice to your managers cuz that's about all the help you get. At least, this is from my experience working through the SDR, AE and Brand Expert career tracks.
- It took a pandemic for Qualtrics to actually consider a work from home policy. Even now we don't have a full program in place. You are required to work in the office 3 days a week.
- You are required to live in a state/the city that has a Qualtrics office. No exceptions.

337,Qualtrics,re:  Good company with strong culture/executive leaders...sales could be tough,2021-04-28,3.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"There is really a good culture with the TACOS theme. The leadership brings a lot of good energy, ideas, and enthusiasm which bleeds throughout the organization. Sales is a good spot to start in and then migrate to other positions in the company. There really is a strong team mentality. Management does offer a lot of support to be successful. I fortunately did well and had a good book of business. There is good money to be made in the software side. The money isn't as lucrative on the services side. Overall a good software company and good company to be a part of. They try to be transparent with weekly leadership calls. It's a younger organization as many of the sales people, it's their first jobs out of college.","Given it's a heavy data company, there is a lot of data that leadership uses to micromanage the job. There is a big emphasis on the Gartner quadrant and there is much pressure for sales to be ""top right"". The quadrant leads to a lot of time doing mindless mining and wasted time that could be devoted to sales. Burnout is real in the sales development role and account executive. The culture could be a bit cultish created heavily by the boys club in Provo. Career advancement is a bit slower once there as there is a rigid model--have to mentor, pod lead, etc. It's frustrating especially when one has the experience already. There is a lot of rah-rah which could seem scripted."

They have a log jam at various levels which result in many people exceeded benchmarks set but only one or two getting high marks and promotions.

356,Qualtrics,"No benefits since WFH, impossible promotion path, and you better pray you never have to deal with HR!!",2021-04-15,1.0,Customer Enablement Consultant,"When I first started here the benefits were very clear. Free lunch 3 days a week, on-site gym, beautiful 5-acre grounds, bring your dog to work, etc. None of that has existed for over a year now so any pros have gone away with WFH.","Benefits has continued stalling around our questions for what benefits we will have post-SAP as well as denying any requests for reimbursement of internet, lunches (considering we used to get 3 free meals a week and one subsidized), and any other expense that has skyrocketed since going fully remote. It’s extremely disappointing as we still advertise all of these benefits when recruiting even though it’s been 13 months since we’ve had them. 

Promotion paths are impossible. In my 2 years here I’ve seen a ton of frustrated coworkers with the antiquated promotion path that completely pigeonholes you if you’re not the #1 kiss a** of the team. I’ve seen too many talented colleagues quit citing this as the main reason.

Work life balance is nonexistent. Qualtrics is touted as a family friendly company, but only if your manager has kids. My manager had no empathy whatsoever for my situation when we started working from home while children also school from home. She expected more hours, which I gave up copious bedtime stories, continued working through lunches, and for months I even skipped dinners due to the workload being completely overwhelming. Despite this and working 60+ hours a week, delivering everything within the deadline, and continuing take on more than my role required, my manager slapped me with a rating of missed expectations. In a 6-month rating period she had one constructive conversation with me. If an employee is truly missing expectations then that should be the focus of bi-weekly 1:1’s. She referenced my inability to “balance” my personal life and work life. As a mom, this was the most offensive thing anyone could have said to me when for over a year I had sacrificed spending time with my children for work in the anticipation of receiving an aggressive promotion schedule. She ensured this would not happen and all of the reasons point to a personal issue with me rather than my work ethic and work output to blame. After raising this with HR as there was clear discrimination for having a family it was extremely clear that they were only here to protect the company and not me as the employee. They refused to acknowledge all of the data I brought to the table despite plenty of other working moms telling me I had a legitimate case I could take to a lawyer extremely easily. It’s sad that they don’t appreciate working moms like they say they do, or protect them at the very least. This rating came weeks after the head of people ops sent an email requesting managers be extremely understanding in this trying time for working parents. Juxtaposed with my rating letter and the nicest thing I can say is that my manager is completely tone deaf. This is obviously a very niche experience, but if you decide to work here as a parent DO NOT GO ONTO A TEAM WITH A MANAGER WITHOUT CHILDREN!!! You will find yourself working crazy overtime for someone who doesn’t care to understand your situation."

High growth company provides a large potential upside for equity-based bonuses.","Dedicated investment in skills and management training is deficient, which means growth and development is inconsistent across the company, based on the innate quality of your manager. 
Quality of life varies significantly depending on where you are in the company and who your manager is.
Career growth is strictly regimented, with minimal opportunity to progress faster than their ""plan"". Joining as an experienced hire, the quality, type, and intensity of previous work experience is basically ignored in the process of levelling incoming employees, which may be unattractive to people coming from high-energy careers in consulting, investment banking, or startups."

This company is a sales and marketing company first and foremost. They fail to fix product issues that have been causing customers pain for years, and then go market and sell new product features they have yet to build (vaporware demos). The roadmap priorities are based on shiny objects/flash, not what will truly deliver on their experience management promise. SAP buying them was based on this value promise that they cannot actually deliver on.  There is no XM. 

They get you in with decent salary, but good luck on getting a raise. Ever. Even if you are rated a 5 out 5. 

Run by too many unseasoned, unprofessional leaders who don’t have a clue how to actually lead and show up. There is no real strategic plan. And they do lip service to the employee experience, but the actual processes are biased and demoralizing. Ask anyone about their promotion process! Truly one of the worst employee experiences ... sadly ironic given they are an experience management company. Sadly, they have hired a lot of very young people fresh out of college or even older ones who have worked at horrible places so they don’t really know what real leadership is. Time and time again, I hear people complain about how demoralized, undervalued, and poorly treated they feel, yet everyone pretends it’s a great place."

During my employment the work life balance in my team was so poor that we had bi-weekly meetings to discuss how to improve, with little action. 

Sales rep are extremely disrespect to fellow team mates, yet management expects non sales colleagues to not make a fuss. 

Sales reps often complain about not being paid commission and when this is paid it takes a long time. 

There is no formal HR department meaning you are not able to easily escalate issues. 

It can be hard to make friends with colleagues as the culture is quiet and extremely professional.

Leadership has a childlike approach to other colleagues. This works well for individuals who work well when monitored closely and enjoy the hand holding."

(btw you'd think that the middle guy would be 'caught up' to the third one, but i've seen examples that show that's not how it works either). basically, the best way to get a great comp package is to get promoted at the ""right"" time, and nobody knows when is a good time or bad time until the review cycle is already over. i feel like i live in a perpetual cycle thinking that i'm 6 months to a year away from a great raise and i never arrive; it's just dangling 6 months to a year out forever."

The overall vibe of a young, growing tech company.

Work-life balance in a beautiful state with lots of stuff to do in nature.","Management focused on IPO, employee satisfaction has tanked since WFH started. Many of the in-office benefits were not compensated for. Lack of acknowledgement from the C-suite team.

Boasts a meritocracy, but at its core, it's really not. There are checks in place that you must be in a certain level for a specified number of years before you can promote, management strategically gives people higher ratings if they are eligible for promotion, which is smart, but not a meritocracy.

Everything is catered towards the sales team. Definitely a sales-focused organization. Mormon bro culture - wouldn't say it's toxic though."

Good news is that they recognize this (probably through the employee feedback channel I mentioned) and are actually taking action to change

Compensation is competitive, if not towards the higher end.","This is not a tech company. There is nothing innovative being built or anything revolutionary about the product. It’s purely a sales and marketing company led by the boys club in Provo. Decisions are made - and changed regularly- by the leadership and inputs from rank and file ignored. The reality is that the business is a bubble ripe for popping. It’s a survey company that the leadership has sold its customers on a vision they can’t execute on. (Even SAP bought into this before realizing the truth and selling the company)

Once the company gets you in with competitive pay, don’t expect any significant increases. Promotions are hard to come by - a tedious and embarrassing process that makes you beg to your colleagues for recommendations when you want a promotion. Once you get it - the compensation increase is normally < 5%.

Management gives lip service to employee experience, but really has very little respect for employees. Employees are replaceable and looked down upon.

The weekly TGIT company meetings are really just pep rallies and sales pitches."

509,Qualtrics,"Biased, misogynistic, nepotism, unrealistic",2020-10-13,1.0,Account Executive,They try to have a modern office without understanding that their core is rotten and that’s not what’s important.,"If you want to work somewhere that has misogyny and nepotism with deep fundamentals of the Mormon church, this is the place for you. Qualtrics has changed the bonus, commission, and promotion structure more times than I count. It always benefits the same types of people and prevents others from succeeding.

All of the sales department are men with stay at home wives who have too much plastic surgery, too many children, and drive luxury SUVs. They give men a week of paternal leave, which that tells you what they think of men and women’s roles. 

Even the men who are not LDS have had to be whistleblowers on fraudulent activities and sketchy deals involving white Mormon men. The only thing that came out of it was that the white Mormon men who were reported received promotions and went to Bora Bora for free with their spouses. 

The company’s expectations to sell a useless software is extremely unrealistic and no resources are given. No quota changes even with a global pandemic.  They had people try to give a free survey when COVID hit in the spring, and then couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any sales. 

There is no flexibility and don’t allow people to work from home normally. They don’t pay for your wifi or cell phone. They keep raising the bar for promotions and adding more levels, while promoting their white Mormon men for no reason at all. If you’re not part of the LDS church, stay far, far away. If you aren’t down for misogyny or nepotism, stay far away. You have been warned."
510,Qualtrics,Very mixed rollercoaster,2020-10-13,3.0,Product Manager,"People here have been extremely supportive of my personal career development. This has been the primary reason for me staying at Qualtrics given the cons outlined below.

Our high growth environment means there are many personally fulfilling, high impact projects that lead to a fun workload.","TENURE BASED PROMOTION AND RATING SYSTEM. We tout being a meritocracy (to the point it was included in our prior S-1), but this is simply not true. You have to be in level for 2 years before becoming eligible for promotion (the promotion cycles are 6 months apart). By being in level 2 years, I literally mean 2 years - I started in October 2 years ago, the same month as the promotion cycles, but they cut off to the exact day so I'm not actually eligible. While there is an exception process, it is notoriously impossible to get through. Additionally, the rating system is also tenure based. For the first rating cycle, even if your boss tells you that you've outperformed expectations, are ramping extremely quickly, and delivering high impact, you can still only ever get ""meets expectations"" (my boss had directly told me she thought I deserved higher but couldn't give me anything other than meets since I was only 6 months into the job). Even more unfortunately, this has a direct impact eligibility for the exception process, enforcing the tenure based cycle.

The early indication is we're being ripped off in our share conversion ratio for going back into an independent company. 

Decisions are made by a small few in the organization.

No permenat WFH options. Post-COVID, this might be the straw that breaks my back and forces me to leave for somewhere else. 

Communication is lacking. For example, we've made a statement that we want to lead the industry in slowly returning to work. However, it's now 2 months from our return date and all the big tech companies have pushed out into mid-2021, yet there's been crickets on what our plan is. One of many examples. 

VERY political for a company of our size (this was the case pre-SAP). Biggest surprise."

The people are some of the best I have had the privilege to work with. People are not looking to cut you down, instead the teams are constantly trying to build you up and offer support where you need it.","Honestly - micro-management and aggressive sales tactics. That is my biggest gripe. You have to meet certain expectations in order to be deemed successful. The leadership team requires a lot of data from its reps (and I get why), however, it can become a beating when you are more worried about the number of calls you made instead of looking for quality deals that will convert. Quantity takes place over quality. It's also uncomfortable when leadership is demanding that we push a decision to be made and in some cases going 

The other issue as of late has been with the territory changes. As we align with our parent company the account books have changed drastically and made it even more difficult to land those big accounts.

- Not a Boring Moment: If you enjoy staying busy and having multiple projects at once, then you might enjoy the fast-paced nature of the work here.","- Lack of Work-Life Balance: This may depend on the team, but the work is demanding and employees can take ""all in"" too far (e.g., meetings all day, 50-60 hour weeks, working evenings/weekends). From my perspective, it is often not sustainable and leads to burnout and high turnover.
- Inefficient or Nonexistent Processes: Though we pride ourselves on being ""scrappy,"" this often means that processes within and between team are not well-defined. This can be a frustrating and surprising experience, and I marvel that some things get done - attributing it to the high caliber of people working here, not to the processes.
- Competitive Bonus/Promotion Process: The system for determining bonus levels and promotions puts people in the same team against each other. Qualtrics hires such high performers that this can be a discouraging process for some."

I've enjoyed working and interacting with the majority of the engineers so people have been great.

Learned a lot we were constantly doing more bleeding edge stuff before being acquired after the acquisition there seemed to be more focus on integrating with SAP. Talk about going IPO again and being independent of SAP has things up in the air on priorities.","Management is still green horned and is learning. They are hiring more seasoned managers now and it looks positive at least 1 or 2 levels above team managers.

The promotion process is broken it's constantly changing and in the beginning it was more of who you socialized with or what big project you showed to higher-ups.

Many people worked 6+ years before even being considered for promotion with quite a few making large important changes that allowed the company to move faster or be more stable.

The stock was a wash, we drank the kool-aid from what was being sold yet with only a little more than 100 people have been here longer than myself it wasn't fully worth it. It would have been better to leave after 2 years to get a higher paying job than stick it out for the money.

547,Qualtrics,"I started before 2020 ""happened""",2020-06-23,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"I started at Qualtrics at the tail end of 2019, right around the holidays. Really great time to start as a sales rep, you get to take advantage of a fresh quota, ramp quota, holidays, good time for training, come into the new year with learning and conferences, its all excitement. But all that happened- it was actually crazy busy, books of business changed, teams adjusted a bit, then .... covid hit. We all know it's tough but all I have to say about this company amidst both the normalcy and craziness - is that the agility, understanding, momentum and energy of this company are second to none. I have never been at a place where sales reps are TOLD to sell free solutions. Obviously not a long term thing guys and we still had to sell actual dollas. But hear me out. We put out GENUINE solutions to help with COVID. Genuine. You know that thing every software sales rep tells themselves, their friends, and fam, so they can sleep at night? ""I love what I do because I believe in what I sell. We actually solve problems, we actually make a difference"" I am telling you as one of those people who says that BS -- 80% of the time it's just not the case. IT IS 100% TRUE HERE. Sometimes I don't believe how true it is. Like there aren't other motives. Being an employee at this company and seeing the response during a pandemic, both feeling my own needs met and that of my customers, gave me the utmost confidence in our future and the commitment I have to being here. Ryan Smith, the CEO, is also a no-nonsense guy. You see this guy roll around the office (pre covid of course) on a skateboard in hightops and a backwards cap and you're like ....what? Thats the guy that sold Q to SAP for 8...Billion?? What? And he talks and you're still kind of like, so.... a bunch of Germans were into it? But then you hear the founders statement. Then you hear his passion with customers and him addressing a real problem with emotion. This guy is genuine and he bleeds qualtrics and CARES for his business and his people. I have NEVER in my life trusted a senior executive more.","You guys really need to get a legit CPQ. This thing is awful. Run some XM for IT on your sales prod tools bc this is no good. 

Should probably consider cost of living adjustments. Reps who are in NY / Chicago / CA vs. Utah... not the same and shouldn't be paid as such 

Need more women and people of color in leadership, and senior leadership but we will get there. 

And probably the biggest gripe -- you guys HAVE to lock down license utilization between CX/EX. It is rampant and you are locking yourselves out of deals and actually losing customers by allowing them to use non-standard licenses to run these programs with no guardrails. It is wrong, and non-compliant.

Also -- healthcare kind of sucks if you actually have expensive needs. And no real way to help decide. 

But I've worked at worse companies, and I'd take these cons anyday for great leaders, growth opps, customers, and products. But still fix them please:)"

If you really don't have other options, it might be worth taking for a year until you find someplace that'll treat you better.","Qualtrics is the only job I've had that I feel negative about.

They didn't do sick days when I worked there. There wasn't the option to work from home sick, either. I came in numerous times when I shouldn't have.

I don't know what their COVID response was, but given their general disregard for human costs vs bottom line costs, I'd be surprised if it was anything less than cynical.

High pressure, poor work/life balance. Management constantly saying this kind of dedication is par for the course in a ""scrappy startup."" I think when you're worth over a billion dollars, you lose the right to make that claim.

I've worked excessive hours in every job, but Qualtrics is the only case where I felt like I was being really exploited.

I was told that the equity compensation was a standard 4 year vest with a 1 year cliff. After I was already in the role for awhile, they finally let me know it was also contingent on a liquidity event; I could be at Qualtrics 10 years and never vest if they never sold.

This is both an extremely uncommon provision and 100% unethical to hide.

The employees who are into Qualtrics are REALLY into Qualtrics. They borrow some of the psychological techniques from MLM - and it shows in the people who don't churn out. If someone sticks around, they're either very into corporate politics or they've drank the coolaid.

558,Qualtrics,"If you are considering moving to the Provo office for engineering, DON'T",2020-05-23,1.0,Software Engineer,"- Many learning opportunities and ownership of your projects

- Catered lunches (albeit in the Provo office the foods crap anyways - not anything special and extremely high in sodium. Snacks are also sub-par; everything's in a package / not fresh, and the soda machine routinely breaks)

- Decent outings (though, truthfully our engineering ski trips is not inclusive of everyone)","Let me just first make it clear: if you are considering moving to Provo, UT to work as an engineer, absolutely DO NOT do this, especially if you're in your 20s and about to graduate university. 

1. Inaccurate performance metrics. The company values how long you've been here more than your actual contributions. The skill variance is absurd; I can think of so many L4+ engineers whom I outperform in knowledge and contributions and it's crazy how much they're getting paid to do mediocre work. So many L3s are definitely deserving promotions and conversely so many L4+s should be fired quite frankly.

2. Low skill variance in the Provo office: this comes naturally since the office recruits so heavily from BYU. Makes sense, since no one in their right mind would ever choose to voluntarily drop everything to move here. 

3. Low technical skill in general: Again, no senior developer would deliberately drop move to Utah county to babysit a bunch of crap L3s. This has led to an overabundance of junior developers who commit crap code and something's always broken all the time. Because of this, when the company does hire any senior developer into the Provo office, chances are the expectation is much lower than at other companies.

4. Disorganization / Bad PMs: At least with the team that I'm working on, if you are looking for Agile Development, do not come working at Qualtrics. Everything feels like a hackathon project (most likely because my team's been tainted by ES (engineering service, btw, don't let them sell this to you). There is no so-called ""method to the madness""; it's quite literally just madness; we don't do scrum correctly and dates and deadlines are just thrown around randomly. Many times my manager has told other teams we have a solution to a problem - when in fact, we certainly do not. 

5. Social: At the end of the day, we come into the office because it is our job; this is true. Still, I look at many of my college peers who are working at their companies and I envy how social they get to be with their coworkers who are their age and who are also new grads. If you're looking for this vibe, you will most likely not find it in the Provo office. Quite literally everyone who's a recent college grad is also already married, so they have a family to come home to after work. It can get really annoying whenever you have team lunches, and someone's ""mission"" gets brought up; I guarantee, this happens more than you probably would want it to."

- Poor work life balance. Managers expect you to work even after hours, without showing any appreciation. WFH is NOT encouraged
- You will spend at least 10 hours a week of internal meetings (pipeline, catch-ups, ""coaching"" etc) just as a way for them to micromanage you

3. The company sells itself as having purpose solutions that were built from the ground up rather than slapping a new label on existing product (which also still occurs).

Just admit it
- This is a sales job without any of the upside of sales. The organization kids itself when it thinks that Customer Success is ""Strategic Advisors"". We hire ex-consultants and bankers only because they look good in front of a client.  The only benefit is to leadership. As a CSM, you will rarely see interesting work. It's making sure your clients won't cancel

625,Qualtrics,2+2 doesn't equal 5,2019-10-01,1.0,Account Executive,The people I work with are really incredible. There is a lot of camaraderie in the office.,"The math for success at Qualtrics does not add up.

There is a company wide initiative to increase our average deal size to $7,500 (for those of you who are interviewing... be very cautious when the recruiters tell you average deal size is $30k... you're being lied to). The ACTUAL average deal size right now is around $5,000.

You are expected to self-generate 12 opps per month as an AE and get another 4 opps per month from the SDRs (btw, you won't). 

Assuming best case scenario you get 16 opps per month (or 48 for the quarter) and a 25% close ratio, that is 12 closed opps per quarter at an average deal size of $7,500 = $90,000 in Quota Relief.

Only problem is that your quota is $140k. And the average deal size isn't actually $7,500, it's only $5,000.

This helps explain why only 10-15% of people actually hit quota in any given quarter. Recruiters will tell you 45% of people hit quota at Qualtrics, and that is true for the company as a whole. But the Dallas office is a stuck with bottom-of-the-barrel account territories (and your account book never changes).

It's a frustrating situation to be in, considering none of us took this job with aspirations of being mediocre. And the response from leadership is to call us all lazy and put incredible pressure on us to make more daily activity.

628,Qualtrics,Management Ruined Something So Promising,2019-09-29,2.0,Account Executive,"- You have the chance to work with great people
- In a space which is top of mind for nearly any executive
- My direct manager and many managers in the Dallas office truly care about AEs succeeding personally and professionally 
- Commitment to continuously improve AEs sales skills
- Ryan (CEO) has created a Go to Market machine","As a recommendation if you are interviewing in Dallas, ask how many salespeople were in the office 2 years ago and then ask how many of those people are still around today. That should tell you all you need to know. The Dallas office had a great base of people, but they ultimately were burnt out by micromanagement along with poorly aligned territories and continuous hiring of lesser talent at higher AE levels to fill growth goals. Top sales leader's ""my way or the highway"" approach is only based on past experience of how things previously were at Q before the introduction of the XM idea (many have never been at other orgs in their careers). In this pre XM era the Q salespeople focused on selling low dollar research deals where X inputs (calls, meetings, opps, etc) directly correlated to Y outputs (sales) as all deals use to be about the same size. This has not adapted over time and has led management to OVER focus on the inputs vs the outputs. In reality as Q has moved into the XM space, the way you approach strategic vs transactional deals should be very different as these deals greatly vary in size. People who hit quota typically have 1 deal that amounts to a massive amount of their quota, however if you focus on the large deals your quadrant performance goes down and you are repeatedly badgered by management to make more calls with the eventual threat of being put on a plan.

When they tell you how many people hit quota dig in deeper to understand what percentage of fully ramped AEs in Dallas hit quota. Q leadership does a great job of presenting numbers the way they want them interpreted. 

With territories already misaligned across the org and Q just announcing that they will be expanding from 2.5k employees today to 8k, I'd be nervous to see how much worse territories could be in the near future."

The company consists of 90% new grad devs. No thought in building reliable systems or designing new systems to be reliable or scalable. Feels much like devs hack away at one project and immediately jump to another without putting in care in what they are building.

The people I worked with are some of the best I've ever met. You can make genuine friends here and the majority of the employees are extremely high-caliber, intelligent, and driven.

Every once in a while you get to work some pretty strategic deals and that can feel rewarding when won.","When I say the people I worked with were great, I would say the exact opposite of the people I worked for. Leadership, specifically in Dallas, is out-of-touch, condescending, and egotistical. When the majority of leaders are made up of early sales reps who cashed in when the sales floor was half as saturated you end up with people who think they a) know everything about sales and b) the sales process is the same now as it was years ago. The management style across the board is coercion and fear. The ""quadrant"" is the holy grail of the sales team here and will be shoved down your throat at every possible second. If you dip under a certain aggregate percentage of billing and pipeline generation you go on a PIP, no questions asked. I have seen top performers have one quarter where they are working a large, strategic deal and are put on a plan purely because their activity isn't at the same level it has been (which is natural when a 6-figure deal is in play). Everyone is a number here almost every low-level rep is burnt out after a year or so, which is a nice segue into my next point.

Qualtrics isn't built for reps below AE4 to succeed. The product is excellent but it plays well to large, enterprise-type accounts. The churn and burn or spray and prey approach doesn't work anymore and only results in account books that are completely run through in 3 quarters or so. The emphasis is on dials and quantity over quality but when you dive into the numbers the AE1s and AE2s who succeed are the ones who strategically approach their books and catch a whale. So the catch-22 is: do I whale hunt and risk a PIP/micromanagment/firing or do I churn and burn and never hit quota."

Great perks (free food, dogs, coffee, casual dress/work environment) and a company that cares about people and leaving the world a better place. Seeing the passion from leadership and throughout the entire org for things like 5 for the Fight is awesome! 

There are definitely still tons of ways in which Qualtrics still tries to operate like a startup meaning individuals at all levels can be proactive and find ways to create new things and drive improvements.","No company is perfect, and while Qualtrics tries to be a meritocracy and objective, there are still some politics that come into play.

As a transplant to Utah and non-Mormon, the culture can be really hard at times. Less so in the office because I don't have people ""trying to convert me"" or being predjudiced against me because I am not a part of that religious group, but there are things that present themselves because of the culture of Utah (less social life/drinking; less women - especially women in management [though it is an area actively being worked on to drive progress]; difficult dating life; more conservative politics; etc.) It's not exactly the type of life I thought I would be leaving in my mid-20s. 

There is a very bro-y culture here and while it isn't always off-putting, sometimes it really can be. Majority of the time, I don't think it is done purposefully but the fact that it is an inherent part of the culture is almost worse because it's then harder to change."

687,Qualtrics,Good Role for Entry into Tech Field,2019-01-11,5.0,Product Specialist,"Overall, my experience as a Product Specialist has been very positive. At the end of the day, this role is what you make it. While the core job consists of being a support person for customers by answering phone calls and emails, there is ample opportunity to grow your skills and take on projects with other departments. In my short time at Qualtrics, I've already been exposed to three different departments for when I am promoted out of the Product Specialist role. This job is designed as a pipeline for the rest of the company; you are an investment for the company. No one knows the product better than us (except the software engineers). You are taught the product and you develop skills to move on to your next role. This is very much seen as a temporary role. I think that it is a great way to get your foot in the door of a rapidly expanding tech company.","There definitely can be a competitive atmosphere to see who is taking the most tickets. Also, some management can be focused too much on ticket taking and not on special projects and developing the Product Specialists' skill sets. That being said, you get out of the job exactly what you put in--if you just sit on your hands, you won't be engaged and you may have a bad experience because it will seem like all you are doing is taking tickets. However, if you seek out opportunities to grow your skills and branch out of the core job, then I think that it is a very fruitful position. 

Also, living in Utah is definitely a change of pace for out-of-staters, although I've been relatively happy with my decision to come here. However, I live in Salt Lake City and I don't think I would enjoy living in Provo (which is much more conservative). 

Pay could definitely be better, but the benefits package is pretty good."

690,Qualtrics,Great opportunity for growth & development,2018-12-19,4.0,Account Executive,"We have a world class product to sell. A very powerful tool for market research & employee/customer insights. 

Fast growing company. If you’re early in your career (say under 30) there is plenty of opportunity to learn & develop here. As an AE you have the opportunity to lead sizeable deals in medium & large accounts, including some billion pound companies - and very well know brands. If you’re right for the role & company, it can be hugely rewarding.

Great location. Great benefits - breakfast, lunch, health insurance & other perks. 
Friendly & supportive colleagues. Nice working environment. Good work life balance.","The supports that help drive a sale - consultative support & technical support are very light - you need to learn to be as self sufficient as possible (hence good opportunity to learn). 

Big challenge personally & have seen this with other AEs- Client success are under trained & under resourced locally (EMEA). The opportunity to grow existing customers is really challenging as the support structure lets them down & leaves them disappointed. In my experience the sweet spot is either end of the spectrum - huge enterprise accounts who are really well looked after or small customers who are self-serve & transactional. The challenge is providing ongoing service to the chunk in the middle. 

Also it’s worth noting that the Qualtrics brand means very little in Europe. Investment in brand & PR appears very light so as a sales rep you have to be prepared to spend 50% of your time as a personal marketing machine (depending how you see it - grind / grunt work or great opportunity for personal development). 

Inflexible working hours and no work from home policy. A little leeway would go a long way in making employees feel empowered & trusted."
691,Qualtrics,"Exciting Place to Be, Amazing People to Work With",2018-12-19,5.0,Senior Account Executive,You'll never meet a kinder group of people to work with. Everyone is friendly and positive and truly cares about you. There's lots of opportunity for career advancement and development. The product roadmap and what we're helping customers do truly is best in class. It's a really exciting place to be.,"There are some growing pains with any organization going through rapid growth (a lot of delays to get things done with everyone being stressed thin in addition to outdated processes). As far as the sales org goes, there's an element of arrogance in the way things are done. There are a lot of areas for growth and opportunity if they looked outside whats worked in the past and what other leading companies are doing."
692,Qualtrics,Finding my Own Way to Flourish in the Role: More than Metrics,2018-12-16,5.0,Product Specialist,"I’m going to get to the advantages of this job, but I wanted to start with why I did not like my role for the first few weeks. I moved to Utah from out of state, and I knew a total of 1 person in the company from beforehand. Since I don’t like commuting, I decided to live near the office. As product specialist you start with a start group anywhere between 3-8 other people who go through basic training with you, and often these people are your first friends. For me, I did not click with any of the people in my start group and not knowing anyone else in town, I was really lonely for the first few weeks of the job. This combined with my inability to hit a 22/ticket a day metric due to the training schedule made me wonder if I had made the right choice coming to Qualtrics. I constantly compared myself to others in my start group who somehow hit the 22 goal. Ultimately, this discomfort and worry was really just growing pains. After passing our training exam, I got to join specialties that used my technical aptitude and trained me in new coding languages. Becoming an expert in these specialties allowed me to find my pace and start to be recognized for my talents. Within the first two months of starting, I went on a trip financed by Qualtrics back to my alma mater! I also started working on a project that provided me with weekly face time with one of the managers; through this project, I have been able to attend weekly meetings with my boss’s boss’s boss and gain visibility into procedures throughout the company. Looking back at the decision I made senior year, I am very happy with where I have ended up. I am at a place where I can grow, develop new technical and professional skills, and be recognized as a hardworking employee. Now to the more typical pros of working as a product specialist! As other reviews state the perks are nice: lots of free food, swag, PTO, and brilliant coworkers. But one of the understated advantages of this job is the ability to save money as I rarely buy groceries since there is so much free food at the office. Additionally, I want to emphasize the laid back nature of the job. Many jobs right out of school will have you working 50-60 hour work weeks for recognition. While you can do that as a product specialist, you do not have to. Work-life balance is encouraged and overtime is provided!","One of the difficult things about being a product specialist is the focus on metrics; yes, taking tickets (calls/emails/chats) is the main part of the job, but I feel the most growth I have gotten in this role are from activities that do not earn me tickets. As a team lead, I am gaining management skills, interfacing with other departments about the product, and spreading knowledge, but I am not compensated for these extra responsibilities in the form of tickets. In the projects that I take on, I find myself adding value to the company that also does not show in my metrics. Ultimately, I have made my peace about not rushing through the role to the promotion or being the top performer; since the role is so flexible to allow you to gain the skills that you want out of it you will need to pick and choose what measures of success you decide to use to assess your own performance."

697,Qualtrics,The core values are more than just statements,2018-12-06,5.0,Enterprise Customer Success Manager,"I've been here for a few months. My background is in management consulting and corporate strategy / finance. I have an MBA from a top 20 program. My impressions so far:
- Check out the core values on their website. Unlike some other companies where I've worked in the past, these statements are the lifeblood of the organization and get discussed/mentioned as they are demonstrated in meetings and conversations throughout each day.
- The culture that has grown out of these core values is optimistic, unified, friendly, and a great example of work hard / play hard.
- These people dream big when setting quarterly / annual / long-term goals, then they EXECUTE! Consistent ~40% growth Y/Y for four years is pretty impressive!
- Very high calibre talent combined with personable, likable, friendly personalities throughout the org.
- Recent acquisition with SAP will accelerate growth in a way that no other avenue could (e.g., IPO).
- 20+ locations globally with several new locations opening each year.
- For my role in particular (enterprise customer success manager), this is a world-class approach to customer success with incredible leaders (former top-tier i-bankers and consultants, all around rock stars), achieving industry-leading renewal and expansion rates.
- Weekly all hands meetings led by C-suite are very transparent and create greater unity and positive energy within the org
- Brand new Macbook Pro with 30-inch monitor on day 1 for all employees :)
- As an experience company, management cares about providing great experiences for their employees. As such, department / team activities are frequent, regular, well-funded, and fun! Not to mention the annual experience bonus! (read more on the website or that)
- Growth creates many opportunities for upward mobility and potential international positions. Especially now that we're getting acquired by SAP.
- Top notch benefits: company pays for all medical insurance premiums, generous coverage on other standard health benefits, free catered lunches M/W/F, several fully-stocked kitchens throughout the building, scooters and skateboards in the building, dogs welcome, frequent distribution of cool company swag, too many other things to mention here!","- Headquarters in Provo, UT, is a blessing a curse. It's nice to not deal with the traffic and congestion of a larger metropolitan area (e.g., Seattle where the other co-headquarters is), but it can be tough to attract top talent to come work here because we aren't in a large metropolitan area. Beautiful setting, though, and close to plenty of outdoor fun!
- High concentration of BYU grads because BYU right down the street and founders from BYU, could be a pro depending on your own personal perspective. The company has made a deliberate effort to diversify the workforce over the past couple years and they're making progress across all levels of the org.
- Compensation for post-MBA role in Utah is competitive but not leading the market. However, benefits make up for most of this."

708,Qualtrics,Product Specialist Role Review,2018-11-28,5.0,Product Specialist,"To start off, the healthcare/vision/dental benefits are awesome, and so is the fact that we have free food for most of the lunches during the week - I barely ever buy groceries. The office is beautiful and has a contagious energy with a start-up feel, even though we've grown a ton since we began. 

One of my favorite things about working at Qualtrics is the freedom we have to fix anything that's not working. As a fast-growing company, there are a million things going on and many of the processes or systems that we have need to be improved. This is not an environment that everyone would thrive in, but if you are a proactive, forward-thinking, creative person, then this is an environment you would thrive in. I've seen my coworkers revamp everything from internal training programs for specialty products, to both our online and internal product documentation, to our recruiting process, to the way we handle support interactions. The core job is a support role (which was very clear to me throughout the recruiting process), but if you're only handling support interactions and you're not satisfied with this, there are PLENTY of projects you can take on to improve other aspects of Qualtrics (as long as the core job function is covered first). 

The next major pro for me is the people. I'm surrounded by creative, hard-working, innovative people that want to grow the business and grow themselves professionally while they're at it. Qualtrics only hires candidates that are overqualified for the role of Product Specialist, and this is because they are expecting you to quickly move through your metrics and take on another role in the rest of the company, armed with your in-depth knowledge of the product. All of the Product Specialists I've come in contact with are very willing to stop what they're doing and help you out if you have a complicated client issue or want to learn something more in-depth, whether that's something about the product, about Qualtrics, or about other skills needed to prosper in your career. I love working with people who are friendly, innovative, and DON'T push you down just so that they can succeed.","The biggest con is probably the fact that the role is a support role. Clients can be very difficult to deal with sometimes, although the overwhelming majority are not difficult and I have had many more positive experiences than negative. But there are customers that are rude, and it can also be hard to instruct customers on complicated processes, especially if they have a very low level of knowledge of Qualtrics and/or technology in general. Some interactions can drain you (especially after you have to delete a million trial accounts), but I knew when I accepted the job that I was signing up for a support role because this was super clear from the beginning of my application process. 

Another thing that I find to be a con is the disorganization/inefficiency around some processes. Finding information without asking someone can be really difficult, and for the first few weeks, I felt like a chicken with my head cut off because there is SO much information you have to learn quickly to excel at the job. The people around me knew the answers to my questions (or had a better idea of where to find the answers), so we've been able to operate without the clearest/most organized processes in place thus far, but this isn't sustainable long term. Because of this, there are people actively working to fix these issues, and once you get adjusted, you learn how to operate with ambiguity and solve problems better than you could before working at Qualtrics. 

The last con that I have is that the salary is low. I justified it for a couple of reasons. This is because the role is for a year at most (if you pass your metrics) before you get a raise and move into another role in the company. The second reason I was fine accepting a lower salary is because of the low cost of living in Utah. It is insanely cheap here, especially coming from the east coast as I did. Also, the benefits make the salary less scary. All of my healthcare, vision, and dental is covered and as I mentioned above I barely have to pay for food because they feed us so much at work. Lastly, I have a great work-life balance, and I personally would rather make a bit lower salary and have a life outside of work instead of making $100,000 and having to work 12-15 hours a day, like most of the people I graduated with that accepted jobs in similar industries."

If you want a nice, stable, job with a good environment and benefits, and nice people, and do not mind being micromanaged, work here.","Almost cult-like. It is a great company and they should be proud of it, but it is weird how highly they think of themselves.

Most of the money is for enterprise reps. They seem to all hit their numbers, but the lower level AE's hit their numbers at a MUCH smaller percentage - less than 5 reps in 2017 in Dallas office were at 100% of quota - only 1 of which was fully ramped quota. Management skews data by talking about people who hit quota, but only because they use ramping reps with smaller quotas to make their numbers look better. Or they use quarterly numbers but dig into the data - most reps do not hit their numbers in consecutive quarters or on any kind of consistent basis, but then they will spike.

They say they hire the best of the best (only 3% of applicants get hired) but they pay very low. This defies logic. Why would you be so picky about who you hire, but then not pay them well enough to keep them?  Arrogance - which runs rampant in this company. 

Upper management who have been here for a long time thinks they can do things in 2018 the way they did them in 2010. Qualtrics is now a consultative sale for large dollars, it is NOT (most of the time) a 3k solution where you can hit your numbers if you make enough dials. The sales are bigger, so the cycles are longer, but upper management has not changed how they approach the sales cycle. Instead they focus on an antiquated quadrant (which most everyone fakes their data) and tell people to make more and more dials, rather than be strategic.  

Speaking of management - just because someone did well in sales, does not mean they are a good manager. Really need to focus on improving the leadership of the management team.

Speaking of the role specifically, you will be over promised A LOT of things in the interview process. Be careful.  You will not make nearly what they say you will unless you get a whale. That is basically the only way people hit their annual numbers is if they are fortunate to get 1 huge sale every 9 months or a year. It is near impossible to hit your number on a quarter by quarter basis. Most of the best reps have a bad 6-9 months then get a huge sale and repeat the cycle."

743,Qualtrics,Avoid the Product Specialist Role as a Recent College Graduate,2018-09-09,1.0,Product Specialist,"The Provo office is gorgeous both inside and out and the outside courtyard is a great place to get away for a few when it's nice out.  The free food provided thrice per week is pretty high quality, as are the available snacks.  Qualtrics employees are mostly very intelligent, personable, and well-spoken.","The following will apply predominantly to the Product Specialist role and should be helpful for recent college graduates.  This review will be long, but I promise it will be worth your time if you are considering this position.  The TL:DR here is if you are qualified to be hired as a Product Specialist I can guarantee you are qualified for far superior opportunities elsewhere.  I highly, highly recommend you do not choose to become a Product Specialist at Qualtrics.  Let's get into it.

First off, it should be made abundantly clear here (since managers will tell you the opposite during the hiring process) that the Product Specialist role is Technical Support.   Your primary and exclusive obligation will be sitting at your computer with a headset on waiting for customers to call in and ask for help.  With few exceptions, the ONLY activity besides answering the phone you will engage in is responding to customer email requests.  You should not expect that you will spend any time doing anything else besides supporting customers over the phone and via email.  You will likely be told during the hiring process that there are opportunities to develop other professional interests and talents as a part of being a Product Specialist, but this is simply 100% false for all but maybe 5-10% of Product Specialists at a time who are asked to complete occasional special projects.

This is where the previous assertion of your qualification comes into play.  The hiring process at Qualtrics for the Product Specialist is quite competitive and is becoming increasingly so.  Qualtrics is looking for students from top-tier schools in the top 10% of their class to be Product Specialists.  I can promise you, as someone who has been a Product Specialist, if you meet their hiring bar you have the ability to be so much more than a tech support representative for $40,000 per year.

There is more that should dissuade you from this position if you are still unsure.  Every single aspect of the Product Specialist position is ""gameified"" to the point where all autonomy and creativity is lost.  Your goal as a Product Specialist is to complete at least 22 tickets (one resolved phone call or email support interaction is one ticket) every day.  Note this number may have grown as it was 20 tickets per day just before I started.  At the end of each quarter your performance and bonus will be rated against every other Product Specialist based purely on volume of tickets completed.  So, while the 22 tickets per day is a general guideline, all your incentives and your manager will encourage you to complete ""as many tickets as possible."" 

The above means you are in constant, direct competition with all other Product Specialists.  Keep in mind this isn't healthy competition that pushes everyone to do their best; this is the kind of toxic competition that encourages cheating and resentment towards other Product Specialists.  During my time at Qualtrics there were MULTIPLE instances in which the entire department of Product Specialists was caught cheating how tickets were handled and recorded to inflate personal productivity numbers.  You will be implicitly pressured to engage in cheating like everyone else since at the end of the quarter your performance will be graded against others, regardless of any absolute metrics such as ""if you hit X number of tickets you did a good job"" that may get thrown around.   The entire system is a ""game"" with special rules as to how different points are calculated and different incentives are earned, and no matter how many times Qualtrics iterates on the ""game"" there will be opportunities for the rules to be exploited.   Qualtrics assumes if you are left to your own devices as a Product Specialist you will choose to sit and  do nothing.  Qualtrics should instead feel obligated to provide such smart and talented employees with a meaningful job they are motivated to do without some grand ""game"" to win at the expense of your colleagues.

If you have gotten this far and still think you, as a likely top-tier student that has proven they are capable of great things, would enjoy being paid a below-market salary to exclusively answer phone calls and emails as a technical support representative in a toxic environment in a role that never progresses anywhere but only grinds the same basic password-reset email requests each and every day, I wish you all the best.  I warn you, however.  You will not be intellectually challenged as a Qualtrics Product Specialist.  You will not develop a significant number of new skills that will benefit you either at Qualtrics or elsewhere.  Your relationship with Qualtrics will be entirely one-sided: Qualtrics will receive a talented support representative that elevates their customer support above their peers but it will come at the expense of your professional development and personal satisfaction.

Please - if you have the option of accepting a Product Specialist role at Qualtrics there are so many other places your talents could take you that are superior.  Cheers, and I hope this helped."
744,Qualtrics,Not what I expected,2018-09-08,1.0,Account Executive,"Innovative company with fast growth. Cool company perks, and great swag. Great place to work if you just want to make calls.","Joined the Sales team as an AE and didn't expect it to be run like a call center. I've never seen a company treat experienced account executives this way. I'm pretty sure not all of the offices are run this way, but the one that I work at the managers walk around the sales floor pushing you to make more dials–they hover over you and micro manage like crazy. It would be nice to get some coaching instead of getting hounded on metrics all day.  All they do is refresh the dashboards all day and push us for more dials dials dials. If you don't hit your metrics or ""points"" you can't leave the office, you literally will be forced to work 10 hours.  I didn't think a company could do that, but they do.  If I make 50 dials I will burn through my accounts, I don't have that many. As an AE I understand the value in building pipeline, I'm already motivated to make money and will do what it takes to be successful, but it's demotivating to be forced to to stay later based on the amount of dials.  I have never been treated this way in my entire career, not even when I started off in sales many years ago.  Did I mention that the leadership is never around?

The sad thing is the management team of this office knows about this, and all they do is double down.  

Avoid this company"
745,Qualtrics,Great company for A type personalities,2018-09-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you are the kind of person that is a perfectionist, never satisfied, constantly wanting to do more and more and more, and a workaholic with few passions outside of work, then this is a great place for you.
Great company trajectory, fantastic office environment, plenty to do.
The CEO really believes in the company and has great vision.
Cool perks like company shutdown between Christmas and New Years and a yearly experience bonus","If  you enjoy work/life balance and are the kind of personality where you do your best and are satisfied with that, probably not the best place for you. 
Managers were promoted to that position with zero training on how to manage people - results in some pretty awful management.
Lower levels of company are treated in a pretty demeaning way, almost like their superiors know that the kind of work they are doing requires no skill and they are trying to pretend like it does.. kinda weird. 
Everyone drinks the Kool-aid.  There's an almost cult-like adoration of Qualtrics. If you don't feel it, you have to pretend like you do."
746,Qualtrics,Good first job but avoid otherwise,2018-08-24,2.0,Account Executive,A great introduction to the Tech industry and good exposure for a first job after college.  A market leader in the enterprise space. Really great and friendly colleagues who want you to succeed and willing to help.  Excellent location. The introduction of more training was also very welcome at the time.,"Extremely high churn at both junior and senior levels (extremely shocking).  A number of changes which happens when you grow but unfortunately management have been unable to tackle this and as a result, the morale in the place was not great. It's a real grind with very little opportunity to do well (only a handful of people stick around longer than two years) The place felt very empty at times. 

Middle management: felt like they were simply taking instructions from the States who dont understand some of the challenges the EU market faces. 

Aggressive hiring targets but not enough focus on improving and helping staff there (probably should focus on this rather than PR and publicity) 

No structure, very poor processes, not enough support particularly for those outside of Enterprise. 

No HR (this should be a big warning sign for those considering joining)

Too much Kool-aid: its great to know that the company is doing well on a global level but maybe recognise that on an individual level particularly in EMEA this success isnt seen. Telling people who work there that the company will be as big as other tech giants doesnt act as a motivator! 

Despite being an survey company I saw no attempt to take on feedback from its most important customers- its employees."

- Education (they put a good emphasis on this)
- Location (bar none in D2)","- The stock options are worth nada. They keep selling it to you in the interview, but it's baloney.

- Your wage will not allow you to work in Dublin comfortably. You will leave Qualtrics partly beacuse of it.

- You are a hamster on a wheel  - you will be apart of a workoholic company, which can have disasterous effects on your own morale and employee engagement. People literally cannot stop talking about how obsessed they are about the product, industry or company. It is fundamentally weird. Work hard, yeah sure, but don't give yourself over completely to these folks. In at 830, out at 530. 
 
- People steal leads and opportunities like there's no tomorrow.  A really warm atmosphere, right?

- Rubbish tech - cool, we get a Macbook, but what about adequate headsets, chairs and tables - they suck for high volume calls (the actual average is not 40/60 calls a day in inbound/outbound, the group pushes the average and you feel neccitated to follow suit, especially if your manager is prompting you).

- IT - Q are ridiculous vulnerable to IT issues and cyber attacks, with no IT department... Sales reps don't have any cyber awareness.

- Hidden management - execs never talk to you, and almost look down on you, unless they are your manager (who are ridiculously stretched btw).

-  Recruitment paints an almost fake picture of the company through their (in hindsight) mad recruitment ads (which only hire men btw?)

- ALLLLLLLLL MALE (XY)

In sum, there are better companies."

Like yeah, we've got the cool perks like yummy catered food, a cool office space with an unreal rooftop view, great benefits with competitive salaries, and an HR team who consistently solicits feedback on how to keep employees happy.  But the real reason I love Qualtrics is that we're in this really exciting spot where the company is doing fantastically from a business side, which allows us to heavily invest in bringing in talented technical folks from various other businesses, creating a dynamic and deep developer team.  The more we hire good, high-quality engineers with experience growing and scaling fast-moving companies, the better we've been getting.   

On a personal note, Qualtrics has afforded me incredible opportunities for early career growth (I'm leading a team here, and it's my first real job!), and I think that the leadership does a great job giving opportunities to people at the org who show potential to be high-impact employees","We've historically built certain things quickly to hit business deadlines, which resulted in us shipping poorly architected and low-quality code for some features.

But I can see how some younger/newer employees might feel lost sometimes. There are also some long-time employees that can be cynical of change, which can sometimes squash enthusiasm. From a sales standpoint, as the company grows and hires, there are often big shifts in sales reps ""books of business"", which can be overwhelming.

Employee evaluation metrics are increasing each quarter, though there is no evidence that workflows have become efficient enough to support this change.

Career opportunities: There isn't a clear correlation between the work you put in and opportunities. Opportunities are given to you based on what benefits the company, not what benefits you.

Lack of work-life balance: There is pressure to work overtime and through lunch for all departments. 2-week paternity leave and 3-month maternity leave (1-month paid).

Transparency: Management is not transparent. Recruiters and managers pitch positions as something much better than they are. Promotions are promised, but no official date is given. And, even when a date may be given, they sometimes change their mind. 

Scrappiness:  This kind of culture is a result of poor internal processes and a lack of documentation of the product. So much time is spent looking for the one person who knows the answer to your question.

If you have that background, come to Qualtrics, you'll have it made","Waaaay oversell roles. If you get an offer, make sure you know EXACTLY what your role is. 

Managers are ex-consultants. They're smart people (not as smart as they think they are), but they aren't people leaders. They are great individual contributors who think they know how to lead.

No yearly raises. You read that right - NO YEARLY RAISES - Not even to keep up with cost of living. You should assume whatever role you come into you are going to keep that salary for several years. The only way you get increased compensation is to promote, and there are set timelines around promotion - it doesn't matter what you do, only how long you have been in role.

Comp and benefits are pretty decent for Utah, but they don't compete with outside of Utah offers.

One person makes a huge difference in your hiring and promotion. If you have a champion here you'll get pushed forward very quickly. If you don't, or the executive over your branch doesn't love you, prepare to be in for the long haul. 

There's a lot of focus on things that don't drive results (if you organize a team outing, or have a focus group on emergent issues etc). If you are willing to smile and be ""customer obsessed"" and ""scrappy"" Read: Panic when something goes wrong. Then you do well.

You advance much faster externally than you will internally. For example, if you want to be a manager (lvl 5 - ask about levels when you come in, that's what matters, not job title) the best route is to do 3 years at another company, then an MBA (or 2-3 years at one of their chosen companies) then come in as a manager. You will NEVER get there in that amount of time working your way up.

If you're looking for a job right out of college, this is a good one. Come in, get 3 years of experience under your belt, but DEFINITELY leave after that. There is only ONE non-sales manager who has been promoted to that level internally. Leverage the quick start they give you into a top tier MBA or a management role within another company."

In the short two years I've been here I've seen issues arrise, issues addressed, and change made.",Qualtrics is still a young company and hires over-qualified candidates and under-pays them. The people that work here are amazing but you almost have to ask them 'why are you working here?'
786,Qualtrics,Review from an SDR perspective,2018-05-06,2.0,Sales Development Representative,"Okay.. Before I begin let me start by saying that this review is from the perspective of a sales development role. I can speak to that role and I have some insight into the lives of Account Executives.  I have heard good things about other roles such as Quni, marketing, ect. but if thats your role this review may not be for you. 

In lue of transparency let me start this review by saying that this is not a terrible atmosphere to work in, Qualtrics does have a lot going for it. There are many positives worth noting. The people you work with day to day are awesome. Out of almost 60 SDR's I can not think of a single individual that isn't a ""good"" person.  I also felt the same ""good person"" vibe from the majority of the leadership. Direct leaders (SDR Team leads/AE team leads) all seem to truly care about the people under them.

 The perks (especially the food) are awesome. Lunch's are really nice, all you can eat and appear to be on a monthlyish rotation. As we've grown we started incorporating other things like a 2 dollar dessert day on fridays and a $5 dollar food option on tuesday. Snacks run out but if you care about that then you dont have the attitude this place is looking for and it wont be for you. I'll touch more on the in office perks later.

The Autonomy is awesome. They really do trust you here. If you are hitting your metrics you can essentially do what you want within reason. If you want to take an hour to go to the gym in the middle of a work day they are okay with it, as long as you hit your metrics. They are also pretty flexible with PTO.

The product is awesome. We easily have the most momentum in the industry. That is not to say that there aren't portions of our product that others dont do better, but we are the most exciting company in the industry and the buzz around our conference and product updates are pretty nice. No matter what I say in the cons portion, I do think Qualtrics (as a company) has a lot going for it and if I could invest money into it I would.","With all the positives though, this place is not without its negatives. 

First, and by far the most important is that leadership is making it INCREDIBLY hard to hit there numbers as an SDR. Out of a group of almost 60, there are maybe 3-4 people that are hitting there metrics month after month. Qualtrics leadership have come to the conclusion that the SDR's need to produce 2 opportunities per rep per week (which is more than doubling our output). So far, the way they are attacking this is by doubling SDR quotas. When I was hired on I had a target of 8 opps per month. By Q4 of this year it is projected to be at 26. As of right now they have upped it to 18. They are trying to rationalize this by saying that we will be working more closely with marketing to produce more targeted campaigns (these have yet to prove that they convert any more than normal prospecting) and that we will have new tools (outreach, drift) that will allow us to work more efficiently (AKA make more calls)... While i'm sure the new tools help some, they do not double the output of a team that already are hitting there targets at an abysmal rate. This leads me to my next con.

Career Trajectory - one reason I joined Qualtrics was the fact that you can climb the ladder really quickly, that is no longer the case. As an SDR you are now expected to be in the role for multiple years on average. From a company perspective this makes sense because you will produce better AE's, but when I was hired on I was promised a timeline of 4-9 months to become a AE1, that is now off the table. A daunting problem for the SDR floor right now is promotions. To be able to promote between SDR roles or from an SDR to an AE role you need to average hitting your metrics over a 6 month period. This is a problem for everyone as, given the new metrics, virtually no one on the team is on pace to hit there metrics over an elongated timeframe. It is hard to move your career forward when you dont promote, and you cant promote if you dont hit your metrics. 

Another important note is that AE1's and AE2's are in a similar position where it is difficult to hit metrics. I have literally seen AE1's break down because they feel that not even an enterprise rep could succeed with the book of businesses they were given. 

TACOS - for anyone interviewing here you should learn TACOS, it's our internal value system. Transparency, All In, Customer Obsessed, One Team and Scrappy.... A few issues with this:

From a transparency standpoint, there are some issues. One example that was recently shared with me is that for months everyone on the SDR floor was told that their variable compensation was completely based on opportunities sources.  We were told this by all of our direct managers, and it was a lie. 85% of our compensation was based on opps and 15% was based on what they expected us to produce in closed revenue. Very few individuals in outbound actually produce closed revenue, so in essence that meant we weren't getting paid what we were told we were... There are other minor examples but transparency around things that will effect you are sometimes difficult to come by. There is a monthly ""ask me anything"" with leadership and the other leadership which is nice, but you need to ask the hard questions, and often times you dont know that you need to ask it (like with the compensation example)...

In office perks are beginning to be really frowned upon depending on which team your with. Bringing your dog to work has become universally looked down upon to the point that multiple people have been pressured into leaving them home. There are also (unconfirmed but understandable) rumors that people have been denied promotions because they bring there dog to work and that is viewed as making them less productive. Other in office perks like ping pong / basketball / pool ect have become taboo to the point that you rarely see people using them during the day. Thats not to say they are not available or nice.. they are.. but dont expect to use them every day without being looked down upon. 

To sum up, its a place filled with nice people but be careful and ask the right questions before you accept an offer. If career growth is your goal, be worried about what is happening here right now. Dont plan on hitting your on target earnings, and be weary about what the recruiting team tells you because I know myself and most other people I talked to were lied to during our recruitment process.

787,Qualtrics,Best sales culture I've witnessed,2018-05-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture, and company trajectory are amazing

Sales Culture specifically:  everyone is extremely driven, but overarching all that is a genuine desire and care for each other to do well - and the teamwork that generates is testament to this.

Company trajectory: the company is one of the most exciting tech companies in the globe.","We grew so quickly in the Sydney office that we had to split the office - half on level 41, and half on level 39 which was a shame. But hey, the view ain't bad on 41!"

It is a high energy, hard working, fun company to work for. The people are great whereby the environment is very much a collaborative one.  The office location is superb as it is right bang in the middle of Dublin city. It was also great to see the sales organisation beat the revenue target in the quarter 1 - people are feeling really good about 2018....",There is a lot of focus on cold calling but I guess it is an new business sales motion.
790,Qualtrics,Manager,2018-04-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great Product and awesome people to work with,"Highly political, you’d have people with much less experience getting promoted because they report to head of finance and because they take credit for others work."
791,Qualtrics,Greatest place to work in the world,2018-04-07,5.0,Research Services,"I love literally everything about this place. Free lunch practically every day, snacks everywhere, soft serve ice cream, and cookies on Fridays. Scooters, comfy couches,  massage chairs, walking desks, and acres of beautiful gardens with strong WiFi to get work done in the shade of a tree. The benefits are unreal - 100% of health insurance premiums paid, 3% 401k contributions (even if you contribute $0), $2,500 a year into your HSA, 2 weeks of paternity leave, and $1,500 towards a vacation experience (on top of PTO). 

Most importantly, it’s an easy product to get behind, I’m making an impact on the world, there aren’t useless meetings, no micromanaging, I’m surrounded by smart, positive, hard-working people, and I have FUN. I look forward to going to work every day.","The only downside is that as the company grows its slowly losing the fun, fast-paced, tech start-up feel. It’s starting to feel more like a large, bureaucratic, corporation. Nothing specific and nothing that can be avoided. It has to happen as the company grows. Just kind of a bummer."

Recruitment:
Be sure to do your own research on job titles at Qualtrics. Reach out to someone on LinkedIn to find out what the job description really is. Recruitment doesn't know the day to day details of your job and a lot of the time you get sold on a job that you didn't sign up for. 

Onboarding:
This process can be really intimidating especially when you are being hired on with another 20 employees and nothing is organized. In research services your job is to work with ""existing clients"". There is a finite pool of those companies and a growing number of AE's. As a result you spend most of your time looking for existing clients that do not already belong to another Research Services Rep. Towards the end of your training/onboarding you should receive a book of business. Notice I say should... You may receive this anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months later than you are promised and it is likely that the accounts in your book are unworkable (no longer have a license, are a single user account, etc.). Even though your book of business may not be accurate (if you have received one at all) you are still expected to hit your quota (either $10K, $30K, or $50K depending on when you promote to a PR1).

Promotion:
In this role you will be assigned to a team which will be lead by a team lead. Some team leads are great, provide great training, and have great experience for you to learn from. Those are few and far between. For most managers (team leads) this is their first time managing and the fact that there is no HR department really is a recipe for disaster. This company has over 1,500 employees and no HR department... that's a lawsuit waiting to happen. I have heard everything from people being personally insulted by managers to cases of sexual harassment. Watch out.

Culture:
Honestly, the culture can be toxic. You will hear managers and their bosses publicly denouncing people for leaving the company.  Also, if you plan on leaving do NOT put in your two weeks. Tell them that you are quitting on your last day. Multiple people have been asked to leave (even escorted out) when they have done the courteous thing and given management two weeks or more to make a transition. Managers forget that they should be working for their team. You will hear most people talking about looking for other job opportunities within your first month of work there. There are also individuals there who love to gossip. 

Operations:
.....are a mess. In my opinion the company is trying to grow as fast as it can (IPO on the mind) and your personal success as a sales rep is not a priority. If they need to hire 50 new people to meet their numbers they will and if that hurts the existing employees because there are not enough accounts to go around then that's too bad."

It's glorified cold calling, territories are so watered down you'd be lucky to have any chance of making targets, and the whole place is geared towards hitting cold call metrics over any upskilling or development of staff (despite what they sell you in the interview).
Do some research on the HQ and the underlying culture, it can be a bit weird if you're not from a religious background.

Dogs in the office","CEO is a joke, and mistreats his employees Definitely thinks he's the best thing to happen in tech, but in reality he's a front man for the real brains behind the business who didn't want  to be the face of Qualtrics. Met him multiple times, went to his house, won competitions which granted me an audience with him, and even shared multiple projects with him. Despite all our interactions, he still introduced himself to me each time as if we'd never met. Not an isolated scenario - happens to most people who work with him. Self-absorbed, and clueless man.

Opportunities are almost zero. Even when you get promoted (if you can), your book of business does not change like they promise - only your quota.

Very cutthroat culture

Very disjointed departments, lack of communication, and hard to get anything done internally. Other departments will often kill good deals due to incompetence.

Management lies to show more positive numbers to their investors, clients, employees, and public. Sub 16% of reps actually hit their quotas each quarter.

They are actively firing reps, because they over-hired for a product that is misplaced in the market and has no realistic quantifiable value impact for customers. They still need to show growth for their investors in order to IPO, so they'll still hire college kids to throw into the meat grinder,  but you'll notice they've slowed their hiring for the Provo office.

Product sucks - SurveyMonkey and other products have caught up to it, and are far cheaper.

Management uses scare tactics to keep their employees. They parade around companies nearby who have failed to let people know the grass is not greener. When people leave for better jobs, they slander them - even their best employees. Definitely not how a company should operate.

Heavy politics. If you're not Mormon, in ""the boys club,"" or suck up to your boss, you won't get ahead.

Recruiters lie to candidates. The money potential and opportunities are not actually there. You could be the smartest, hardest, best sales person out there - but unless  you're part of the aforementioned, you will only spin your wheels."

It's extremely hard and completely decided by people you don't work with (that is, outside of sales). And then if one of the top executives doesn't agree with the decision the committee came to, he can just veto it.

As for sales: it's extremely hard. Most reps don't hit quota. And any lower tiered rep isn't really set up for success. If you're interviewing, make sure to ask what level of AE you would be (1-5). If you're a one or two, either don't take it or expect to only be there for a year."

825,Qualtrics,Sales above all else,2017-12-06,1.0,CSM,"High hiring standards lead to amazing co-workers. Smart driven people on the front lines. Amazing culture, transparency at the executive level allows you to really understand where the leadership is trying to take things","Because of the executive transparency, it is obvious that the number one priority to leadership is revenue growth at all costs. As I write this we have 700+ sales reps to only ~350 engineers.....let that sink in.

Now because revenue growth is placed of above all else, numerous unneeded stressors are placed on all departments:

- Engineering is worked to death to build new features and functionality to meet the growing list of new client expectations. 

- Support has no visibility to the intricacies of newly sold, highly complex, deals which limits their ability to actually assist with client issues

- Client success is forced into a position of having to manage client expectations of quality/value the product delivers rather than helping the client maximize it.

- Implementation has an enormous backlog and pressures consultants to simply work more to cover the gap


the transparency in TACOS is nice but you know whats really missing from the companies core values that you see in most other successful tech companies?: an emphasize on QUALITY. you'd think a company trying to position itself as a leader in product/brand experience market would understand the number one contributor to a great experience is the product or service actually meeting the needs of the customer. The insistence to sell at all costs, even when the company is not capable of delivering a polished, supportable, product, is the root cause of almost every con you'll see in every negative review on this website"

829,Qualtrics,Worst decision I ever made,2017-11-10,1.0,Account Executive,Lots of free food and free tickets to the Summit concert every year,"I waited over a year to write this review to see if my hatred of Qualtrics died down, it hasn't. I moved from out of state for the job, one of the first people in the sales department to do so, and I regret it. 

Qualtrics seemed like the perfect company at first. Seemingly fun culture, cool location in the mountains, and a real opportunity to make something of myself with an up and coming tech company.  That lasted a few months, I had one of the last glimpses of the company it used to be. 

As an Account Executive at Qualtrics I was treated like absolute garbage. There is zero training. They mainly hire entry level sales people right out of college with little to no real experience, do not provide those people with training, and expect them to function as experienced enterprise sales reps within a few months. They don't invest in their team and are unrealistic about ramping. The team that I was stuck on was mostly unfriendly and unsupportive. Management ruled through fear, constantly making me feel that I'd be fired at any moment. I also had 12 territory changes in 12 months. As soon as I'd start to develop a territory and make some headway they would take it from me and give it to someone else. I would then get to see someone else close my deals and collect my commission. The one time I brought the problem up to management that person ripped into me and said if I didn't like things I could try my luck somewhere else. 

Meanwhile I would see people who were part of the ""in crowd"" be handed deals they didn't actually work to close (because management was compensated when their team members hit quota more than if they closed those deals themselves) and those people were making great money and being promoted, despite not actually working for it. 

I almost went broke working there. I was depressed and hated going to work every day. I lost all confidence in myself to be a salesperson, in no small part because my management told me I sucked at it. 

After I was put on a PIP (A ""Performance Improvement Plan"", which has nothing to do with improving performance) I quit. 

Im now one of the top reps at my new company and turns out my problems selling at Qualtrics legitimately had nothing to do with me, I've heard the same thing from numerous other friends who have left Qualtrics and gone elsewhere and are thriving. And I hear that frequently because Qualtrics is losing anywhere from 20-50 employees per month. I love my job now and that makes me even more bitter about what Qualtrics put me through. It was unnecessary. 

I continue to hear about my friends who struggle there, people who are treated poorly and without basic respect on a daily basis, and who were blatantly lied to about the job and their trajectory by the Qualtrics recruiting team.

Stay away from this place at all costs."

* Food
* Awesome Coworkers
* Fast Paced
* Growing Company
* Fun atmosphere

Qualtrics has been a fun ride for the last few years, but like most people who are approaching Tier 4 of pay, I've realized that there is no future at Qualtrics. You have to go back to school because anyone at a higher level than you has more school than you and Qualtrics makes no exceptions for hiring, even loyalty to the company. I've never worked with a more fun and talented team, but they pretty much push you out after a few years due to their lack of investment in you as an employee.","* No Paternity Leave
* Vacation days don't roll over (use or lose)
* Bro Culture
* No investment in employees
* Hard to move up
* Most management hired from outside
* No plan to develop talent internally
* Low pay
* Bonuses very ambiguous
* The recruiting team posts fake reviews on Glassdoor...

The Qualtrics culture has shifted in the past while to being like any other tech firms in the area but with lower pay. It's still a fun place to work, but be sure to avoid the many opportunities to be shamed publicly on the internal messaging system. There is a ""gratitude"" culture that has begun where any questioning of direction/decisions is met with ""You should be grateful that the benevolent company has given you this opportunity/chance/event/activity."" 

Another interesting aspect is the severe lack of opportunities to participate in any project that could be a risk to the company. They don't take risks on their employees; there is always a safety net so no one really hits their full potential. It's not somewhere you can walk away from saying ""I had some really cool projects that would have failed without me."" 

As mentioned previously, it's a great place to work for a while, but don't expect to stay. They don't make any investment in their employees so at some point you realize that you won't be moving into a leadership role even though you've been scoring wonderfully on your performance reviews. You don't meet the technical bar and there will be no exceptions. Same goes for making a move to Eng without a degree even with years of experience and loyalty to the company. No exceptions.

Also, although we have offices around the world don't expect to transfer offices. I've seen it happen twice, and both were under the rug. It's just not something that's allowed."
839,Qualtrics,More than 1 role at Qualtrics,2017-10-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I I would summarise as:
* Challenging work, friendly customer base and good natured, intelligent colleagues. 
* Management definitely don't get everything right but the investment in addressing 'problem areas' as raised by Employees has been refreshing to watch over the last 3 years. In my experience there's always something that's 'broken', be it a department that's under resourced, a function that doesn't exist or an obvious benefit we lack. In my experience these issue are addressed and it's a matter of 'when' not 'if'.  This doesn't always happen immediately (which can cause short term pain) but in 90% of cases it does over time.","I can see why newer employees get upset with the lack of support on things like 'career progression' and 'training materials' etc. The company has grown up very quickly and was much smaller a very short time ago. 

The fact is, new hires / prospective recruits see a well established company that has a lofty reputation. With that comes the expectation of getting properly trained, having clear career path and properly established processes - as they should.  While some teams have these now, others don't. Messaging to new hires is important."

They tell you when you start as an AE1 that your on target earnings should be nearly 80k. Then you find out your first day that if you hit all your ramping targets you only make 60k on the year. That is effed up. The account allocation is a complete joke. Do not join this company as an AE 1-3.  Honestly even some AE 4's struggle because the original 400 reps have locked down any good account.

860,Qualtrics,Major Employee Experience Gaps,2017-08-18,1.0,Account Executive,"Great Visionary Leadership- Senior Leadership has a great vision for it's future and aims high to achieve great things. 

Health Insurance- it's excellent. Probably the best you can ask for.

Perks- lunch 3 times a week is nice to have. PTO is good.

Events-the marketing team does a good job with events.","Overall, the best sales opportunities are taken and the quality of the work/jobs are not very good. They've grown the sales team way too big, leaving low quality accounts for the rest. This makes it difficult to perform against a steeply increasing quota, so expectations are unrealistic given the accounts you typically have. Only 30% of reps are hitting quota each quarter, and a very few hit OTE. As a sales rep, you have to generate your own business with zero to very little help from supporting reps and marketing. (aka A LOT of cold calling and cold emails. If you're doing it as they expect, you'll prospect for several hours a day.) You sell highly priced enterprise-level products, so it’s hard to win deals against companies that have a better SMB offering. Turnover is extremely high because sales reps are dissatisfied. Qualtrics is largely unwilling to change many of its problems, so it continues to deal with high levels of dissatisfaction and turnover. They are pushing to hire as many people as possible to look better at IPO. I wonder what will happen once they do that. Unless you are coming in as an AE 4 or Enterprise rep, where you get better accounts, go elsewhere! 

Salary- you will be underpaid. For B2B sales, especially a unicorn backed by big VC firms, the base pay is well below competitive levels. People are leaving because of this. 

Poor Training- they are severely lacking in sales training. Qualtrics = difficult value/solution sell. If you are young and/or somewhat new to B2B sales, it will make it more difficult to find success. If you get lucky with a good manager though, that could help balance out the deficiency here.

Tools for success- As new sales rep you won't receive a laptop until you hit your quota. The nature of the sales job basically demands a laptop for success (meetings, client meetings/sales demo's in conference rooms, etc). Not having the tools to succeed is extremely frustrating.

SDR Role- this is an awful job. You literally mine contacts, cold call and cold email, all day. There is nothing fulfilling about this role. When you're promoted, you'll become an AE 1, where you'll get poor quality accounts that you can cold call into. They've improved the process of learning to become a more effective AE, but still the job is an unreasonable, unfulfilling grind.

Sales Ops- incompetent and ineffective. Poor data, account organization/distribution, and other failed initiatives, plus an unwillingness to fix the issues is what sales ops is known for. If the q would fix these problems, they would save sales reps 1-3 hours per day of wasted time. 

Disorganization- it's highly disorganized. As fast as they've grown, some of these growing pains are understandable. But this badly needs fixing. 

Marketing- you will have no support from them. It’s the black hole of Qualtrics. There is incompetence and an unwillingness to spend (except for on events, where they spend insane amounts of money). Inbound leads are almost unheard of. The coordination between marketing and sales is practically non-existent. Marketing doesn't know how to do effective lead and demand gen and the results show.

In summary, don’t work here. You will be miserable like the majority. The employee experience is severely lacking in many areas. Qualtrics needs to close the experience gap. (How’s that for radical candor?) Work for a company that will place you in a position where you will have the tools, support, and opportunity to be successful. Don’t fall for the hype."

873,Qualtrics,Promoting from within is great until it isn't,2017-06-22,3.0,Account Executive,"Great benefits, great learning experience","This will be from the lens of someone in sales (lower tier Account Executive):

1)

What happens when you have success and you are really cheap? You promote from within. Make sure to label it as a ‘strength’ though versus a weakness. This is something Qualtrics has excelled at on multiple accounts. 

Sometimes promoting from within can be great. If you are in a static market, it makes sense. There is little change in the everyday business and sales process. However, if you are in a startup environment where everything is constantly changing, you're setting yourself up for a bad time.

That bad time is in full effect right now. These homegrown legacy sales managers and region leads have no idea what or why the customers of today are purchasing Qualtrics (especially as it relates to SMB, Mid-). To sum it up, their mindset is outdated. This is more than a problem. These same individuals are the people who are doing ALL of the training.

I would love a competent leader from an outside organization to sit in on one of these sessions. I do not remember the last training that was well received. It’s comical at this point. This communication gap needs to be resolved.


2)

Attrition is high. Not sorta high - I mean extremely high.  Out of a group of 9 or 10 sales reps on my team from when I started, only two of the are left. Also, two of the most tenured reps in the company have also left in the last few months, too.

This is caused by many different factors, namely 1)  account allocation 2) hiring too many quota carriers and 3) data in our CRM. The only individuals who hit are ones who either got really lucky with account allocation or the reps who have been here for eons and have great accounts.

While leadership says that they don’t care if attrition is high as long as their ‘best’ reps stay, that’s unproductive. The only way someone gets promoted is if they have a solid territory. The problem is that these territories are divided up arbitrarily. I've seen so much potential talent walk out that door because of unfair circumstances.

But wait, am I just making excuses? I don' know - ask the 75% of the software sales team that didn't hit their quota."
874,Qualtrics,Qualtrics Manipulates Glassdoor Reviews with Employees,2017-06-22,1.0,Technical Support,"A kid job best staffed by recent college graduates.  If you are a recent college graduate, and want to have your soul sucked out of you while always maintaining a smile and constantly publicly professing how awesome Qualtrics is, this is the job for you.  Also, if you love to replace all 'K's and 'C's in your communications with 'Q's instead, this is also the right fit for you.  If you love to work your tail end off with little to no recognition (financial or otherwise), this is the right job for you.  If you love to always have the taste in your mouth that you are working very hard to make a couple of people very rich, this is the right job for you.  If you love having constant change in management and senior management, with almost 100% of these ""leaders"" coming from outside of the company, this is the perfect job for you.  If you like to be more knowledgeable about all things Qualtrics than your boss, this is the perfect job for you.  Oh, and if you like skateboards, basketball courts, flat-billed hats, arrogance, and free cereal, then you should look no further than Qualtrics.","Hmm, where to start?  Let's start with the fact that multiple employees are asked, often, to submit reviews to Glassdoor to ""drown"" out negative reviews.  I have no doubt that this review will be followed by multiple super positive and happy posts about why Qualtrics is the best place on planet earth to work.  Such manipulation and deceitfulness is par for the course at a company that claims to help other organizations solve employee engagement problems while having some of the most disengage employees I have ever met.  

Key questions to consider when thinking about working at Qualtrics: 

Why is turnover so extremely high at Qualtrics?  Over a five year span, we are coming up on near 100% turnover...

Why is pay so low?

Why are there no real career progression opportunities?

Why is all senior leadership so arrogant, and why are they so inaccessible to employees?

Why are all leadership positions staffed with external hires?

Why does so much favoritism exist in a company that professes merit-based recognition?

Why have four executives left in the last four years?"

882,Qualtrics,An honest feedback. Hopefully it helps...,2017-05-23,2.0,Account Executive,"If you are considering joining this company, you are probably going to meet the smartest people you'd ever have a chance to work with. I really mean that ! 

The work environment is great, the colleagues are amazing. Think about it this way, Qualtrics is like a Family.

There are plenty of team activities/nights out, drinks at the bar at the end of the week. Yes, there is a proper pub and you can get free draft beer, wine, etc...

The office location is pretty central, it is Stephen's Green. So whether you live South, North, West of East you'll always find an easy way to commute to work.

If you are considering joining Qualtrics, if you are at the beginning of your sales career and if you can afford working extremely hard for a relatively low pay, you should go for it. The reason being that Qualtrics is actually a great school. You'll work so hard and you'll learn so much so quickly that wherever you move afterwards, you gonna actually find it easy to sell.","Well, I'd like to say where to start...

- The first thing to keep in mind is don't trust all the comments that are actually out there ! They are actually fake and written by management because the scores are getting low and candidates are not accepting offers...things saying that the company is great but because it is fast paced it is facing some issues, that's like criticizing yourself with compliments...

- Not a global company: having offices in multiple locations doesn't make your company global or international...The guys in the US definitely need some diversity. The products and marketing is developed for the US and it is great. But it is a nightmare when you are penetrating European markets. The guys in the US think that they don't have to change anything in their product and whatever works in the US, will be working in Europe...A huge effort on localization has to be made. Not only on translation but also on practices!  

- If you are an experienced Sales Rep in Dublin and you have the choice of taking another offer, stay away from Qualtrics ! Less than 10% of the Sales Reps are hitting their Quota ! Unless you are an enterprise rep based out of London, you are most likely getting a patch of accounts that have never been touched before ! You'll need to go through every single one of these and source all the contacts...Enterprise Reps in the UK are getting all the good stuff and you are left with small companies in random parts of England that are not a good fit for the solution and won't end up paying for it because it is an enterprise solution anyway...

- I wish there was a stronger synonym for unrealistic. This is what I would have used to describe the Quotas within Qualtrics ! Actually, it will probably take you 6-9 months before closing your first deal...

- Compensation is  very low compared to the industry average. They will obviously give you a good basic if you are experienced but don't expect to get your OTE before 2/3 years...This is pretty standard. The more experienced you are, the higher your salary is gonna be, but also the higher pressure you gonna feel. Because if you don't deliver quickly, you'll be pushed out...

- Employees attrition: I guess a quick search on Linked In about all the people that left recently would give you a clear indication about that...

- Training & coaching: one word, inexistant ! The new hires training is a mess and I rarely saw people coming out of this one and having all the resources to start selling. Coaching is almost inexistant, and managers spend their time micro-managing you instead of coaching you.

Management: there are some exceptions, but 90% of the managers are external hires. You are basically being managed by someone who never sold the product before and can never guide you through the sales process nor help you overcome potential challenges you may be facing on a long and complex sales process. Some of them never even sold cloud-based solutions...
They spend most of their day tracking how many cold calls you made, how many meetings you scheduled and how many opportunities you created. 

""Transparency"": it is one of the company's pillars but it is just for the image. There is no transparency whatsoever and they are only communicating about stuff they want to communicate about...It is like a propaganda where the idea is to make employees think that everything is perfect, that Qualtrics is a life-time opportunity and that there is no company out there like Qualtrics."

- Uneven distribution of accounts
- Clients are overpromised and under-delivered so support and professional services are worked to the bone trying to help clients who were promised things that the platform doesn't do.
- Arrogance that is almost tangible. You can feel it. It's disgusting.
- Hypocrisy - they claim transparency but then discourage anyone from talking about things like salary, stocks, or going public.
- They know people are giving them bad reviews on glassdoor so they have people that work there flood it with good reviews. I know for a fact this happens because I remember my manager asking us all to write a review so we could push out a bad one. 
- If Qualtrics isn't your life, you are looked down upon. No work/life balance. You are expected to put in crazy hours, and if you don't, you are judged. It's all about perception, though. I could ""work"" a 10-hour day and do nothing but sit on my computer and watch youtube, but I'd be looked at more fondly than a person who works an 8-hour day but does solid work.

You'll never hear anyone speak rudely, and praise is given upon milestones, albeit almost as emotional blackmail to keep you working ridiculous hours.","Words aside, actions show some pretty clear callousness towards engineers by middle and upper management.

1) Frequent separate off-sites and meetings between upper and middle management to form plans and deadlines, which engineers don't get any say in sanity checking. (Maybe we get a glimpse in ""view-only"" documents when they're done?)

2) No say for engineers in coming up with deadlines, which are crafted and presented to us as fait accompli even when they're pushing us to our very limits. I find this extremely disrespectful. We have to actually implement this, often to the sacrifice of our family or personal time. Why do we get the least say on estimating the workload when we have a better idea?

I can understand product priorities/directions coming from above, but it is absolutely ridiculous that you assign work demanding so many hours a week to be at ""standard"" level.
 

3) No respect for work life balance or recognition of extra effort. 50 to 60 hours weeks at a conservative estimate, including off-hours deployments, on call and weekend coding. And this is considered ""standard"" effort, it's not even enough to move you close to promotion or advancement by default.

4) No regular indexed salary raises, even though cost of living is going up in Provo valley (look at the real estate prices). You only get a raise upon your promotion every few years, which is likely to not greatly exceed how much cost of living has gone up since then.

5) Huge reliance on the ""imposter syndrome"" in engineers - ""if you're not able to finish the deadlines we set for you in 45 hour weeks, it's because you're inefficient or made mistakes"".
Hello, coding is a creative, complex process! You're taking advantage of people's desire to do well to drain the life blood from them.

6) The initial engineers who joined qualtrics 4-5 years ago are amongst the worst perpetuators of this culture. It's one thing to have this lifestyle when you're a company with only a few dozen engineers, and these kind of hours/demands can actually get you advancement. When you have hundreds of engineers, pushing this culture to them when advancement is slower is exploitative.

7) You have cockamamie idiotic company wide OKRs presented like ""increasing output per engineer by 40%"". I kid you not. If that isn't a huge red flag for a ""work your employees like dogs"" without respect for their worth, I don't know what is."

The CEO is very bright and tries his best to keep his employees in the loop with the vision of the company. They have great benefits and a cool office/equipment.",It is extremely cliquey and there are too much politics involved in sales. The book of business you're given as an AE makes it almost impossible to succeed or hit quota. You will not get paid what your worth here and lower management only sees you as a number rather than an actual person. It always wasn't like this but it is getting more micromanaged as time goes on.

Also, great benefits, great people (they really only hire the best of the best), and amazing culture.","When I was there, my role wasn't very well defined, which is great it a lot of ways since it allowed me to work on all kinds of projects, but it was frustrating to not always know what was expected of me on a day-to-day basis.

- Lots of opportunity to make a mark, be creative and have an impact.
- The EMEA business is just getting started - best days are still to come.","- Quarterly ratings system is flawed and unfair, while it's supposed to be the 'wisdom of the crowds', your success depends on your manager.
- Becoming increasingly difficult to 'get things done', too many people involved in decision-making process and too many approvals needed.
- Executive leadership are not transparent enough and there's a lack of ownership on too many initiatives. Seems to be becoming quite political, with a lack of clear direction forward.
- Very little direction as to what you need to do to be successful - inconsistent."

- Opportunities to travel are plentiful if you are a good performer
- Pay for non-sales staff has improved immensely in the past year and benefits are constantly increasing
- Location is fantastic with great perks like a bar and free food","- High growth means departments are often overstaffed. Depending on your role, working late can be extremely common and not reflected in pay or otherwise.
- Organisation can be very sales-centric, easier to feel undervalued if you are not sales staff
- Company claims to value 'transparency' and whilst this is true in many respects, there can be a frustrating lack of communication between departments and offices sometimes
- Bonus structure makes it difficult for non-metric-based staff to show performance and really benefit from the bonus system
- Organisation can be very US-centric, with a lack of prioritisation of EMEA-based issues. 
-Maternity leave policy, whilst improving, is not great"

Whether it's coaching, communicating or collaborating, each interaction continues to keep me engaged and inspired.  The pace at which Qualtrics is growing, and as such which we work at, is incredible, and honestly not for everyone .... The ability for me to solve for problems that haven't been solved for before, plus the super smart people I work with everyday, are a couple of the reasons I enjoy working here.","Sometimes it can feel like pushing water uphill when you need to get things done quickly, as the decision makers are still heavily centered in the US. However, the frustrations that this causes is counter balanced with the fact that we're finding our way, turning the obstructions into possibilities and setting the stage for a truly successful business here in EMEA."

The opportunity that comes with that for everyone is there to see and is visible in existing employee stories already. However it is tough as a result. It is also not instant and requires a commitment. However this is personally what I signed up for so am delighted.
Only join if you want to add fuel to the fire and be part of a story that you will talk about for years to come.","Due to the growth there is continually a lot of stuff ""broken"".

- Co-workers are hard-working, smart and fun to hang around","- Transparency is talked about at the higher levels and it happens to an extent but not completely.
- Low pay because we know how much we're worth in the market.  They typically pay 10-20% below market so if you're looking to be valued, look elsewhere. 
- On the sales team, there's the boys club so you'll want to avoid that if you don't fit their mold

-The location. This is something people need to be aware of if they are coming out of state. The office is located in Provo which is a heavily populated LDS Mormon area. Be prepared for a culture shock. No bars, tight nit cliquey community, not your ideal place to live if you are a twenty-something college grad. If you want to live in SLC or Park City it is quite the commute but Qualtrics accommodates with Frontrunner passes or a shuttle if you live in PC.

-Access to leadership, including the executive team, is unparalleled anywhere, particularly a company of this size and growth rate. “Transparent” value of the company really rings true here.
-Company is hitting financial goals that most companies in the Bay and Utah alike wouldn't even be able to imagine, making for an exciting exit in the future
-The growth of the newer lines of business and sectors is mirroring that of Qualtrics' initial ""rocket-ship"" expansion, with momentum only growing stronger each month.
-Great benefits/401k plan
-Huge engineering push in the past year (with opening of Seattle) will allow for quicker innovation timeline
-Work along very smart people (many Ivy League/top school grads), and everyone in Utah is incredibly kind

Client Success:
-Particularly in Client Success (but also in other divisions), managers encourage you to find areas for improvement and empower you to implement solutions, both within and beyond the scope of your team
-The ability to collaborate cross-functionally is a huge plus, as it gives you a great strategic/360 view of the company allows you to work with Sales, Engineering, Support, Marketing, etc. 
-CSMs get to have a high impact with Fortune 500 brands
-Fast personal growth due to level of responsibility, the stakes of the clients, purview of role

Overall, the careers opportunities both within your division and outside of it are there for the taking, as the promotion statistics are pretty astounding. I also relocated from a large city to work at Qualtrics, and the transition has been great.","- Engineers don’t give frequent enough updates regarding development timelines and projects

979,Qualtrics,"Growing company. Need more leadership, better compensation",2016-08-02,2.0,Client Success Representative,"Coworkers. Smart, scrappy, fun people who will be successful in life. Benefits are good, new headquarter building will be beautiful. Open floor and collaborative spaces. Dogs come with you to work. Company is rocketing. You will be smarter here just by sitting around these people.","Think twice before betting your career on Qualtrics. A good starting point, but not looking like a great long term choice. 

Qualtrics does a good job of selling the idea of joining a rocket ship during meteoric rise. Problem is, not a lot of employees benefit from the rocket ship. Leadership is hired from everywhere else. So when a recruiter talks to you about internal opportunities of a rocket ship, don't buy into it. Revenue is rocketing, but the company is frugal and does what it can to not spend more on employees. I exclude benefits, which get better each year. Don't expect much pay or opportunity to advance from within. This is really true for experienced hires. Salary never increases.

Client Success is changing too. Management has made it clear that we have to prove our value to the company by expansion (aka selling more products). It feels more and more like we have a quota, just like sales. It is a bad place to be when you feel like you need to prove your worth to your own company all the time. This is a downer part of the culture.

Management in Client Success are managers not leaders in any definition. Managers are so focused on numbers (renewals and opportunities) and take no time to lead the team in any way. It's no surprise given the pressure of the company to prove our worth, but I've never seen any other division where there is zilch investment in the wellbeing, career development or coaching of the team they work for. It's utterly maddening. Career progression and development are an afterthought at best. It is like the opposite of LinkedIn or other employee first companies out there.

There is a sad ceiling to your career in Client Success at Qualtrics. Career path is a concern that is voiced by in this group, but nothing real has been done to address it. The concern is always brought up in town halls and in other glass door reviews, but management just doesn't get it. One or two slots for team lead positions does not settle the concern we all have, that there is hardly any chance of big career milestones in this group. One of the selling points of this group was that it would grow quickly and leadership positions would come along the way. Well we've only grown a tiny bit and hardly any new opportunities have been offered. A bad over sell of what this team was supposed to be.

I think to myself if Client Success managers realize the delicate situation they are in. We are a talented group of guys and girls with good education and experience. Opportunities are out there, and the status quo will not keep everyone around forever. We are so stretched thin now, if half has many people leave as are open to other jobs, our books are going to suffer. I believe management thinks it is tougher to exit than it really is. The Smiths and a few others will receive life changing $ in an IPO. The rest of us will get a scrap, but that's far less valuable than making the right career choices in the long run. Before joining remember that all stock units are gone if you leave before the IPO."

983,Qualtrics,Work with Customers (non Sales),2016-07-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Exciting to work at a place where trajectory is up. Revenue continues to increase at surprising rate. Growth oriented. Open atmosphere. Charismatic CEO.,"Others have mentioned it, I agree: if you're not in Sales, you are 2nd tier employees at Qualtrics. 

That's tough enough by itself, but realize that Qualtrics is not an employee friendly company. Company would counter that with its benefits package (which is decent), but culture is so much more important. Day to day life is dictated by culture, and Qualtrics culture is not employee friendly. Company is divisive, judgmental and employees are first to blame if something goes wrong. It's hard to be happy and work hard when you feel like you have to constantly watch over your shoulder. Never worked in an environment so implicitly threatening to employees before coming here. 

One of Qualtrics claims is that employees bet on Qualtrics and Qualtrics bets on them. Never seen something so patently one sided. Qualtrics culture is that you bet on Qualtrics, give your life to Qualtrics, or you're out the door. Would be nice if Qualtrics actually backed up its claim and focused more on employees.

This is not a 9-5 job. Technically, it's an 8-5 job, but if you're only here from 8-5 then you are under performing and won't be here long. 

Promotions are so rare and company constantly hires management from the outside. Again, see point about not being employee friendly. Don't think that you're special and will come in and outperform everyone. These are smart, hard working people and most get passed over for external hires. 

Because of the above, I know many feel like they are now in a dead end and need to look at other companies to move forward in their career.

Wages only increase with promotion. See above on how difficult that is. Lose to inflation, quality of life suffers. 

Company claims to be transparent, but grievances or complaints will be met with hostility and possibly worse.

IPO never seems to happen. It's dangled in front of us as motivation, but seems like it will never come.

Managers are extreme micro-managers. Does not feel like the freedom or autonomy we were promised."
984,Qualtrics,Worst decision of my life coming to Qualtrics.,2016-07-13,1.0,Account Executive,"-Technology: The technology is pretty cutting edge and at the forefront of feedback collection and marketing research. Research Suite is great, but the other tools (especially SI) needs to be built out and updated.

-Co workers (some): Had some really interesting and good colleagues during my time at Qualtrics.

-Company parties: Pretty amazing and well organized parties.","Since day 3 on the job, I hated if for the 20 or so months that I was there. In Opportunity Development, all you do is cold call. Bonuses depend on how many set meetings get accepted by your Account Executive, so some OpDev reps will have AE's who cheat and accept meeting that aren't good or even happened. Those OpDev reps are praised and quotas for everyone are in turn raised.

When you become an AE yourself, you will have zip code territories with mostly very small businesses who 1) can’t afford Qualtrics, 2) have no or little need for it, and 3) have no idea how to do research (e.g., it’s an onion farm). It’s extremely hard to sell as a new AE and most fail. There is a huge retention problem regarding AE’s, but the leadership insists that’s it’s not a problem.

-Pay: You are grossly underpaid at Qualtrics. Unless you have been in sales for forever and have large accounts, you will not be living large. My family even qualified for food stamps and Medicaid because the pay was so bad.

-Leadership: If you are LDS, imagine the worst, most number hungry zone leaders; those are the sales leaders at Qualtrics. Leadership mostly hangs out by themselves and don't do a good job of coaching or assisting people on their teams. Pep talks consist of sports analogies (Michael Jordan missed this many shots and kept going...flu game...etc.) At one point they even motivated us to be ""All In"" and tried to motive us with the story of how Cortez burned his own ships while committing genocide against the Native Americans. 

-Bro mentality: Too many bro's and Provo All Stars; showing up to work in flat brim hats and basketball shorts. The CEO also does his best to be a bro.

-Transparency: In the interview and recruiting process, they proudly say that all employees are owners and have restricted stock units. In reality, those units aren't worth anything. Only the founders and some top executives have shares that are actually worth anything. If you are looking at Qualtrics, don't even think about the potential stock options, because it's of no value, and definitely not worth taking a 20% pay cut for. The CMO and VP of Engineering all left suddenly while I was there, and we were told bogus reasons explaining why they left. If they really want to be as transparent as they say they are, talk about why the VP of Engineering left in the middle of the biggest product launch in the company’s history. 

-No internal mobility: Something that was promised during recruiting was the opportunity to join other teams within Qualtrics. This isn’t true. Maybe five years ago, but if you are in sales, you are stuck in sales. No internal mobility at all."
985,Qualtrics,"Great Potential, Lack of Vision",2016-07-09,2.0,Client Success,"Free snacks are always a plus no matter where you work. You just can't beat a company that knows humans are its driving force and they need food to stay energized. The other benefits of 100% paid healthcare premiums, company 401k contribution, stock options (though it is still unclear when the company will go public), company parties and the open office enviornment make it a really solid company to work for. Having free access to the product is also nice!","Unfortunately to me, the cons are really difficult to look past. 

PRODUCT:
The features of the product are great, but the slow functionality, lack of design and poor engineering efforts cause every department to suffer. Poor engineering direction (I have heard from multiple engineers that feel as though they are fixing a sinking ship) has caused the product to become slow, laggy and functionality to break often. Sales team seems to oversell the product leaving us Client Success Managers or Implementation Consultants with the task of cleaning up the mess. We reach out to engineering to fix key elements of the product, but things end up getting pushed back quarter after quarter. The engineering team seems to have a pile of bureaucracy slathered with a bit of a god complex that make it slightly messy and unorganized.

SALARY:
The salary is just... terrible. It doesn't matter what role you are in (except the sales elites), the salary is a lot less than other companies in the tech industry of Utah. It's sad that the engineering team gets paid as little as they are taking into consideration the level of effort day in and day out with the product. It is baffling to me that a unicorn company valued at over 1 billion dollars pays its employees some of the lowest salaries. The sales team is regarded as the companies heart and get paid good base salaries and bomb commission. Sales teams are definitely important, but if you need your sales team to be your heart, your product just might suck too much. It would be nice to see people that have to keep the client happy and the product pumping paid a bit more.

MANAGEMENT:
Within Client Success, at times it feels like a bunch of high end business school snobs that are slightly two-faced at times and often lead by fear. They tell us to come talk to them about issues or concerns, but then don't seem to follow through with what is discussed. They are focused more on numbers than clients (partially due to the sinking ship issue), and don't seem to know how to help train and mentor us to reach future career goals."
986,Qualtrics,Good place to work for a couple of years,2016-07-06,4.0,Qualtrics University,"- Fairly laid back work environment (You work hard but it's pretty chill - shorts and sandals are the norm in the summer).
- You are surrounded by very talented and driven professionals. They only accept top people from top universities so the connections you make are pretty great.
- Qualtrics is growing really fast right now which means that there are more opportunities for early career growth than at most companies.
- You will likely get opportunities to do projects that actually matter and make a difference for the company.
- Free food / ability to bring your dog to work if that's your thing.
- Definite emphasis on continuing education. Qualtrics University has licenses to Pluralsight and Code School that you can use.
- Most managers really care about developing you and helping you move up in your career. (This isn't necessarily the case outside of Global Operations)
- You'll make friends that you'll actually want to keep in touch with in 10+ years.
- 3% match without the match (they just give you 3% into a 401K, no strings attached).
- Pretty good insurance benefits for full time employees.
- Stock options (vested over 4 years and only valid if you stay through an IPO or acquisition).","- Qualtrics University is a call center. You may be doing projects and working with people from top schools and household name companies, but at the end of the day you will be answering support phone calls and emails for a year before you can move into another position.
- Salary for entry level positions outside of engineering are typically in the mid 30's with little to no room for negotiation. After hitting certain criteria which take about a year, you are able to get a ~$10k raise.
- Qualtrics touts transparency, but there is little transparency into compensation or promotions. It's taboo to talk about comp at work.
- The software products Qualtrics offers are surprisingly buggy. 
- Rather than pay off technical debt, Qualtrics loves to create new features and products so everything they build feels half finished.
- If you get hired, that means you are way overqualified for the position that they are giving you and you will probably need to work for a year or more to get into a role more suited to your abilities.
- Qualtrics won't help pay for grad school, MBAs or otherwise.
- There is a definite air of elitism (Qualtrics upper management really thinks that Qualtrics is the best tech company in the world and look down on other tech companies).
- The word meritocracy gets thrown around a lot, but tenure is a much better indicator of promotion then work preformed is. If you do your job, stay late once in while (making sure that your manager knows about it), toe the line, and don't ruffle too many feathers you should do pretty well."

With this comes huge opportunity (if you want it) to develop and learn. As the company needs to change regularly because of it's ever changing size you become the process creators of the future. Management tend to trust the people they promote will do a good job of creating the future of the company.","Qualtrics is a hard place to work. The company re-invents itself every 18months and requires you to evolve with it. This can be a strain if you want to have a comfortable job that requires you to do a similar thing day in, day out. Because it is hard work, it can be easy to feel you are not being paid enough at the beginning. This is a fallacy in my opinion. Also, pay gets considerably better with promotion."
995,Qualtrics,Great company to bet on ... willing to bet on employees,2016-06-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Qualtrics is growing very quickly and that creates lots of opportunities. People who work well in ambiguous environments, who are proactive and innovative, and who take initiative do very well here. There are some who watch more from the sidelines and wonder why they don't get the same opportunities. My experience has been that if you have a good idea, can make a business case for it and are willing to do the work, then Qualtrics is willing to bet on you and give you as much opportunity as you're willing to take on. In other words, it's not just a growing company, but a company that wants you to grow with it and all the opportunities are there for the people who want them.

The culture is also really good. Qualtrics is very thoughtful about its growth and works hard to make sure it keeps what is good about the culture and is always improving in areas where things can get better (they added full payment of healthcare benefits for the employee and their families one year, they added 401K matching the next year, etc. etc.)","There are constant growing pains.

Its tiring and makes you forget why you're supposed to be here, for the customer. 
Managers in client success micromanage and use fear tactics. We are not led or inspired in any way, just managed and managed. There is a lot of talent in this group, but I personally know many are waiting for the next opportunity either inside or elsewhere. Managers may be smart but are emotionally unintelligent.

Good product: Qualtrics is a great product and truly a leader in the industry. It's easy to get behind and believe in the technology.","Low pay: Unless you're an upper level leader or top sales person, Qualtrics pays about 10-20% below the market rate. This can be frustrating as an employee. Promotions outside of sales are very difficult and slow, despite what may be communicated. If you are starting in an entry level position, don't count on ever getting a real big pay day (again, unless you're a sales all-star). From what I understand they do this is in order to be more profitable to get a higher valuation when they IPO. Also they don't want employees who work there ""for the money"", but rather people who believe in the vision and want to be there for other reasons.

Hype to substance ratio: There's a LOT of hype from leadership around Qualtrics' future, how they're profitable, how they're a rocket ship, how they going to IPO, how they have amazing investors and a great board, etc. but much of the hype seems to be just hype and regular employees don't necessarily see the benefits of the company's ""deep pockets"" or unicorn-ness.

Politics: Most employees at Qualtrics are ambitious and young in their career and are striving to climb the ladder and move to the top. Unfortunately this leads to quite a bit of politics and ulterior motives. Lots of people trying to do whatever it takes to get recognized by the right people and lots of the time it's about who you can get tight with within the company and not always a meritocracy.

Despite the promises of career advancement and opportunities for growth, I found that there are very little indeed.

There are those who have been with Qualtrics for years and are genuine leaders in the company that are getting passed up for opportunities consistently. There is no upward trajectory. 

Management in Client Success do not lead, train, or contribute in meaningful ways.

I've worked for a handful of tech companies, and the culture at Qualtrics is terrible. Political and definitely not merit-based. Sales is slightly different because it's easy to measure performance, but problems are widespread everywhere else.

Products are the buggiest I've sold. Company hired a lot of engineers recently, so the problem will get worse then will probably get better if they know what they're doing.

The culture probably seems so terrible because leadership tries to make such a big deal about how good the culture is, while everyone is so tired of it. 

There are three types of employees at Qualtrics: the 8-10 who will make good $ from the IPO, 90% who are demoralized but can't leave because if they do they lose all their equity, and the smart ones who are walking out the door. 

Almost everyone I knew at Qualtrics was tired and hoping to leave asap. Save yourself the trouble. Also, I agree with the guy who wrote about the fake reviews - it's simple to see which reviews are real and those that are fake."

- Leadership is in an ivory tower. Definitely a boy's club feel. Good 'ol boys.

1010,Qualtrics,Good benefits - limited opportunity,2016-05-15,3.0,Opportunity Development,"in terms of perks, benefits, and overall culture, Qualtrics is a great place to work.  They pay health insurance premiums and dental is cheap - they also have a generous 401k donation regardless of whether or not you donate yourself.  Company parties are great and the people are generally pretty cool.  Lots of free snacks, food, and drinks.","There's some politics involved in the promotion process from opportunity development to account executive.  The top reps who have been in sales at Qualtrics for years have all the vast majority of the good accounts, making it hard for a new reps to hit quota.   A little less than 40% of reps hit quota, many of them go entire quarters without making a single sale.  They don't pay their employees enough, which is made evident by the fact that they are in a constant struggle to attract software engineers (which they desperately need more of)."
1011,Qualtrics,Meh,2016-05-09,1.0,Client Success Representative,"Great holiday parties. Uh-ma-zing. Seriously, the best. Energetic CEO. I eat cereal for free every single day.","Where do I begin? It can't be overstated how poorly Qualtrics pays its employees, even for Utah. I guess all that money went to the holiday parties (see above). Not only does Q not pay its employees, it doesn't value them much at all. I've had two great coworkers laid off in the past few months for no reason at all. They were great people and good performers. Clients loved them too. Worse yet, the layoff was a complete surprise to them - everyone knows that good leaders don't let someone go by surprise. It should have been on their radar through performance reviews, but it wasn't. Completely demoralizing to the group.
Client Success is a terrible team to be on. New management of this team care only about adding to the bottom line. We are more salespeople than trusted advisers. We work for managers, not leaders. There is no excitement here, only quotas and performance reviews. No career advancing - it is literally a dead end for me. I wish I had never come.
Sales people are gods at Qualtrics, and everyone else supports them. Even Legal, or Finance, who hold fancy degrees, play second or third fiddle to the high school GED Provo-allstar who met his quota this quarter. It's exhausting. Avoid it. Not a happy place to be."
1012,Qualtrics,Catfished - over hyped company,2016-05-09,2.0,Manager,Open environment. Lot of food. Company sells its products well; efficient sales force. Decent benefits (health care). Pretty good coworkers. Lot of job growth in 2015; essentially halted in 2016.,"Most companies probably do this, but its obvious that Qualtrics is gaming Glassdoor with false positive reviews. I've worked here for years and its so easy to pick out the super peppy, happy reviews of Qualtrics. No real employees feel that way about the company. Any review that has Cons filled with ""growing pains"" or ""young company"" or ""lack of direction, but open opportunities"" is masking real life at this Qualtrics. This is my honest review. 

- Poor compensation
- Little PTO... compare to local companies like Adobe
- Not as much opportunity as company would have you believe
- NO RAISES without ""level"" promotion, which are extremely rare even for high performers
- Sales obsessed, not customer obsessed
- Face time (being at the desk from 7:30-6:30) MATTERS here; its cultural and its real
- Middle management is terrible compared to other companies I've worked for
- No tech company feel anymore; completely operationalized and feels like a dull corporation
- Dogs everywhere; making noise and making messes on the floor. Its disgusting

Avoid Qualtrics. The company is doing well financially, but is not what it says it is. Qualtrics does well because of its obsessive focus on sales. Sales rules all. Company is not customer-obsessed, but is sales-obsessed. Company also touts being 'transparent' but that doesn't seem to apply to leadership. 

Talk with employees of the company ... almost no one is happy here. The company will likely do well for another year or two, squeezing every last drop of ambition and goodwill of talented employees; but that well will run dry and you will see massive attrition. There is no payoff from the hard work and demands of the job."
1013,Qualtrics,A Hidden Gem!,2016-05-01,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Transparency: open environment. Everyone can look into what the CEO and leadership did last week and is doing this week (or quarter). Your position doesn't limit what you can or can't do. The competent is rewarded more than the confident.
* Scalability: this is not your typical startup. We have a huge load on our system. We are getting really challenged to scale our system to the number of our customers and their customers.
* Ecosystem: Like it or not, we are going to become the ecosystem for getting insights about customers, employees, and the market. As of today, everyone in education knows about it. In a few years, everyone in business will be in the same position. 
* Everyone is talented and HUMBLE. Yes, humble. Good luck finding that elsewhere. I'm going beyond humble now because I want to showcase this hidden gem. 
* We took the best habits of Google, Amazon and Microsoft. All the other bad habits like working on random stuff just for advertising, abusing our workforce, or nourishing slackers, we left them behind :)

Disclaimer: these are my own thoughts; not Qualtrics'. I'm giving you my anonymous opinion as a Qualtrics employee here in Seattle.","* Health insurance is not that great (compare to Microsoft). Still, I don't have to pay for it like I did in past startups!!
* If you're here to slack and relax, this is not the right place for you.
* If you just care about what you're doing and don't think of the customer, it won't work either.

They start you at $35k-$50k depending on your position, and you'll do some climbing from there, but not much.  All while you see executives show up in decked out BMWs and Land Rovers.  Like several others, I personally heard some of the higher-ups brag to their visiting friends about how little they have to pay their employees.  This place can be a great feather in the cap of a young college graduate, but if they want to keep quality employees, salary should be more competitive and there should definitely be more upward mobility rather than hiring management externally."

The company really rewards people who work hard, so if you're willing to work hard on exciting projects, this place is for you. 
2. The Culture and People. During my time at Qualtrics I did not meet one single unfriendly person. On a professional level, all the people I encountered were more than willing to collaborate on projects, give feedback, answer questions, and provide guidance and mentorship. On a personal level, the people are an absolute blast to work with and your managers care about how you feel about your work and how you are doing.
3. Perks. Company shuttles from Park City and Salt Lake City, employee appreciation events and parties, free food in the office, being able to bring your dog to work, a cool office space, and an overall fun culture make this a fun place to work. 
4. Utah. Utah is absolutely beautiful in all seasons, and there is always something new to do, whether that's discovering a new bar in SLC, a new national park, or checking out a music or film festival.","The only downside is that unless you're Mormon or have friends/family in Provo, it might not be the ideal place to live.

I love that most people who are at Qualtrics did not necessarily chase the highest offer, but instead chased the offer with the most to offer (mentorship, environment, professional challenge and upside).

The benefits are pretty amazing too.  I feel like most companies are trying to find ways to give less while Qualtrics does the opposite.  My impression is the Qualtrics is continually finding new ways to reward its employees.

Also, just to mention a few of the benefits that are pretty incredible:
Health Benefits 100% paid for

The problem is that most of the big-name clients are already taken (and the remaining clients don't really have a use for the product or can't afford it). There is no room for growth and it's very difficult to switch departments. Their biggest department is the sales team and if that isn't a good fit for you, good luck trying to interview for another position. 

Additionally, the base salary is super low - $30k. Not enough to live off of while you gain clientele.

1056,Qualtrics,"Very challenging, very rewarding.",2015-12-04,5.0,Senior Management,"Culture: is among the most overused terms in business today but Qualtrics has what companies aspire to. Yes, there is free food and basketball hoops but that is an aesthetic and has nothing to do with real culture.  People work insanely hard and are laser focused on company, team and individual success - but without taking ourselves too seriously. Laughter is a constant sound throughout every day. 

Career path and velocity are unrivaled.  While most entry positions aren't the very best you'll find, ability to move up and up and up from an entry level position IS THE VERY BEST YOU'LL FIND. Most entry level employees are EXPECTED to be promoted two if not three times in their first 18 months. 

Absolute expectation of excellence. I've been in meetings where most would be celebrating success and we were running a postmortem to determine why we ""failed"" - as in you get a 98% on the hardest course your school offers and your immediate reaction is to deep dive on why you didn't get 100%.  

Said differently ""Good enough at Qualtrics literally means not good enough.""","In any hyper-growth environment, everything is constantly in flux - you must be able to deal with a small but constant degree of disfunction. For those that enjoy optimization and problem solving, this is  your dream. For those that want 100% stability and consistency and cannot tolerate even a small degree of change, this place is your nightmare. 

Level of competition internally is too tough for most... with a ~5% hire rate Qualtrics is one of the most talented collection of professionals anywhere, meaning some that are used to being top 10% are simply not going to be top 10% at Qualtrics.  It is a put up or shut up environment."

Lots of broken toys around the office. Blaring pop music in front office so that you think the company is ""cool."" Company feeds you food from the pantries. New office should be nice. Everyone gets stock in company, but it won't be worth much to 98% of employees.","Pay - it's terrible. THERE ARE NO ANNUAL RAISES, which means with inflation you will actually earn less each year. Are you serious? Yes. Raises come only with ""level"" promotions, which are different than role promotions. Level promotions are very rare, in spite of the fast growth and what you will hear from recruiters. This is by design - the company is cheap (""frugal"") and intentionally underpays its employee base. There is a small cap on how many can be promoted in each division - even if all members are high performers. This really stifles motivation after a year or two. 

CEO - removed from employees. Ryan used to conduct company meetings, but we haven't seen him in a couple of months. Company likes to brag about how he sits on the floor at a regular desk like the rest of us, but never mention that he actually works in a different building near his house in a private office. Not exactly the ""employees' CEO"" we are lead to believe. 

Management - misguided. Smart people, but have no previous experience in startup software. The company is changing in a bad way. The primary focus of management is on maximizing sales, rather than on the company's most valuable resource: employees. This is going to bite. 

Location - Provo. Come on.

Severely lacking leadership at virtually all levels.

Culture is so-so, destructive in some cases. Lots of games, toys to project a Silicon Valley feel, but they are mostly superficial gimmicks. 
Products are unusually buggy. Much of life at Qualtrics is spent managing fires.
Upper management has little apparent vision for its teams. Occasionally, the supreme executive wand waves to divert all attention to the latest hot topic and disrupt all momentum. A huge productivity drain and short-sited. Kills morale, hurts clients. Seemingly no trust in the employees that had to pass such a ""high bar"" to get hired.
Company is intent on staying in Provo for some reason, despite the huge benefit to its employee base of moving to a more central location.

Tough to consistently hit quotas when prospecting these types of companies."
1083,Qualtrics,"Great Environment and Coworkers, Mediocre Management",2015-07-29,3.0,Systems Engineer,"My coworkers were some of the smartest people I know.  There probably wasn't a day on the job that I didn't learn something new. 


Qualtrics is usually great at adopting new technologies, you often work on the cutting edge. Qualtrics isn't afraid to tackle hard problems. I was excited to go to work each day.


The company seems to genuinely care about their employees. Free swag, office dogs, free food, Summer/Winter company parties, discounts to local businesses are just some of the perks Qualtrics offers. The health benefits are amazing.


At a high level, Qualtrics is very transparent. You will be aware of company-wide initiatives and goals. There is a weekly company-wide meeting where each department gives an update on their goals.


Qualtrics is growing at an amazing pace,  it gives you an opportunity to really be part of something awesome.


Being vocal about your opinions is encouraged, one of the ""Leadership Principles"" is Disagree and Commit. If you have the data to back you up, your ideas can flourish at Qualtrics. 


Overall, my experience at Qualtrics was very rewarding.","While transparency is one of the company's ""Leadership Principles"" it is often only exhibited at a higher, company-wide level. Lower level decisions were often made with employees told last minute. I often felt out of the loop as far as the path Engineering was taking. 


Management in Engineering often exhibits knee-jerk reactions. Be prepared to be pulled off of a project mid-quarter, or put into a ""Code Yellow"" which forces the entire team to work on a single issue, even when only certain people of that team have the skills necessary to work on that issue.  Decisions made by management are often emotionally or historically based, so have data ready to back you up in these situations. 


This goes along with the fast growth of the company, but be prepared to change teams. I was personally on three different teams in 2 years at Qualtrics. Also, deadlines are often imposed on certain teams or projects but these deadlines are often not communicated to other teams through management.


The high-bar for hiring is definitely an important part of what makes your coworkers great, but sometimes amazing candidates were not considered simply because their GPA was not high enough or they didn't have a degree. If you're not a buddy with someone in upper management, you likely won't get hired if your GPA is lower than a 3.6 or you didn't graduate from college. Several amazing, heavily experienced people were turned away solely based on these figures.  These can be useful metrics but are not the sole indicator of someone's success. The hiring process in general is not transparent and also hurts current employees who are stretched thin as it is and could really use more people on their team.


In my case, even after two years as a part-timer at Qualtrics, I was told I would not be hired on full-time based mostly on my GPA. Even worse, Qualtrics waited until the very same day I graduated from college to notify me of this. In the end Qualtrics can decide who they want to hire or not, but at least have the decency to do so in a timely manner.


Management is often disconnected from the day-to-day goings on of the company. Even team level managers are often kept too busy to be able to fulfill their management duties at the team level. 


There are bi-annual performance reviews which can be extremely helpful in receiving feedback from your peers and your manager. However, this is often the only feedback you receive. Managers are supposed to meet individually with each employee at least once a month but these were often cancelled because we were simply too busy. Feedback every six months is not truly actionable and processes need to be put in place to enforce more regular opportunities for feedback."

Some of the best sales talent and leadership you could find in any software company.","Some senior management and the CEO/founder are disconnected from many aspects of the day to day business. While sales and support are strong, it has to make up for lack of investment in engineering on the user experience and design of the product. Marketing has never seemed to be understood at the company and the CEO has appointed inexperienced leadership with no marketing experience to the team. Outside of sales it is very hard to advance your career."
1092,Qualtrics,Hyper-growth Start-up Atmosphere: Not for me,2015-06-03,2.0,Software Engineer,"If your number one priority is career, Qualtrics is a great place for you to work.

The people you work with are super smart and you can learn a lot from them. The trajectory of the company is great, and it you can hang on to the 'rocket ship', I do believe that it's going places.","""Work hard, play hard"" is the claimed motto, but the play hard part has kind of gone away in recent months, at least in Engineering. Engineers are generally expected to work crazy long hours, and on top of that, remain available all hours of the day/night/weekend in case of 'incidents'. Even when I wasn't at work, I couldn't relax. I was always worried about when the phone might ring. (If I could give work/life balance a 0 I probably would.) This wouldn't be so bad if the pay were near the top of the market, but it's not. It's middling at best. 
The culture has shifted in the last year or so. When I started a few years ago, everybody was pretty happy with the situation. Sure, things were still busy, but it was more driven by what we wanted to build rather than what we were told to build. It seems like the culture is shifting towards an Amazon style of Engineering department (based on what I've heard, anyway): employees are a resource to be consumed and discarded.
I'm hoping that management is just mostly unaware of the morale issues in Engineering. If they are aware, they're just ignoring the problem, which in a lot of ways is worse."

1096,Qualtrics,Product Support,2015-04-30,4.0,Support,Qualtrics does a great job keeping the vision of the company with their weekly meetings.  The work environment is really nice and open and there is plenty of snacks to keep you happy throughout the day.  I enjoyed the people that I worked with there.,"My perspective is that you stay in a lot of the roles longer than you should be there.  I felt like I saw people in OpDev and Support for extended periods of time when they should have moved up the ladder.  And the ladder for support is pretty short as you basically have two options of a Client Success type of role or Panels.  I chose to leave because I didn't feel I was growing anymore.  I felt that way after about 10 months of working there and stayed another 5 months after that and it didn't change, despite trying to convey some of that frustration.
At the time I was there, I know from the support team the most valuable people on the team did not feel that they were getting appreciated or bonused appropriately.  I sometimes heard from sales employees ""Why can't we keep our best support individuals?""  I believe this has improved, however.
It also seems like it would be a hard place to work longer than 2 years unless you are an engineer or rockstar in sales. The hard thing with sales though is the cycle is so long you may take nearly a year to realize that the deals you thought you would have are not going to pan out.
I feel like they underpay at Qualtrics because they are able to keep most employees happy with the culture, snacks, etc."

1101,Qualtrics,Selective,2015-04-13,2.0,Account Executive,"Qualtrics is easily one of the Utah business world's greatest success stories. Few companies have achieved the profitability, growth, and industry-changing accomplishments as the Q. Most companies pale in comparison in terms of excitement, energy, and smart, think-on-your-feet people. I would pit almost any Qualtrics employee against any other company's work-force and 9 times out of 10, Qualtricians would win. I love the people there and still consider some who continue to work there, very close friends.","Qualtrics attracts young, high energy,  and entrepreneurial people. Unfortunately, these people typically lack experience and therefore the savvy necessary to know when they've been taken for a ride. The sales side of the company can be lucrative, I admit - and Qualtrics will argue that their low salary, ""high"" commission model rewards those that ""bet on themselves"". The problem with that idea is that Qualtrics also has the responsibility to bet on its employees. The company takes absolutely no risk in hiring because its compensation is so low. Even if you are able to claw your way to high paying commissions, you have 1) spent at least 2-3 years getting there (years you could have been getting paid literally 3X the base salary plus double digit increases in commission at almost any other local company), 2) you would have done so working 60+ hour weeks with little to no real account management support and 3) you risk being put in a sub-par region and expected to hit the same quotas and as a result miss out on promotional opportunities that your peers who were lucky enough to be put in New York were able to get while you scratch out a living in Arkansas. 

Leadership will tell you my attitude is poor. They will talk about how difficult it was for them to get to where they are and promise similar opportunities for you in the future. The problem with that line of thinking is that their struggle resulted in major share percentages with massively high salaries. Very few, if any, people hired after the basement or ""across from the practice field"" days, will ascend to that level. Can you become a Regional Lead? You bet. But if you think you'll be allowed into the inner circle, you'll be sorely disappointed. 

I also found a great deal of frustration when it came to nepotism. When you run a billion dollar company, you no longer have the luxury to give hand-outs to your friends who you play basketball with on the weekends and give front row tickets to at BYU games. This is unprofessional, dishonest, and morally negligent. People should be rewarded on merit, not simply because they helped you win your church ball tournament with a killer J. 

If you want to run the company by working people for what equates to minimum wage, filling in the gaps with empty ""benefits"" like cereal, and promoting based on tenure rather than talent, that's fine. It's your company. Just have the balls to admit it. 

Don't put yourself in the same category as your employees. Most of them will never be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. They will, however, work just as hard as you. Yes, they will and do. I don't care how many private jets you take. And no, you didn't take a massive risk by starting this company. ""Bootstrapping"" for the Q equates to having a lot of family money that could be independently invested without real risk. When you start working a 60+ hour work week for a company that pays you a 36K salary and who tells you to ""invest in yourself"" to make a livable wage - when you do that for several years and simultaneously start a billion dollar company, then you can give yourself a pat on the back."
1102,Qualtrics,Doesn't pay anything! I'm making 30% more elsewhere.,2015-03-27,3.0,,"- Qualtrics has a great atmosphere and culture.  But offering snacks, massage chairs, and basketball hoops does not make up for the fact that they pay nothing.

- Definitely have the best product out there.  It's the best survey platform, hands down.
- Lots of nice people. Lots of not nice people, too, but lots of nice people.
- Free healthcare, which is really generous.","- Lots of favoritism.  The CEO chooses his best friends for promotions even if they're hardly qualified. 
- Pay nothing. The hardest working people get paid the least, except for the engineers.
- Lots of flashy stuff to cover for the fact that their salaries are a joke.  I don't need cereal and free lunches. I need to get paid what I deserve.  
- If you don't work your 9 hours, people judge you for leaving early or getting in late (even when it's for justified reasons).  You don't have to work late or get there early, but if you don't, you get judged--even if you're doing your job and exceeding expectations."

1112,Qualtrics,No place for women,2015-01-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great product
Talented team
Typical tech office perks","Zero women in leadership positions. Not one on the board. Not one in the C suite. Not even one in mid-level management. Unfortunately, many women have tried to step up and assume leadership roles only to be subtly undermined and disparaged until they quit. And in all cases replaced by men favored by the executive team. Opportunistic men are not only allowed to steamroll women and take credit for their ideas and hard work, they are rewarded and promoted for it. Not one woman has a place at the table where the big decisions and promotions are made. There is real conscious and subconscious bias that has led to the exclusion and alienation of women and reflects an inability of Qualtrics' leadership to work with and communicate with talented and capable women."
1113,Qualtrics,Too much hype,2014-12-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits
nice office
Awesome Christmas party
As a company Qualtrics is relatively metrics driven
Lots of free food.","I personally heard one of higher ups boasting to a friend about how little they paid us while walking past my cubical.  I realize all companies want to pay people less, but that is a very disheartening thing to hear from your employer.  

Don't be sucked it by all the glitz and shiny toys.  Sure it sounds like a lot of fun to have a massage chairs, pool table, a gym, etc.  at work.  but if you are seen using any of these things during business hours (7:00am to 6:00pm) you will never get a promotion and if you are not hitting your quota you may get fired.   

While personally I thin some one playing pool during lunch who has not met their quota yet is sort of asking for it,  I also think it is dishonest for a company to give you these nice things at work and then get mad when you use them.  

When interviewing they will tell you that you will make it big at Qualtrics,  But the truth is the pay is crappy for every one who is not an engineer and they expect you to put in long hours.  

You  will need to work 60+ hours a week if you ever want a promotion.  Even if it only take you 40 to hit your quota."
1114,Qualtrics,Astounding Company,2014-12-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great CEO, great coworkers, and a great atmosphere.  I haven't been with the company long but it has been absolutely amazing so far.  Everyone is laid back, and while you are still expected to perform, they don't over manage you at all.  So glad I took this job.",Glassdoors requires five words for cons.
1115,Qualtrics,Great exciting company with lots of potential,2014-12-07,5.0,Engineer,"I love working here. The other engineers are great to work with. The pay is better than any other offer in Utah county. They are a fast growing company with still TONS of potential to continue to grow. They are very transparent in almost everything they do. They have great perks - free food/soda, Sundance corporate passes, company parties every couple months, swag gifts. At the same time, it's not a walk in the park - they expect a lot from you.",I honestly can't think of anything.
1116,Qualtrics,Career launching startup!,2014-11-24,5.0,Software Engineer,"There is a lot to consider when you are thinking about joining a new company. New jobs can cause a lot of stress, and there are high consequences if you make the wrong decision. Here are the questions / answers that went through my mind when joining Qualtrics:

1. Will I be challenged / work on hard problems?

Qualtrics has no shortage of hard problems. From distributed data collection to advanced analytics and data visualizations, Qualtrics has enough challenging problems to entertain most engineers. These challenges combined with Qualtrics' amazing growth present numerous career opportunities.

2. Will I learn / be mentored by other smart engineers and leaders?

This was a serious question of mine, and one of the main reasons I left my previous job. We are all capable of learning on our own, but when we are surrounded by top talent we will learn much faster! Qualtrics engineers are smart, and leadership is top notch (Amazon, Google, etc). It is rare to find a company where access to this level of experience is so abundant.

3. Will I be compensated fairly?

Of course this goes through everyone's mind. Qualtrics definitely pays competitively and is actually the most transparent company I have experienced with regards to the promotion process and pay increases.

4. Will I fit in with the company culture?

This is a personal question, but if you are wondering, come check it out. Qualtrics is very much a startup culture with a bunch of smart creative people eager to make their customers happy. In addition, it is family friendly, and people frequently have lunch in the office with their spouses / kids. Utah in general has a strong LDS culture; however, as a someone who is not LDS, I can verify that there are plenty of people who will be interested in grabbing a beer with you after work ;)

5. Will I enjoy where I am living?

This was an easy question for me. I personally can't imagine a better place to live. Utah has quick access to world class skiing, biking, and other incredible outdoor activities. Pair that with a relatively low cost of living and family friendly environment, and what more could you want? (Maybe a few pubs? Yes, Utah has those too!)","1. Hard to keep up with growth / expectations

Qualtrics, like any startup, has to run fast to stay ahead of competition and continue growing. At times this creates a lot of pressure on engineering to deliver customer facing value. This can be hard to do when also having the goal and responsibility of maintaining a healthy level of technical debt.

2. Commute for people from SLC or PC is ~60 minutes each way

It seems that most people moving to Utah tend to settle in Salt Lake or Park City. These are great areas, but they are also ~60 minutes from the office. Qualtrics helps by providing free transportation from both locations; however, a long commute is always hard.

3. Lacking in flexible work arrangements

Although Qualtrics has many perks, they are lacking in flexible work arrangements.  With so many tech companies competing for engineers, Qualtrics may have an easier time attracting top talent by offering a more flexible work schedule."
1117,Qualtrics,Hyper-growth company with a good culture,2014-11-16,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great culture.  Very fast paced.  Lots of driven and motivated young professionals.

Really interesting and challenging projects and problems to solve. Great benefits - medical premiums are fully covered, stock options, and regular bonus'.  Utah is gorgeous (I relocated here for Qualtrics).  Not being Mormon I had some worries moving to Utah given the stereotypes but I have had no issues. Nobody has tried to convert me, I don't have six wives, and Utah has some of the best breweries.",No 401(k) match.  Hiring so many new people its sometimes tough to know who you need to go to - so everybody goes to the dept head and bogs up their calendar.  Location can be a detractor for top/experienced level talent so most hires are right out of college creating a gap between entry and execs.
1118,Qualtrics,(SALES) Most challenging experience to date - but most rewarding,2014-10-23,5.0,Account Executive,"1) Great products to sell/support
2) Awesome internal trainings to continue to improve individually 
3) Automatic promotions based on hitting identified goals (management is looking for internal leaders because the rate of growth is fast)","1) Sales expects a lot right out of the gates - nothing is handed to you and management wants you to prove yourself

Working at Qualtrics has propelled my career 100 X faster than any other company could. I have had opportunities to take on more responsibility and learn faster than I even thought possible. They claim to still have the start-up mentality and it is absolutely true. If you value having autonomy and being able to take creative liberties in your job, then there is no better company than Qualtrics. The growth of the company means growth in my own career. The best part may be the individuals who work there. Everyone is an A player and has the same drive for success. Incredible leadership team who is accessible by anyone at anytime. At Qualtrics a motto is ""we do hard things"" and it is true. If you want to be successful, you have to be willing to go the extra mile. Excellent benefits and cover 100% health premiums for employees and their dependents.",They do not currently match 401K plans because they cover the cost of health premiums. It would be nice to have that option.
1122,Qualtrics,Better Than I Thought It Would Be,2014-10-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people from the bottom up are fantastic to work with. Qualtrics has done a great job of hiring top-tier talent, so you know the common denominator is someone who is intelligent, has drive, and who is willing to lend a hand to those around them who need training or help.","They can't yet compete with the remunerations of more developed B2B companies like Adobe. However, with the new infusion of cash, I'm hoping for a compensation overhaul for most sales people."
1123,Qualtrics,The best place to solidify your career,2014-10-20,5.0,Account Executive,"Qualtrics is the best place to learn and build a solid professional background. Qualtrics is not an easy ride, so if you are looking for a place to sit back and relax, then go work at a calling center. You wear many hats at the company, so your learning potential is huge. As an account exec. you can work really close with product development, marketing, relationship management, etc. So can definitely build a solid background in the tech. industry. The company believes in you. They invest so much in our professional development with 3rd party consultants. I like that Qualtrics is a rare startup in the valley. A place where you can become a founder, not just an employee.","Like any other young startup, we have our challenges. As a sales person you start at a low starting salary, and it takes a few months to get you ramped up. The company knows this, and has developed a new hire bonus program to reward hard work. Also, the benefits are sweet!"
1124,Qualtrics,"If you are good, you will love this company",2014-10-19,5.0,Corporate Sales,"For those that excel, you can earn promotions every 6 months. The leadership team deeply cares and works hard to help you earn your next promotion. The people you are surrounded by will be top notch. It is rare to look to your left or to your right and not be impressed.

It is all up to you and no amount of politics will hold you back.","If you are looking for a job to just coast in, stay far away from this company as everyone is going a million miles an hour looking to make the news not just share the news."

Excellent business strategy and lots of exposure in the market with a superior product.","Because everything is metric/merit based, you are entirely responsible for yourself.

First, in the interview I was told to not worry about the very low salary because I would be making more than triple that in bonuses if I performed. I performed over and over and no such bonus came. Management will lie to you, and this wasn't the only time it occurred. I was told ""Qualtrics is like Google in the 90's"", and what's crazy is this is there sales pitch to get employees to continue to work near minimum wage jobs. I was constantly harassed by my manager to the point where I almost took action. Whatever you do, avoid this place at all costs. The sole purpose of the cool building and free food is to disguise you from what's really going on, which is practically indentured servitude. Ask they what their turnover is and this company will speak for itself."

Leadership is OK. Could be better. The employees and your peers at Qualtrics are awesome. That was my favorite part of working at Qualtrics where the people I was able to work with.","If you weren't in early on, there is a great chance you wouldn't be going up the chain very fast and won't make very much money unless one of the owners has some interest in you. Be prepared to drink the kool-aid from management that everyone will make a lot of money, that you can't be successful unless you are Qualtrics, everyone will be millionaires, etc. If you get on the core leaderships side and they like you, you will get lots of perks."

The mid-level management and sales leaders are all mid-20s to early-30s and while intelligent, generally lack the maturity and sobriety to handle large and diverse teams (hence the tendency to hire primarily white males, likely around 90% of their employees)."

1156,Qualtrics,Qualtrics is a Rocket Ship!  Just get on!,2013-11-08,5.0,Panels Sales Representative,"Career advice from Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman at Google: 

""Get on a rocket ship. When companies are growing quickly and they are having a lot of impact, careers take care of themselves. And when companies aren’t growing quickly or their missions don’t matter as much, that’s when stagnation and politics come in. If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat. Just get on."" 

Qualtrics is a rocket ship. The opportunities here are unbelievable.  It is such a dynamic workplace.  As the company grows, things are constantly evolving and improving.  The ability to pivot and grow is a must.  There's never a dull moment on the job at Qualtrics.

As an employee, my contributions are valued and my successes are noticed and rewarded.  Management is excellent - from team leads up to the founders.  They are passionate about Qualtrics and want their employees to be successful.  The people I work with are fantastic across the board.  I love coming to work.

The culture of success, get it done, and own it is also appealing.  If you like high rewards for smart and hard work you will like Qualtrics.","Initial start up for sales can be slow until you build your pipeline, but they compensate you with other numbers and bonuses that are very achievable."

1161,Qualtrics,Fun place to work. Fair share of frustrations.,2013-09-07,3.0,Corporate Sales,"Qualtrics provides a fun atmosphere, lots of free food, mostly good people who like to work together (and are obsessed with college football), has mostly decent upside potential IF you plan on being there for several years. This is a great job if you want to be a career salesperson if you're viewing it as a stepping stone to a real career.",They're not as transparent as they say. Some shady stuff goes on. Most people drink the kool-aid for a year or two before waking up and realizing it's not quite as amazing as they were led to believe.
1162,Qualtrics,"Underpaid, overqualified.",2013-08-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great culture. Cool people. Lot's of Microwavable Food.,"Here's the deal, if you aren't concerned about getting paid well and only care about cool ""perks"" and showing your workspace off to friends/family, Qualtrics is great. They distract you from how bad your salary is with cheap perks, like microwavable food and swag. Salaries are hidden very well and odds are someone who came in after you with less qualifications is getting paid more. Management isn't looking out for your best interest. Their main job is to get you to work for as cheap as possible. This is fantastic if you're on the board of directors or in upper level management. Sadly, for regular employees, this is terrible. There isn't a place in Utah County with more over qualified employees for what they do and get paid. I know personally three people who were promised that if they worked hard that after bonuses they would be making 85k+. They all turned out to make less than 40k. Jared will lie to you in interviews and misinform you on potential earnings, but it works because you go in believing if you sacrifice for the Q you'll get rewarded. At the end of the day you don't and only the company wins."

1164,Qualtrics,Truly one of the worst years of my life...,2013-07-18,1.0,Sales Representative,-I made many lasting friendships with coworkers,"-Perks like food, prizes, etc are thrown in your face so that you'll forget how little money you're making and how badly you're being treated.

-The salary trajectory given in the interview is only for the best sales people who started at the very beginning of the company. Otherwise, it's not actually achievable.

-Mid level management is very misguided--I was given a hard time for conversations with co-workers and taking lunch breaks. Very unprofessional in meetings as well----individuals are berated publicly and called things like 'loser'.

-The line between work and religion is completely blurred. It is assumed that you're Mormon and you are looked down on if you do anything 'out of line'. Church things are constantly talked about it public and we were often told in sales meetings that we should be make sure to say our prayers near the end of the quarter."
1165,Qualtrics,Great place to work,2013-06-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to add value.  Company is growing very quickly and there are many places to take on projects you wouldn't touch in years in another organization.  Great management who care about you and have a strong vision for the company they personally execute on.  High performance culture that's contagious in all the right ways.,Role and compensation growth are not clearly laid out making it seem more risking to start a career at Qualtrics.

I have been successful in every other sales job, but even with good deals at Qualtrics, there is little money to be made.

The sales territories are also a complete mess and there are several cut throat employees who do shady things!"

The compensation plan is great, they believe in a work/life balance, and are extremely goal oriented.  Those that accomplish their goals are rewarded.  I love the people I work with in the office, and the the clients I work with on a day to day basis.","Qualtrics only promotes based on performance.  For me this is not a downside, but for others that feel they are entitled to promotion based on tenure, this can be difficult to swallow."
1184,Qualtrics,Not easy but certainly worth it.,2012-01-12,5.0,Corporate Sales Manager,"The reason I left a large company I was working for to come here was the opportunity for growth.  When I start the company was very small less than 40 employees.  The compensation in regards to salary was tolerable, high than a lot of places but that is not where my money has been made.  My money has been made with a very aggressive commission structure.  There are clear cut and achievable ways to move up in the management and there are no limits on the number of managers the company can have.  Moving up in the company is totally based on you and no one else.  We are growing everyday and continue to expand new space in our building for the next generations of employees.  We hire amazing people with a multitude of talents.  The money is great.  It takes a few months to build up a pipeline so that you are making 80k+ a year but once you have done that you can easily grow and sustain that income year over year.","The only downside to working at Qualtrics from some points of view would be the low starting salary.    It is high considering the role you will be in but where the real money is made is in what you sell.  It takes several months to build your pipeline and beginning closing deals, once you have done that you are closing deals about once a week.  It is not an easy job in terms of the challenges you face day to day.  You get out of it exactly what you put into it."

Fun, friendly, and competitive work environment.

About the only downside I can think of is that Qualtrics does not match 401k."
1186,Qualtrics,The best job I have ever had!,2012-01-11,5.0,Amazing Opportunities,"As a college student nearing graduation I was surprised how much of a chance I was given by Qualtrics.  I was never discriminated at based on my age or work experience.  From Day 1, I was able to control my salary, my position and my happiness on the job by how hard I worked and how much success I saw.

While the sales process is very demanding and at times stressful, the corporate environment is far more fun and relaxed.  Sports tournaments, company lunches, clubs and groups are common in a very fun and modern work environment.

At the end of the day, I can think of many jobs where the owners know everyone personally by name and I couldn't think of a better place to work.","The pressure to close is very high.  You're expected to succeed and earn your worth at the company.  If you're not competitive and driven, chances are Qualtrics sales won't be a good fit."

The people you work with are successful, ambitious, intelligent, and friendly.
The company is financially secure and experiencing explosive growth.
The founders promote from within, giving everyone a level playing field for moving up in the company.","Working at Qualtrics and succeeding is one of the hardest (and most rewarding) things I've done in my life. You are surrounded by impressive people and you have to push yourself to the limits to stand out above the crowd. For some people, they might see it as a con because you can't just clock in and clock out - but if you are ambitious and hard working, it means there is amazing opportunity for you at Qualtrics."

No earnings-ceiling, potential for a great income
Catered lunches
Flat organization
Great benefits (Incredible offices, paid vacation, health/dential/vision/401k, etc.)","The sales teams are a very competitive group, so you must be extremely self-motivated, focused, and driven to stand out.  You will need to put in more than a 9-5 to succeed at Qualtrics, which is great for some, but wouldn't be ideal for those seeking a set schedule."
1189,Qualtrics,"I love my job, my co-workers, and the environment",2012-01-10,5.0,Corporate Sales,"Qualtrics provides a great flex time off of 13 days a year, plus 7 holidays off, in addition to an average of 2-3 weeks off a year for Christmas. When you combine that with that most employees make well over 60k in sales after they have been there for two years the upside is great. Probably my favorite part of the job is how quickly the company is growing giving so many opportunities to grow with them and take on roles that matter.","The only disadvantage I see is that we only have one office. I would like the opportunity to work for Qualtrics but have the chance to move to other offices for a while. However, I have heard they are thinking about opening other offices so stay tuned on that."
