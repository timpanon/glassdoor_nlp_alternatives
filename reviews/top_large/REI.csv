- scheduling is often a nightmare you have to request days off sometimes even months in advance though it’s just an average wednesday
- the union busting going on a soho… very disappointing and not what i know rei to value

Growing company. Transferring between stores is also possible, if you are seeking to move.","Low pay. No guarantee of hours. Very few employees work full time. Each store can operate like its own fiefdom. I worked for a great store manager, but a couple junior managers were in peter principle positions who didn't know how to manage, or micromanaged and played favorites.

The employee isn’t given a chance to ask for more money if they feel falsely accommodated for their development in that role. Which I feel is a tactic to mitigate negotiations. “The increased pay has already been applied so…” 

The process for promotion in the time that I’ve worked there has been murky, no real training, just subjective goals held by a manager. The acquisition of said goals is supposedly supposed to be supported by measurable dollars (problem, solution, outcome) “I did “X” which changed “Y” which resulted in more sales/ professional growth etc. in my role (sales lead) I am not given access to any meaningful metrics to support my goals. Only managers have access to that. They are the gate keepers. 

And the turn over in those positions is go great, within management that establishing a relationship with my management team has been reset every year, in some cases every six months. This process then begins again, new goals and subjective assessments based on “gut feelings” or
Personality is the basis of my development. 

In short the hoops are many the pay is mediocre, the effort is high and the reward for experience is low. 

This isn’t a great carreer type job unless you already have the skills they want at a store. Development or internal education is essentially YouTube videos, no classes or hands on training (beyond product training/clinics). Deveopment training is different.

The company sells itself as one that ""loves the outdoors"" and believes that ""a life outdoors is a life well-lived,"" which is a cute motto but not practiced in reality. REI is a retail store, nothing more. It punishes employees for trying to take time off to adventure outside (which directly contradicts its marketing strategy that shows its employees using the gear and being ""experts in the field."") I was terminated without my knowledge, while in the backcountry hiking the Colorado Trail, even though I had this time approved. REI only cares about one thing: selling memberships. REI generates millions of dollars a year in revenue just from getting people to buy into a stupid co-op that strives to put smaller retailers and brands out of business. It lies to customers about where the funds go, saying ""a portion goes to the National Forest service"" lol not true. Each district decides where less than 1% of proceeds go, which almost never impact the local community or environment. REI is an organization that hopes people never realize that the ""I"" stands for ""incorporated"" and instead believe that it is a small, grassroots business rather than a large corporation. I had to deal with sexual harassment from an employee that had a history of workplace sexual harassment at REI and he didn't get fired until I made another claim. I also had a large bay door malfunction and close with me underneath it and management told me ""it worked like it was supposed to"". REI doesn't care about its employees or the outdoors, it only cares about money."

I was pushed outside my comfort zone by co-workers to expand my hobbies and interests while working at REI and learned a lot along the way.,"The company as a whole has become much less focused on taking care of its people and offering a wide variety of specialty products. It has shifted focus to more generic high profit lifestyle apparel putting revenue above all else. This shift is unappealing from an employee standpoint and as an outdoor enthusiast. 

Seeing senior employees making less than new hires, and shop technicians with technical certifications making less than fast food cashiers are perfect examples of the flaws within the REI pay structure.

I have worked in a couple different stores doing retail sales part-time and it definitely has the most educated cohort of employees. I have worked with people who are/were lawyers, doctors, engineers, and other professions. Most of my co-workers are very nice and laid back and management overall has been accommodating and friendly, with a couple of exceptions. The discounts on products through them and their partner retailers are a big perk of working there. But it is a retail job, and pretty much all the baggage of working retail in America exists there too. See my Cons section for a further analysis,","I appreciate that REI has been very vocal in 2021 about becoming a “anti-racist, BIPOC/LBGTQ-friendly, progressive” company. But they still pay their retail employees less than $15 an hour in most places, including very high-cost of living places like Seattle, New York, Boston, Denver, Southern CA, etc. I don’t know how they can be out there spouting on and on about how they want to set an example of being a progressive, forward-thinking company when they are not paying people enough to live in the markets they need to be in to make the sales they have to make to stay alive as a company. Economic inequality IS the most relevant factor that perpetuates racism, and it’s the one “progressive” factor they are hush hush about because they are not doing anything to address economic inequality within their own workforce. When REI starts paying a living wage, they can then legitimately start to claim to be a progressive organization. Until then, they’re just acting hypocritically."

Black folks beware, you will be tokenized and taken advantage of."

They sit in their offices and stare at the cameras and over the radio call us out. Multiple workers got talked to for clocking in, ""20 seconds too early"" it's a battle not worth fighting, in my opinion. Hours are inconsistent. You're always talked to for memberships. Very difficult to move up, especially if management doesn't like you. 

Very disorganized. They rush you through trainings on spark because they don't want to use the payroll budget for it and have you not on the floor. A 90 minute DEI spark training and they told us to click through it quick and hurry to get back on the floor. We get DEI posters about inclusion and they tuck them in a non visble spot. 

Kind of a cold rei to work at."

I was fired after two years working for REI using my partner's card with my discount while traveling, the total was under $40. Also rang myself up for two sesame snacks while on the register while understaffed and feeling very low blood sugar. I was not aware of the strict rules and had known other employees to do similar things but without any repercussions. This came up four months after it happened and the way they took my statement and passed it along was poorly managed and I felt like I was playing a game of telephone because I never got to talk to anyone directly."
212,REI,"A good place to work, with an inconsistent schedule.",2021-11-18,5.0,Softgoods Specialist,"Great management, great coworkers, great prodeals","Inconsistent schedule, customers can be rude."
213,REI,untrained and drama-loving management,2021-11-18,2.0,Retail Sales Associate,Discounts especially prodeals (buying directly from companies with a massive discount). The sales associates are usually pretty awesome people who love the outdoors and want to help.,"Terrible management, subpar pay, lack of training, and a fake positive culture. REI used to be a great company to work for. In fact, if I was filling this out 5 years ago it would be a completely different review. These days, my wife and all of our family and friends refuse to step foot into the place for a couple of reasons. *clears throat* First things first, Management is terrible. I'm not sure when it happened but REI started rewarding drama-loving untrained children with management positions. As you can imagine this has developed management teams that will step on quite literally anyone to make an extra dollar an hour (I know they make a salary, I'm just making a point) and these children are usually the least ""outdoorsy"" people in the entire building. meaning they know the least about how to use a product or what is best for the customer. Management teams are so obsessed with making their next step in management that they will stomp on you or me or their grandparents or even a puppy to get there. it is what happens when you try to make a nature-loving community into a massive organization. The people who don't care about power don't pursue it, and the people who crave power abuse it. I worked at REI for almost 10 years before I left so take some advice if you want it. Make friends with the associates most of them are awesome people but stay away from management they are not your friends no matter how much they fake it. just trust me. The second thing is membership sales. Don't get me wrong if you shop at rei you should be a member it is very worth it. But selling people multiple memberships is stupid and goes against the very core of why the co-op exists. think about it like this, managers are scored by corporate on their ""Conversion rate"" essentially how many transactions happened that you convert a non-member into a member. which sounds great right. But this is when big business and algorithms get a little funky. Take salt lake city a relatively small city with one of the largest reis in the country. what happens when your market is saturated with members? Well if you are a power-hungry manager that wants to look good on paper you start telling your associates to sell multiple memberships to people. At this point, you lose credibility with the outdoor community. which is what's happening to REI in the outdoorsy states. The longer I worked there the more I noticed that I stopped seeing the pros come in the store and then my friends and now lowly ole me. I would rather spend an extra three bucks and not get a dividend than try to be sold something I don't need."
214,REI,Solid discounts,2021-11-16,4.0,Sales Associate,REI really gives the best discounts I've had working in retail. If you're a big outdoors person it's a solid place to work,It's retail. Your coworkers could be the best and everything but you'll feel the cons of retail often. Fatigue mentally and physically

The REI employee store discount and Industry Pro discounts are a huge upside to having this jobs.

I've just discovered REI's Employee Assistance Program which I am just now making use of to take care of my mental health.

REIs larger commitment towards a more environmentally-sustainable business model in spite of its flaws.","Pay for this position is pretty mediocre not really any room for paygrade growth unless you just get a whole other job within the store or company.

Hours are inconsistent and aren't usually regular enough.

Company-arranged healthcare plans are only eligible for employees who've been with the company for over 1 year with an AWH over 20 hours.

Hard for someone with ASD like me to get promoted to Full-time position or to Lead positions. Can get pretty clique-y."

221,REI,Perfect for the outdoor person,2021-11-08,5.0,Retail Sales Associate,"- Flexibility here has been awesome especially for someone who is in school or is working a separate career job
- Management, at least for me, has always been helpful with solving issues or hearing me out and taking notes
- Comfortable work environment, everyone is very kind, helpful, and no one seems like they are trying to “gatekeep” the outdoors
- Pay is above minimum wage however it is just retail so it isn’t a living wage, it really is a key place for those who are retired, in school, or just love to help others get into the outdoor scene as a side job
- Discount of course, not a bad discount especially if you always find yourself shopping here!
- You don’t have to be a pro or expert level at any outdoor sport to work here, it helps of course but is not required by any means
- Most important, EQUITY! REI as a brand really voices their mind on certain topics and takes it very seriously and also stands with local communities which is nice","- There are tons to learn especially if you are new to some outdoor sports or hobbies, tons of technical concerns to catch up on but this is all totally dependent of what part of the store you choose to work in and isn’t super hard to get familiar with
- Customers, you get good and bad customers no matter where you go but you will run into very proud or know it all types but you can’t let it get to you
- Not much room to grow unless you work here for a while to get up to a management position, however, if you’re looking into a corporate position management will always put a good word in for you!"

There were consequences for anyone who openly disagreed with leadership decisions and they made lots of bad decisions. There is very little understanding of how the business works and who the customers are. They allow senior leadership to retaliate against individual contributors and HR allows them to do it. There are no consequences for poor leadership decisions and dishonest behavior and the company is in an endless cycle of making the same bad decisions over and over again.

Everyone is great to work with and chill.","Management is all over the place. Lack of structure, organization, and communication between management can be infuriating at times. Management does not even write their own department schedules so everyone in the store in under the same scheduler. I also feel that leads are often pushed to the side and not well respected by management. Half the time you can't even tell who is a lead or not as they are not often given actual leadership duties.

336,REI,Great Company; Old-Tech and Processes,2021-08-20,4.0,Sales Lead,"In the retail stores you'll find a range of co-workers; experienced old-timers, young motivated outdoorsy people, gear-heads, career ladder-climbers, fresh-out-of-college children with little work experience, etc. It's a great place to work if you're looking for good benefits, relatively flexible schedule, and a fun, relaxed work environment.","As a leader on the retail floor, I found it hard to motivate people to go above and beyond the menial tasks of the day. Progress is slow, and slower if you consider how out-dated the tech we were using was as well as the processes in place. Additionally, there is quite a bit of cognitive dissonance at REI - from Corporate to the sales floor, there is a serious disconnect that focusses on ""showing/ marketing"" environmental values and not changing any old habits, processes to make real impact."

339,REI,Great co-workers,2021-08-18,3.0,Sales Specialist,"While working for R.E.I. I met a lot of great people and developed good working relationships. It's a good place to work if you enjoy the outdoors as there are good employee discounts and pro-deals with certain vendors. Another perk is the flexible schedule. It's a great part-time job, second job, or job for a college student. Also, excellent benefits even for part-time employees.",To be honest the pay is not great. Low wages for the work. There is also a significant amount of turnover as they have implemented a temporary/seasonal hiring policy. I also found it to be difficult to move up in the company. I think there was a significant amount of favoritism when management was considering promotions.

If you get past a certain point, they expect a lot of expertise and extra investment of energy in time without compensating with better pay, ESPECIALLY in more technical roles. If you want fair pay and you're going into bicycle technical roles, think again. They pay decently for retail, but they expect above-and-beyond expertise on your own time that they will never compensate you for.

362,REI,High Turnover for a reason,2021-07-27,3.0,Frontline,"Great pro deals, friendly and likeminded co workers","forcing memberships on customers even when they politely say no, pay is terribly low no matter experience in industry, amount of single use plastic waste created is staggering, most employees don't have a clue about the products which makes them label readers not helpful resources"
363,REI,"Great environment, a few issues.",2021-07-22,4.0,Retail Sales Associate,"The community at REI is awesome! I have never worked with such a great group of people. Everyone is incredibly kind, hard-working, and adventurous and the managers are incredibly approachable. The discounts are pretty great too.","A common issue I have seen is scheduling, I have seen and had myself man instances of being scheduled outside of my availability. Another issue I had was being constantly denied days off even after a new hiring period because they did not have enough employees in my department. 

The other big issue is the infamous membership sales. Although the membership is a great deal that 99% of customers would benefit from, most people just don't want to hear it. I have seen a lot of people get frustrated because they come in looking for advice or a specific item and all anyone wants to do is sell them a membership. Your hours, pay, and promotions are based off of your membership sales so you have to be really ok with annoying people to succeed in this.

The other problem is training. I am very experienced and knowledgeable in most of the activities we supply and initially applied for a sales position but got hired as a cashier. I was hoping to eventually move to the hard goods sales or bike shop as the manager's made it sound like this was a possibility. If you get hired on as a cashier, you have almost no chance of ever getting to work in a different department."

Loved working with my team, and we had great supervisors and management. The company cares about the employees and invests a lot of time in providing an inclusive and safe environment. Senior management is looking ahead to stay industry competitive and (for the most part) is transparent with objectives and timelines. Moreover, and what I really like, is that they aren't robots. They genuinely care about all employees and display emotion. The company takes a stand on current events and makes its position known to employees. It's not afraid to sever ties with partners who aren't aligned with its values. Regular pulse surveys for the employees that lead to discussions. Two floating Way-days are given each year to get outdoors and do something you love. Great industry perks and discounts. Great medical and 401K options, but it takes a full five years of employment with REI to be fully vested. Matching contribution up to 6%.","No place is perfect. Retail - so it's in a highly vulnerable industry that can affect headcount. But leadership does its best to make reduction a last resort. Pay is relatively sub-par, but perks make up for it. Career advancement is possible, but many departments are linear and hierarchical.

422,REI,Just Don't Do It,2021-06-18,1.0,Sales Lead,The people who work here are (almost without exception) great people.,"So you just saw REI Durham has some job openings and you couldn’t be more excited to apply. I was you. I had a soul once. I’m here to tell you, just don’t do it. 

When I first started, I could not have been more in love with REI. The outdoors was both my passion and place of refuge. I saw an opening four years ago and immediately applied. It was only later that I would discover this place, without a doubt, has the most toxic atmosphere I have ever worked in. This is coming from someone who could not have dranken any more Kool-aid back when I was hired several years ago. 

The people who work here (outside of management) are some of the coolest, most genuine people you will meet, which makes it all the more harder to watch them get screwed over, over and over again. Management is too busy trying to save their own job to listen to feedback from employees. They see anything other than enthusiastic support for their policies as a threat.. Intimidation and bullying is not uncommon.

Alright, it’s been negative so far - let’s address the positives that are commonly brought up: the discount on gear and the healthcare plans. The discounts can seem appealing but once you’re hired you will be regularly over-scheduled/over-worked to the point where all you want to do on your day off is rest. In addition, your days off are often not in a row. How does working four days on, one day off before working another four in a row sound? Additionally, they schedule such that you won’t go into overtime with this type of schedule either (how? I’m still trying to figure it out).

“But great health care plans though, right?” I guarantee the toll it will take on you is not worth it and you will pay for it one way or another. The concrete floors and demand to always be working on the next big project will tear down your body, the gas lighting and ever present fear of being called into an office to be “coached” will crush your mental/emotional health. Management will also use this as a tool to bend you to their will. They will tell you health care isn’t a benefit and threaten to cut your hours if you don’t fall in line, thereby negating your eligibility for health care (during a pandemic no less).

If you haven’t been turned off yet, know that there was a carjacking around the corner a few weeks ago, a window smashed and robbery at Ulta next door a few months ago, and numerous windows smashed in the employee parking lot out back. In all cases management has failed to do much more than tell us not to leave valuables in our cars.

This isn’t hyperbole. This isn’t the case of one or two pissed off employees; this is a toxic culture that rewards brown nosing and crushes dissent. They are able to get away with this because there are only two (count them, 1, 2) HR employees in the entire company. The real swift kick to the testes is the fact that while treating their employees like dirt management loves to tell you how much better than other retailers they are.

Don’t work here, don’t shop here.

To summarize: Great for sycophants and masochists. All others need not apply."

Paid time off builds up quickly, but you can always ask for unpaid time off.

They tried to improve but their history highlights their genuine motives and core values as a corporate conglomerate ate. You are only a number to them and you’ll be treated like you’re not human but a robot or a personality.","It is a corporate department store, no matter what the facade is they sell to the public and their employees. If you’re serious about a career in the outdoor industry, work for a local gear company, obtain sponsorship or start your own company.

561,REI,"The last dog at the bowl dies, REI is slowly starving itself of talent",2021-03-14,1.0,Operations,"-In general, nice socially conscious employees
-The company presents lots of fronts about doing good and some are real
-Neat product, discounts got less and less over years","-Management is overbloated and so protective of their jobs, there's a pretty toxic culture in management 
-So many changes every 6 months, new values, new purpose, new mission...new technology - that's a hard pass. REI attempts to overcome its culture challenges through re-aligning values and performance evaluations instead of actually addressing the core issues - toxic, tenured managers
-Corporate survey is 'blind', it really isn't. Every manager can slice it and sort through and pretty closely identify who submitted which response. Employees are forced to complete the survey, managers are rated on completed survey %'s. SO MANY MANAGERS reported to HR for bullying employees to complete the survey and complete a certain way
-Pay. Needless to say, people will say the pay is low for retail HQ. Shockingly, its about 40% below market. Benefits - 5 year vest for Retirement with a 5% match AT 5 years, health insurance is crap, plan on spending substantial out of pocket even with the high-deductible programs. I was mid-level and paid less going through open insurance market than using REI's
-Slow moving company, slow moving systems with opaque leadership so its managers in their fiefdoms
-Employees are incentivized to turn on each other to make themselves look good
-Zero HR support, active claims of toxic manager behavior (discrimination, bullying) were repeatedly ignored or the ICs were shoved out. Better to be quiet and look elsewhere quietly than speak up"

They were constantly changing the same 3 managers roles over and over. from the 2 years I was there, I had 3 different managers and it was always challenging to just stay on course it seemed. 

Additionally, It's not guaranteed that you'll be hired at a different store, even with 3+ years of working for the company. I worked here for multiple years, took a leave of absence and moved to a different city that had an REI, and was later turned down for a portion that multiple people were hired in. Im currently on a leave of absence, as in, Im receiving benefits from my employer REI, but they didn't hire me. Doesn't make sense to me and doesn't seem right."

In the second location, I was treated lower than a new hire after working with REI for over a year a and a half. They acted as if I knew nothing and only put me in one department.

823,REI,Exceptionally Supportive in Every Aspect Except Compensation,2020-10-02,5.0,Retail Sales Associate,"There are a few reasons above all others to work for REI. This is not a typical retail job. The quality and reputation of the company lend itself to a loyal and exceedingly friendly clientele, a substantial portion of which are in fact part owners. Beyond a respectable and respectful client base, REI puts significant resources into their hiring and training processes so that only the best of the many candidates are selected. As a result, you typically get to work with a group of over-qualified, fun, interesting, and open-minded people. Those people who don't fit into such a culture often don't last long.","A down side of the hands off corporate management of store culture is that cultures vary greatly among stores, depending chiefly on the leadership capacities of the store manager (whose judgement corporate is largely in deference to).

Again, compensation is not great. You will make about the average wage for your position in your area, and periodic cost of living raises. Where I worked, that meant that the unqualified high schoolers across the parking lot at Dicks Sporting Goods were making more to star than I had after 4 years worth of raises from REI. Typically the raises are between 3% and 5% a year."

826,REI,"At the end of the day, it is still retail",2020-09-29,3.0,Sales Specialist,Great benefits – from pro-deals to medical. Some opportunity for growth (if you have a good manager). Usually a good team that can feel more like a group of friends than co-workers.,"A few months after the store closed in mid March and we were furloughed, I was called back to return to work during the COVID-19 shutdown. I did not feel comfortable returning due to pre-existing health conditions, and was not given the option to extend my leave. Because they were offering me my same hours and rate, I was left with one option: resign, losing all my health benefits and unemployment. It later came to my attention that other staff faced the same options as me and were encouraged to return to work, while being told the team was doing everything they could to be safe. In reality, they did not disclose when staff were sick and tested positive for COVID. Not only this, but staff who became sick due to reasons unknown to them (i.e. feeling sick and not yet being able to receive their COVID test results back) were also encouraged to return to work, potentially endangering the whole staff and any customer who enters.

For a company that prides itself on a commitment to its members, it does a poor job at ensuring their health. If they truly cared, they would not be pushing folks to spend an extra $20 to become a member and to spend time shopping in a non-essential business during a pandemic. In fact, the company appears to be not much better than other big box retail stores when it comes to employee health and happiness – encouraging workers to not disclose illness during a pandemic, and making sick-time a luxury afforded to only those fortunate enough to have paid-sick leave saved up. 

Sure, REI can be great. It is a retail job with great pro-deals and a company that appears to care about making a positive impact on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. Some managers are great – and if you work hard, and commit yourself, you can make a career out of it.

However, be forewarned, I started out making less than $10/hr and ended up making less than the pot-head who came to work drunk and/or stoned on at least 5 occasions. I faced more repercussions for attending a job interview than that kid ever did for interacting with customers with whiskey still on his breath."

Instead of one typical “holiday blackout season” there 3 or 4 which makes time off requests difficult for two weeks around basically every major holiday.  
•Low PTO accumulation rate till you work for the company for at leas 5 years.
•Like most retail, constantly under staffed to save payroll.
•Pays under retail average - had to take a pay cut to work here. After a year of exceeding my KPI I was “rewarded” with a .80 raise
•Hourly paid but mgmt will still text you at home with questions/schedule changes which ultimately brings a resting/recovering mind back to a stressed working mind.
•Poses as a higher purposed co-op but the company is ultimately a money-making business like any other retailer.
•Typical retail pettiness amongst staff
•Typical retail late work hours 
•While the capacity is there, little effort to create a balanced or set schedule for mgmt team.
•Very, very little product training with no investment by HQ to implement product specific training programs."

'Oh wow, I can work with people that are outdoors-oriented. REI is a cool co-op. A different kind of retail environment.  Good wages.  Managers will be awesome and outdoorsy. They're a pretty big retailer with a decent reputation. Best positioned to ride out the COVID 19 pandemic!!  Where do I sign-up?","REALITY:
Reality is a bit different. Other over-the-top glowing reviews appearing here are pretty thin on details. Be alert regarding company placed reviews. REI lost a lot of employees due to the pandemic and they're yet to be replaced, Just sayin'...  So yes, you're in the outdoors industry. But make no mistake once you're hired, it's about getting that great store discount. Period. Why? Because REI salaries are beyond disappointing. $15/hr?  Because it's just part-time work, only. Because of high employee turnover due to  COVID 19. Because loyalty to employees is now oddly unloyal. Despite robust outward appearances, REI is in 'pandemic panic' sales mode, and management's cool upbeat vibe changed dramatically as the stores reopened. REI has lost a lot of sales momentum and you'll feel it in the trenches. Seriously adding to the problem, many of America's parks, campgrounds, trails, etc., where REI customers go to travel and recreate are closed.  Fun now?  Define fun.  Sure you're in an outdoorsy place. But, it's now a 'grind it out' retail environment during tough times just like all the other big box stores.  Did I mention that it's about getting the store discounts yet? Yeah, that's the new Reality..."

- If you love the outdoors, the prodeals are great. 
- Its less than it used to be, but there are great community service partners that you get connected with that create great civic partnerships.","-There are two REI cultures. The one at the retail stores where there is a high level of engagement and complete service to the customer. Then there is HQ. The leadership at HQ is as hierarchical and self-absorbed as you will find; where leaders say the PC thing and then do things behind others backs to delay or sabotage those they fear. 
-Leaders get paid very well with little accountability, and there are no other businesses in the market today that offer them this kind of place to hide. 
-For 4 years straight, employee surveys say leaderships inability to make decisions is holding the co-op back. So, when layoffs happened, few leaders got let go and they axed a large number of people actually doing the work. It now makes it harder on all of us to get the work done."

Vast disparities and inconsistencies of employee experience by team. No unified standard for management.

Ineffective and toxic management: inconsistent communication, favoritism, lack of transparency, and observable unconscious/conscious bias. 

Severe lack of diversity.

Lack of action in addressing employee management concerns and complaints. 
I have seen many external campaigns regarding the co-op's efforts to make the outdoors more inclusive. I can't see how this is an authentic representation of the company when the culture from my experience was of a toxic, tokenizing, and extremely exclusive environment.

The impetus for my departure was a culmination of negative experiences and barriers for career growth. The experience I will carry with me through my career is perceived discrimination for severe health challenges that occurred during my employment.

But with COVID-19, everything is going downhill and shady decisions are being made. Barely three weeks into stores being closed, 25% of HQ employees were laid off. It appears the majority of them were women, which is interesting considering the HQ population overall is majority men. Several women on maternity leave or very pregnant were let go. The layoffs also targeted primarily individual contributors, so now there are many ""teams"" of a manager and a direct report. One team I heard of now has a ratio of 1.5 individual contributors to managers (9 ICs to 6 managers). Ineffectual managers were retained while very valuable and needed ICs were cut, greatly increasing workload for their colleagues. Then there's the 10% pay cut the survivors had to take. And to top it off, we all have to work remotely for the foreseeable future but the company has made it very clear that we will not be reimbursed for any expenses to purchase equipment, nor are we allowed to take anything from our office workspace.

980,REI,A huge disappointment,2020-01-22,1.0,Retail Sales Associate,Great co-workers! Hard working and dedicated.,"I started at REI with 10  years of retail experience. My starting pay was $12.00 an hour and I was hired part time. I soon realized that there is NO guarantee of hours, much less 20 hours per week so I would be eligible for insurance. In fact my manager told us new part timers that we were not guaranteed any hours. So depressing...During holidays hours were good but once the holidays were over I was lucky to get 8-12 hours a week. That way the company doesn't have to pay insurance benefits for part time staff. Is really shameful. If you are a part time employee at REI you simply DO NOT MATTER.  I left REI and actually cancelled my membership with the company that I had for years. I will never be a customer again. I encourage anyone who has had a similar experience to speak up!!! This company needs to do better."

Opportunities exist for sales staff to attend experiential, outdoor training events to test gear and learn technical information. REI retail is a great job for young people, retirees or those in between career changes, but cannot be considered a realistic career option for those needing adequate pay or hoping for legitimate upward mobility.","Not financially sustainable as a full time position in any remotely high cost of living area. Most full time staff simply must rely on family/life partners as bread winners. Even management salaries are not competitive. Forbes list surveys combine HQ employee experiences with those in the retail sector, and therefore cannot be considered an accurate representation of the retail experience."
985,REI,Good Job For Extra Money,2020-01-06,3.0,Customer Service Associate,The discount is amazing! The people you work with are great.,It doesn't feel as if the company actually cares about the employees earning a liveable wage.
986,REI,Worked at REI less than a year,2020-01-06,5.0,Footwear Sales Associate,The staff and management are quite laid back and down to earth. They respect their employees and are willing to listen to you if anything needs to be worked out. Also are very good about breaks.,The only thing that put me off was closing late and working longish shifts. There is also one day every couple months where inventory needs to be counted and a handful of employees are picked to stay until about 1 or 2 AM.
987,REI,Meh,2019-12-30,2.0,"HQ, People Department","Discounts and prodeals!
Working for a corporation that does good.","Man, do I have a bittersweet relationship with REI now...
Frankly, I had always wanted to work here. They sell, sell, sell you on the opportunity. Once you're in the door, it's a bit depressing. Cubicles galore (yes, that's changing when the new HQ is complete) and managers sit alongside the window like it's corporate America in 2007.
It's clique-y and information is on a need-to-know basis, no matter how much they try to pretend they're transparent. If you're an ""IC"" (individual contributor) you are most definitely treated differently than people managers. It's laughable, really.
There are a couple of good people on the HR team. A couple of the best ones retired, leaving pretty big shoes to fill. Otherwise there was a lot of schmoozing at the manager/leadership/business level but not really any time spending getting to know the staff, besides maybe 30-45 minutes when you first join.
In my role, I felt like  a cog. Doing one think over and over again, reporting on it weekly because somebody somewhere was looking at numbers that didn't really matter anyway because they're the wrong metrics.
There are some cool teams at REI and some departments doing state of the art stuff; don't get me wrong. But there is a weird, dichotomous culture and you're not included if you're not one of the cool kids."

Co-workers are usually awesome","Memberships are everything to this company. Sell them well, becomes a favorite, be average at selling them, mean less than dirt to them.

The pay is AWFUL especially if you are a tech. You have to know more technical stuff on top of everything everyone else knows in the store and you might be getting paid less than a cashier who knows nothing which is already not enough to begin with.

No seniority - A person starting yesterday who sells memberships better than a person who has worked here 15 years even with 0 knowledge can literally take all your hours.

No loyalty - Management is infamous for never backing up employees to customers. You will be thrown under the bus even if you did everything right.

Been asking to be trained in other areas of the store for 4 years now with 0 results. Camping sales lead asked for me to be personally trained in camping and was told no by management. So 0 opportunity for advancement.

Management is awful. In the four years i've worked here the management turn over rate is scary; 12 managers at my store alone in 4 years.

They will skimp hours everywhere they can to avoid paying you more. Example you have to work 25 hours on a holiday week to get holiday pay. They will purposely schedule everyone they can at 23 that week. 

If you aren't full time, never rely on having benefits. You will definitely roll under the 20 hour minimum required to maintain getting them. So if you get braces or something for dental one year, you might end up paying for them fully the next because you dropped nuder and are no longer receiving dental.

They don't care about you at all. All they care about is selling memberships. You could be a 15 year veteran here, and if someone starts a week ago and sells more memberships, they will give you 10 hours a week and this new person who literally knows nothing about anything at the store, but sells memberships well 45 hours a week."

The employee discounts are worth getting a part time position for if you want to save a boatload of money. 

Management does their best to work around schedules.","Often understaffed and not a minute went by where we weren't running across our giant department. 

Formal training is slim. You get the background information but the technical knowledge is really up to you. I was expected to know how to fit $500 ski boots and sell very expensive skis with little to no knowledge.

1111,REI,"Kennesaw, Ga. REI",2019-04-01,1.0,Sales Specialist,"I’ve worked for multiple REI stores over the course of a few years.  I originally began at the Kennesaw REI in 2014 and loved it. I transferred to the Boulder, Co location and also really enjoyed my time there. I worked off and on for the company over a course of a few years. However, when I came back in 2018 to work at the Kennesaw location is was a totally different company.   Most employees are knowledgeable,  friendly, and helpful. The customers are amazing. I will say the STORE managers at REI Kennesaw and Boulder are both wonderful people and work extremely hard. You have a bunch of time for outdoor activities because they often cut hours unexpectedly!","I want to start out by saying I once loved REI and what they stood for. And not all locations are like this. When I came back to work at the kennesaw REI in 2018 the store was totally different. All of the amazing managers I had known before had moved away. When I inquired as to why, it seemed there was little room for growth in management for “certain types of people”. The current management at this location is very different from the Boulder Co. store and the earlier Kennesaw REI I knew and loved. They’re evasive when it comes to their employee obligations  and more often than not, have trouble talking with their employees about sensitive topics. Since I left I’ve kept in touch with a couple of current employees who feel they are being personally attacked because of their gender and look. I too, feel this way, but didn’t feel like I had anyone to talk to because the ones who I was supposed to tell were the same people exhibiting this unprofessional behavior. For a company who preaches equality and fairness it was a surprise.  I’ve never felt more inequality at a job. The only people who can sustain a living on their “salary” are retirees and management.  And they cut hours unexpectedly. So before you take a “full time position” please have a back up plan because I know I was left stranded. It’s so unfortunate but I can’t in good conscious allow unsuspecting good people to walk into the same situation I did."

For the majority, we never know when we'll work or how many hours we'll get from one week to the next.

Management was super flexible with my schedule as long as it was working for both of us. 

The company put some solid effort into making pay appropriate for the local cost of living and the expertise they desire from employees. 

Deals are amazing.","Store management can be narrowly focused on the $ and lack inspiring leadership skills. 

Too much weight is put on membership sales and not enough on making sure customers get out the door with the right product.  As employees, we are told that integrity is everything, and I saw that attitude every day from my coworkers. However, pay raises and bonuses were, and are again, based primarily on membership sales.

Despite rousing company all-hands meetings, information is hoarded and execution is pretty much impossible. So upper management simply changes the mission statement. There are lots of critics and low sense of trust - very easy to feel one's personal value fizzle. I had 6 managers in 4 years - 75% of them had no business leading teams.

The work-life balance isn't balanced across the teams, and the PTO is not progressive.

It's funny there's a belief that ""old-timers"" can't handle change, because their team, managers, and agendas change nearly every quarter.

The pace can be fast, and it’s very customer centric, so if you like that (like I did), you’ll thrive there. Part-time employees can become eligible for health care, which is nice. Some people list pro-deals (steep industry discounts) as a benefit, I feel ambivalent about them. You will meet some great people at the co-op: students, retirees, seasonal outdoor pros (guides, biologists, geologists, etc), and folks that will help you get into sports/activities you haven’t done. Never gone backpacking? Someone will definitely take you on a trip. Climb a mountain? Same-same. Many stores also have an employee gear bank, so you can gear up for a trip without first having to outfit yourself. This is the segway into the cons...","You will be broke. You will be paid peanuts, even as a manager. Until you are promoted to Store Manager, you will not be earning a living wage in most of California. You will be outfitting people who do have money. Every day. Yes, you get psyched for their adventures (I’m not a hater), and that makes you want to outfit yourself. Yes, you get sweet deals, but 50% off of a $3000 bike or kayak is still way more than you can afford to spend if you are making $13 an hour and working 30 hours per week. Also, you are in an environment  designed to stimulate buying (as with all retail environments), and this will effect you as well. I have way more Nalgene bottles and t shirts than I will ever need. If you want to make the co-op a career, that will require getting promoted past Retail Sales Manager, unless you like eviction and malnourishment. Unfortunately, REI is rather opaque in terms of  how you can actually do this, and 3 to 5 percent annual raises are not super awesome. There is a lot of carrot dangling and not a lot of bona fide growth."

The benefits are fair, although not tremendous. Great discounts on gear (an awesome thing if you're a part timer and want to get latest and greatest equipment for cheap)

They DO promote within.  In my experience, opportunities have been provided due to motivation, prior experience and a good work ethic. They offer a pathway for moving up in the company if you're interested and show an aptitude for it.

The co-op's direction is inspiring and makes every employee feel like they count. This creates a real family vibe within the stores when we're working together.","Pay could be better. It IS retail, but it's a bit of a struggle sometimes. If I were stressed out here more often, I'd likely change jobs but, you're paid for stress. Don't work here expecting to get rich.

Average benefits, unless your first interest in getting gear.  People have to make sacrifices to work here.  The CEO committed to ""stay ahead"" of the market pay scale, but REI has failed to do so in many areas of the country.  Employees start at minimum wage, or just above, and are held to a very high standard for performance.  Merit increases are a joke, between 1% and 5%, once a year, with no adjustment for inflation.  Cost of medical benefit premium increases are greater than the merit increase.  It is impossible to stay in the job without advancing to management.  

Highly biased and competitive to advance in their retail management.  A boss who chooses not to support you can destroy your chances to advance, transfer or grow in any way.  
Absolutely no employment reward for tenure.  If you don't advance, you are managed out of your job, and they want young, hungry people in their leadership roles, willing to relocate.   Minimal relocation financial support."

Employees are smart and thoughtful, there is a sense of community+teamwork amongst coworkers, pretty awesome!","Some customers can be demanding in the strangest ways... We are selling high priced products to individuals and there can be a sense of entitlement when customers come in.  Example:Woman came in the other day asking to do a return ""i dont have a receipt for my items and I got them 4 months ago...oh also they were a gift so its not even under my membership"" she demanded a refund for the items... in cash, she was a member however. 

On REI's actual part only issue I have personally had is the systems are sometimes strange and could be updated for the Retail Environment which would add to faster processes and a seamless customer experience and employee experience as well.

Also its Retail so Full Time does not really exist in that environment anymore, it's an amazing second job but if you want something fulltime you will have to commit to the company or really have an interest in Outdoor Activities (Which is not really a bad thing I think you should be dedicated if you want to move up, you can tell other employees who are full time really live and breathe the lifestyle which is pretty awesome actually you can learn a lot from them)"

1233,REI,Inconsistent working environment,2018-08-09,2.0,Retail Sales Manager,"- Many of the employees are stellar! They live and breath for the co-op and the customers who spend there money with us. 
- The pro-deals are pretty awesome (you may need a second job to support your pro-deal fund.)
- The company’s 401k is absolutely incredible! They don’t match, instead they just put in. The most I’ve seen them contribute was almost 14% which is really insane. 
- Insurance is alright, something I like is they offer the same two plans for ALL employees regardless of your position in the company. More info can be found on google with you type in ‘REI for your benefit’ 
- Vacation is pretty average from what I’ve read, it all depends on how long you’ve worked for the company and if your full time or part time. 
- I’m a fan of our CEO and his get it done attitude, I just wished it translated down to the retail level..","- Work life balance really isn’t a thing... as I’m sure as most companies do REI has different pay bands for different areas. Some of these pay bands seem to do a pretty good job at supporting folks and making it so they don’t have to work another job (depending on your position.) Others not so much.. basically even in a management position expect to need to work another PT job if you are the sole/main provider of your family. The thing that gets me most about this is REI promotes and encourages its staff to go outside and adventure in your own way - promoting a work life balance. However seeing as most employees need to have another job (including myself) just to make basic ends meet (food, shelter, transportation, phone and that’s pretty much it..) vacation time and days off are used to work more, not get out and adventure. If REI really wants to promote a work life balance the need to again reevaluate there pay structure seeing how so many companies are starting 2-3$ higher than our starting pay. Or stop promoting the balance. 
- There is a lack of ownership with some (my) of the Store Managers that is rather frustrating, I don’t understand how they get away with some of the things that happen. I’ve often spoken with HR regarding something and 95% of the time I feel as if they do little to nothing rather than help work mediate the issue. I’ve certainly learned a lot in particular to thing I could/should be doing differently but I have yet to see any changes from my supervisor. 
- Smaller stores seem to get the short end of the stick when it comes to payroll. When our payroll is ‘tight’ it is really tight especially when you see a rush of some kind. This often leads to employees feeling overworked and undervalued. In contrast I’ve visited larger stores who seem to always have staff hanging out chatting with each other (I know they have there rushes too) or having the luxury of spending ample time with a single 
customer rather than multitasking with 4+ customers. 
- I used to think REI provided a great learning environment for those wanting to grow within the company. Some store managers may be good at this, but I’ve seen my Store Manager change multiple peoples minds due to the way they execute things/manage conflict and ultimately making it so someone who wanted to grow within the company left the co-op to pursue other ventures. As someone who once was impassioned about growing with REI (as were one of my peers) neither of us have any desire to progress while under our current store manager. You’d think this might be a wake up call to someone hire up...
- There is really no gear repair for REI branded items, so if you have a piece of REI branded gear needing to be fixed, your pretty much out of luck. This does not instill much confidence in the REI brand seeing as rather than sending it in to get fixed your kinda out of luck which seems to be incredibly unsustainable and not great for the environment. We should have something like Patagonia where we can send product in for customers to get repaired at the cost of shipping one way."
1234,REI,Keeping up with business trends but masquerading as a Retail Cooperative.,2018-08-09,4.0,Retail Sales Manager,"Employees are quality and provide  great working environment.
Company culture is inclusive and progressive. They try to do the right thing.
Pay is adequate there is a lot of talk about work life balance. 
Selling environment is not pressured. Customer needs come first 
Strong employee personal relationships and connectedness regarding outdoor adventure and fun.","There is flux at the corporate levels of retail and it trickles down to the stores upsetting the flow at the store management/employee level. 
Employees /managers with time on the books are identified as not agile, not flexible, less creative with solutions and less cooperative. Managers are retained based on how they perform in the “new agile, we’re competing with Amazon” environment. Experience is seen as inflexibility and young managers who often have significantly less EI and sense of the needs of the employee teams and customer service are promoted past older managers who have stronger relationships and are more likely to be servant leaders. There are periodic clean outs of store managers with years of service. No explanation is given and they are replaced by less experienced and significantly less expensive short time managers. 
The culture presents as employee centered but just like every business it is fairly ruthless in terms of coaching and documenting. Employees MUST pay attention to coaching and respond. There are no second chances. 
Sales associate pay is fairly retail standard. Mostly start at minimum wage but the pay coupled with inconsistent hours makes getting a second job very difficult. If you are indolent, unfocused or not customer centered your hours will diminish until you leave on your own. On the positive side, good employees are rewarded with more hours."

It could prepare you to work at any level in the outdoor industry. You can get in great shape with all that you do there physically.","You probably won't see the cons until you are a few years in, it starts out great...In my personal opinion REI does not pay a livable wage for many people (retail, I know).  Many co workers will be making 33 percent more that you. IMO you should only work here if 1. You are in college or high school, 2. you are independently wealthy, 3. Your significant other or family can support you, or 4. You are retired. 5. you want to build up your equipment.  (Some other things)...If you work at a great store, your management may be different from mine (and there are locations with fantastic management) however my managers did not lead by example. Most of the time they were in the office. Managers will very rarely back you up with customers, they prefer you to be subservient to themselves and customers even though you are the one who is teaching each customer how to enjoy themselves and stay safe while enjoying the outdoors. Internally, they are constantly pushing you to sell memberships. REI is (IMO) moving away from selling equipment. Now they are basically pushing their own line and they might as well be a  flagship store. If you want to deal with screaming 17 year old high school students who can't find the right down jacket this is the place for you.  Also, customers will constantly be trying to scheme on returning items. I have had people try and return tents that are 22 years old. This is an average day.  I could continue. Basically I loved REI as a customer prior to working there, and I think it's best to stay a customer. My store was all based on manager favorites."

I worked in GA, so we frequently had people coming in who were going to hike the AT (or at least big sections). It was rewarding to have them come back and tell me how much they loved the gear I outfitted them with. I never felt any pressure to force people into a more expensive pack or tent, if they didn't need it. Generally the focus was on making sure people had the right gear so their outdoor experience was good.

I liked getting regular pay raises, and I was glad that my hard work was appreciated with an unexpected pay raise once. 

Really fun people to work with (for the most part). 

Lots of my original group went on to become managers (I can count at least five). I know of one that became a manager at a flagship store, which really speaks to the room for mobility in the company. 

Health insurance is apparently very good, although I never had it.

Employee discount was fantastic.","No surprise that some customers were jerks.

When I first started, there was this weird competition to sell memberships (there was a chart that had everyone's membership sales for the month). This was a big metric of our performance, and I know for a fact that one employee who occasionally worked in the back office was ""stealing"" memberships from other people to boost their numbers."

Felt very unsupported especially when the store got too busy for the staff to handle without help of the managers. Sometimes they wouldn't respond to multiple requests for help. Passive aggressive and some micromanaging. Skeptical of the way REI markets itself to the reality. You cannot afford to live much less travel if it's the only job you have. And the whole public campaign on increasing employees wages to reflect the increased cost of living in certain cities afforded me a 30 cent raise per hour. Needless to say, I still couldn't afford to live... my hours were cut for not selling enough memberships. There is too much pressure on memberships.

Some incredibly amazing and talented people to work with.","Leadership is messy at best, a lot of conflict with decision making due to leaders “empowering” teams to decide best path forward which oftentimes results in conflicting goals being championing by cross functional teams. Decisions are oftentimes made without full examination of downstream effects resulting in complete 180’s when the negative outcomes of not well thought out decisions are realized. 
Too many meetings and not enough time to actually work. There are meetings about the meeting about the meeting about the meeting, ad infinitum. And then lots of side meetings about those meetings to change decisions even after consensus is seemingly made in the larger group meetings. There is a lot of backstabbing and manipulation happening as well as a lot of people unqualified to do their jobs without a lot of direction/course correction. They even have a term for it...they call it ‘REI nice’.
The co-op is incredibly scared of Amazon and it’s future relevancy but isn’t making steps to actually change. Believing instead that it’s history as outdoors experts will help them weather the storm. 
Too many leadership people at HQ who have never worked anywhere else in their careers so have no idea how to work differently or better. 
These are good people, nice people and well meaning people who just, unfortunately, don’t have the appropriate experience and/or outside perspectives to take the business forward. There is a very strong culture of “this is how we’ve always done it” that pervades the company. And sadly, no top leaders who are willing to or know how to step in and make the changes necessary. 
The co-op has a strong desire to diversify and be more inclusive of minorities (sexual as well as race) but it isn’t reflected in the organization in a meaningful way. If you identify in this category be prepared to really feel your ‘otherness’. 
Speaking of a non-inclusive environment, if you aren’t gun-ho into the outdoors it doesn’t matter in the slightest how good you are at your job...you will feel constantly judged and eventually will be pushed out. (By outdoors they mean scaling mountains, living in the wilderness for weeks, ice axing and other extreme outdoors adventures not casual Sunday hikes) As my boss said “non-outdoors folk are kinda like a virus that the good bacteria will get rid of”"

Evaluations seem to penalize performance that deviates from a standard of perfection that is largely a mystery except to management. Reviews happen several times a year but compensation happens annually on an incremental basis.

It sounds like an amazing department to work in but it is incredibly toxic. ""Leadership"" within the department are terrible people managers, and bullying is clearly tolerated (even after multiple reports to and incidents documented by HR) is allowed to stay. The HR department cannot be trusted to be an ally to employees, only to managers who cannot or will not change. There is no room for any ambitious individual, as no one, except department managers, is allowed to think for themsevevs or make decisions. Constructive feedback will trigger a ""get this employee out of here"" reaction, not any self-reflection on how the department's leadership could improve.

Twice a year, you get a paid Yay Day to go outside (paid 6 hrs for part-time, 8 hrs for full-time employees) and do something you love. Sales managers are encouraging and helpful.

Vacation is now use it or lose it, but you are way too swamped to ever use it all.  Working from home one day a week was the norm.  Now you have to get it signed off.  Managers used to say thank you and would give a few comp days after particularly grueling project wrapped up.  Now neither happen.  So many people from Nordstrom came to REI to get away from their toxic culture.  Instead they brought their gossipy, mean girl ways with them.

1345,REI,"Wish it had been better, disappointing overall",2018-02-01,3.0,Manager In Marketing Org,"I worked at the corporate headquarters in Kent, Washington so my perceptions are based on that NOT working in one of the retail stores. 

Pros:
- CEO -- I think Jerry has been and will be a good leader. The company needs a big shake-up and he has been laying that groundwork.
- General sense of mission among employees; folks are passionate about the outdoors, being fit and active, and want their work to impact others who have the same outlook
- Employee discount. It's very good. Flat rate discount on everything and direct-from-brand special, VERY deep discounts. Coworkers ""over-bought"" in my opinion because they could. Easy to watch your pay float right back to REI","Well, I have a few:
- The company invests in their retail stores and are WAY behind in investment in technology and professional staff
- Many people at corporate were promoted from the stores. That's nice but has led to something of a group-think mentality and not enough diversity -- in terms of experience -- among the corporate staff. Jerry knows this and has tasked leadership to make changes, but that's a slow boat to turn around and will take a long time to impact.
- Marketing leadership. This was the division I worked in and I thought it was very poor. Related: HR. In the sense of professional development and coaching managers on how to set expectations to manage poor performers out of the company. At my exit interview, two different people from HR asked if the reason I was leaving was because of a leader in my org. If they know there's a problem, why hasn't a change been made?
- Pay. Compensation is WAY below market rate. I, and seemingly everyone else, took a pay cut to work there and the employee discount certainly didn't make up for it."
1346,REI,Outdoor School,2018-01-31,5.0,Outdoor Programs Supervisor,"Excellent Benifits, ranging from Heath care, (vision and dental) to generous time off and the expectation of a healthy work life Balance.  Also the quality products available to use at extreme discounts and the encouragement from management to take time to get outside and play.",The pay is on the lower end for the positions/ titles.  Also the availability of upward movement is limited and slow do to everyone wanting to stay put.
1347,REI,You'd better like cool aide.,2018-01-30,2.0,Customer Services,1. Discount .... there is literally nothing else. The only reason anyone should ever work here is for the discount...not that they pay you enough to buy anything anyway... but the idea is nice. The discount is the ONLY reason this review has more than one star.,"1. Hours - I was hired as part time and gave management a full 40 hours of availability. I was given under 20 hours a week and frequently scheduled during times that conflicted with the availability I gave them. 

2. Attitude - Management was extremely condescending and patronizing at times. Make no mistake... most of the employees are doing minimum wage, non-skilled work that a monkey could do. Management seemed to take it upon themselves to not let us forget that. This was a common theme I witnessed through all departments.

3. You'd better like Cool aide - Showing up and doing your best to ensure customers are leaving satisfied is not enough. You'd better live, breathe and eat their core values and simultaneously be a court jester.  If you're not wearing socks with sandals, you don't boulder at Joshua Tree or you don't spend your free time hiking sections of the PCT, then you're just one granola bar away from getting let go. 

4. Cliquey - Newcomers are not welcomed, especially anyone who's under 35. Much of the staff was middle aged and many were unwilling to engage new faces. If you want to make friends, you'd better be a single 48 year old and spend your time cleaning local beaches of trash or wearing fanny packs...... or both.

5. Smoke and mirrors - When you're hired, you're explained all of the benefits of working at REI... profit sharing, discounts, health insurance, 401k... etc. You'll soon find out that to qualify for health insurance you'll have to maintain a 20 hour a week average for 1000 hours... which is difficult to do when you're not even scheduled 20 hours a week. That also pretty much excludes any kind of profit sharing and 401k contribution simultaneously. The pay is minimum wage, which is the standard among billion dollar companies. What do they expect from you for your lucrative $11.00/hr pay? Your dignity. 

5A. Yay-Days - You get what is called a ""yay day"" which is basically just a paid day off, because its cheaper to pay you minimum wage for a day that you don't work than to actually just pay you a livable wage. Its just an internal marketing scheme to make it look like the actually care about your work-life balance. One day a year?! OH LUCKY ME! 

5B. OPT-OUTSIDE - The biggest joke in retail history. We are given black friday off from work to appear like the company cares about its employees and getting outside, when in reality the months of Nov-December is one giant black friday. Thanksgiving is sandwiched by heavy sales... and black friday is closed so all the good ole' boy club of REI can post on social media about not being materialistic in their $600 Arc Teryx jacket.... come on. 

6. Advancement - Does't exist unless you've satisfied numbers 3 and 4. Every time I mentioned transfer to a different department I was either laughed off or completely ignored. 

7. Memberships - Where do I even start? I'll keep it short and sweet. You are REQUIRED to sell memberships but there is absolutely no incentive. You get nothing for doing it, but if you don't pull it off you are scrutinized. This alone is the sharks fin breaking the waters surface. If you get a job here, try not to fall overboard because those sharks are blood thirsty!"

Like minded community","A lot! I really wanted to love REI. As a lifelong outdoor person, I was initially stoked to work here. However over the course of two years the luster wore off, and the true image of what this “co-op” is appeared. When you are hired at REI you are led to believe that you will make good money, and step into a career. What they actually do is effectively brainwash you into thinking what they offer is unequivocally amazing. Once You’ve been working here a little while the veil is stripped off and you’re left quivering in a corner wondering what happened. 

First, the hours and pay are terrible. If you like working low inconsistent hours, with low pay, only to be called in repeatedly during the holidays to sell your soul to capitalism, you will love it here. 

You are constantly pushed to sell memberships. Regardless of how knowledgeable you are on the product, if you don’t sell enough memberships, you can kiss your hours goodbye! Learn how to sling memberships and fast If you need this job to actually live off of. REI hires a lot of people who work very occasionally cause they want the discounts. It is really difficult to move up into the company, you have to be prolific at selling memberships, luck into being a favorite of management and generally sell your souls to the devil. Yes multiple souls.

You are constantly evaluated and must always appear busy even if there is nothing to do. It seems that management decides who you are and treats you accordingly over the course of your time there. For example my direct manager took a liking to me and while we were buddy buddy, my hours took a big hit. I mentioned this multiple times and he’d kinda laugh it off and make jokes. 

Last but not least, this is retail. Look up retail memes on google, then multiply this by a cult and you get REI."

Great company if you get in at a high level, which has high bonuses, and are not looking to move up within the company.   If all bonuses pay out, it is nice, but there is not guarantee of that.","Lower than average market pay. mediocre perks (Ex. bus passes are only 50% company paid). Negotiate salary hard upfront. Do not plan on making any significant increase in income year-over-year as the maximum you will ever get is a 3-4% raise, with 2-3% being the average for nearly everyone. Bonus is based on company performance compared to an arbitrary projected growth. This means that even if the company does well, it might not do ""well enough"" to pay out the bonus. In the end all bonus and raise amounts are based on what the board approves, so you never really know. Small company means that upward mobility is severely limited and you usually have to wait for someone to retire to move up. Also, it is harder for an internal employee to get a job then an external candidate (if you are considering trying to get in and then move around).

there is an over saturation of the REI culture although many of the values are compromised at the flagship store, THIS STORE DOES NOT RECYCLE

Working at the newest flagship is less rewarding than working at any other non-flagship store. The flagship is currently under performing and meeting only very few sales goals, so headquarters has reduced the payroll which leads to under staffing, and unfair scheduling practices. Those that get hours, are still expected by management to sell more memberships than other stores that are adequately staffed. The employees of this store bare the burden of the inaccurate market predictions for the DC area. Repeated feedback from employees has not improved the situation of the flagship.

Mandatory weekends. They make sure to keep as many of their employees under 20 hours to make sure they don't qualify for any benefits (they actually got called out on this and only made minor changes because of the threat of a union). They advertise paid time off as a perk of part time employment  but it cannot be used as traditional pto, it is considered a ""yay day"" where they pay you a couple hours to go do stuff outside twice a year, hardly something I would consider paid time off.

There are pockets of really good and talented people.,"Leadership at REI has some serious blind spots. Every corporate leadership book I have ever read speaks to creating a culture centered on trust, candor, and providing clear goals. REI headquarters lacks these basic building blocks required for a healthy working culture and is instead run on fear, misdirection, and a serious lack of trust. 
 
Hoping for a meritocracy, I was instead plunged into a machiavellian culture where posturing, alliances, and manipulation ruled the day. Leaders would regularly withhold information, change goals at the 11th hour, and were rarely empathetic to the ripple and impact on individual contributors. Pushback was not tolerated and most of the stress on the workforce came from sophomoric leaders who lacked confidence in their decisions and constantly wavered under the pressure of an impulsive c-suite. It quickly became clear that collaboration took a backseat to cutthroat individual competition and politics. Meetings were a constant display of bombastic speeches laden with indecision and empty promises to keep the staff from revolting.

Watch out. I wouldn't recommend REI to anyone. It’s not a resume builder, and it certainly doesn’t lead anywhere good."

They also offer generous employee discounts, and their clothing, footwear, and gear is top quality.  Lots of fun and cool people to work with who enjoy their jobs, and you find new buddies to go have fun paddling, biking, etc.","Pay was not the greatest, but not the worst either.  Easy to spend your paycheck when taking advantage of the employee discounts, but hey, you are having fun and now you have awesome gear to go play with.

They used to require a minimum of membership sales based on hours worked, but thankfully they finally eliminated that requirement.  It pressured the employees to spend more time pushing memberships than actually helping the customers and increasing actual sales, and with more customer-centric focus the customers would naturally be more inclined to want a membership, rather than being annoyed that 5 employees have now tried to sell them a membership instead of helping them.  

I did not agree with their criteria for how many people to schedule, which often caused us to be short handed and lose sales due to not enough staff to help them.

Also there was no one person or persons responsible for answering the phone.  It was up to whoever wanted to answer, and as a result it often went unanswered, many times because staff was tied up explaining the membership to a customer.  Because our store was in an odd location that was not easy to get to, most calls were to get directions to the store, and the other majority was people asking if we had a certain product or size.  We lost a huge amount of business because people wound up going elsewhere just because no one answered the phone. Had they hired one person just to answer the phone, the increases in sales would have more than paid for that one person's salary.
As with any company, there can be a few bad seeds, which was the case when I was there, but they were eventually terminated after I blew the whistle.  Most folks were great."

The discounts are decent and the prodeals even better--if you can swing them on your lean paychecks. Sometimes you can win some swag and it’s really cool when that happens.,"What it boils down to is that REI is a paycheck to paycheck job. If you're not a manager you're going to have difficulty ever getting enough hours to survive on. Most of REI’s retail workforce is hired on as seasonal part time workers and they’re often made to believe that they have a shot at moving into a full time position if they meet their goals. Don’t be fooled. It is nearly impossible to be considered for a full time position because there are hardly any. 

As a part time employee you will be susceptible to highly fluctuating schedules, you'll never seem to get enough hours, you'll be at the mercy of frequent payroll cutbacks, and worse than Walmart wages. Other drawbacks include: dropped health benefits, membership sales are still demanding and stressful, there is a lot of favoritism in play by management, upward movement is nearly non-existent, and there is high employee turnover which impacts the morale (you will miss the employees who have become like family, because they became so fed up and couldn't stick it out anymore).

Be aware that If you become one of the fortunate part timers who qualify for health coverage, they’re not guaranteed. You’ll need to maintain a rolling average of 20 hours a week to remain eligible. If your scheduled hours fall below that, then your benefits will be dropped. It happens to alot many employees and it's painful to witness. With that said, if you don't need the hours or benefits it's a fantastic place to work! 

More importantly, part time employees often struggle and experience hardship you never thought was imaginable at a cooperative renown for its values. REI has sadly been taken over by corporate interests and has lost its way in valuing its people. These days It's all about profits and the bottom line. 

There's an employee movement and an online petition that are eye openers. You can learn more about the movement by doing a google search for REI Employees for Real Change. The petition can be found by going to coworker.org--just search REI and it should pop up. It's all true. Good luck."

REI needs to wake up to see what the IT upper management is doing.  TONS of trips to India for outsourcing, which doesn't align with the REI culture.  Rumor has it that there are kickbacks from the Indian companies to upper management.  At the director level, high school games are played with who you like and don't like.  Work like balance for most of the company except IT.  If there is a project, they don't care about family, you will get it done, without parties that are held at headquarters or things your family.

Inability for much mobility with the company. if you work at one store and work your way up to Store Manager or whatever you have to basically stay at that location. I knew Assistant Managers and Sales Leads that had to start over and become Retail Sales Specialists upon transferring to other locations.

1615,REI,Customer Service,2016-11-03,3.0,Customer Service,"REI has a great culture for those who are or want to be involved with the outdoors. Most people who work on the sales floor are highly knowledgable, not just in technical specifications for products but also in practical applications for individual pieces, even in situations that are not a part of the 'outdoor' context. If you don't know something, either about an outdoor activity or a product, you can quickly learn; REI has wonderful opportunities for learning, for employees, co-op members, and everyday customers.

REI also has a very good deal with the companies they deal with. Depending on the company, an employee can get an enormous discount off of wholesale value, even if it is only once a year. For items like bike racks and kayaks, once a year is enough!

REI has been doing better recently, which I partially attribute to the new CEO Jerry Stritzke. I left before he came onboard in Oct. 2013, but REI as a brand has flourished under his guiding hand.","Not all REI's are alike; I've been to ones with a high turnover and a corporate vibe (very profit driven), and others where the team has been together for years. At the store where I worked, it wasn't unusual to stick around and quite a few team members had been there for upward of five years. That being said, the culture wasn't conducive to fully welcoming new co-workers into the fold. As a part of the customer service team (where it is easiest to get a position; less training than other positions and a higher turnover rate), I was stuck behind a table ringing things and did not have a lot of opportunity to reach out; it also took a while for a team member to cross-train into another department. In part, this is because the team members in that department aren't likely to leave and open up another spot, but it seemed like the process was very slow.

Otherwise, hours were heavily dependent on which manager liked you and what sales were projected to be at. Managers seem to write the schedule on a rotating basis. If the upcoming week was projected to be slow and the manager writing the schedule liked you, then you were in the clear. Otherwise, it might be best to get a second job. I know of quite a few team members who left because they couldn't support themselves on the hours they were working. You could go from a few shifts a week to one shift every two weeks."
1616,REI,"Great culture, fun people & an amazing mission",2016-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Within the first two weeks, I knew I had landed with the right employer. It's so easy to fall in love with people who are smart, talented and driven to connect people to the outdoors, which stems from the top. You are given the opportunity to not only develop yourself, but help the co-op to develop and grow. We DO truly believe that a life outdoors is a life well lived and I can't wait to see where we go next.","With any company, we are (at times) moving so fast and there are so many projects in flight, that it's hard to know which is most important and takes precedence. There is open & authentic communication between upper management, which helps take a lot of the ambiguity and anxiety away."

It was like working with family.,It's so impossible to move up or even switch departments. After a year of asking I was finally moved. Some weren't so lucky and were stuck for 5+ years before moving to another store just to have any sort of opportunity. And it doesn't reflect every store but the store manager had a problem with bringing his personal problems to work and letting his emotions effect his work.

- GREAT pro deals and discounts. Downside is you may get sucked in and spend your whole paycheck on gear if you're not careful. 
- Pretty flexible schedule, not hard to get time off as long as it's not during the holidays or a sale/promotion. 
- You will learn so much!!! Take the job seriously and learn as much as you can. Our store had a gear bank where you could borrow certain gear to test out. 
- Happy customers - people love REI. I was proud to work there and am still friends with some of my customers. 
- As a girl, it was common to be asked out by customers. Kind of strange, but could be a plus if you are single and looking for an outdoorsy man. 
- I felt very recognized by my coworkers and managers for the good work I did.","-Pretty low pay, especially since I felt that REI employees take their job and the products they sell seriously. Even a couple dollar raise would have made a big difference. Considering all the knowledge you have (and constant information you are taking in) I feel the job should pay more than minimum wage.

-Working with good coworkers who share you passion for the outdoors.

-Assisting and connecting with great customers from all over the world.

-Opportunity to meet professional skiers, climbers, mountaineers, etc.

-Great gear and apparel you get to play with and purchase real cheep through employee discount and pro deals.

-Getting to know vendors and learning about and seeing all their new and existing products.

-Good benefits, i.e. health and dental, 401K, sick and vacation pay.

-Going to the OR show.","-The pay does not match the job requirements and product knowledge you are required to have.

-Starting pay does not match your education nor past work experience.  You start at the lowest base pay for the department you hired for.

-REI only values its employee by the number of memberships you sell.  If you want to work and have lots of hours, you need to meet or exceed your conversion rate or membership goal given to you by management. Nothing else matters. 

-Failure of REI to recognise that selling memberships is not the best way to grow and expand their customer base, making  them a viable business for years to come. Anyone who is savvy in business or who has a Marketing or Business degree knows that you grow your company through your existing company base. To do otherwise is too costly and doomed to failure.

-REI does not know its members. Who are active and who are not.  What their needs and wants are.  They don't even know the retention rate of new members. This is common knowledge amongst most customers and employees. 

-REI lacks leadership and management from corporate on down to the store level.  Most of them are uneducated, unprofessional and have no business sense. This along with the lack of technology have been the main concern of current and past employees including myself who've been with REI for 14 - 25+ years.

-Management is too top heavy. Like the saying goes ""too many chiefs and not enough indians.""  At the store II worked at we have 7 managers when their should only be 3. And we have 10 or more sales leads, two for each department.  As a result we loose a lot of business during slow periods because we don't have enough employees to help customers and answer phone calls.  Money could be better spent on having more employees  rather than managers and sales leads.

-Ongoing customer complaints to corporate and the stores about the lack of management on the floor.  Managers at the store I worked at spend 99% of their time in the back office.

-Failure of managers to do their job. They fail to understand the nature of their job, its requirements and responsibilities. It's ""do as I say, not as I do"" mentality, even when in comes to corporate policy and REI's code of conduct. 

-Burden placed on us employees.  For example, employees are required to find someone to cover their shifts when they were scheduled by mistake by managers for approved time off for vacation or day(s) off. Managers told us it is not their problem even though they made the mistake.  The schedule is written and posted, thus it is our problem. Of course this is unacceptable.  And to be clear, it is managements responsibility to fix it, rewriting the schedule if need be.  Not the employees.

-Disconnect within management.  This means they have no respect for authority amongst themselves nor for the chain of command, i.e. a supervisors blatant disregard for assistant managers authority. It is well known in the store I worked at that employees have gotten into trouble and even written up by a manager regardless  the fact that they were given permission by a manager(s) to do something or given a task or project to do by a manager(s) just because that manager did not like or agree with it.   

-Lacks upward mobility and lots of competition for what is available. 

-No professional training for those wanting to get into management.  It is self guided, internet based, and on the level one would give to someone who is in high school. 

-There is no system in place for innovation at corporate down to the store level. Employees who've tried have been written up or fired.

-Technology.  REI has not upgraded their technology in over 25 years.  It's old and dilapidated.  For example: they went live with their inventory within the last two or three years, while Retail went live with inventory back in the early 1980's.   Nor do they have the capacity to see their numbers live in real time like businesses do today.  

-Loss of focus.  They no longer follow their mission statement nor business plan. They have become a ""glorified Walmart"" wanting all their stores to be an exact mirror images of them selves throughout the country in how they look and products they sell, irregardless of the region or market they are in.  They don't quite grasp the unique and diverse markets within these regions around the country and the specific needs of these customers.

-Failure to understand regional assortment and the need to manage their stores across the country by region.  For example, those living in AZ, TX, and NV like to get out when things cool down. Typically, this is the later part of Sep. through early May. These customers are frustrated because they are not able to buy flip-flops, shorts, etc. because it's  winter time in the Rocky's and all we have are puffy jackets and ski equipment.

-Fairness in the work place. 

-Personal growth and success.  There is no mentoring or coaching by management. You will find it hard or impossible to move around to different departments you are interested in working in.  You are on your own for achieving your professional goals, growth and success whether or not it's with REI or elsewhere.

-Favouritism and nepotism.

-Lackes good work/life balance, which is quite a surprise considering you are working for an outdoor retail store who is all about getting outside."
1628,REI,REI is as great as advertised,2016-10-14,5.0,Sales Specialist,"The employee perks are incredible, well worth it in that alone. The other employees and store management are bought into the company too, the people that work at REI are truly passionate about the outdoors. They are very understanding and want all employees to understand and have a work life balance.","Only con is that the system for getting time off is outdated and difficult, nor are there ""set"" schedules, even for part time employees that would have an easier time with this, if they are doing the job (Like me) in addition to their full time employment. I will say, however, that the difficulty in getting time off should be expected... after all its retail and the needs vary which is another reason ""set schedules"" are not possible. If you sign up here forgetting it is retail, you'll be disappointed, but if you get it from the day you start, it totally make it awesome."

They truly do work towards making sure people are fit and ready to go into the outdoors. One of the best working experiences that I have had.",The only bad experience that I had was the management was too forgiving with one employee. After 6 months when they still didn't understand what their job was they kept them on.
1631,REI,Horribly to long term employees,2016-10-14,1.0,Customer Service and Sales Representative,It's a paycheck even though it's tiny since your hours get cut every holiday and sale.

Nobody knows the policies since they're always changing. No clear sense of direction. Horrible clueless managers making too much money that don't know policies but will send you feedback emails even if you do something right or per another dept. People act beyond nice to the point it's clearly fake. Customers are rude and demanding. This job will bring you down eventually. Also the employee discount is mentioned heavily, do your homework since Amazon is still cheaper. If you're interested in working at REI read the Reddit AMA thread with the new CEO Jerry!"

The pay is not great, and the path to advancement is fairly narrow in scope.  Because REI is large, there is a top down structure, and even store managers have limited flexibility in how they do their job, so those at the bottom are pretty much a peg in a hole."

I can still take advantage of shopping at REI without working there.  Cons:
- Inconsistent hours.  20 hours one week, 8 hours the next, followed by a week with only 4 hours scheduled, following by one with 24 hours of work.  Exceptionally hard to plan budget with the inconsistency.
- Secretive nature of management.  It always seemed that management was hush hush on issues, and not forthcoming in many ways.  Lack of mentorship to new employees to help them succeed.

It seemed like a great place to be. Then the recession of 2008 hit and everything soured. Many of my friends were laid off, but I can accept that as a necessary business decision. However, after the dip in 08, the entire culture changed. Gone were the days of ""work-life balance"" that they love to crow about so much. Work life balance in their case meant, come in to work Sunday...and also take Wednesday off so you don't get any overtime. You were crucified for requesting a day off. I had an enormous bank of vacation and sick time saved up that I was afraid to use for fear of management finding an excuse to get rid of me. No upward mobility whatsoever. I had friends who shed blood sweat and tears for the company, sacrificing weekends and working terrible graveyard shifts just to be seen as a good candidate, only to watch as some manager from a window company or Starbucks was hired for the position they had hoped for. When I left they were hemorrhaging good employees who sought greener pastures and hiring more and more temps.  It felt like a family atmosphere when I started. Now if there is a way to save some money they won't hesitate to cut your job and send you out the door with a handshake and a severance. Work this job if you have another source of income and you just want to take advantage of the discounts."

It's nice that so many REI employees have a genuine interest in outdoor activities, and all have a sincere interest in giving great customer service.

Pro deals and discounts are a great perk.","Having worked under 3 different store managers, the management style is different for each.  One was excellent and really empowered employees to make the store awesome.  One was more hands-off, but still fine.  But the final manager I worked for didn't seem to put much effort into scheduling to make employees happy.  Also, while I was not seeking to advance in the company, I had some coworkers who were passed up for advancement who I think would be excellent supervisors - again this likely has more to do with each individual store's leadership, and not company-wide policy.  As a part time employee, compensation wasn't great, but it's a retail job.  The pro deals and discounts make up for it if you're into outdoor activities."

The membership sales metric has officially been done away with but is still a de facto metric that rewards poor service so long as that service sells memberships.

- excellent health benefits for 20 hours average
- very minimal politics at retail sales level, corporate - another discussion
- customers value your expertise very much so!","- very low pay
- your hours can be cut enough you might find yourself homeless
- seems like the longer you work at REI, the less they ""like"" you, I get the impression
that store management doesn't want your advice, your expertise, and would rather you 
be that $10 an hour beginner employee they hired some time back.
- minimal value given to expertise from store management
- 2nd Level store management (regional) is a joke, they play numbers games with revenue and budget to get their bonus, everything else discussed seems like they actually don't have an interest in.
- Very Poor in-store on going communication to employees. If you happen to work on the day a manager decides to communicate - great! - Off that day, its word of mouth or osmosis.
- very hard to get an honest discussion about career with store management
- store management seems to be always in a hurry, very little time to listen like you would expect someone in management to do as part of their job.
my theory is store management really wants minimal, non-thinking employees, that will just smile and help customers, not challenge the status quo nor ask too many questions.

- I would recommend trying REI out, but don't stay too long, you will wear out your welcome."

Schedule is inconsistent and negatively affects work/life balance. Store management is poor, particularly at the store manager level. There is a subtle but persistent age bias within REI, at least at the retail level. Look at the age of Retail Sales Managers, Store Managers, and District Managers. Within retail the only (and few) middle age and older people are working in customer facing positions. Ethnic diversity is also sorely lacking within the company.

REI is also changing their emphasis and measurements - membership sales and customer satisfaction scores have been replaced with an emphasis on profitability.

REI seems to be loosing it's way and moving away from it's core values. The company is becoming just another corporate retailer with no real distinction from outfits like Dicks, Sports Authority or Cabelas."

The trumpeted company culture is that of positivity, inclusiveness and accommodation, and there are certainly a lot of positives, but there is a lot of hypocrisy evident in this company as well.

This is a great place for someone just getting into the work force, but positions and outlooks are slim with regard to those actually wanting a full-time living wage salary (especially in the San Francisco Bay area).","Where do we start.

Because of the company culture and the almost systematic avoidance of anything resembling conflict, there is a lot of passive-aggressive type of management practices.  For example, you may be flagrantly insubordinate to your supervisor and not get officially reprimanded, but you better not dare exceed the number of late clock-in allowances as that can officially be documented and can get you terminated.

It is a retail business, and therefore retail hours.  However, for part-time employees, the only chance to get both work hours and a decent schedule is if you are a student--classes take priority.  For everyone else REI expects for you to give them priority, even if you already have a full-time job (i.e. they ask that you clear your schedule at 6:00 AM even though you have made it clear that you work a 9-5)."

Prodeals and employee discounts are also an awesome perk.","REI is a retail job and can't be all play. As with any retail or customer-service job, we all have to deal with a mix of customers.

It's easy to have pride in what REI publicly stands for.","In most departments the majority of leaders are recently promoted, either from within or hired from the outside and given a big promotion in the process.

Their performance typically ranges from good/acceptable to shockingly terrible and in most cases it's the latter.

The culture at REI headquarters where I worked changed for the worse two years ago with the new CEO (formerly at Coach) and a new CFO. Management lead by fear and confusion. Managers didn't talk to one another and expected staff to interpret conflicting and confusing direction. Staff was micromanaged and given no autonomy. Every decision, no matter how small, was examined and rehashed.  There was no budget for anything except the pet-project teams of the CEO. Sales goals were unrealistic.

Flexible hours, easy to get time off when needed. Great discounts on gear etc. Great place to work if you don't need the money to support yourself.","Low pay, hard work may be noticed and praised verbally, but is not rewarded with higher pay. Pay raises are quite small (typically 3% per year or less). Managers are overworked and underpaid as well. Little incentive to work harder if you don't want to get into management. Inconsistent scheduling, may be difficult to get hours. 

Business model is low pay, high turnover, keep most employees part time so they don't have to pay for benefits. Small number of full time and management positions with lots of competition, pay is still pretty low for the full time positions ($14 per hour to start, managers make more like $15-20 per hour)"

The employee discount is AMAZING!. Playing frisbee on nice mornings.,"I felt like I never had any money to participate in their employee discount program when working here. They say you have to start off working there part-time for a year before you can advance to full-time status or receive benefits. If you are trying to make a living here, it might be a good idea  to have a second job. I have seen people advance faster than most and what you have to do to achieve this is really show interest and initiative by asking for what you want. As a Frontline employee, the management really makes you feel like your job hinges on selling the membership. You are supposed to be the last chance the customer will buy a membership before leaving the store, but a lot of the times you are the first one to tell them about it. It's not so bad, but if you have a really good week and sell 40 memberships in a week and only 12 in another, it's like the 40 never happened. It can be stressful trying to make a numbers game happen when it feels like every customer is saying ""no"" to the membership."

The people who work there are generally knowledgeable and passionate about the products they sell.,"Company structure is very poorly thought through. They give hours based on ""performance and availability."" But realistically, the only performance metric they track was how many memberships you sell. You are required to sell a quota of memberships which obviously can only be sold to newer customers who don't already have one. So, in order to get hours you should avoid selling gear to quality returning customers who are devoted to the company and instead focus on new customers who haven't bought the membership. 

I had a full availability and my hours would change dramatically every week from 8 to 40 hours. It was a budgeting nightmare. I began to work a second job just to subsidize working for this company. 

Along with this, it seemed as though hours were handed out on a ""who do we like most"" sort of basis. Definitely creates a brown nosing sort of personality in the company."

There's always the question of ""What will this top-level person think of this?"" Projects always require approval from top leaders and it slows down processes. There's no trust between upper management and employees.

Inauthentic culture. REI strives for ""authenticity"", but there is a lack of transparency and open door policy. Why else do you think that Reddit disaster happened with that employee ranting on a public board? HR turnover is so high that it's hard to confide in someone in HR who's only worked there for 3 months and doesn't know anything about the company. The passive-aggressive culture also applies to this.

Instability. Too many re-organizations within the company where people are let-go left and right.

Work/Life Balance is so-so. There's this overly-positive image of REI it portrays that it has an amazing work-life balance. Although most days you start and get off on-time, expect to work non-stop throughout the day with little lunch breaks and occasional extensions in the evenings."

The customers are typically wonderful. It's so fun to chat with them about their upcoming trips and past experiences.

Discounts are SO GOOD. Pro deals and great in-store discounts as well- half off all REI-brand products!

I had my own health insurance, but I'm pretty sure they offer theirs to all employees. REI also has really fun product training classes. You get paid to attend and the company reps often bring in food and products to raffle off.

Also, REI's corporate social responsibility is pretty decent. Let's be honest, it could be better- more organic fabrics, sweatshop-free, etc.- but it is a start.","The pay, while better than minimum wage, is not great. It's wonderful that they offer health insurance to all employees, but $10.90/hour isn't much to live off of (depending on where you live). In Santa Barbara, I struggled to pay my bills. Also, you occasionally deal with less-than-stellar customers, but that happens in any retail environment. 

REI loves to brag about how ethical it is, but it could do more. Besides the fairly low pay, REI works with sweatshop-loving North Face. Also, its own products could be more ethical."

Focus on customer service and encouraged to give individual attention to customers. To be hired you need to be passionate about getting outdoors or just being active.,Sometimes store inventory was low which made the store look picked over.

1850,REI,Great Place to work,2015-11-23,4.0,Customer Service Specialist/Frontline,"REI has one of the best work environments that I have ever experienced. It has such diverse culture and creates a very unique work experience. The pay for part time is good, discounts are great and managers are cool.",One of the biggest negatives that I experienced while working there was getting time off approved especially during holiday/sales seasons. It seems like they hire tons of people when it isn't as busy but during the busy times you can't seem to get anyone to cover a shift and management doesn't approve time off.
1851,REI,REI is an excellent company!,2015-11-22,4.0,Frontline Cashier,"REI is a fun environment that attracts good people, and I always enjoyed my coworkers. They give back to the community and support good causes.","A very strong emphasis on selling co-op memberships, and I often felt like I was pressuring people. Extremely difficult to get a full-time job. No set schedules, so it's hard to plan ahead."
1852,REI,Project Manager,2015-11-18,3.0,,good benefits and retirement plan,conservative attitudes and very slow to change
1853,REI,Memberships more important than expert advice,2015-11-17,3.0,,"By working at REI, one has agreed to exchange one’s own outdoor experience for a wage to sell products to the consumer.  Most customers are not hard core outdoor enthusiasts (that’s okay), but will be suburbanites with a desire to “get out” more or simply purchase items for their upcoming vacation.  Fellow part-time coworkers are outdoor enthusiasts that you count on for days off full of adventure.  This is a great part-time job to supplement income for a working person, college student, or retiree.","The first con, and this is appears to be a company-wide problem which is getting worse, is selling memberships.  Remember, that one is exchanging their outdoor expertise.  Well, that does not really matter.  Selling memberships is the single most important task.  For not meeting quota, one is handed, punitively, reduced hours.  This is a tongue and cheek example: It is important to never spend too much time with an existing member.  Keep moving across the sales floor to find those non-members and beg them to sign up.  You do not want to waste time outfitting an existing member preparing a trip of a lifetime to Kilimanjaro.  It seems like the only rubric for measuring success is memberships.  

The second con I hope, is only particular to my own store. Most of the sales leads and managers are retail professionals and not particular “outdoorsy”.  The authenticity and integrity of this hiring practice should be questioned.  Said employees could probably tell you about a product, but not how they have actually used it."
1854,REI,What a great company...,2015-11-16,4.0,Customer Service Specialist,"Employee Discounts, Great Co-workers, Fun work, positive atmosphere","Too much emphasis on membership sales, Sometimes they have a high turnover with new employees"
1855,REI,"Not About Outfitting for a Lifetime, Only About Memberships",2015-11-13,2.0,Sales Specialist,"The cool thing about working for REI is that you know you stand by a great company that likes to give back to the community. The second cool thing is that all your coworkers, peers, and even your customers share one common interest: the love for the outdoors. REI sells high quality gear and people are willing to spend the extra money for it.

The culture is great - picture a big group of people from young to old who are all suited in their outdoor hiking gear and you can rename them as the 'REI' coworkers. Everyone is mostly laid back, easy to talk to, and have a diverse outdoor background.","Although the culture and background of REI is awesome, the company seems to have shifted to more a ""sell membership"" focus. Sell, sell, sell. The quality of your customer service and your skills to maintain the store do not matter when you are evaluated on your ""performance"". It doesn't matter if you've just helped a customer get fully decked in new outdoor ski gear - if you didn't rope in a membership at the end of the sale, your whole effort in helping the customer get outfitted for the outdoors does not count.
Which is what I could consider a really unfortunate con. REI is about bringing stoke to the outdoors and helping people be outfitted correctly for their epic adventures. It's not about pushing on memberships.

With the holidays approaching, management will be understanding of penny-pinching customers who don't want to pay extra for membership. They will also understand that shoppers will either already have a membership - thus making it hard to sell a membership to an existing member - or that customers who come in during the holidays are looking for deals - not lifelong commitment to REI. Then, at the end of the big holiday storm, management will ding you on the lack of memberships you weren't able to sell."
1856,REI,Frontline - Sales Specialist,2015-11-13,2.0,,"Great community atmosphere; if you are interested in working at REI, you are going to find many people working there that you will like; moving up in the company has amazing benefits; great stewardship program; amazing employee discounts and prodeals","With sales and marketing experience, I am treated like the low-level, part-time frontline cashier that they assume I am; I am wasting my marketable skills with a company that I thought I would be interested in moving up with; VERY difficult promotion process--must have open availability, sell memberships, know product, etc., but mostly you need to have open availability--this means they might schedule you 4 hours this week, 35 next week, 10 the following week, making it very difficult for anyone making $10/ hr part time to open their availability. As a struggling recent college grad I was disheartened to find that getting promoted there won't even be an option unless I fall into a great sum of money and have a lax work ethic. Currently, with another full-time job, I get scheduled roughly 4 hours/ week, for shifts that I have to drive 30 mins to get to. 

Speaking of driving 30 mins to get there--to start out making $10/ hr with a whacky changing schedule at a retail store for which there are very limited options of location, its hard to work at REI and not live closer to the store if its not in a particularly desirable area (ie Madison, WI's upper-middle class white neighborhoods on the west side).

The benefits for employees sound amazing to the outsiders, but once you dig into them upon hiring there are many restrictions. Yes the Yay Day every 6 months is awesome, and so is getting paid for a holiday even if you don't work that holiday; once per year REI sends all employees a check with a bonus, depending on how many hours you worked and how well your store did--but you have to have been an employee for a full year before you get to earn that benefits. 11 months? Too bad! A full year.

During training, mentioned to a manager that we should be gender-neutral when greeting guests; he shrugged off the comment saying, ""Well I just call everyone 'man'."" Unacceptable in a retail sector where our customers tend to be more liberal and diverse in the ways they define their own gender. Completely unsympathetic to the customer.

In terms of stewardship, REI does amazing things for trails and parks everywhere. However, it fails its own value system when the REI brand rain jacket on the hanger was made in a sweatshop vs. the Patagonia jacket from a company that vows to bring only fairly traded, ecologically produced products to the market. Pretty annoying for a company that fosters a love of nature in both employees and members.

Promotion from frontline to sales lead comes with only $1.25 raise."
1857,REI,Wouldn't recommend it,2015-11-13,1.0,Sales Specialist,"Great incentives, pretty good pay, pro deals are great","REI sells you a dream when they are first hiring. The dream is that this is a company where hard work pays off, we are not ""car salesman"" was the exact words that were used. However soon enough we discovered that car salesman is exactly what were expected to be. The membership is all that management cares about. They want you to go around the store hunting for new members and we have to sell it anyway possible. I was an employee at the store in Yonkers and while there is no incentive for selling memberships since that is ""our job"", we did get penalized for not selling them. The people who worked the hardest and were brilliant when it came to the outdoors got little to no hours while the lazy ones that managed to sell memberships and were on managements good side got all the hours. Management is lazy, immature and unaware of anything that goes on in the store and the HR department is horrible. They say that we can contact them and they will try to solve the issues but even after more than 5 employees contacted them about the same issue nothing was done. A lot of people at the Yonkers store quit right after taking the job because they quickly realize what they have gotten themselves into. I regret taking this job since it was just a waste of time. I wouldn't  recommend it to anyone."

However, during my 5 years there I had the chance to work on a few different teams both in and out of the retail stores and I found the consistency with which the ""REI"" values are applied to be rather lacking...","...Some managers really walk the talk and believe in supporting their people and protecting work life balance, others support the positive attributes of the culture in word only and yet others blatantly feel its a waste of time that doesn't apply to them. It can be really hit or miss and I began to feel like changing teams was a risky move cause if you got stuck on a team lead by someone that didn't value the things you value or the things REI claims to value there was really nothing you could do about it. The system they have in place to address work place issues like this are really toothless.

The camaraderie is awesome and we try to get out and do things together on a regular basis.","Communication between management and the sales or backroom people has been very fuzzy lately. When one manager says that an item has been completed and another employee finds it hasn't been done, the blame just gets shoved onto someone else.

1917,REI,REI Outdoor Programs,2015-09-01,5.0,Market Manager,"Co-op claims lofty values - and works hard to live up to them. No company succeeds here all the time, but the effort to stay true is legitimate and sincere.

President and CEO Jerry Stritzke is an inspiring leader, with razor sharp management skills and a love of storytelling. After coming aboard in late 2013, needed changes, which had gone unchecked for years, were identified and successfully acted upon with skill, tact and precision - and in an impressively short time span. More importantly, he re-focused the REI brand vision and provided a clear path to follow that is easy to understand, and enhances the cultural values which are so vital to the company's identity and its loyal employee base. These actions have instilled great confidence in everyone from VPs to hourly retail employees, and the co-op has never felt - or performed - better.

Dream job. Seriously. The work is surprisingly complex and challenging, and when done well, the result is something that actually makes you feel as though you are contributing to a better planet. Teaching a 40 y/o adult to ride a bike for the first time is something you never forget. Enabling a team to inspire and prepare thousands of people to explore the outdoors in ways they never previously thought possible (or at least lacked the skills for) - is absolutely priceless.

Your team, colleagues and bosses are exceptionally talented and passionate people who deeply care about the work being done. 

Managers, and even hourly staff, can enjoy a fair amount of autonomy - as long as results are produced.","Key strategies are sometimes at odds with financial expectations; occasionally, meeting one goal can directly result in compromising another. 

Divisional goals and metrics change significantly each year. If you're not good at shooting multiple targets while riding backwards on a runaway horse, move along. 

New ventures are often announced with deadlines that are difficult (and occasionally impossible) to meet. To succeed, one needs a highly creative approach, honed organizational skills, and the ability to energize a fatigued team.

Organizational re-structure is an annual occurrence. While corporations must anticipate and adapt to the constant change in business environment, this division has a significantly higher rate of change than any other. If you aren't comfortable with a LOT of change, look elsewhere. 

While REI is famous for its work/life balance, salaried managers often work 50-60 hours per week (sometimes 60-70), and are on-call on days off. Expect long days, longer weeks, and an end to the ""busy season"" because there is no ""slow season.""

As a manager, expect to work in a virtual environment with superiors and colleagues, as well as the majority of your staff, whom are part time and work remotely."

Employment with REI is kind of perceived as a privilege. There's this attitude sometimes that because of the great employee discounts they offer that everything else can get overlooked. It's an amazing job if you don't really need to make a living. Perfect for students and the semi-retired who have loans or other forms of income to rely on. In 14 months of employment with REI I never once received any consistency in scheduling, I never ""qualified"" for access to health benefits or PTO, and I never once had any opportunity to work full-time. My hours would fluctuate, sometimes wildly, and I simply never felt very appreciated or adequately compensated. It surprised me when I realized early into my employment with REI that they use similar hiring and staffing techniques that any Target or Walmart would use. Rather than having a solid full-time work force, REI relies on leaning very hard on management while using a large part-time staff who may never qualify for benefits. If I were still in school this would not have been a problem but now that I have a degree and student loan debt I simply could not afford to remain employed at REI.

Definitely take the ""work/life balance"" aspect of employment very seriously.  Benefits are fantastic - we're all gearheads, and the discounts and prodeals are wonderful.","While REI likes to see itself as hiring ""inspired guides,"" the truth is that the company often times feels like it's holding its employees back from really enjoying the outdoors.  This has gotten better thanks to the ""Yay Day"" initiative - designed to give people paid time in the outdoors - but it has felt like it can be hard to actually use the gear you're selling.  As a retail position, the only real ways up are either to make the (difficult) jump to headquarters, to be willing to move about the country as a sales manager.

Work with some cool people into outdoorsy activity.","Memberships are everything.  It doesn't matter to them how well you connect with customers or the amount of product you sell, you're only as good to them as the number of memberships you push onto people.  No more, no less.

Low wages.  Working at REI is like working at Wall-mart or another ""big-box"" store.  Pushy, paranoid managers treat you like a school kid, regardless of expertise or proficiency.

I love the encouragement you get to go outside and pursue your passions, generous prodeal programs makes it even easier to get the gear you need for your trips too!",How well you sell memberships pretty much determines your worth to management. The more you sell the more hours you get. Sometimes employees seem to loose track of actually aiding or helping customers because they are so focused on trying to shove a membership down someones throat.

2071,REI,Great environment!,2015-01-07,4.0,,I worked for REI for 2 years part time.  Excellent culture and focus on work-life balance.,There have been several cuts to employee benefits packages in recent years...which was one of the major advantages to working for the company.  Part-time employees that used to have benefits packages no longer have robust health insurance options.  Only other con is that you will spend most of your paycheck on gear once you see the great deals you get!

Most people in management genuinely care about the people they manage.,Working on weekends. Changing schedules every two weeks. Opportunity to advance is difficult as people don't leave so not many positions open up. During holiday season very stressful.

2076,REI,"Good company, boring job, no future for the masses",2014-12-26,2.0,Sales Specialist,"Most of your coworkers will appreciate and respect the outdoors and believe in the company mission. You will get great discounts and plenty of product knowledge so you'll always have the newest and best gear. Management is good about honoring time off requests so you can get out there and enjoy the lifestyle you are ""selling."" The work environment is casual. Coworkers will genuinely work together to provide good customer service making customers happy. It's rewarding to help people get outside.","Most employees are part-time (10-15 hours per week) which is great if you aren't actually trying to pay any bills. Very few people work anything close to full-time.

It's basically a dead-end job. Management positions are supposedly awesome, but the reality of working your way up the ladder is slim to none. Management positions get eliminated, and the people in management positions never leave. 

Turnover is high among sales specialists. Well, it is retail after all, but there is a lot of frustration at the bottom. Everyone is trying hard to impress the managers because they all want to be a candidate for a management position themselves whenever one becomes a available. At my store, there was a lot of two-faced back stabbing going on. It was kind of like high school all over again but with less acne and at least you could hide in the sleeping bags for a while.

Selling memberships seems to be the only metric for measuring success, and trying to sell them is painful to say the least. Most customers already have a membership. The people who don't, generally don't want one. I could up sell anything, but memberships weren't good for me. If you do want to work your way up, be sure to perfect your membership sales pitch and get ready for irritated shoppers... especially when you are the third or fourth sales specialist to say the ""M"" word. Good luck."

Many of your coworkers will have different hobbies, and most are willing to take you out and share that experience with you. So if you like to try new things and you are a gear junkie, then this is a great environment for you. And you are always recognized if you do a great job or go above and beyond.

Except for managers not giving feedback and their firing policy, it it s great place.","Management has some issues.  I was fired due to ""issues"" they had with me.  I had been told by both of my managers that I was doing great/excellent, so I thought I was fine.   They admitted that the managers had spoken and had written comments 3 times, though they didn't tell me. They also wanted me to come in on Black-Friday to work at 7am and probably fire me then.  I knew another employee who was ""fired"" at her 3 month review, though she had never had negative feedback beforehand. Luckily (for her, a great person), the management messed up with that because the one who fired her left and the other manager was on sabbatical, so they just forgot about her and she kept her job.  I heard from many employees that many managers didn't know what they were doing.  A real bummer."
2081,REI,"Strong company with unique assets, trying to find its way in a more competitive landscape",2014-12-01,3.0,Senior Professional At HQ,"REI does a great job recruiting employees who share company values, which creates a strong sense of community where most really care about doing a good job.  It is a fun workplace where many employees form tight friendships, making it a hard place to leave.  The coop model is a real plus because leaders can make decisions with the long-term health of the company in mind.  Most benefits programs are strong.","At times it can take forever to get a change off the ground, even if many people believe it needs to happen.  The company lacks the appropriate level of planning and project management functions, which means large projects can experience many stops and starts and often not cross the finish line.  Too many individual heroics are required to get things done.  

With many recent leadership changes at the top, too many lower level leaders are scrambling to please those above at the expense of thinking for themselves, which is increasing the political environment and having a negative impact on employees reporting to them.  You will encounter fabulous leaders in some areas and mediocre ones in others, and there is not a strong enough focus on training and evaluating leaders to ensure consistency."
2082,REI,The Walmart of the Outdoor Industry,2014-11-27,2.0,Retail Sales Specialist,"First, let me say I've worked for REI twice; once back in 2011, now in 2014. The first time I worked for REI it was everything I'd heard it was. The managers were exceptional, the staff were all very cool and outgoing, and there was a sense that the place we were working at was something special. It seemed like the company truly cared for it's workers. That is about the only positive thing I have to say about this company.","Now in 2014, this company has changed so much for the worse it isn't even funny. Fair treatment from the bosses? Ha, not even likely. Blatant favoritism runs rampant at this company, at least at the retail level. If you aren't an absolute suck-up, you will NOT get hours like the employees who do. 

Watch as your schedule gets adjusted before your very eyes to ensure you are kept under the 20-hour-per-week minimum to qualify for benefits. 

Watch as REI brags about their wonderful gear and clothing discounts but don't count on ever being able to afford anything this store sells as your paycheck won't ever cover it. 

There are no opportunities to advance in this company, unless you want to be a retail manager (and when a spot opens in retail management, count on having to compete against several HUNDRED other applicants).

I really hate to sound so down on REI but they really are going down the drain. The corporate mentality is rampant here, the only emphasis is on selling memberships, the pay is terrible, the hours are terrible, the opportunity for advancement is non-existent, and the company will constantly rub in your face how profitable they are while finding reasons for not scheduling you the hours you requested."
2083,REI,Amazing place to work,2014-11-17,4.0,Store Manager,"Great structure, competitive wages, appropriate work/life balance for retail. Solid employee environment. Great benefits.","None. For retail, by far the best organization in which to work."

Easy to transfer locations and relocate. 8 hour paid day off every 6 months is a nice perk.","Retail within a large company always has its challenges. Loss prevention, low hours for part time employees,  limited space for stock, unclear visual standards. Overall REI does a great job at managing these issues, but there is always room for improvment. Managment team varies by store and can be hit or miss."

Schedules are flexible to a reasonable degree if you don't mind losing hours.  The healthcare benefits you get are excellent if you can keep them.",The pay is average for retail but hours are hard to come by at the sales level. You don't have guaranteed hours so if business is bad then you'll find that you're are not working much for a month which means many people often end up working a 2nd job.
2087,REI,Sales Specialist,2014-11-04,3.0,Sales Specialist,"Chill environment to work in, friendly co-workers that make you feel like you're in a family, good discounts

Personally love my co-workers. It is much like a family though and there are times where you may be mad with someone but with most families that is bound to happen. Everyone treats everyone with respect and I like that.",Horrible hours. I hardly ever get hours which makes it tough to pay the bills and be a college student. I believe they base hours off of membership sales which in my opinion is lame. If you don't get the hours how are you supposed to sell more memberships to get more hours? You basically get stuck in a cycle.
2088,REI,REI is the best!,2014-10-31,5.0,Sales Specialist,Absolutely the best retail job out there. They company has great values! They supports community by giving grants or sponsoring outreach programs.  They also are supportive of operating green and conserving the environment!

Co-workers are all outdoor enthusiasts which means there are always great stories to share and there's a wealth of knowledge to tap into in the event I run into customer questions I am unable to answer. The company also cares a lot about outdoor stewardship and encourages employees to get outside often. The company is even starting what they call Yay Days which are days where employees will get paid to go out and do their favorite activities (8 hours for full-time employees and 6 hours for part-time).,Weekly hours are completely dependent upon number of memberships you sell. If you cannot get customers to become members then you will be given very few hours each week. They give you a yearly membership goal which is based on number of hours worked per week and if you are anywhere under 100 percent of your goal then your hours may not be what you'd like. Another huge con is the pay. With over 5 years of retail experience alone the pay should be much better than it is.

In many ways this has served them well, especially in the 2008 economic downturn.

My advice would be to hire fewer people and make them full time so that they can be fully committed to the company.

You will get good discounts on gear if you are into the outdoors.,"There is a reason that REI has fallen from the top ten of best companies to work for and is now in the bottom. I predict they will no longer be on the list in the coming years. With the hiring of a new CEO from Coach REI has decided to forget everything that made them a store people want to shop at. They are slowly becoming just another retail outlet, at present they have dropped many of their ideas such as ""balance"" for their employees. There are new availability requirements that mean you must work 16 hours per weekend. Which essentially means you must work an 8 hour shift on Saturday and open to close on Sunday. So much for balance. If you are someone who enjoys the outdoors and wants to have time to do those things, look elsewhere. If you are someone looking for a second job that they can work, look elsewhere. REI was my second job for a long time but they have started pushing out people like me with their new availability requirements and their new found inflexibility. If you want just another retail job, go for it. If you want to work somewhere that only cares about metrics that have very little to do with your actual job performance, go for it. If you want to work for a great company that values balance and is ready to be a great place to work then you'll want to find a time machine and go back about 6 years."

The only real solution here is to get a second job, which is tricky because REI schedules only go out two weeks before you need to work, and it's physically pretty draining.  There is also a lot of pressure to sell memberships to customers, and this is how the managers track your quality of work.

2137,REI,"Fun place to work, but terrible, horrible, no-good management.",2014-08-11,1.0,Sales Specialist,"- If you're an outdoorsy person, you already know REI's your toy store. The employee discount was 10%-50%, so it was pretty easy to get whatever you wanted. 
- For retail, the training was significant. Vendors came in often and gave talks, and there was plenty of hands-on time. A minor downside is having to go all the way out to the store on a day off to attend a training. 
- There's a variety of things to do each day in the store, so it's pretty tough to get bored.","- Useless, utterly insulting store-level management. Apart from the day-to-day complete lack of leadership, there was all manner of corporate double-speak and bureacracies. The real kicker came when a co-worker was accused of stealing. Apparently management had, in their infinite wisdom, decided to put a hidden camera in the stock room(!) to combat huge shrink numbers. They used the footage to fire said co-worker for theft when they saw him ""moving things around"" in back. Needless to say, ""moving things around"" was part of the job, and the whole thing just came off as paranoid and nuts. I left soon after that. I heard later the manager got REI's version of 'employee of the year' a few months later. 

- The pay is pretty terrible. Granted, I haven't worked there in a couple years, but I really doubt it's magically jumped up to the living-wage range. Benefits are available to part-time employees after a certain amount of time, but the health coverage was negligible and I don't think it even included dental.

- I had open availability, but had to pick up shifts my co-workers dumped because I only got scheduled for 25 hours a week. Somehow, people with other jobs/kids/school were still scheduled the same hours week after week when they dropped shifts.

- Not much room for upward mobility. There are a couple supervisors per store, a store manager and his/her asssitant. If you want decent hours and pay, you'll have to shoot for one of those spots, which will probably involve a transfer."

-I love the gear I get to sell and I like when I can interact with customers and talk about products trips, etc.
-Schedule is very flexible and all of my time off requests have been approved. My managers are willing to work around my schedule and other things I have going on. 
-I think the company has good values and standards.
-the prodeals are amazing.
Overall I am satisfied but there are several things that frustrate me...","-The schedule is completely different from week to week. This makes it really hard to plan anything else in my life in advance. I guess that's the price we pay for time off flexibility though. 
-There is so much emphasis on selling memberships. That's the biggest thing the managers judge our performance by. However, this is difficult because I'm pressured to continually harass people who clearly just want to go about their shopping. We're trained in ways to respond and rebut any reason why people DON'T want a membership. 
-Memberships aside, we're supposed to engage in conversation with every single customer, even when they clearly do not want help. Last week I was rudely told ""you're the 4th person to try to help me in the last 2 minutes in this store."" Several customers get annoyed and/or become rude before we back off. However, if I don't approach customers and talk about membership, I'm not doing my job.
-Hours are largely based on membership sales, since that's the only thing they really have to judge us by.  
-This may just be my store, but the management is inconsistent - one manager will have us do things one way, and then the next day the other manager will get upset at us for doing it the ""wrong"" way and tell us to do something different. It's very frustrating."

Many of my fellow coworkers lie to customers just so they can sell more memberships, and I constantly have customers ask me if we are on a commission-based salary because they are harassed so often (we are not).  Maybe just a unique aspect to the store I work at?  Also keep in mind that although REI offers great benefits, that only applies to full-time employees, and getting a full-time position is extremely competitive (you have to sell a ton of memberships regularly).  You are also only given hours based on the memberships you sell, so if you don't sell many memberships, expect a 4 hour work week (I am only disgruntled about this because I had been promised 25+ hours when I was hired)."

Others, not so much (see below).","Some stores are run by managers who do not understand how to run a store and generate sales without cutting corners.  Unfortunately one of the ways they meet these goals is by reducing payroll hours which leaves you understaffed.  At one of my stores, this meant that you had to give total open availability only to get a measly 20 hours per week.  And work life balance means nothing when you're working somewhere that is the epitome of inefficiency.  Some managers don't appreciate hard work and favor employees who make them feel liked.  This creates an environment where lazy employees get promoted and/or scheduled the most hours.  At the store I am describing the store manager blamed sales specialists for low morale, treated us like children, and lacked any real leadership skills.  He was passive aggressive with feedback and never gave a clear path for development and improvement.

My biggest complaint is that to remain on the health insurance, I have to maintain at least 20 hours average per week, and REI cannot promise to give me at least 20 hours, as I am not fulltime. Averages are checked quarterly, and if I fall below, I loose my insurance. This happened once: I got a letter from corporate in my box, and 1 week later I was off. I got no warning. Scheduling is done per store, but averages are monitored at corporate so there is a disconnect. I was sooooo close to 20 hrs average, I could have contributed some of my vacation time to raise up my average if I had known.

I understand that REI is a co-op and survives because of memberships, but my hours got cut because I only met 98% of my goal and I always felt like managers were hovering over me when I tried to sell the memberships.

Way behind the curve on technology, attempts to upgrade technology are stupidly expensive, drawn out and grossly mismanaged.

Company espouses values while behaving in an entirely different manner.  Store hours are cut to bare bones, HQ departments do not have enough staff to do the work, while ""fat cat"" ""Executive Vice Presidents"" are promoted and given larger and larger salaries.

Cruelly executed layoffs, random dissolution of departments, decreased work life balance and an increasing disrespect for employees lower morale.

They've paid me tuition reimbursement for school, given me a grant of gear to run a marathon, contributed largely to my retirement savings and just clearly have the best in mind for their employees. Schedules are flexible and the team works hard to make time-off requests work so you can have a full life. The company proudly supports gay marriage, and works hard to be a good employer for minorities including but not limited to racial and ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities (trans people). Oh, and your coworkers will become the shining light you look forward to daily. :)","It's still a co-op and a family, which is great, but the very fact that people are so valued and trusted means no micromanagement. Sounds awesome until you have to humor someone else's dumb idea. Keep this in mind when you pitch your own dumb ideas. Everybody's opinion counts.
Also, staffing varies hugely throughout the year. It's a retail necessity. I advise anyone to have REI be a second job if they're not going into management."

Remains a co-op...for now.","The Fairfax store, for many years, has been a home away from home and a place that you looked forward to the interactions of both employees and customers alike.  Now, it takes every ounce of my being just to get out of the car and walk across the parking lot to work a dead end job where store moral has fallen off the table.  Hours are cut during the slow periods to ""meet business needs"" all the while treated like a second class employee.  Once business picks up, you are scheduled to the max of your availability and expected to care about a company that only a few short moths ago, cast you aside.  Often times during this busy time you are scheduled six, seven, sometimes nine days in a row and if you speak up about it you are reminded how you wanted more hours.  Employee turn-over is on the rise and there is nothing being done to retain the employees because management views you as expendable.   The compensation and wage increases are a joke and are at the point of being just a notch above a slap in the face with no solid reason or goals of how you could do better and when asked how to make more money you are told to move up in the company but there is a lack of upward mobility and the ""endorsement process"" is a mythical process that has no guidelines.  The endorsement process has lead to more departures of many, many high quality employees than is has seen promoted to the ranks of management.  My advice to you is to seek employment with any other company but this one, if you are going to be treated like a second class employee, you might as well get paid more for it.   There is a reason why this company dropped from a top 10 on Fortunes Top Companies To Work For list all the way down to 69th.  The staff are crying out, lets not hope it falls on deaf ears."

Great discounts on gear.","Rei (Fairfax)was a great place to work for many years but sadly the company is moving in the wrong direction.  The pay is low, the hours are inconsistent and employees are scheduled just below the minimum threshold of hours so we don't receive holiday pay.  Many of us have had to add vacation time to every pay period to keep our hourly average up so we don't lose our health insurance benefits (20hour average needed) because we are not scheduled enough hours.  A few employee lost their insurance coverage.  Many of us earn vacation time but don't make enough money to go anywhere.  Morale is low and many employees would leave if they had an option and trust me they are looking.  REI Fairfax is all about the numbers, selling memberships , cutting payroll and has become a very tense place to work with upper management watching your every move.  Corporate control is high and my direct managers are really powerless to be advocates for their staff.  Job advancement is virtually non existent since the restructuring a few years ago.  Pay raises don't cover a cup of coffee a week.

For much of my time with the company I was on the “endorsement track” (management track). In the hope of being rewarded with a endorsement, I conducted extra projects and took on more responsibilities beyond my title. Throughout the process I was NEVER fully clear on where I stood or how close I was to obtaining a endorsement from management. They kept the whole process vague. My manager told me multiple times that I was close. Eventually I got the sense that they had no intention “promoting” me, but continued to string me along in order to keep me around and motivated. I was burned out by the process. This was not a isolated incident. Several highly competent, hardworking coworkers were also strung along, only to eventually leave the company out of frustration.

Store management has become insular, hiding in their offices for hours on end, never coming out to the sales floor, ignoring employees whose views do not align perfectly with their own, promoting only those one or two employees who only tell them how wonderful they are, the store manager allows the sales managers to rule through fear and ignorance while he sits in his office and waits to retire."

Flexible hours, which is awesome if you are a student, have another job, or can afford to take long periods of time off without pay. Benefits are great, if you work more than 22 hours per week on average. Prodeals are fantastic --- just make sure you have a second job so you can afford them. At least you're surrounded by amazing gear all day long.","I regret ever getting involved with REI as a full-time gig. The pay is terrible. If this is your sole source of income, you will have a hard time affording prodeals, food, and rent. You will never have weekends off -- or even two days off in a row -- unless you request them weeks in advance. If you do make those requests, be prepared to have your weekly hours cut. You will also frequently be scheduled 6-9 days in a row, always over a weekend  so you never work more than 38 hours in any given pay period. Hours are never consistent and management is constantly under pressure to cut payroll, so be prepared to feel understaffed on the floor. Corporate cannot seem to figure out what direction the company should be moving in. Policies are consistently nebulous, unexplained, or outright ignored. New software seems to be developed by people who have never actually worked in a retail location, and on top of that, the company has been incredibly slow at embracing technology. Advancement within the company involves a process that is almost never discussed and never fully explained. When questioned, management staff will give you a print out, claim it is ""a very personal and self-reflective process"" and never discuss it with you again. Moving up generally involves having to relocate as new stores open. Management seems like a pretty sweet deal: you set up a few displays and hang out in the back office talking with your fellow managers and occasionally answer pages and write the schedule. All that being said, if you are looking for a part-time gig and aren't relying on the income, it'd definitely be a fun part-time job."
2229,REI,"Excellent place to work, one small catch",2014-02-22,4.0,Customer Service Specialist,"Thorough training before and during your first few months. I was working front line and even after training managers cut me slack if I made a mistake during my first few months. My coworkers, for the most part, enjoyed working at REI and were mostly satisfied, this made for a more enjoyable work culture than other places I've worked. My coworkers were also quite supportive and I felt like we could work well as a team. My bosses never gave me too many unrealistic tasks to accomplish each day, that really takes the stress down a notch when you don't feel overwhelmed. I loved the annual Christmas gift and the great discounts! I appreciated being able to say via the availability form, ""never schedule me on Sundays"" and they always followed that. I'm very grateful for that. Also, I always filled out my time off requests well in advance and was always granted my requests. Most of the customers I encountered were happy to be at REI and so, compared with other retail stores, I had very few angry customers to deal with. I would work at REI in a heartbeat if it weren't for one thing (see below).","When I applied for my $11/hour part time job there were 9 positions available at the store in question and hundreds of applicants had applied. There then followed a rather lengthy hiring process considering the relatively meager salary. The cash registers (at least at my store) were dinosaurs and the user interface was far from efficient or intuitive. Most of my bosses were amazing: open, communicative, friendly and didn't gossip. I did have one boss who chided me in front of a large group of coworkers and didn't seem to think very highly of me. I was able to avoid him for the most part. The real reason I left? I wasn't selling enough memberships. During training they say that it's important but that they understand if you're having troubles. What they don't tell you until later is that they rank each employee based mostly on their membership sales. If you're at the bottom of the totem pole--your hours get cut. The pressure of having to sell memberships when most people are already members was too much for me. I'm not a salesperson, it's not my gift and it stressed me out. If you're a good salesperson and can talk even the most resistant of folks into buying a membership then I think you will love working at REI--it's a great place to work apart from the membership pressures."
2230,REI,Best Retail Job,2014-02-21,5.0,Customer Service Specialist,"REI is a company that honestly believes in its mission to get more people outdoors with the right equipment to enjoy it while at the same time encouraging good stewardship to preserve outdoor spaces for generations to come. Most customers are happy to be in the store so more often than not customer interaction is very positive. Management has been genuine, supportive, and easy to talk to/work with when questions/concerns arise. I have worked across several stores and have experienced this in every one. Also, their profit sharing plan (they are a co-op) is quite nice and they also offer pretty good benefits to employees (especially for a common retail position). Each store has a break room and an employee shower in case biking/running to work is your thing but you don't want to work in sweat drenched clothes all day.","Just like all other retail, the hours available are always subject to the ebb and flow of customers and how much they are spending. If you are in a constantly high traffic store  (or one in a particularly wealthy area) it is a lot easier to get the hours you will need though."

2241,REI,"REI is not a co-op, it's a profit-driven corporate retail box.",2014-02-02,3.0,Customer Service Specialist,"REI has great employees and great customers.  They are the heart of REI's authenticity and culture.  
It's fun to work with and get a discount on all the exciting outdoor gear.
REI has better benefits than many other low-wage jobs I've looked at, with a lower threshold for health insurance eligibility than most (you must average 20 hours per week after your first 1000 hours on the job).
There is a fair amount of autonomy and capacity to make your own decisions.  Managers, (when they are present), usually support you.
The pay is better than Taco Bell and you don't come home smelling like ground meat product?","The pay is still too low, and the hours fluctuate greatly.
Often, meeting your membership quota is about the only measure of your performance that managers evaluate you on.  If you've ever experienced a cashier or sales specialist become outwardly irate at your refusal to join the co-op, it's because if they don't sell that membership, they won't get enough hours next week.
Over the past few years, it seems as though upper management has been trying to squeeze out more profits by tightening down on ""controllable expenses"", mainly payroll.  Which means when the store gets really busy it is likely under-staffed.
REI likes to boast about its ""Diversity and Inclusion"" but racial and ethnic minorities are still grossly under-represented in the pool of employees, and the health plan explicitly discriminates against transgender employees."
2242,REI,Really great to work for on a macro level--if you're retired or living at home,2014-01-30,4.0,Sales Specialist,"Insurance available if you can work enough hours, excellent retirement advising and retirement savings, fun work, not too demanding most of the time. And they usually have peanut butter, bread and ramen in the breakroom. mmmmm.","Not too demanding most of the time, I don't love to eat ramen, don't live at home and my other two jobs don't really cover the gap. Can't get much more than 20 hours a week. If you want to advance, you have to move."
2243,REI,Great company overall but infrequent hours due to retail,2014-01-30,4.0,Sales Associate,"great coworkers and work atmosphere. You get great deals on everything, which you get access to right after training. higher than normal percentage of nice customers.","hours fluctuate with no consideration of the impacts. Retail hours fluctuate ~36 to 5 (or even 0) and that can span months. Hiring follows demand, rather than anticipating it, leading to improper staffing. Employees must sell memberships, and hours are typically based on membership sales. Sadly, this means that people are rewarded for focusing on people who are singing up for a membership and ignoring the other customers. You get REI's health benefits only if you are full time (32hr+), otherwise you are on government healthcare. Previously they gave benefits to everyone (with different levels based on hours worked). The rest of the benefits you won't get until you work 1500 hours, which takes a long time when you average 15 hours. Although they do try to hire from within, if you are looking for a corporate level job, most of those go to people outside of the company. Overall, i still think that it is a great place that tries hard to do the right thing."
2244,REI,Very good for retail,2014-01-30,4.0,Service Technician II,"The benefits: health care and discounts, are excellent. The people you work with are generally awesome","The pay isn't great, but it's retail. Depending on the store management can be less than stellar."
2245,REI,Awesome co-workers and fellow employees,2014-01-29,3.0,Sales Specialist,"The coworkers are the best part.  It's great to have a bunch of people passionate about the outdoors under one roof working together.  The pay is decent, the benefits are good, and talking to customers about outdoor products can be fun.  The management, though sometimes disagreeable, are all just human and it shows.  Also, if there is ever any disagreement or issue with a customer, the managers almost always take the side of the employee.  All of management has been where the rest of the employees have been, so they understand difficult customers and the stress of working the 'trenches' of retail.  Definitely the best retail job I've ever had.","Irregular and inconsistent hours.  One week you could have 32 hours, the next you could have 14.  It depends on projected customer traffic.  Hours are intentionally shy of full time for 80% of staff; maybe to cut costs for employee benefits.  The management places a lot of importance on membership sales to evaluate individual performance, but never explicitly say so.  Meeting or exceeding membership sales goals can get you favoritism; since you make the store/management you work in look good.  They also seem selective on 'violations' to write up for certain favorites.  IE: One employee gets fired for a certain violation, while another simply gets a talking to.  The membership quota system creates a 'used car salesman' atmosphere at times and makes you feel cheap; it also creates an atmosphere of competition among employees which is not what I pictured REI to be about. The membership system also forces employees to try to sell a customer something they weren't looking for in the first place.  There is an odd gap between management and employees (at least at my location), and some managers are hard to relate to.  As with any job, there are managers I respect and will do what they ask, and others that I can't help but second guess and reluctantly do what they ask."
2246,REI,A Great Place to Work Until It's Not,2014-01-28,4.0,Store Manager,"There is a good synergy that can be experienced at REI depending on the store location and the leadership at a given store.  The people that work there are usually fun, active and enjoy camaraderie while on the job or pursuing their outdoor interests.  You can share good company, good times and create strong friendships.  At work there is often a strong sense of teamwork and people genuinely care about each other.  It can be really satisfying helping customers gain knowledge about the outdoor pursuits they are interested in and helping them select gear that can make the experience all the more enjoyable.  There is usually a strong emphasis on ensuring positive experiences for the customer and contributing to that goal feels good.  You will be recognized outside of work and customers will show genuine appreciation for the great advice, gear and service you provided them.  I have seen peoples' lives positively and significantly impacted by the experiences and adventures that were facilitated by a trip to REI.  That is always very cool.","The direction REI takes tends to be determined by whatever prevailing economic wind might be blowing.  One season might be all about ensuring a positive experience for the customer, followed by the next season scrambling to increase profit margins by drastically cutting expenses (payroll/ schedule hours).  Don't tell me that a 30% decrease in payroll doesn't impact the experience that customers have...it's pretty noticeable from their perspective.  From the employee perspective it means one month you might have as many hours as you can work, followed the next month by next to nothing.  REI talks a lot about Work Life Balance as a company value, but it's hard for employees to find any life balance when their hours and take-home pay can fluctuate so wildly.
REI's leadership tends to be very inconsistent.  There are some great managers who really care about the company, the customer and employees, and work hard to encourage, develop and advocate for their success.  And there are managers that are manipulative, lack integrity, show a ridiculous amount of favoritism, and generally are looking out only for themselves and to curry favor for future endorsements. Upper leadership tends not to be able to identify who is who.  I've seen the former type of manager somehow run afoul of their superiors and soon forced out in nasty fashion even after years of dedicated service, while the later type of manager is allowed to contentedly continue on, creating division and rancor while somehow receiving praise from those higher up.  It's head scratchingly laughable and frustrating at the same time.  Your experience at REI will likely depend entirely on which type of manager you happen to be associated with.   At some point in your career you will probably realize it is simply time to move on."

REI only hires part-time workers and purposely keeps them under a gross 32 hours so that they aren't considered full-time and able to receive benefits. If you can sell stuff (specifically a membership) then this is the place for you. They've way over expanded and will feel the pain of their greediness soon. 
REI was a great place to work before the economy crapped out, but post-2007 it turned into a strictly numbers company focused on putting stores in every market possible--especially ones that made no sense.

Processes are not in place or there are too many new processes that doing your job is not efficient. REI is the opposite of a well oiled machine. 

HR sits on their hands if you come to them with issues about management. The anonymous hotline is a joke and since people have been there for 20 yrs they will never get fired. Even though they are incompetent. One manager made someone read a book out loud to her in a meeting room and then she corrected her on her English. This person was humiliated and this was a weekly meeting. Calling the hotline did nothing. HR did nothing. This manager still works there and I find it appalling REI would allow this behavior.

It was a really great job for me at that time in my life, and I would generally recommend others to work there too.","Unfortunately, it's still a retail position, so hours can be all over the place.

The company does a good job hiring people that have diverse backgrounds in sports/travel to cater to a broad range of customers while also providing extensive product training; you can learn a lot while working for REI.,"If you are working part time as a student or have another job, REI is great. But I would never recommend going career with the company on the store level. I saw several cases where upper management strung employees along for DECADES without offering any form of job security or realistic expectation of promotion or raise.  From what I saw, some of it comes directly from management, but the rest comes from shear fact that turnover in low-mid level management is extremely low while turnover with sales staff is extremely high.

2285,REI,A dose of reality!,2013-10-11,2.0,Sales Associate,"The employee discounts and at least half the employees you work with are interesting or accomplished folks and great to work with, many of the customers are the same.","It's just another corporate environment. It doesn't matter how much product you sell or how customers feel about you, the obsessive drive for memberships is the only thing they care about and managers are chosen on their ability to push the membership issue to the utmost. When you hire on you're told that the membership drive is important but what you are not told is that you work on commission...the joke is on you however because there is no extra benefit to selling memberships, the compensation is being allowed to work at all. Your livelihood is completely dependent on membership sales; the more memberships the more hours irregardless of how much product you sell. The problem is that many of the customers are already members but the worst part is the famous REI customer service becomes second to being a used car salesman pushing memberships. I've seen it over and over again where the top scorers go quickly from customer to customer seeking out those few customers who are not members or have other little scams for getting the most memberships. If you have the temerity to question this approach your reward for your effort is being assigned 4 hours a week instead of 25 hours as happened to one of the most accomplished sales associates at the store I work at....blatant payback.
 If you have never held a good job before or are experienced in the working world you will not be happy at REI and indeed may find feelings of contempt creeping into your thoughts about modern REI management policy, especially if you have been a co-op member for sometime. If this is your first job and you want to stay at REI my advice is forget customer service and concentrate on greeting people and asking if they are members just as quickly as you can during your shift and, I can't emphasize this enough, go as quickly as possible from customer to customer, that is by far the most important skill you will learn at REI."

Management talks about the company being a Co-op, but membership sales, ad-ons and up sales are as important here as anywhere else.

They no longer provide benefits such as health insurance for part timers, employees no longer get first pick of returned items, and ""Work/Life Balance"" is no longer a touted REI ethic.  

They used to provide great training that translated into great customer satisfaction but now the only training you will get is on how to sell memberships.  And you'd better sell memberships or you will not get hours.

Most people who were trained under the old REI are gone now, they were being paid more than REI wants to pay so they either left or were fired for one thin reason or another.

Pressure on employees to sell memberships!- customers hate hearing about ANOTHER membership from ANOTHER store.
You have to have availability on both weekend days. Not really balanced.
Hard to move up because of favoritism.
This is a retailer who returns used crap and has trouble saying NO to customers! There is a lot of abuse of the return policy by customers and if it continues the company is going to face some major financial issues. I returned a USED $1000 kayak from 2007 in 2013.

For a warehouse it is the most relaxed and enjoyable environments I have been in. 98% of my co-workers are really cool people that are interested in the people they work with. 
The discounts on gear are amazing!","Very little opportunities for advancement. There are a few reasons for this.
First: People love working at REI (myself included) so people don't leave. They stay in their same position for years and years leaving nowhere for the upwardly minded to go.
Second: There is a lot of competent and capable competition for the rare spot that opens up. I personally have 10 years experience in management managing up to 85 employees, I have a degree in Business management and I am working an entry level position. I took the position with the hopes of quickly moving up the ranks (which has always happened in my case). I am by no means unique. There are a lot of highly experienced and educated people that took entry level positions just to get into REI with the hopes of moving up. I personally like the competition as it requires a higher level of motivation, creativity, and determination. I like the challenge.
Third: The third and final reason advancement is difficult is REI hires outside the company for management positions. I have only been at REI for a year now but have found out since being here, that your best bet is to get very high levels of experience outside REI and come back in far below your capabilities. I aim for objectivity in this review but there is some bitterness in the last statement as I have seen completely qualified employees in REI (myself included) be looked over for a position just to see someone be hired from the outside. 

I love REI but, it is certainly frustrating for motivated people."

While it is currently a company in transition (job and structure changes), it is a company that has good culture and values and the transition is for the right reasons.","The pay is not great, so you have to love what you do. It is hardly a career at retail level, opportunities for growth and upward movement are very rare and competitive, and there is a big discrepancy between retail and corporate when it comes to pay and resources (up-to-date software, technology, etc.)."
2344,REI,Marketing Dept,2013-04-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fabulous benefits, smart people, fun industry, fantastic products, focus on the customer and corporate social responsibility.","Big changes are happening!  While this can be both positive and negative, I'm concerned that the changes will ruin REI's incredible corporate culture. With Sally Jewell, former CEO, leaving to become the Secretary of the Interior, and Matt Hyde, former EVP, now the CEO at West Marine, there is a big hole in leadership. The new CFO is making some good changes but is not interested in maintaining the culture. The co-op is losing its employee mojo -- which is the basis of its wonderful customer focus."
2345,REI,An unfortunate race to become just another retailer.,2013-04-10,2.0,Manager,"Pretty good benefits compared to other retailers, good discounts and deals on gear, depending on the store - good people to work alongside.","Steady decline to value cost cutting over the employee and customer experience, payroll management is erratic and punitive for managers and employees alike, the daily battle of PT employees over hours is a morale killer, management development has turned into a popularity contest replacing talented managers with people who simply agree with upper management. The employee experience varies a lot throughout the company and the increasing number of dissatisfied managers and frustrated employees worried about their jobs and hours makes for a bad mix for customer service. Departments at headquarters are more disconnected than ever and appear more interested in pushing out changes than listening to how they're going. They still talk a big game over various initiatives like diversity but every year it goes on, it seems more like lip service. There's very little diversity in store management or senior leadership beyond gender. Good luck to those coming from other retailers, unless you're prepared to smile and nod a lot. Unfortunately, at this point there are more retailers out there doing a better job at taking care of their teams and their customers."
2346,REI,"LAID OFF! A nice stop-off for a few years, but don't plan your entire career around REI, or you may be disappointed.",2013-04-09,2.0,,"Good discounts, a ""green"" company that supports the environment, outwardly a relaxed and pleasant working environment, a co-op (not a publicly held company) that is not driven by stock prices, etc.  Senior leadership is still pretty good, and on the ball for the most part.","I believe that some significant pockets of mid-management are more interested in managing their own careers, titles and pay scale at the expense of advancing the business, or even keeping the senior employees that got them there.  (Allegedly, reportedly, ""on the down low"", etc.  a significant number rumored to be at least 150 (out of approx 1200 total at HQ)  mostly, senior-level 10+ year-tenured staff and management employees -- with all the ones that I know,  having a history of major contributions and perfect performance records were laid off at the company's headquarters in March 2013 plus an ""unknown number"" more at the stores.).  This appears in my humble opinion,  (since they are not really saying, and being publicly as vague as possible)  to be an arbitrary, simple cost-cutting measure, i.e. remove the ""more expensive employees"".   In addition,  in my former department, I had noticed in recent years, that promotions and advancements were very few and very far between at the staff level.  In my opinion, It looks like they possibly want to maintain a mostly entry to mid-level position to keep costs down.    Per all of the above, I think it might be a good place to get your ""feet wet"" coming out of college  or early in your career, but you might not want  to plan to stay working at REI for the ""long haul"" as like me, you may never make it to see the highly-touted ""sabbatical"" benefit (at 15 years).   Unfortunately, I think some career-limiting,  and very negative precedents have been set with this particular lay-off, and a strong message has been sent to all remaining and future employees via these actions.  My advice:  If you stop advancing for any length of time, or are working in an area that is not the primary or a significant focus for that given year (or even a 6 month period), move on in the best interests of your career -- or they may do it for you !  I believe now that staff employees have become ""a commodity"", or  ""a number""....very un-REI like if you ask me (e.g. as compared to a decade or more ago)!"

As a new hire, I was impressed by the treatment I received, the attempt to cater to my schedule, the training, the opportunity to get insurance and other benefits.  After two years of service and multiple positive reviews, I moved to a different city for school and requested a transfer to the store there.  When I arrived, I was told I'd have to ""show 'em what I've got"" and was faced with a marked decrease in hours (presumable until I proved myself).  I found this odd as I'd been ""proving myself"" for two years and had the endorsement (required on the transfer request) from my previous supervisors and store manager.  Why now do I have to jump through hoops to get hours?  Why accept the transfer if the store doesn't need employees?  It was an ongoing game that eventually impacted my rolling average thus causing me to lose my insurance!  I had more hours as a new-hire with next to no experience or knowledge (compared to now) with no trouble at all!  Why would REI give more benefit of doubt to an unknown entity than to a dedicated, proven and loyal REI veteran?????"

In the right market, it was one of the best jobs I ever had.","The quality of all of the pros for this job are completely dependent on the store or market you work in. I worked in three stores in two markets (the West and Midwest) over the course of six years. I LOVED working for this company in the Western market. Really loved it. So much so that I had decided that I wanted to pursue a long-term career with the company.  All of the employees hung out, I went out for the occasional drink or bite to eat with my managers and co-workers (without the entire store being invited as formal function), at work, we worked as a team, and we all just had fun together. Work hard, play hard.

When I moved I transferred to the Midwest market. Honestly, it completely ruined my interest in the company. The corporate culture was completely different. The managers were on the mean side, it was frowned on for any of the management team to do anything outside of work (that wasn't a company function) with anybody of a ""lesser"" position than them, tons of favorites (who were the ones that got hours), ASMs and SM would completely undermine the Supervisors, and every day we got basically yelled at because we were low in memberships and told that if we didn't have high membership sales we wouldn't get hours (this happened even on days where we were supposed to be working stock shifts.) And even though we were supposed to have a ""confidential"" phone number we could call about these problems, the minute anybody called, the managers knew who it was (because the HR person would tell them details, of course) and shortly after the person who called either got fired or was so under the gun they quit.  It got to be so miserable I gave up on a career and left the company."

They say that they are about a work life balance, but when you are required to work one day a weekend and at least 2 nights a week, that makes work life balance very difficult. I was told that I would be able to run the warehouse when I was the S/R, but when it came down to it, they wanted it their way and any other would be wrong.

They also have a good discount purchase program for the employees.","The flip side the schedule is that it changes every week. Days, then nights and always some part of a weekend. I didn't like having my personal time change every week. The is the stress placed on meeting goals for memberships sold - it's not that hard, but still a an issue when you don't meet your goal. It can also cause a problem when another employee feels that you scooped a shopper that they thought they had sold a membership to. They also employ the mystery shopper score system - so be prepared to be judged on your performance."

Management will listen when and if you are interested in learning a new department (when there are openings... tell them before the next hiring period).","Selling memberships: It always feels awkward to insert ""Are you a member"" into your conversation with customers. It really is a neat benefit to the customer, but customers get annoyed especially when every sales associate they've talked to that day (or in their lifetime of shopping) asks this question. Some sales associates do a great job of not making this question seem out of place. Membership sales can effect your hours and your raise. It's the company's measurable performance goal for you as an individual. 

It is still retail, so you might seem like all you do is pickup and zipup jackets and clothing that messy people leave everywhere. You start to love the people who put away and zip up the mechandise they were looking at. 
Very rarely get an rude customer, but they do happen. 
Customer service deals with a lot of upset customers and some that take advantage of the company's return policy, returning ""well-loved,"" not faulty merchandise that at times have been 5-10 years old. People return things that should be in their own garage sales, not REI's."

- Fun. It's in the company DNA that fun should be part of the work.","- The struggling economy had an impact on REI's retirement contribution, It is not as good as before the recession. It's still pretty good compared to other companies, but if you take into account everything (base pay, bonus, retirement) then it's compansation no longer stands out.
- Slow to change. If you enjoy fast-paced environment and like moving things around quickly than you'll have your frustrations here. REI's team-oriented culture makes changes slow to happen.

REI's environmental stewardship is laudable
I wish REI was the MINIMUM standard for all retail jobs. The health insurance is ok-to-decent even for half-timers","Selling memberships is the name of the game. They don't value much of what you contribute if you don't also sell memberships.
As an REI employee I can't actually afford many of the activities that I prepare customers for. 
Most coworkers don't do basic upkeep tasks. If YOU do these, you are essentially penalized because it's tough to sell enough memberships while picking up the slack for others.
Life at REI seems to be a constant cycle of insufficient hours for most employees followed by  very hectic times where there are not enough staff on the floor to man the store and cover breaks. 
It's implicit that you're not a team player if you want to take all your breaks.
On annual reviews, again, it's all about the memberships. But even in other areas, they'll rate you poorly on something that you excel in to justify only giving a small raise. And there is no warning during the year that they think you haven't been doing something well. We'll see in July if this improves with the new review guidelines, but I'm not holding my breath, because we are supposed to have been getting more feedback for months now, and I'm getting nothing.
Store inventory is often off by one unit, even right after inventory has been done! Inventory is seldom right!
Digital infrastructure: our intranet is excruciatingly slow. The registers are awful, RPS has down times during very busy days, hand scanners take forever to process some requests
We need some ongoing paid training, not just for new hires: our electronics offerings have changed dramatically since I was first trained. People come in with very specific questions about even the stupidest of cheapo products.
The product information guides for the various electronics and watches are abysmal. They don't contain answers to many customers' questions. Worse, RPS info also often lacks important data about these products, yet it's very wordy!
REI coupon exclusions are getting finer and finer print, to the point that they recent moved the coupon's terms OFF of the coupon to the internet, leaving employees holding the bag when customers want to use the coupon improperly. WE have to be the bad guys and explain our sneaky coupons. It makes me feel dirty, making excuses for all of our poorly written coupons. I hate it."

Health benefits are available to anyone, including part time staff.  The customer base is, for the most part, good to work with.","Too much of a focus on membership.  At my store, we have a lot of customers that come in just to by a quick snack or other small purchase.  Though it's possible sell a membership to these customers, the majority of these customers came in ready to spend $2 not $22.  

The company is centralizing control way too much.  Recently, shop labor prices for all stores have been set by the office in Seatle.  The adjustments made are making it harder to sell memberships and are pricing us out of the market.  

I can't speak for all stores when it comes to management, but at my store the management spends way too much time in the office.  Since the only full time staff in the store are managers and they spend the majority of the day in the office, the sales floor is left understaffed almost all of the time.  It's not clear whether the workload of the managers requires them to be in the office so long or it's because they are lazy.  The employees in my store really don't trust the managers to lead, the leadership is coming from the strong employees, who aren't appropriately rewarded for that contribution."

You get to sell high quality product that the company backs with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

Except for memberships, there is no sales quota for sales staff, so there is NO stress over trying to upsell customers.

Starting pay is above minimum wage.

Although REI is definitely run as a corporation, they do their best to de-emphasize it.

REI has its ""cons"" but its WAY better than working at WalMart or Target or some other big Sports/Outdoor chain store.","High turnover and seasonal sales means constant hiring of new staff -- there are more staff than business can support during the slow times so weekly hours vary--could be as low as 10-12 hrs/wk for weeks at a time with some 3.5 hour shifts.  8 hour shifts are RARE, about one per week, unless there is a sale.  Most shifts are either 4 hours or 6.75 hours, but you don't necessarily get 5 days of work.  Schedules are done only 8 days in advance, but the managers DO try to work within your availability.

LOTS of emphasis on selling memberships--your raise is based on it.  

LOTS of emphasis on getting member email info--your raise is based on it.

Managers are not very visible on the floor--they seem to spend their time in the back office watching YOU work via the security cameras.  Managers are COMPLETELY unaware that the staff ALL think they are lazy.  Not good for morale.

If you want to move up, you need to move to a store in a different city and really work your butt off."
2457,REI,"Pretty good company, and pretty good place to work.",2012-02-13,4.0,Customer Service Specialist,"Great benefits, pretty nice coworkers, company has lots of respect in the community, flexible hours, easy to request time off when necessary, better pay than most retail.","Typical big-box retail -- constantly changing hours, you work all holidays, pay, although better than most, isn't enough to make ends meet without a second job."

I got to be involved with my areas of interests. Managers cared about employees. Opportunities for advancement.,"It's retail, so you have to deal with some real losers. Other than that no real complaints. I guess pay was a little on the low side, but I wasn't looking to support a family or anything, so no big deal."
2460,REI,It's earned it's spot on #7 in the Fortune Top 100 list,2012-02-02,5.0,,"Upbeat environment, fantastic medical benefits even for part-timers and seasonal employees, amazing discounts and vender connections, great advancement opportunities if you're mobile, awesome training","Getting hired is really difficult as a slew of people want to work at REI, hours can be hard to come by"
2461,REI,Perfect for students,2012-01-27,5.0,Sales Specialist,The benefits are great. It's easy to change your work availability. They will give you time off when you ask for it. The other employees are nice people that are fun to work with.,There aren't too many. You have to work either an opening or a closing shift one day a week. There is a lot of pressure to sell memberships. You usually have to work holidays.

-HQ seems a bit elitist, especially merchandising dpt."
2463,REI,Great work environment,2012-01-18,4.0,Sales Specialist,"-The best thing about working at REI is the environment and the people.  Most customers are very laid back and just need a listening ear to figure out what would suit them best.  
-People rarely have complaints, and with the company's consumer friendly policies, there usually is a solution that will make them more than happy.  
-Many people keep the job for the different perks of working here rather than the pay.  
-Also, supervisors are very understanding about scheduling.","-Sometimes it is a bit disorganized.

Health insurance for part time workers is brilliant, and the number of ProDeals available will tempt you.","REI caters to the beginning outdoors enthusiast, its mission is to bring people outdoors.  Therefore, you wont find really high end gear there as part of their normal in store inventory, but it is available online.  Its Retail, so say goodbye to your weekends.  Hours assigned are unofficially tied to membership sales, and in some markets its policy."
2467,REI,Not a bad second job,2012-01-02,4.0,Customer Service Specialist,"The great things about working at REI are: The prodeals, your fellow employees, how laid back most of the customers are and the fact that you can actually get health insurance if you work enough.","The downside to a job like this is that you're never going to get 40 hours a week, or at least its very rare. Its also difficult to support yourself on the hourly wage while you try and work your way up into the management team."
2468,REI,"At REI, I look forward to coming to work due to great coworkers, great customers, and I believe in our products.",2011-12-26,5.0,Sales Specialist,"At REI, we are selling quality outdoor products to a customer base that loves to recreate outdoors. Most of the employees share that passion as well so the environment is very positive, which is rare in retail. The company takes its ethics seriously and treats its employees well, providing excellent benefits and decent pay. The review process is straightforward and there is a comprehensive plan for moving up and around the company. Middle and upper management values input from every employee and it shows in our annual surveys: REI ranks high in employee satisfaction. The company is well run, financially stable with steady growth and has weathered the economic downturn in the black while still opening stores. Online sales are rising rapidly expanding REI's reach into areas where brick and mortar stores do not currently exist.","It's retail. The cons are somewhat typical, but not to the extremes of some retailers. The pay is low, but it's probably at or above market rates. The hours are not guaranteed for non-management employees, so when it's slow, you are struggling to make ends meet. Although, if you're a student or this is a job to get out of the house, it's perfect. Again, it's retail."
2469,REI,"Great place to work - great staff, benefits and customers",2011-12-19,5.0,Customer Service Specialist,We are empowered to make decisions everyday.  fabulous discount and fun working environment.,Its retail - but we are treated well.
