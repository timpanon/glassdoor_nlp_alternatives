89,RE/MAX,asdas,2022-01-25,5.0,Freelance Virtual Assistant,"One of the main attractions to hiring a real estate virtual assistant is the significant savings opportunity. Many business owners hire virtual assistants to execute specific tasks billed by the hour, which can be much cheaper than hiring a full time employee, or even someone to work part-time. In addition, the expense of a virtual real estate assistant is typically tax deductible, while in-house employees are associated with tax burdens and employee benefits.","Lack of physical presence: Hiring an employee who works remotely offers a myriad of benefits, but it is not without potential downsides. Communicating with a remote worker, especially those in different time zones, can become an issue. Although applications such as Skype or Zoom have made remote communication much easier, it can sometimes be difficult to coordinate with someone who is not physically present, especially in cases of emergency or immediate responses become critical."

The salaries aren't even competitive for Colorado. Way too much corporate redtape.

For example, most large companies can offer a range of insurance options. This includes not only different options for medical insurance, but also supplemental insurance (like life insurance or even pet insurance). And, because the company is large, they are usually able to negotiate a better deal, which means there’s a good chance you’ll pay less out of pocket.","For a time, “thinking outside the box” was a big trend in business.

188,RE/MAX,Great Company,2021-10-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"No company is perfect, but during 2020 I feel the things that really matter in a company really came to light: A genuine commitment to it's employees. The leadership met monthly with staff to update everyone in a crazy pandemic year. Real Estate industry was hit hard like almost everything else. Leadership was clear and transparent. They mapped out how we were going to make it, their commitment to 100% staff retention, what it would take to change that commitment and all the other reserve measures if they had planned if things got worse. I've worked at this company for years and they really care about employees and really do keep their commitment to transparent, honest communication.","The reason RE/MAX does so well is they run lean on staff. They still function like a small, agile company. That means change is the culture. It is an agile company where the likelihood to get a job where you are the only one responsible for a given job is high. That means advancement is typically available. But that also means you might pull long hours or get overly busy for long seasons. I take it as opportunity, but sometimes the company will be to busy to notice it is burning out a department. In my experience management tries its best to help, but it is a rapidly changing environment with constantly changing priorities. If you know that going in, it won't frustrate you."

The benefits package is amazing, not including pay. The 401k used to be mind blowing, now it is just good.

There are some fantastic people that work here!","Engineering culture is moving down hill fast. Engineers are not listened to, and features are forced in at leaderships beck and call. Often times in staunch opposition to the engineers suggestions. This has come back on multiple occasions to bite them, and unfortunately the engineers.

There is no CTO which is a great detriment to the engineering culture. There have been multiple acquisitions since I started and everything this is in a constant state of finger pointing and confusion. The COO appears to be trying to fill a CTO position and I cannot see how she can possibly handle everything she has on her plate, plus be acting CTO. 

While the benefits package is wonderful, the pay leaves a whole lot to be desired. I would say that if you are looking for a good stepping stone to learn, you could do much worse. And do note, you can find an extremely similar benefits package all over if you look. The only benefit I have not found a comparison for is the 401k match. And they took that last year, and re-implemented it at 50% of what it was. Also be prepared to never fully get 100% of your bonus."

694,RE/MAX,Agent-Centric Real Estate Company,2019-05-25,5.0,Real Estate Agent,"RE/MAX allows agents to have their own private email addresses (Gmail for example) and lets you keep all of your leads. It's a great company for agents producing at a high level, because while there are fees, if you make enough, you can set it up so that you pay a higher fee, but keep 95% of your commission. Once you cross a certain level of sales... even with the higher monthly fee, only having to pay the company the 5% sales commission can become a WAY better deal. You can also pay a smaller fee and a higher % of commission (depends on your production level and preference). Agents are allowed to be very independent - they can choose how they want to run their business and they earn from what they produce.","Not a company to come and expect leads. All offices are independently run, so they are not all created equal. Be sure that you meet with the managing broker/owner and that you really like what they are about and the culture they create in their specific office. Monthly fees - you pay for what you get, I suppose, but if you are not really using the office, your broker and associates in the office, the famous / most highly recognized agency name, and/or the online tools, or training (if your broker/owner provides, some may prefer to pay less."

When I first started, I was skeptical whether or not brand recognition was all that important, but after 4 years as an Associate Broker I can tell you without a doubt that buyers and sellers would prefer to work with a reputable brokerage. And there isn't a more recognizable name in real estate than RE/MAX.","I work for a smaller RE/MAX franchise, and when I started I was disappointed with the lack of training programs available to help me get on my feet. As with most real estate licensing programs, they really teach you how not to get sued and how to protect the consumer. Which is great! But that means when you select a brokerage to hang your license at, its important to either have a great mentor/managing broker, or be sure that the brokerage offers training programs that will help you gain confidence and applicable knowledge."

751,RE/MAX,eCare/Technical Support,2018-12-04,1.0,ECare Technical Support,"Good people, nice building, good benefits","If you're considering the eCare or Technical Support position Tier I or II, there are a few things you should know: 

-They'll tell you this is not a call center position, but it most certainly is. You will take back to back calls from agents who have been on hold for a really long time, making them very cranky. You will also take complaint calls from the general public, and the only thing you'll be able to do to for those people is refer them back to the Broker. 

-If you want something technical, and you have a background in tech support, you'll find out quickly this is not what you will be doing. It's mostly password resets and helping people manage the outdated technology they're provided. If you want to see a product grow and change, that doesn't happen much around here. 

-You'll also hear about the wonderful events and happy hours that RE/MAX offers their employees. But you won't get to attend them. Or if you do get to attend them, you can go for a half hour before you have to go back to relieve someone else. So don't get too excited about those. The phone is your number one priority. 

-The Managment of the team does not know how, or want to develop people. They will play favorites and pit people against each other because that is all they can do. They have favorites who get whatever they want, when they want it. There's always someone else to blame, and eventually it will be you. 

-The people in eCare are really very nice, and will help you to train and learn the position. Most of them are new because there's been a lot of turnover recently, like for the last 5 years. They are always hiring to replace someone who left. But they are good people who are all just trying to do the best with what eCare gives them. 

-RE/MAX as a whole is not a bad place to work, but eCare is a mess and it has been for a long time. Until they get new management, it will continue to be that way."

I was called in for the interview and a week or so later I was told I had the position. They were fully aware of my circumstances that I was a student and could only work part-time. They said they needed me to work at least 3 days including the weekend which I accepted and fit into my schedule. I got there on my first day of work  and everything was closed.  After waiting there for 40 mins, I got a call saying the office was closed due to the holiday. I was extremely frustrated as no one had the liberty to contact me or send me an email. As a result I had to come back for my ""first day of work"" the next day. I got there the next day and went to the office where I thought I would be instructed on my position and work duties. The woman there then tells me that one of their workers is going on maternity leave so they need a full time worker and they can't keep me as a part-time worker. I reminded her that she was aware of my situation and this is in no way my responsibility. I asked her why I was not notified by email or phone and she said they tried to contact me and left a voicemail (which there is no record of because i had no voice mails on my phone when i checked). Long story short, Since I couldn't work full time, they decided to retract the job offer telling me they'll ""get back to me"", which of course they never did.

1283,RE/MAX,"HQ Political Nightmare  (RE/MAX HQ - a.k.a. RE/MAX, LLC)",2015-01-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The job itself was pretty easy and most people put in far less than 40 hours a week. The other employees are amazing, met some of my favorite people there.

Plenty of great training opportunities to help you advance your next career, however they won't help you much at this one. If you are looking for professional development, be prepared to seek it out yourself and hold yourself accountable.

Time off flexibility","They used to emphasize how great the company culture was, and from I hear it used to be pretty great. The year prior to their IPO, the focus on culture started to rapidly decline. The smaller salaries that they pay used to be compensated by the culture and not hating your job. Now that they are well into their IPO, the culture is pretty much all gone with the exception of being able to bring your dog to work 1 day a year.

If/when you start there, don't be surprised to see and hear about almost every single employee looking for a new job. I've only worked at one place where the staff morale was this low and they ended up going bankrupt (with turnover being a large part of it in my opinion).

Don't expect to be trained. There are little to ZERO training guides, manuals or procedures. You will be told that training someone for a position with so much ""grey area"" is a tough thing to do, so learn as you go and ask co-workers. Don't be surprised if you're held accountable for things you are not trained to do or informed are your responsibility.

Almost every person in a management position was promoted due to the ability to do their non-manger job well. However, the company doesn't train management to become good or effective managers which results in a lot of company waste. Many of the management has also reached their levels due to political connections within the company (or so I was told). Many of them that were accused of this seemed to half commit to their responsibilities in my eyes.

As I mentioned as a pro, the job(s) themselves are pretty easy. The con to that is people spend a lot more time creating and driving drama instead of contributing to difficult or complex tasks. This also allows people to come in very late and leave pretty early. 

There are other cons, however I don't feel they are legal to share since it is a public company and I'm unsure of what has been released to the public at this point."

All of the perks slowly went away and employee satisfaction was no longer important. It also became hugely apparent that people who didn't deserve promotions were getting them.

1396,RE/MAX,"RE/MAX Platinum, Selden, New York",2013-03-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"EACH OFFICE INDIVIDUALLY OWNED AND OPERATED. My opinion of this office has nothing to do with the RE/MAX franchise. This opinion is solely in regard to RE/MAX Platinum, located in Selden, New York. 

Office is laid back. Very friendly coworkers/agents. Family-like culture. Choose your own schedule. Computers in place for agents to complete work, etc. Free wifi for agents and staff. Desk fees and commission splits are negotiable.","Extremely poorly managed! Owners are not decisive on who manages and often change their minds on who the manager is depending on the situation at hand. No ""HR"" department and four owners who all have differing opinions of how to run the office and giving objecting directions to workers. Issues brought to owner's attention are general dealt with very passively and never resolved. Sometimes these issues brought up both in conversation and addressed in writing (email, notes) are completely ignored, along with the ignoring of follow-up messages.

""Laid back"" atmosphere has ""management"" which does not put a cap on excessive workplace noise and chatter. Most times, very unprofessional  behavior and chatter flows over into business calls, etc. This causes many to not be able to function or concentrate at their fullest potential and even causes agents to not come to office to avoid the noise and drama. Chatter includes unprofessional language which is often heard by callers and clients. This also causes discomfort to the people taking these calls.

Disruptive and ""needy"" agents need constant attention and hand-holding. No real computer or technical literacy or decent, uninterrupted help available to agents. Agents who choose to not be more self-sufficient are not encouraged to do so. This causes admin and other surrounding realtors to have to cater to constant interruptions and requests for help. This, in turn, leads to frustration for those who cannot work efficiently and effectively within the office.

Make admin feel unappreciated and unworthy. No real support for agents or for staff. Raises are not an option for admin staff. No sick time or vacation. No benefits offered.  Meetings ineffective. Respect not commanded. Promises are made verbally and most often never kept. They tell you their expectations but do not give the right tools or work environment to produce what they expect."
