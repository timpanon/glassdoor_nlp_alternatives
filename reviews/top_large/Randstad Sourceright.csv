- a lot of variation in your work
- nice team to work with
- international environment",- sometimes workload is too high
39,Randstad Sourceright,Consultants on Demand - It’s not a permanent contract,2022-02-27,1.0,Consultant,Salary but it’s only high because you’re on a short term contract although they issue you a ‘permanent contract’,"They give you a permanent contract when really you’re only seconding onto the client for 6 months. The manager sold it to me as ‘it’s like being a contractor, only we give you notice!’ 
Please avoid this model in the company, you will be out of a job within 6 months. 

I was placed on what they call a ‘redeployment consultation period’ and I barely heard from anyone during that time, only once or twice. 
The woman who was supposed to be in charge of finding me a role didn’t contact me for weeks at a time when I had a deadline of 1 month to find a new role. 

Luckily I found a new job elsewhere (which is also something my manager told me I’d need to do after the secondment finishes) but some of my colleagues are still there asking me for help to find a new job outside of Randstad because they are being sacked at the end of their 6 months secondment with PwC. 

They lie to you by telling you it’s a permanent contract when it’s not, the client PwC tells you they only need you for 3 months and that’s when it doesn’t make sense. You’re also made to feel like an outsider doing this contractor role so please please avoid."

Averse to trying new things. Disorganized structure and processes. Management is disengaged, one-on-ones are cancelled more often than not.

A lot of manufacturing clients. Not what I like
You'll be put on the bench if they lose a client and you could be benched weeks or months without work. They tend to overhire when they get a new client and when it doesn't work out with the client, they are left with a lot of contractors out of work. 
They also rarely hire perm because it is easier to put you on the bench as a Contractor vs benching full time perm employees."

When I first started a few months ago, I had several things going on from illness to a death; both times I had to take some time off for. I was nervous to tell my leadership about these things because most companies would not tolerate any absences with a new employee. My leadership said, “take care of yourself. We will be here for YOU.” When I returned to work, I received an outpouring amount of messages with offers to help support me and get me caught up with my tasks. 

Additionally, they are VERY flexible with scheduling. As long as you do what you’re supposed to, you’re fine. 

They also provide FREE office supplies, even if you work remotely. How cool is that?","I think the biggest downside of working on the project I am on is that it’s going through some growing pains. For example, because of the need for so many on our team, no one seems to know who reports to whom and it’s a bit of a mess. 

Overall though, I am confident that things will improve. I’ve had several conversations with Senior Leaders and they are transparent and open to accepting feedback to improve."

It is very difficult to start earning real money. The Account Managers make Business Development impossible by gatekeeping so many accounts. The Company has strong favourites. There is no point staying here long term. Endure training for a month and then find a much better smaller recruitment company that treats you like an autonomous adult. They strictly regulate breaks and although there are no rules about it, it is almost impossible to even go on your phone or breathe in office. In such a competitive recruitment market, it's not worth it. There are so many better companies to work for.

- The teams that I've been a part of also tend to be quite close which definitely makes your workday better.

- They're quite flexible when it comes to working hours. Also, they give you freedom and independence to work with no issues as long as you do your job. For me, that's a big plus, I don't like micromanagers.","- We're moving into a hot-desk setup, which I'm not really a big fan of. I like to come into the office almost every day if I can.
Nevertheless, if you like working from home, you will be able to do so with no problem so it would actually be an advantage for you.

- Sometimes the KPIs set can be a little bit disconnected from what is actually plausible. They're working on it though. In the end, it's a company that needs to make a profit, I understand sometimes it's difficult to find a balance.

It might be the client I am onsite working for, but every day is challenging but rewarding. I am not your typical ""lifer"" but I truly want to stay with Randstad and continue growing and moving up for as long as they let me.","Money. Moving from the desk level to on-site, you really miss that fat paycheck. At my account, we ""own"" the process between our client and candidates and it's a full service MSP.

The execs also held a company wide meeting every week during the pandemic to discuss the pandemic, company plans, and even brought in therapists to speak about mindfulness and managing stress. 
2) Everyone has worked at a company where you just don't like your team, or teams you work with, or just individuals. I like everyone that I work with and appreciate that we have such a solid roster of professionals.
3) My team, traditionally, works remotely (as does most of the company right now). Everyone in the company is understanding when non work things come up. Kids have a doctor appointment? Go take care of it. I'm heading to the gym for lunch? Go for it!

I was lied to and ended up doing the kind of job that was so basic, it doesn’t need to exist.
Base salary is poor and the new commission structure is ridiculous, no one in the right mind would work there.
Senior members of the company in Japan were fired for sexual misconduct and breaching Japanese labour laws. The stuff they tried getting away with was criminal.
Started operating as an agency and not RPO and with clients a senior member brought in, he demanded 50% of  consultants commission for any placement made. 
After the overhaul, things have got even worse. In installing  a clueless kid in an important position and promoting someone who is so far out of their depth, into a crucial role, they have dragged the company to the lows of that persons abysmal reputation. This person also threatened to fire people for performance which is against Japanese labour law.
They screwed me out of my final paycheck and the resignation process was handled so badly where they kept breaching labour laws with what they were saying.
RSR keep losing RPO clients left right and centre, that is how bad the place is.
Zero career path whatsoever."

- RPO'd for a Big 4 and they didn't even try to follow the Big 4's values even though we were on site
- They started brining in others on lower salaries for doing the same role which was strange
- Kept changing the benchmarks to reach maximum bonus, so each quarter it was just getting lower and lower
- No individual recognitions in place. High performers weren't recognised if you weren't friends with management
- Management had no interest in the well being of staff and tried to shove problems under the rug
- High turnover 
- Would rather push people out than have honest conversation with them"
509,Randstad Sourceright,Recommended,2020-11-17,4.0,Human Resources Recruitment Coordinator,Nice place to pick up skills within recruitment if you have strong language skills. They will give you the training necessary. They value you and will be happy to offer you alternative roles within the company in case there is a drop in your workload which will give you even more opportunities to learn new skills and work stability. We have 2 massage chairs in the office. Management is very supportive. During the pandemic they were actively looking for ways to secure the jobs of their employees and supported the mental well-being with regular meetings/updates on the status of the company globally.,"Location is near Göncz Árpád VK which is not very central, area lacks a lot of amenities in my opinion. Now during the pandemic the office is open but they support full-time home office (normally it would be 1 day a week which could be more and hopefully they will be more flexible on this from now on). Our salary is not the highest on the market and the benefit package could be better too."

Prepare for lots of meetings talking about recruiting, all the while wishing you had that time back to actually do the job. True story: one week our team was told we had the best quarter performance in the 7+ year history of working with the client, the next week we had an mandatory meeting to get our hands slapped for not following their escalation policy. In the next 30 days three highly experienced recruiters quit. Most concerning though is their employment model. It's plain unethical. If business slows down with the end-client Randtad puts you on the bench and you sit idle until you are finally forced to find another job. It's obviously a calculated strategy to keep from paying unemployment, because you're not actually released until sitting 90 days. Not many of us can wait that long to pay our bills and they rely on you quitting beforehand."

Management also likes to pretend they're on your side at first, but don't expect them to help you at all.

For somebody who is green on the field of HR it is a great entry-level opportunity but no wonder after a year you will see new faces all around you. In general what could be valued here .-if lucky - is a good team spirit and the opportunity to use your language skills, gather some experience, and grow a thick skin whilst learnng about some aspects of the business.Oh and diversity they value that. As well as your opinion- latter is only on paper though.","Accepted the offer with the great promise of long term vision and growth within the company, soon started to see the gaps in the story as team consistency is changing on a monthly basis as sourcers look for new jobs.  Some positions ( presume.not all) have nothing to do with HR. Without saying too much let's just assume someone who has a very good insight on how the Human Resources(internal and RPO) and Agency business work out there, and  seen 1 or 2 employment contracts in various languages and done some F2F interviews in life writes this review.You have no influence and say in the hardly-working processes, and might also question your very existence in that process, as feedback is lacking, candidates who have been  convinced and found over various platforms during long hours of work and overtime are dropping out due to waiting. Most companies offer flexibility on working hours for obvious reasons:availability of people....Home office is ok, as long as nobody wants the same day HO.. Or maybe not? There is a major miscommunication and unclarity who is allowed what since it varies depending on the team your are working with, Bummer.If lucky all celebrates your success if not you most likely will end up on a client visit starving. Training is super nice and super useless as it is not specific to the industry. Must learn along the way and you may also  have some ideas,then can proudly work even harder without support. The admin fairy often pays visits to remind you on all 5 trackers and ATS to be updated and used.
To quickly wrap up the above: feels like a startup with green employees, miscommunication, misalignment is part of a daily routine, please pack on board: stress-bearing, sense of humour,patience, tolerance and a reminder: it is a shared service center, better than telemarketing, worse than HR."

People get promoted internally with no prior people management skills nor any training and are then let ruin their coworkers day to day lives by their mismanagement. Team leaders are also used for senior management to be blamed for every unpopular decisions.
There is a toxic culture with lots of gossipping and backstabbing. People are not only not promoted but also prevented from applying for jobs internally.
There are very few senior people in Sourcing Recruiter or Recruiter roles and as such there are no real role models.
As many of the jobs require foreign (i.e. not English) language speakers, foreigners with 0 days of experience are hired with Senior titles and get paid twice as much as English speakers, even if they don't actually have to use their language skills for months.

RPO is hired to aide organizations with their failing talent acquisition departments, however you will be faced with a juxtaposition. Manager will tell you to be SME and consultative, but won’t support you with client. Organization has lost clients from pushback so often the very reason they come to RPO is ironically the very reason they do not renew.

Some excellent people in client facing roles
Flexible work environment if needed. Largely managed like an adult
Lots of good ideas floating around","Totally disjointed organisation. No standard processes and a lack of unity cross accounts.  It really isn't a big company so it is odd this has never improved.

Sales sell a great programme/offering to clients - but rarely comes true in reality so the strong onsite staff get left with firefighting and a battering over and over.
Shared services/back office teams a huge let down -sourcing teams are low quality in areas, IT support non existent, various other functions run from non english speaking centres which results in embarrassing communication to external stakeholders. Need a figure from finance to support a client decision - ask 5 months in advance...
Even most internal docs and comms are poorly translated.
2018 Re-orgs of back office have left them bare boned and no one knows the answers. Those that are left are stretched.
Constantly falls to client facing staff to take the heat.
To many political battles at the top and between client services and back office - eg targets/SLAs dont align to client targets - leaves the onsite teams taking a battering as above
Apparently ""people"" are the focus but again bonus schemes change 2/3's into a quarter , pay review conversations a grey art.

Sort of like a crash course in recruitment - worth putting up with for a while to go work for a real company, as most people do. If you can briefly succeed at RSR, you can succeed almost anywhere so alumni go on to work at great places - Amazon, Google, large tech companies around Europe. 

The people are young and mostly friendly - though most gifted people have left by now to find a proper job.","The management is genuinely bad. Anyone in a leadership role, except for some notable exceptions, generally speaking has little to no idea how to manage human beings. Often this is because people with no prior leadership experience are promoted in order to keep them in the company, since there are no other career paths to follow. 

The overall attitude about the company is so negative that you will spend at least an hour a day listening to new gossip from coworkers which sounds made up but isn’t - usually related to how badly people were treated or some new ridiculous business initiative that was thought up with no concern of how it would be received. As a newbie, you hear jokes about RSR from day one and immediately adapt to this sarcastic tone. 

There’s a huge disconnect between the Budapest office and the rest of the company - working in an outsourced location for an outsourcer is rough. This is never addressed, and instead the high fees charged to clients and exorbitant salaries being paid to higher management and for tech acquisitions are not passed down to Budapest, but paraded in front of the office like a show. When ELT visits, you genuinely feel like a celebrity came to visit the African orphans to feel good about themselves. 

Salaries are low, not just internationally speaking but compared to competitors in Budapest. You will often hear about inconsistencies, like how some juniors got offered senior salaries just because they speak an in demand language."

771,Randstad Sourceright,No thank you!,2018-02-12,1.0,Rec,You have the possibility to work from home. You also might be able to change accounts and work in different industries.,"As a full time 'talent' employee, you aren't eligible for paid sick time off your first year. You also accrue vacation hours (only 40 hours total) each pay period so you don't have a full 40 until the end of the calendar year. You can only roll over 8 hours to the following year. So you're most likely losing 32 hours of vacation. 

Additionally, the medical benefits options are so poor. I elected to not use their coverage and pay for my own health benefits because it was cheaper to use a different insurer than to be covered by them, even with their pre tax deduction.  You also aren't paid for overtime. You have to be preapproved to work overtime. But they don't approve it so very often we are working more than 40 hours but not being compensated.  

For metrics, we are required to use their ATS in addition to the client's ATS so much of my time is spent doing double data entry into their ATS so I get 'credit' for my work."

The clients are very professional and this allows you as an employee to learn from the professionalism exhibited by your clients. 

They management is also willing to give you a chance and hire you despite minimal experience in the field. 

Of course, once they hire you, they ignore you as they've successfully recruited you.","The management is rude, inconsiderate, hurtful, discriminatory and worst of all, negligent. 

They tout an ""open-door-policy"" which is completely untrue as your attempts to communicate with the management team is blatantly ignored. Some people on the management team constantly use debasing and degrading words to shut you down and any attempts to communicate. 

There is complete distrust amongst the employees and the management staff which impacts relationships. The wrong-doers are never brought to attention as the ""whistle-blowers"" are consistently ignored or worse, targeted for biased treatment from the sitting manager. 

They constantly lie to their clients and expect the employees to go along with it. 

Management makes decisions without including staff in it and refuses to practice their ""R-O-A-D to fun"" policy. 

The company is in so much debt it is considered financially weak. 

Human Resource in this company is hopeless and are not educated about Malaysian labour laws , consistently giving the wrong information. Communications with the Human Resource department is  is not confidential which in turn, ensures that you get into trouble with the management staff about the issues brought up. 

The employees with great achievements are not given an opportunity to move up but rather, the ones who can effectively ""butter"" the management are the ones who get promoted despite their complete lack of success at work."

Pros for this company: Ability to work from home. I have been with the company for almost 7 years.

The new leadership team still is lucky enough to count two true gems among them, however, with itsin-fighting, promotion of self-interest at the expense of employees, active manipulation bordering on bullying, blatant nepotism and inability (or unwillingness) to articulate the ""why"" behind the flogged-to-death ""strategem"" of ""we have to be number 1 because number 2 is first place for losers"" (yes, a top exec actually stood on stage and told us this), the new management has managed to create a culture of blame and fear."

825,Randstad Sourceright,Pharma Contractor through Randstad,2017-03-10,2.0,Project Manager,If the company you are supporting mistakenly partnered with Randstad for contract staff then working through Randstad may be the only way to start working quickly.,"Randstad is paid 20-30% over your hourly rate. If you are paid $100 per hour, Randstad is paid at least $20 per hour for every hour you bill.  Given Randstad's earnings are tied to your earnings it would be to their benefit to provide adequate payroll and benefit support to those they support. Unfortunately they do not and when (not if) you need to reach out to fix errors that they have made it will be worse than a visit to the DMV.   I would recommend not contracting with them - contract directly or work through a different  contracting house that will provide adequate support. If Randstad can not support the colleagues that are generating their revenue I find it difficult to believe that they would treat internal, non-revenue generating, colleagues any better. There are a lot of red flags with Randstad."

They have problems paying their staff which happens on a regular basis. If you are into not receiving your money on time, this is your employer or choice. Complaints raised to HR and senior management are just not being dealt with. In fact, you are better off not raising them at all in order to save yourself hassle. If you are right they will choose the side of the wrong. Senior management is only concerned with money rather than looking after employees and valuable business relations. Be prepared to work with people on intern level who they gave senior titles which obviously does not work. They hire people out of pure desperation and fail to do background checks and most importantly psychological tests which results in working with mentally disturbed colleagues. They hire people from even worse RPO's than they try to be in the UK who were fired from their jobs and put them in front of their clients.

I feel like I have seen this company grow through the purchase by Randstad becoming who we are today... Randstad SourceRight. They are so many pro's to being a part of this company
-support infrastructure (anything from implementation, compliance, sourcing) of true subject matter experts that can give me solid pertinent data to share with my clients.
-ability to work from home 
-strong medical benefit plans
-paid vacation and sick

Most importantly to me is that they have given me the opportunity to support/have visibility to several large corporations ...I get to see their process successes (and sometimes failures :) .... so I can improve my skill set to achieve greater success for who I support. I get to do accrue such a wide net of knowledge from supporting industry leaders without having the look of being a job hopper. I love that aspect of my corporate culture.... you just don't get in other staffing environments. It makes you wiser because you have more varied experience to draw on. I love that about RSR.","To be completely honest though ...its not all sunshine and rainbows. How could it be....

Remember that part about working at home... from the Pros. Well it is not for everyone. I find that I work more hours then I ever did when I was sitting in an office. Just being honest. That is my choice and I know that but it isn't for everyone. Over my now nearly a decade of working from home I have learned that folks think working from home is all long lunches and mindless conference calls; It is not. You have to be okay in setting expectations with your loved ones that just because you can open the door and you can see me ....doesn't mean I'm there. That really isn't a Con for RSR but more of a disclaimer for anyone targeting a WFH role. Be ready for longer hours and true accountability for your responsibilities...working from home is not a cake walk.

Really the only true Con I can think of I just recently identified. Surprisingly enough, RSR doesn't have any level of tuition reimbursement. I was kinda stunned as from that varied experience I mentioned earlier... all of my clients have some aspect of reimbursement for advance level education requests that I had to be well versed on to support recruiting. RSR I feel is an industry leader in its own right so not having a program that supports the goal of an advanced degree is disheartening. I'm going to remain hopeful that will change sometime soon."
880,Randstad Sourceright,RSR Compliance Manager,2016-02-29,5.0,Compliance Manager,"I started working for Randstad Sourceright in September of 2007. Considering that RSR is a big proponent of promotion within, I have been promoted twice since starting with the company.  Each one of the associates that I work closely with can state the same thing (at a minimum). It is possible because RSR leaders recognize top talent and are willing to invest in their success. In addition, we have leadership programs in place like “Leaders in Motion” that assist in guiding you in achieving success. 

I work virtually but I have the option of coming into the office, which I take advantage of a few times a week.  I enjoy partnering face to face from time to time with my teammates and direct reports. 

Finally, the culture at RSR is one of a big team. Regardless of the client/account it’s clear that we all have the same end-result goal in mind:  To ensure the success of our clients in efficiency, timing and quality of hires while ensuring regulatory compliance with the OFCCP and/or EEOC.",The (expected) turn around time associated with work requests at times.

My manager trusts that I work and do my job-no micromanaging, don't constantly call and request updates, and allow me to manage my own time, as long as I meet my job duties/goals. Also, the RSR 401K program is great! They match your contribution and I've saved a good amount of money for retirement already. The job stability is good at RSR-many recruiters/sourcers are account based, and if/when an account closes, the RSR internal team does a fantastic job of finding new accounts for those employees.

891,Randstad Sourceright,The best is yet to come,2016-01-28,5.0,Recruiter/Sourcer,"*Great employee engagement, which really improved even more in 2015. 
*Virtual working opportunities. 
*Typically a positive work/life balance.
*Management offers fantastic growth opportunities. While you may not always have rapid advancement, there are almost always situations where you can gain more technical knowledge or take on projects. 
*Lots of camaraderie among teams. In spite of having a large virtual workforce people really do share their time with one another. 
*Lots of recognition for a job well done. 
*Mentoring programs. (Lots of willing official and unofficial mentors and ""mentees"".) 
*Leadership that cares about the ""everyday employee"". 
*Strong Center of Excellence
*It's an organization that cares about staying current with best practices.
*Continuous learning opportunities/ Internal University","*Working on an account basis can sometimes present a feeling of instability. While it's a great organization and the individual can work incredibly hard, you can't always dictate the financial situation of your clients and that can sometimes lead to downsizing. When companies aren't hiring as many people, our expense can become superfluous. 
*Somewhat challenging process to move from ""Talent"" to ""Associate""."

My leadership team specifically is outstanding and the people I partner with daily… well I am happy to say they care about me as a person as well as the business.  I am finally at a company that “gets it”","I love this company of people, of that, there is no doubt.  As with everything however, there are pro’s and con’s to being a part of this organization.  For me, it is the benefits.  While the healthcare is solid, it is not “great” and for me education assistance is needed to offset my job related degree in process.  When finished, I will be an even greater asset to the company however I am handling the bill on my own.  That said it is a tradeoff.

My manager is focused on hiring smart, driven people - then getting out of our way and letting us be GREAT!  She's there when I need her, but never micromanages. I'm allowed a tremendous amount of autonomy, as is everyone else on my team who is productive and meets goals. Culture of progression for those who want it - access to career mapping, personal development plans & tools, and a formal mentoring program that is actually meaningful! If you like being surrounded with smart, thoughtful, and driven people who possess humility and a sense of humor- this is your home. Virtual training anytime I want it has made me a stronger recruiter. Also appreciate how many women hold positions of power at Senior manager and executive levels.","Working remote/virtual is wonderful on most days, but makes it a little tougher to build relationships. Have to really make an effort to reach out and connect with peers and managers. Leveraging more mandatory team video conference opportunities might help."

I've only been with RSR a short time (6 months) but I do hope to grow my career within the company and be a part of the RSR team for a long time to come.,"Working remotely definitely has it's pros, however it doesn't come without challenges.  Training can be complicated because of the distance between team members.  You rely heavily on the internet and web conferences.  Also, communication is KEY!

901,Randstad Sourceright,Terrible experience,2016-01-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Virtual and work from home opportunity.  You can also work on different accounts and gain exposure to different industries.,"The RPO model is the worst environment I've ever worked in.  It seems like every time you turn around, there are metrics being created to measure one thing or another.  It felt like the company hoped their employees don't meet their goals and looked for ways to NOT have to pay out bonuses.  For the most part, the metrics come from the SLA's between RSR and the client but the clients are often the biggest offenders, which keeps the recruiters from meeting 100% of their goals. However, RSR does not care because keeping the clients is more important than keeping good employees.  OT is common and necessary because of the heavy work load, but is never approved.  Managers don't want to hear that you need more hours to get your work done. They only tell you to manage your time better, so recruiters learn to suffer quietly and work the hours anyway. Managers have quotas too - push their recruiters to fill as many jobs in the shortest time possible, keep costs low so their numbers are good and they get to be on President's Club.  HR is useless when contacted.  They give the standard ""not reporting your hours are illegal"" and ""talk to your manager"" speeches.  If I felt comfortable speaking with my manager, I wouldn't be calling HR!!!"

This is a hard task given the size of the company and its various models and silos.",This is being aggressively rectified but the size of the company can make information flow slightly clunky. But they are going to great lengths to resolve this gap.
909,Randstad Sourceright,On-Site RPO Recruiter,2016-01-11,5.0,On-Site Recruiter,"I have been working as the On-Site element of the Babcock Power team since August 2015. From initial contact from a corporate recruiter who originally sourced me to today I am very pleased with my experience on both the internal and client side. Here are specifics: 

Management: Leadership up to even senior level is very accessible, encouraging, and connected. I have been in brainstorming session calls with SVPs and Directors on escalated projects. My manager and I have a very good working relationship; she is clear/direct, encouraging, and meets with me regularly on my development.

Work/Life Balance: I was given ""blank-check"" support/time off from my client and Randstad leadership when I needed to take time off from work during my first few months for a critical medical/family matter - other firms would dump, back-fill, and move on. Flexible hours and working from home is also a very nice plus.

Compensation: Based on my years of experience within the recruiter and marketing world, I was given a very generous compensation package.

Investment/Training: Client needs naturally can pull anyone away, but there is a plethora of resources available. My manager and I regularly meet to discuss my goals, development, and progress.

Culture: High energy is a great describer. The company encourages and facilitates establishing relationships within the company. Again, client need can naturally pull anyone, but at least there is a wonderful culture to contribute to and enjoy. Other firms will have a deficiency in such, even if you're not interested in participating. It's available, so take it or leave it. Me? I'll take it! I love who I work with and am very happy here!","I have not come across any so far. I am fully comfortable in the role and totally beyond the introduction phase with no major issues or complaints. We will see what the future holds, but I'm very optimistic and plan to have solid longevity with this company."

The pay is fair, and in some areas, above average.","They do not often promote their team members to ""associate""--which would mean PTO, (partially subsidized) benefits, etc. The bonus structure gets revamped often, and usually results in a lower payout.

The culture in general cannot be beat - most of the RSR team (including every level of the organization) work remotely, which lends itself extremely well to work-life balance.","The benefits have both their pros and cons - PTO is generous, however 401 K leaves much to be desired.

Tools being utilized for Recruiting are not the most effective.  For instance, Linked -IN Recruiter is not a source utilized  for external searches. The competing companies in the RPO sector have invested in upgrading to Linked-In Recruiter.    This is a tool that will give Randstad a true advantage over competing companies.

Our training is extensive and challenging but drives the use of emerging techniques and technologies.  The support provided by our internal talent team, the Center of Expertise, and our overall leadership provides both day-to-day support and strategic direction that sets us well above our competitiors.  The majority of our compnay works from home, yet through technology, namely Google+ and other tools, we're able to maintain community, celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, and achievements.  All in all, RSR is a great place to work.","This company can be very challenging, and definitely brings a work hard, play hard environment.  As part of this, it's sometimes not for the faint of heart of one who requires constant management.   In some cases this can affect work/life balance, at least temporarily.

I love that we hire professionals who can bring a fresh perspective to the job - it makes the day to day a lot more interesting too. On the flip side, Randstad really tries to take care of their employees, they seem committed to helping them further their careers. Plus, great job security. It might sound too good to be true for such a large company but it's true. I've found there are plenty of opportunities to advance (I personally have enjoyed two fairly major promotions in two years) or even move into a different role or department - which I've seen happen with a handful of colleagues. Definitely a work hard, play hard culture and you will never be bored. I also like the fact that I am able to work remotely (from home or while traveling) or I can go into a Randstad office since I'm based where some of our sister companies have phyiscal branches.","Workload can be overwhelming at times, but I'm fortunate enough to have somewhat flexible hours which makes a huge difference. Compensation may also be slighly lower than other industries, at least in my case, but as you progress in your career you start realizing that who you work for - and with - can make up for a gap in pay.

By far, this has been the most rewarding experience in my career. In a relatively short period of time, I have been involved with some very challenging projects that have stretched me professionally. The people who work alongside me are very supportive with an acuity ranging from smart to genius. Not only am I given the resources I need to be successful in my role, I am encouraged to be creative and am recognized for jobs well done. Among the perks of my position is the occasional opportunity to travel globally which edifies me at work as well as personally. Furthermore, I am fortunate to be associated with a company that is involved with so many charitable initiatives, listens to the concerns of its workers (and factors those concerns when planning annual objectives, I may add) as well as offers health benefits that have been a boon to my family.","While it is certainly not a bad thing to give the best quality of service imaginable, it is often tempting to work non-stop; this is especially true when receiving emails after hours is a normal occurrence.

I support a huge company, but love my team and the support we get from our client, leadership, and managers.  Randstad Sourceright tends to hire very seasoned people.  I had several years of agency recruiting experience prior to coming here and was impressed that i seemed like a baby compared to my peers.  Compensation is very competitive too--no complaints on that end.  My favorite thing is getting to work with great people, and have an awesome work life balance.  We're salaried, non-exempt employees so you're not working in a sweatshop with crazy hours.  I work 40 hours a week and leave work at work.  So many people would kill to make the money I make with the stress level I don't have, and crazy hours I don't work, and not a day goes by that I take it for granted.  Yes, it is higher volume at times with high expectations, but if you're a go-getter, type A, with excellent customer service to your managers and candidates you will do really well here.  i will never go back to agency recruiting!","Sourceright is VERY metrics and data driven.  If you don't like numbers and data and spreadsheets and metrics, you won't do well here.  We are successful with our clients because we pay such a close eye to TTF, and req analysis, but if you are unorganized and not on top of your reqs or managing a full desk, it can be overwhelming.

Was told once the transition was completed to an exempt employee they would no longer reimburse for ISP costs - that turned out to be completely false, and they are now refusing to reimburse their back payments.
Will work a minimum of 80+ hours per week
Zero work life balance
Management could not care less -- I found little to no integrity among any of the managers for the 3 years I was there. 
When Sourceright lost their RPO account, they lied to string along all Recruiters and HR Coordinators as long as they could maintain their ability to be billable back to the client; they promised more assistance to the recruiters (who were averaging 80+ reqs per week) - when they had no intention of providing assistance. 
They will string you a long without a raise or without reimbursing ISP costs until you threaten legal action. 
Intelligence is obviously not a requirement for management."

Very LOW integrity and morals amidst most ""management."" The ""bottom-line"" is the only concern even if one produces 30% of revenue for the whole team. Micromanagement is overwhelming. 4 different managers have changed in 1(!) year of my employment. Work-life balance is talked about, but not practiced."
1006,Randstad Sourceright,It is what you make of it...Whiners and Blamers...this isn't the place for you!,2013-03-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is not unlike any other company....In most cases, competent, hard working people who can understand the big picture and translate that into their everyday work will do fine and be rewarded.  I personally, am not a whiner or blame thrower.  If there is an issue, fix it!  Or if it's out of your span of control, bring it to those who can, provide them with the unbiased business case, a workable solution, and ask for assistance.  I've been successful in this company for years with this attitude and when the opportunity opens up for the next role, my reputation of being easy to work with, productive and results oriented makes me a shoe-in.","First of all - let me point out that none of these are really cons...but they are things you need to know before you take the job:

Unfortunately, we have a few ppl that have decided (or simply don't have the skillset to be anything else) to be part of the problem, rather than the solution.  To those folks (looks like a few have posted here) I say, sorry you couldn't cut it.  

Recruiting isn't for the faint of heart, especially RPO where you are in a balancing act between your company that is trying to remain profitable, and your client and HM (who think there are qualified candidates begging to take their below average job for less pay).  You have to know how to gently put that HM in their place, help them understand what you bring to the table (read: I'm the recruiter, so I'm inherently better at recruiting because...) and coordinate your team (sourcers, recruiting coordinators, screeners, etc) to deliver.

This isn't a cush-job.  You have to figure out how to do things more efficiently.  Especially with the fact that many of our positions are hourly and you have to manage your work into 40 hours (and I personally have never been asked to work OT and not been paid for it, but they will realign workloads or get someone to help if you're approaching 40 and can't get it done yourself).  There are a lot of ppl that get to work from home, which is nice, but not everyone can handle that set-up.  The distractions can kill your efficiency and focus.  

Bottom line - Understand what you are signing on for.  Hourly employees are not guaranteed 40 hour per week for 52 weeks a year...you'll likely have to flex your schedule and you need to budget that you will work maybe 7-8 months out of the year....the end of the year is always slow for recruiting.  Even in a salaried job anywhere in recruiting, you could be laid off.  At least this company tells you when that time is approaching rather than blindsiding you.  And then they will pick you back up later when volume increases (Assuming you're one of the good ones)"

1008,Randstad Sourceright,Great Managers horrible company,2013-01-15,4.0,Recruiting Coordinator,"Great managers who work with you and your schedule,","There is no longevity, company continues to have over 200 people on the bench."
1009,Randstad Sourceright,The RPO company in a huge amount of flux with no end in sight -,2012-10-17,1.0,Recruiter,Pros - the company name is recognizable; that is now an unfortunate thing.,"Cons - SourceRight used to be the #1 RPO, and always led the Bakers Dozen.  In 2012, they are #5 with PeopleScout skyrocketing to the top.  

The RPO business for Sourceright is in process of dying; they have lost dozens of account - from the largest to the smallest, from the longest length of contract to the shortest - doesn't matter, they have lost it.  Currently in October, there are nearly 300 Recruiters and Recruiting Coordinators who are on the bench, for a few more days, and others are just being terminated with a 2 day notice at best. 

There were a few of us who were on long-term accounts, but beginning in the fall of 2011, we were all told that contracts with hundreds of new clients were being signed and for us to continue to ""hang in there"" and we would have jobs for the next 5 years.  In a recession, that is good to hear.  The majority of us unfortunately believed this moronic middle management, and it all turned out to be lies. They only wanted the Recruiters to 'hang in there' while the contracts were coming to an end.  

Prior to the horrid purchase of Sourceright by Randstad, when SRS was still a part of Spherion, it was a good company.  Yes, they always demand 80+ hours per week, and the compensation was average; the benefits were average.  But you had relationships you could build with the corporate managers, and several of us were absorbed by the client which was a good thing.  Other than that, the executive management of Sourceright will just continue to churn and burn - that's their entire goal.  Do not make the mistake that they give a flip if you're happy, or if you want career advancement.  They do not.  They want 80 hours from you - they want you to meet your metrics - and if you get an ulcer or heart attack from their manufactured stress, they do not care.  

If you can keep in mind that you are nothing more than a moth in their flame, and you don't mind having -0- work life balance, and make an average salary with well below average benefits -- knowing that there is a 100% chance of the next phone call being your termination call (most of the time for no reason) - then you'll be happy here.  Also keep in mind the Sourceright managers will just blow smoke - that's all they know how to do.  they have managers who are inept, who often sound stoned on the 'team' calls, who cannot create an excel file, or who constantly (and supposedly) lose their hard drive every other day so you have to do their job too -- then you'll love it here. 

If you are interested in a solid work-life balance, working for a good company who cares about your career path, who will reward efforts - then Sourceright is not for you.  They have terminated hundreds in the last few months - some with no notice.  And they will keep on doing it, and lying to everyone they hire.

If you are an individual with more than one year of expertise in your field, and are hired by Sourceright, please keep in mind they do not acknowledge that you've done anything prior to your being hired by SRS.  So, if you have 15 years of solid recruiting, staffing, talent acquisition expertise in your field -- from day one, SRS will talk to you and treat you like you literally just fell in to their chair and knew nothing before they hired you."

1011,Randstad Sourceright,One of the few RPO companies that can deliver,2012-08-16,5.0,Recruiter,"There is a commitment to quality that I have not seen in other RPO firms I have worked for. Here I have been given specific training for the deals I have worked on as well as sourcing training that has taken my ability to find niche positions to another level.
I have found that the clients I have worked with quickly forget I am an employee of Sourceright & regard me as an extention of their team. This is in direct contrast to other RPO firms I have worked for who are just trying to scrape by with the minimum resources on a deal.",You are expected to perform right from the get go! There is a lot of pressure to maintain the levels of production & the compliance rules are exacting. I was audited repeatedly in my first 6 months.
1012,Randstad Sourceright,There's a Reason These Guys are #1 in RPO,2012-08-10,5.0,Director,"Some of the smartest and easiest to work with people in the business.  Generally speaking the individuals within Sourceright are sharp, analytical, understand the business, and excellent at working with clients.  Simultaneously they maintain humility and show appreciation for their fellow team mates with constant praise and feedback.  The recent merger with Randstad has placed SourceRight in an even greater position as the merger has provided a global footprint with Randstad recognizing the knowledge and experience of the SourceRight team, thus allowing that team to lead much of the way in preparing RPO for a global model.",At times SourceRight can find itself overcustomizing solutions or bending too far to client demands.  They will ignore their role as consultant to say yes to the customer when at times their experience and knowledge of best practices would better suit the client going forward.

Small bonuses are paid quarterly based on company profitability.","Low pay, no benefits unless you pay for them (you pay 100%, but pre-tax).
