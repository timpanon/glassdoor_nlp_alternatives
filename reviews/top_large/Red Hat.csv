Management doesn't think about what is right for the company but more about doing whatever is needed to achieve the numbers for their profits.
Employees become snitches on their colleagues is common for the sake of their personal gains. Culture is toxic, fake, and only about politics and personal interests. Unfortunately, diversity doesn't exist in the MENA office with the dominance of people with the same ""background/nationality/former employer,"" which helped speed up the toxicity spread in the environment.
Too bad, Management is fully aware but decided to look away despite the escalations and evidence. I would not recommend this place to anyone."

This makes for messy and ineffective plans and execution. The company is matrixed and segmented in weird ways that oftentimes seem illogical for productivity and efficiency. Change management is atrocious and there are always several business shifting changes that occur each quarter before the last load of changes had a chance to be adopted. This has resulted is mass turnover. Now there are enormous gaps in tribal knowledge, because nobody documents anything, but if they did it would be outdated. So much of the work is spinning wheels because the business won't allow to slow-down and address systemic and root cause problems. Everything is just push through and survive to the next round of changes. And forget about measuring for success, reflecting on efficacy or ROI."

Diversity, equity, and inclusion are just a few of the hottest buzzwords at Red Hat right now. Management preaches of their importance, and yet if you look around you’ll notice that a lot of teams have none of those characteristics. This is especially true the higher you go in the company hierarchy."

They always treat me with respect. My team is also pretty amazing. People are the main reason I love Red Hat.","My biggest concern with Red Hat, and the only reason I don't give 5 Stars, is because of how leadership at the top (and throughout Red Hat) seem to strongly side one way over really embracing open culture from all sides. I struggle with that on a company wide basis. Let's be open for everyone, not just the agenda that other company politics are paying for.

475,Red Hat,Mixed bag,2021-07-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Generally people are nice and collaborative. There is a very strong and deliberate drive by leadership to provide or cultivate a culture of inclusion and psychological safety,Promotions are not always merit based. Performance management is a joke and the People Team is the worst culprit in this area
476,Red Hat,Sexism- Culture was the reason I joined RH and the main reason why I left.,2021-07-22,1.0,Senior Level Employee,"I truly loved working with so many people throughout RH and I learned a lot from so many of my peers. I’m forever grateful for the connections I made here and the people who supported me during my time with the company. I also had fantastic management (this is very team dependent) during my time at RH. The benefits here are decent. Pay is ok, but not nearly competitive to other companies. Remote work is supported and seamless. The addition of recharge days this last year was great! PTO is generous.","I can easily spot fake reviews plastered here. I’ve also been tracking the reviews lately and as of last month when you filtered reviews by demographics it was very clear how women and marginalized groups felt internally. This gap magically closed overnight? My strong recommendation for job seekers is to sort reviews by the lowest ratings and pay attention to the common trends/dates when making your decision. Also, ask LOTS of really direct questions in your interviews!!

The culture that was pitched to me in interviews and promoted ad nauseam internally was not at all what I saw or experienced. RH is by far the most toxic work environment I’ve ever been in! Sexism, racism, and nepotism are not only rampant, but blatantly overt. RH prides itself on being diverse and inclusive (it says so on the website!), but internally that couldn’t be further from the truth. This is still very much a white-male dominated environment with a strong bro culture. All of the affinity groups RH is so proud of just serve as therapy gatherings for marginalized employees. There is zero transparency into promotions and pay, as a result meritocracy is pretty much a joke here. Gender pay gaps are real. If you work in departments outside of engineering, your opinions won’t matter. Engineering rules all at RH and they’ve been allowed to essentially dictate how the other departments run. As a result it is pure chaos and departments have zero autonomy to make decisions and changes to benefit their employees. This overarching engineering control consistently fuels fighting between departments/BUs over seemingly everything. It also fuels departmental silos...and even more so along product lines. I had to force/beg for cross-departmental collaboration and spent so much time forcing people to work together and think outside their bubble. I never succeeded with engineering. They were content doing it their way and their way meant all the supporting teams were kept in the dark and then bashed repeatedly for not “keeping up” with them. If you like structure and process, RH is NOT the place for you. It’s not merely about keeping up in a fast-paced environment and being agile….you’ll need to survive in pure turmoil. Company direction changes all the time. There are no clear roadmaps for some of the products. No solid go-to-market strategies. Engineering will deliver functionality without including QE/Docs, because those departments are always drowning and behind. Support teams are understaffed and flailing. We STILL let customers toss money at us and shift to focus on that vs building stability into our products. Tooling in departments supporting engineering is mediocre at best. You’ll sit in hundreds of meetings to discuss something and then zero action will come of it. The internal dysfunction makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to just do your job.

Outside the general internal dysfunction, the bulk of my poor negative experience at RH was directly the result of sexism from male colleagues. A lot of the constant issues I faced boiled down to a toxic culture and management chains that don’t know how to advocate for their teams properly. As much as we promote ""teamwork"", RH leadership is more focused on keeping/owning control of their functional areas vs being a part of the larger team. A lot of self-serving exists in leadership. If I'm honest, my biggest regret was not leaving this company sooner. I should’ve left after the first time I brought up toxic/sexist behavior and watched it get swept under the rug. And months later when I watched male peers from across the company support the gender pay gap and marginalize women OPENLY on a company-wide mailing list, it should've been my cue to go. I saw all I needed to see here."

535,Red Hat,Great place to work,2021-06-22,5.0,Software Architect,"Red Hat is a meritocracy. If you put in the hours, do good work, always work to improve your skillset and advocate for yourself, you will find success. I hired in as a Consultant with no tech degree (self taught Java). Through hard work and advocating for myself, I made it to Consulting Architect in 6 years. Others have done it much faster.

Even though the company has become more corporate as it has grown, there is still a Wild West sense to some of the divisions (I've worked in 3 different divisions over 10 years). With that chaos lies opportunity, but also unease if you desire more structure. Be cognizant of this when hiring into a division. If the division culture is too staid or not startup-y enough, transfers are usually allowed.

I very much enjoy working with other people at Red Hat. Even though we come from a relatively diverse set of backgrounds (by tech's standards), we all have common ground in the work we do and the culture of the company.

If you are passionate about something tangentially related to your work, you are encouraged to pursue that. Whether that be building a rack, writing bootstrapping code or working on open source projects, Red Hat rewards go-getters.","The acquisition by IBM hangs over the company. There is a sense that if RH slips in growth or profits once, the IBM overlords will assimilate our culture to be more like IBM to 'fix' us. While this may not be true, that potentiality is openly discussed.

Some of the software suites RH develops have lofty physical requirements. Many employees that have to deal wth that software in a daily capacity have had to resort to building their own home labs in order to run the software to learn and resolve client issues."

- Great allowances over the salary compared to any other companies I have worked with.

- Very cool office space, pantries & cafeterias. Free snacks & beverages 24x7.

- We also have a gaming & sports area which we can use anytime of the day.","- The only small drawback I can mention is a the Official CTC/Salary Package. They do not officially provide a good CTC or hike when they hire. But the in-hand salary is really huge compared to it.

For example, I was hired at exactly the same CTC as my previous employer, but my in-hand is at least 1.5 times than what I was getting there.

Travel, as long as there isn't a pandemic","Management focuses solely on sales targets, and absolutely ignores root cause for keeping up with market trends in practice/tech, which is farming the same talent out without investing in their new hires to take over.

You'll commonly be at 100-120% billable allocation if you have a skillset and know what you're doing, while newbies sit on the bench indefinitely not getting experience. Management struggles to train and enable their employees, and doesn't hold people accountable. Favoritism forms an endless cycle of fighting for the same few people to staff projects.

Everything is wild west. There are no processes, everything is off the hip. All the best and brightest that form standard collateral just get railroaded by sales until they can't produce anymore.

Red Hat touts being an open organization, but have incompetent senior staff that play politics/favorites if you don't do exactly what they say. The entire environment is high-context that relies on information hoarder/busy bodies that don't actually do technical work. Your input isn't valued.

People with loftier titles haven't done technical work in decades.

Compensation is all over the place. Performance targets are worthless.

Work here if you want your career to die, or if you like failing into management."

- The pay isn't bad compared to other non-vendor similar positions
- The expectations of work before everything are definitely not there and it's not a cutthroat environment amongst colleagues in similar roles","- The rewards for equal effort aren't equitably distributed and the flexibility isn't tied to your professional output but rather to the management you happen to report
- Diversity and Inclusion is more talk than action and HR or People Team are more ombudsmen or a buffer between employee and management than true HR 
- Change for change sake often leads to duplicative and redundant roles 
- Very little mandate to affect or enfirce said change thus your exposure & therefore influence beyond your small sphere of contacts is limited by a very oddly matrixed yet heirarchical org/reporting chart/chain.
- Meritocracy isn't a good thing, it marginalizes those whom are unsuccessful branding them somehow less fit"

Software Quality Engineer (QE) in Red Hat usually takes responsibilities way beyond just testing software.

Also QE can contribute to whichever project they'd like, and due to Red Hat is fully open-source, there is hardly any limit on where to share your codes or technical blogs.",Red Hat has huge and comprehensive portfolio.

They constantly compare you to others who work overtime and say you’re not getting enough done. Deadlines and appearing to be on schedule are more important than any of the values they claim to have. They lie about giving you 20% time devoted to your own projects. They lie about letting you use whichever tool you’re most comfortable with. They constantly micromanage and bully you by assigning ‘mentors’ AKA ‘spies’ that are informing your manager of any flaws you may have and telling you that you suck and don’t get enough done. They give you a 90 day goals and expectations and even though you meet and exceed everything on that paper, if they don’t like you as a person none of that matters and they invent new goals at the end and pretend that you were supposed to have met that invisible goal. They lie about you and make up untrue assumptions about you, and then spread those lies to others and to HR to get you fired. It’s a very toxic environment."

801,Red Hat,"Inadequate management for tech support, painfully slow hiring process, ""people relations"" teams are a joke.",2021-02-18,2.0,Technical Support Engineer,Some remote work. Friendly teammates that are always willing to help. Friendly environment even in the office. Bonus quarterly. Spend first 3 months focusing on getting RHCSA and RHCE certifications(forfeit first bonus).,"Technical support is underpaid compared to industry standards. Work feels like an assembly line rather than helping customers. Managers without technical background being in charge of technical support and writing their performance reviews. People relations teams need an overhaul of adequate people. How your bonus is calculated for front line is a joke. Bonus is dependent on your rank, not so much performance. If you are front line you will most of the time receive a bonus between 60% and 70% even if you are a top performer on your team."

2. Good Work Life balance","All good in redhat but management should take care of employees those are working here from 5-6 years mostly who started with freshers role. These guys will think that they are big sharks in redhat and act like the same. The new people who will be joining redhat will get frustrated with behavior those old tech guys have. So it's humble request to track newly joined employees issues, and should expect professional behaviors from these big sharks. 
Treating new techi employees like freshers in the colleges by those big sharks (who consider themselve) will going lose trust between new employees and redhat."

Never they will answer any question directly and if the senior leadership will say anything, the rest of the leaders follows it blindly. Development for associate managers is the least cared topic for their managers. The ego of managers is lower than room temperature and they will not leave a single opportunity to take away your credit.

Little salary (less then the amount of work demands), great pushback against hard and proper work with a straightforward goal which logically should be rewarded. The idea of “find yourself something to do” is leading in management heads, while new and fresh ideas are getting generally little support, because of overwhelming pickiness of engineering and no strong management lead."

There is no lip service and where there is a lack of transparency or any hint of insincerity, it gets called out. Leadership expects it. People say what they mean and are free to disagree. I feel valued for my opinion, even when it turns out to not be the best way.

People are encouraged to find their own path. I have only been here for a little over a year but have already seen a new job be created for someone because that was the direction she was naturally interested in and there was a need. I myself was promoted after only 7 months. Red Hat truly cares about their people.

Also, people here are really smart! I don't recall ever working anywhere with so many intelligent and reasonable people. It's truly a joy to be around so many people who are good at what they do.","Let's be honest - all this openness does not result in fast decisions. Fast decisions are made where needed (read: COVID) but in an open organization, where multiple viewpoints are solicited, it naturally takes longer. It can be frustrating. Ultimately it results in a better decision but takes some getting used to."

Red Hat offers the chance to solve problems in the ways that seem best to our team, and has a huge well of talent and experience to draw on for advice. Red Hat also doesn't (officially) demand that you spend a lot of time doing off-hours work, though the needs of communication in globally distributed teams often makes this much more ambiguous.","Infrastructure and team efficiency support is not always the best. You can pursue the solutions you think best, but the downside is that you might have to support it yourself. Our organization has been a bit reluctant to adopt some more modern practices, such as SRE and service observability. You are in charge of your own education and training, in order to implement solutions to your problems. Although Red Hat does offer a wide array of training courses, finding time to take them can be quite challenging. Finally, global distribution of engineering teams has taken a large toll with some teams, in terms of finding a sustainable work-life balance (you simply cannot factor out timezones)."

958,Red Hat,Don't be fooled by fake positive reviews,2020-12-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Brand name. As much as one may want to downsell this after working here, this name still ensures you will get calls from recruiters at better companies with much better engineering cultures. For now, this is true. Next year? Who knows. Big Blue acquisitions have never ended well.

There are few good engineers, especially at principal level or above. If you get to work with the really good ones who have a track record of shipping impactful projects, it would be a good plus in your career. Not every engineer at this designation is good though, so watch out for the not-so-obvious rotten apples, because there are a lot of them.

Work life balance is ok. Your manager would usually care if you are clocking a lot of hours, but then again at same time, he may not care whether you are fulfilling your potential and having a great career. He might actually not  give a damn about those. Some of the work can be busy work created by lack of direction from the very top.","Many downsides to working here. I won't recommend this company even to anyone I don't know, much less the people I know and care about. Absolutely, no way.

So, where to begin?
VP and Directors are pretty much lacking in providing direction to the company. This is a company that missed reaping major benefits from every major technological change that occurred right under it's nose. Sure, the company has engineers who write software that runs on public clouds and mobiles. But why work in this company if the direction is set by other companies? Talk about lost potential and a misguided sense of doing something useful as an engineer. There are other companies that can take your inputs, and take them to fruition, while enabling you all the way. Competitors have better track records at launching products with customer validation, and with much less fanfare and self-adulation.

The entire top brass, from VP and Director level, to the CXOs, ought to have their performance examined for the past 10 years. People and employees who were better at providing direction have moved on, long time ago. The ones currently remaining have been here for long, have learnt nothing from failures, haven't been held accountable for stagnating product lines and failure to create new product lines. And morale is bad. Engineers quit mostly because they fail to find a sense of purpose and ownership, which they eventually get at other companies.

Product management culture is absent and abysmal. In the several years I worked here, I had never met a competent product manager who could sell his vision to engineering teams. Lot of PMs winging their way around, with product success not attributable to them. This place has a lot of failed products, and there is a history of rebranding and embedding such failures in other products, to provide a sense of utility and not have work go to waste. Reflections and postmortems are either not done, or done for the sake of hiding failures under the rug.

So, you not only get to see poor people management that demoralizes you, you also get bad product management, with the end result that you would spend hours working on features that aren't relevant. It can't get any worse than this.

Clueless engineers enable this culture, by not demanding accountability from key stakeholders to ensure staff deliver impact. Some are busy fighting over minutiae and trifles on memo list. Some others enable bad management by brainwashing other staff into thinking the culture is fine, and as if this were normal at a growing successful company. And a few other engineers at very senior positions have pet projects that you might end up working, by accident, where there is no meaningful and measurable impact, with all round bad decision making. You get to know of this lack of impact and the damage it does to your career, only when you've assessed yourself against peers - until then, you're just as clueless and brainwashed.

I mentioned memo list. That mailing list is probably a reflection of how the company has lost its way, chasing its own tail, while other companies have emerged as better and more desirable places to work at.

This company has devolved into a laggard that focuses on selling support for software to other laggard companies. What was the last piece of software sponsored by this company, that was the choice for a new emerging startup? Did any of the projects here eventually go on to create outsized impact, that resulted in the Googles and Amazons taking notice? No. You'll struggle to find answers. If you are quitting Red Hat, better hope your recruiter doesn't find out about this.

Bad pay. When I worked here, appraisals were done every 18 months, and there was a good chance you would get a cost of living increase for great performance where you had to break your back, work with asinine coworkers, and deal with clueless managers. Slap in the face. One of my managers discovered this small concept of inflation and how ideally pay rises had to factor for inflation, some 20+ years into his career. Spoke volumes about how compensation is treated as a subject in this company. Avoid.

Run like hell like your life depended on it - I did, just too late, and it took years of hard work to negate the shortfalls of working here. You are going to be doing much better work elsewhere, rather than this place that advertises heavily but has very little to show for."

If you are an engineer or other individual, you can make it to principal through hard work and results. If you are a manager, the only career options open to you are entirely based on who you know and depend your narrow personal group — other units are insular and out of reach. 

The CEO talks a big game of ideals and Open Source openness. Quite simply interviewing folks for promotions, or even just posting the opening for internal applicants (instead of secretly deciding who of your friends gets promoted) are old practices that companies a lot less full of themselves have followed for decades. In Red Hat, senior openings  are an exercise in closed door decisions for the existing old boys club. 

Let's not get even started on diversity. This is the most white, male company I have worked at, and this is not a particularly diverse industry so the baseline would be so easy to beat."

992,Red Hat,toxic,2020-11-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Pandemic approach that puts employees first and isn't forcing us to return to the office before we're comfortable. Very generous paid time off policy.,"On paper, Red Hat’s famous “open culture” seems fantastic, and there are plenty of Kool-Aid drinkers who praise it and leadership ad nauseum. But what companies like Red Hat fail to recognize is that an “open” culture tends to become unsupportive and downright toxic when the company consists primarily of people belonging to the privileged class.
Case in point: Certain Red Hatters have been doing the right thing by trying to replace longstanding tech terms that perpetuate a hostile environment for traditionally oppressed populations. The result is a bitter feud on the company-wide mailing list, with too much repetition of the same tired arguments citing dictionary definitions and the “offense” of totalitarian-like language control. The problem, of course, is that the people making these arguments refuse to understand that tradition and dictionaries were created by the class that did the oppressing and that it’s time to give voice to the oppressed. Watching this conversation devolve has been incredibly demoralizing.
Then there’s the fundamental concept of the open decision framework, which calls for transparency and inclusivity in decision making. In practice, at least in my department, key decisions are still made in an isolated, top-down manner by one or two department leaders, often not even eliciting feedback from other department leaders, resulting in confusion, toxic fallout from the associates negatively impacted by the decision, and often multiple efforts going on at cross purposes because one group doesn’t know what another is doing. 
Overall, I do not recommend Red Hat as a place to work, and I am seeking to get out as soon as I can."

The targets are ridiculously high made without any formulas or real facts from the dashboards (which are a mess!!!).

That's not Red Hat as we all know it. Lack of management governance has favoured the formation of siloed environments, in which everyone only thinks about their own profit and progression, regardless of the company objectives. Backstabbing is very frequent, Culture is non existent and it's only about politics and personal interests. It's no surprise that this has led to the dominance of a ""certain group of people with the same background"", which now are setting the ground for spreading the roots and intoxicate the environment even more. They've taken relevant management positions and now they are bringing their friends. What a shame, hopefully someone in Europe will act despite the huge evidence and repetitive escalations.

Being at this company for 5+ years with different roles I have had experience with an array of management types. For the most part, the transparent value that Red Hat strives and asks for helps when having open conversations with a leadership team, however, you will always come across a personality clash or a manager who's only goal is to acquire as much territory as possible in order to continue to get promoted/recognized whether it makes logical sense or not. Where career growth can be difficult at Red Hat is if you have been here for several years, potentially in different departments, you can find yourself having to take lateral moves just to ""develop your career"" this really hinders your ability to continue to grow your salary range due to the company policy of only a certain max percentage can be given for promotion at any given time. Depending on the department, there is not a standard salary base for the same role you'll find in others. Your best bet is to come in externally and one day consider boomeranging (leaving Red Hat then coming back) if you find yourself in a similar position."

Staff over worked doing the roles of about 6 different people at times. Not handling growth in some depts well at all. You will continue to have turnover if you dont stop over working people. Don't only trust middle mgt to voice their teams are in desperate need of help. Some of these people in mgt have no clue what it takes to properly support a specific type of team and won't recognize where help is needed.
My first place where mgt is extremely incompetent in some depts. Some super smart people yet also have some of the dumbest people in charge with literally no past experience managing what they are managing. They didn't even work their way up so literally are clueless.

1084,Red Hat,Easily the Best Company Ever,2020-06-22,5.0,Acquisition Account Representative,"Honestly? There are too many to list here. 

Red Hat is a one-of-a-kind organization. Period. And it's an honor to be a part of their tremendous growth.

Perks/Compensation: On a basic employee level, the compensation is significantly higher than any other organization around. The benefits are everything you could hope for, and they are constantly asking us, the associates, for feedback and other ways to improve. 

Culture: The OpenSource culture they foster here is amazing and fosters a sense of camaraderie, transparency, and togetherness. This is reflected even within the sales organization, where the sales team mentality is ""win-as-one"" without the typical corporate cutthroat, hierarchical/competitive sales culture. And if you ever need help, there's no end of colleagues willing to assist you. 

Work/Life balance: Everyone is working from home right now for the foreseeable future, but most Account Executives before the pandemic were remote and frequently traveling for customer meetings. Although at the higher levels of the sales structure you'll see a lot of traveling, Red Hat has always been committed to telling us ""family/personal life first, work second"". You can see that evidenced in their recent ""recharge days"", where they have given almost ever associate a random day off, just to help with mental health and general wellness during these trying times. 

Goals/Mission: We have high goals and standards, but we are given all of the tools to meet them. And there's a TON of upward/cross mobility here--if you are looking for a career and a place to grow as a professional, this is where you belong. Upper management has the mission to increase our size by x3 within the next few years, so I'm betting there's going to be a ton of changes but a plan of action that will absolutely get us there. 

Senior Leadership: Red Hat's senior leadership is virtually flawless. Their response to COVID has been one of the most humane and comforting out of any organization I've heard to date. They are transparent as possible and I truly trust their direction and decisionmaking. 

TLDR; As things stand, I will be a lifelong Red Hat employee because of the ways I have been treated in this organization.","It can be stressful at times with high goals and high quotas, especially during a recession/pandemic, but the way the company has handled these changes and offered enormous help will make me a lifelong employee and advocate.

Management can be stressed at times and sometimes they can reflect that stress in team meetings, but in my experience, they are quick and willing to engage in a useful dialog to remedy the situation. My manager has even apologized for cursing at me at one point and has been proactive to change that method of dialog."

Wfh is the norm and remote workers also exist, so the culture is built in such a way that there isn't a lot of difference between someone who always comes to work and someone who prefers to wfh.

1110,Red Hat,"Good, but low performing middle management in corporate functions not being addressed and dragging the company down",2020-04-29,3.0,,"Still a good place where you can make a difference to the world and to the company. Internal rules somewhat on the minimalist side, so there are empty spaces you can fill in with your initiative and invention.  A lot of very smart people, many people willing to go above and beyond and show the Red Hat culture at its best. Some excellent senior leaders, especially in PnT.","Corporate functions in Red Hat do not keep up with the evolution of the company. Erratic decisions about internal tools and global vendors when IT, Finance, Ops and HR decide to change their tools in the same time without really making sure that there will be some kind of alignment and that the interactions between processes have been taken into account is worrying to say the least. I attribute that to the fact that the middle management in the corp functions is full of people who have been for a long time in the company and Red Hat's growth ascended them to senior manager levels or director+ levels - for which they are not apt in terms of competencies, leadership skills and ability to learn and understand the business and its needs. Because it is Red Hat, there is a very high tolerance for low performance in strategic thinking, planning and leadership - as long as you are the 'good olde sport/lady' with 'Red Hat in the hearth'. This increasing layer of incompetence is than reflected in situations when Red Hat's business is slowed down by non-performing internal processes, approval layers that exists only to justify existence of certain managers and by sales, services and engineering creating duplicit internal roles to substitute for the fact that the corporate support functions that should have been there to...eh...support...are not fulfilling their role and instead are running own agendas detached from where the business goes. It is needless to say that people in these middle management jobs seldom leave on their own - since they are not very likely to succeed outside of Red Hat.
This, together with increasing levels of empty corporate talks in these functions make it really difficult to be engaged when you work there."

- Red Hat has been trying to break into consulting for big corporations for several years, so some projects are very high pressure as there will be tens of millions of dollars worth of contracts for the company (and about a $1M USD commission for the salesperson)

*** THE REST OF THE REVIEW IS MOSTLY FOR PUNE, INDIA Support Delivery( AKA CEE)***


- The Pune support delivery has become from a *great place to be*  (more than 5-6 years back) to a CALL CENTRE. 

CONS: 

- Micromanagement
- Favouritism
- Focus on quantity rather than quality
- Dirty politics
- Unorganised HR, hence poor talent acquisition 
- Interview/hiring process is not standardised
- Overall slow appraisal cycle. (it is still a gray area) 
- Now it is not a place for people who has some career goal or aspiration 
- much much less compensation than market standard. 
- For products like OpenShift, OpenStack support is not at all equipped(with training/tools) to support enterprise customer.  \
- Extremely poor management, most of them are really really bad people manager without any people skills. 


I have seen some common trait in managers(Pune/CEE)

- most managers do not give a damn about associate's career development
- Only interested in numbers 
- managers taking credit, promotion, international travels showcasing associates hard work
- Discouraging to participate on Open Source conferences or projects within support org. 
- Push back from support management if one wants to pursue other career opportunities within organisation.  


Most of the great and talented people has left or leaving. 

It has now become a place full of incompetent people, who has just got really really comfortable. 
 
The problem is the company has scaled poorly, in last three years due to mass recruitment to achieve short term goals."
1157,Red Hat,"Great place to work,  parental leave policy needs improvement",2020-01-05,4.0,Software Engineer,"Great coworkers! Red Hat is growing fast and is a dynamic working environment full of smart, collaborative people who care about their work and are passionate about open source software. 

The company provides ample opportunities for growth so from a career development perspective, it is a great place to work. 

Management clearly cares about preserving and promoting Red Hat culture post-IBM acquisition and I feel positive about the future of the company.","One major pain point at Red Hat is the parental leave policy. It is far behind other tech companies for parental leave. Birth moms get 12 weeks paid leave, which is much less than many of the comparable big tech companies offer, over 50% less in many cases. Non-birth parents get 9 weeks paid leave."
1158,Red Hat,Awesome place to work at,2020-01-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Open Source Culture
- Opportunities to learn and grow
- Freedom of voicing thoughts",Nothing much comes to mind.
1159,Red Hat,These four and five star reviews seem like they are fake or written by management to give falsely positive testimony.,2020-01-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Bi-weekly pay cycle.
Lame but available health insurance.","Terrible pay.
Very toxic culture.
Rampant sexism.
Rampant racism.
Rampant ageism.
Unrepentant favoritism often crossing into nepotistic territory.
Associate managers all seem to lack both experience and humanity.
Managers are clueless and proud of it, they love to rubber stamp anything a fellow manager says.
Communication failures between all levels of management are so consistent that meetings discussing anything in the company feel schizophrenic.
Sexual harassment from male and female managers is so prevalent and intentionally unaddressed it is alarming.
Terminally un-inclusive.  If you are a woman or person of color, get ready to be marginalized and overlooked.
High levels of attrition.
Zero time is provided for training and professional development.
HR will side with management 100% of the time and tell employees point blank that only a managers word matters.
Unless you happen to be on one of the two or three teams with managers who can walk and chew gum simultaneously, do not expect meaningful performance reviews.
Management openly mocks employees when they think no one is listening.
Employees are harshly critiqued if they point out problems or issues but do not also supply the immediate fix to management.  
Management habitually lies about their concerns for everyone’s work-life balance.
Many managers and associate managers are in meetings from the moment they walk in the door until the end of day, preventing any management from actually occurring.
It’s a “do your job and your managers job and some of your colleagues jobs too for good measure” sort of place to work.
Untruthful management.
Inconsistent management.
Costly misguided pet projects that waste employees time and ultimately produce no viable product are the norm.
What was important last week will like not be important next week and employees will be punished for not anticipating the changes.
Budget freezes and undisclosed overruns will affect employees salaries repeatedly.
Salary actions are abysmal, almost humorously so.
Frequent management advances mean employees get to have a revolving door of mostly inexperienced and unqualified associate managers throughout their career.
Merit is not appreciated or recommend.
Red Hat kool-aid must be consumed or there ARE repercussions.
Hyper-cliquey.
People with inconvenient health conditions will be fired.
Performance is actually irrelevant, but how an employee is perceived is paramount.
All of an employees knowledge and good will absolutely will be abused by most managers.
Career advancement is time locked,  rather than taking ability into the equation at all.
Hard work and dedication are ignored."

1182,Red Hat,Worst place to work for…,2019-11-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I need to think hard for it...........Brand Value.,"This place is certainly not for people who are ambitious or people who do not want to be treated as a doormat and wants to grow in their career. I am not sure whether I should blame the organization or the team but I will definitely not recommend anyone to join this organization, especially to people who need to relocate.  The managers, senior managers and existing team members are deeply involved in politics who are 24X7 preparing a recipe to make this place toxic. 
The funniest part is that the newly born so-called “people managers” are always scared of their own team as the team members have better technical skills to deliver their work, that too without any guidance from their managers and this basically puts a big question mark on the existence of these people managers as they are left with the task like leave approvals, performance review (sometimes without even knowing what their associates actually does), introducing carrot and stick policies within the team, unethical practices etc. An ultimate “manager’s boot licking” skills are required for surviving, promotion, bonus etc."

1184,Red Hat,How much you'll like it depends on what you're looking for,2019-11-21,3.0,Quality Engineer,"If you like working remote 100% of the time, this is a great fit; most of the quality engineering team is distributed around the world and remote teaming is required.

Solid benefits offerings and compensation.

Most folks are engaged and highly opinionated about technology, sometimes ad-nauseum. This level of passion is a good thing for a company that is focused on technology and collaboration.

The variety of technologies and learning opportunities available mean that you'll have plenty of chances to brush up on the latest Red Hat sponsored open-source technologies. If you like to learn and grow, this is a good place to be.","The remote work aspect is an impediment to collaboration between development and quality engineering; expect things to move much more slowly than an environment with co-located team members. Sometimes quality engineering work can feel like a ""rubber stamping"" charade at this company.

Heavy emphasis on correspondence via e-mail. Conversations and decisions that would be made more effectively via a real-time discussion are often taken care of via e-mail or online chat. 

There is an emphasis on being receptive to feedback, but this openness doesn't always extend to taking action, even if the benefits are obvious. Sometimes feedback is simply passively ignored. Some things can be changed. Some can't because of inertia.

For an open source company, the source code for test automation is strangely kept private. This is reflective of the internal structure of the company - quality engineering is not formally included in the engineering part of the organization."

As simple a thing as not being willing to wave the flag will get you criticized for not joining in to the movement of the day. To focus on actual work, disorganization and lack of process is the normal way of doing things. Departments are heavily silod and no 2 business units work the same. Overall company direction is clear & well done from the very top (which is great) but immediately stops once out of that level. Lower level management does not follow the directions from above and routinely does not do as directed.

1227,Red Hat,Best Company Culture wise,2019-09-27,4.0,Data Analyst,"1. No such work timing. Come and Go any time.
2. Work from home option. (Don't ask just take it)
3. Well stacked fridge (Free)
4. Free Snacks.
5. Good Pay.
6. You are your own boss here (Literally no bootlicking). Complete your work and go home.  I most of the time reach office by 12 PM and leave home by 2.30 PM.  (This does not mean I am working only for 2 hours though)
7. Everything on your mobile phone. Yes everything. Red Hat uses google suite. So the mail app is gmail and other products are gchat, google calendar, google drive. Again this is kind of advantage and disadvantage. For Example at 11 PM you will be watching something on Netflix, your work mail just gives you a notification. You just open the mail, respond to it and go back to your show. No one cares whether you responds through mobile or laptop.
8. Talking about laptop you can choose between Lenovo Thinkpad and Macbook. I chose macbook and I received a brand new macbook pro (It costs 1.4 L). They value you...
9. You ask, You get it. You need extra monitor, ok here you go. You need a Apple Magic mouse (costs RS. 7000), here you go. Literally anything as far as you use it for red hat.
10. Everyone here use whatsapp for official chat. Make sure you have two mobile numbers one of personal and other for work.
11. You have red hat University site for free, where you get 1000's of courses online. Not satisfied with that? No problem, you have Linked in Learning for free. Still not ok? Here you go, you have $ 2000 every year for your learning. Use it to do online course, Higher studies... Anything.... But only catch here is you should prove this course you are going to do will help red hat business.
12. Oh forgot to mention that you receive lots of cook stuffs. (premium quality)
13. 21 days of Annual Leave + 6 days of sick leave + at least 12 days of public holidays per year. So for 2019 below is the calculation - 21 + 6 + 17 (Public holidays)= 44 days of paid leave. Cool isn't it. And you get extra holidays for maternity, paternity,  Compassionate leave etc.,
14. Everyone in the office is friendly. From the receptionist to the CEO ( I have never met him though). You feel like you are valued. You want coffee just ask for it. You need to bring from outside, just ask for it. You will feel like you are at home.
15. Not sure what to name your new pet dog? Dont worry. Ask to the memo list (which has every redhat employee in it, including VP's and CEO). You will get 1000's of suggestions.

I can go on for so many. But its boring to type. So I stop here. Meet you in the cons section.","Does Red Hat has any cons? Yes like all the company it has. But nothing major as far as I know.

1. You will struggle a lot in your first 10 days. Everyone here comes to office, do their work and go home. So nobody will voluntarily helps you unless you ask for it.
2. My personal Struggle - ""Joined red hat? Recruitment team doesn't care for you once you join the team on your first date. Till now not sure whom I have to contact if I have any doubts regarding HR process ( I can ask anyone though, they will be happy to guide you). 
3. No proper steps for on boarding. Sign the documents online, join the company. Thats it. 
4. Interview process took almost a month. Every round had a week gap.

I cannot think of more as of now. I will add more if I think of something."

I was mislead by the market and reputation that Red Hat continues to have.  Let me tell you - the great culture applies to some departments but NOT the SALES DEPT. When I spoke to the People Team about my concerns they told me about the work they have put into have an ""OPEN CULTURE and OPEN Management"" BUT IT DOESN'T apply to the 13th floor AKA the SALES DEPT. HR admitted this themselves and told me that they are constantly getting complaints about the sales culture. The Sales organization is BACKWARDS. It is mostly run by 20-30 something men with HUGE ego's who believe in the Wolf of Wall Street sales environment where you work until 8PM or even some nights until Midnight. There is little to no concern for people with families. You feel guilty for taking PTO or asking to work remote even though we all have laptops and VPN access. We are all micromanaged through different tools integrated with Salesforce and other apps. There are even monitors under your desk to see how often you are at your desk. I wish someone would had told me that the ""open culture"" did not apply to the Sales Department. I would be curious to know what their turnover rate. I would not recommend to anyone with sales experience that are looking for a company that will treat them like an adult."

I advise it as a good starting company given the technologies you work with. Once you get experience and you do not find your position interesting, you should leave as soon as possible. Promoting people for their work is rare, often it's like ""I got a better job offer, I want salary rise or I leave"".  With this attitude, people are often underestimated and underpaid in advance for people who live corporate life.

A lot to learn","Salaries are not at all up to the market competition and to make things worse there is a discrepancy in salary for experienced and new grad hires where the new grad hires could be getting higher pay than the experienced employee.
Inexperienced management leads to poor team development and loss of productivity. People don't want to acknowledge they are micromanaging even when they are.
IBM acquisition created a lot of uncertainty and to make it worse, the management just kept on providing newer and newer excuses instead of making the impact clear and concise.
Also, the hiring bar is going down considerably across some of the teams where the hires are hardly ready to learn something new and are rather more focused on just joining the dots."

This is harsh reality that red hat does not pay its employees according to what market standard is. Due to this a lot of people quit looking for better salary. There are a lot of people who quit and are earning 3 times of what red hat paid them but they miss the company and would come with a blink of an eye for a lower pay than current but at least more! 

-stress

OH boy! This is real. Management thinks stress is what employees cause to themselves. These management people are dumbf-word. Stress is due to the customers calls and a lot of other things such as workload. Have you folks thought of giving us more money for the work we do? Have you thought of maybe hiring more people so that the workload is balanced?

This was my best company. And it will always be. I wish they do something about money.

Also, management will start ""performance improvement plan"" for associates that they want to get rid of. Eventually due to pressure these employees quit."

They seem to think that they have come up with the incredible technology that they have literally stolen from baby geeks  to awe struck to realize they are being taken advantage of.  Shame on you Red Hat.  

Why are all these market analysts predicting IBM will take a hit?  What reality are they in?  THINK.  This is the best thing that has ever happened to Red Hat.  Of course, most of the employees will be laid off and replaced by offshore workers or ""new collar"" workers.  Configuration is simply not as difficult as the more ""SR"" team members like to make it out (that's just their egos).  Welcome to the Borg folks.  You are much more replaceable than you and your foolish friends believe.  

I find the majority of the reviews here comical and if you do your homework you'll find some articles out there about Red Hat's demand for loyalty.  Thus all the kissing up.  You can cool your jets.  IBM has actual ethics and tracks your value add vs lip service.  
 
The word Meritocracy was thrown around a lot at Red Hat but this only equates to Mediocrity after all the nepotism.   I've never encountered such a lack of original thinking and innovation (not to mention integrity).  Why the attitude and pretension?    These people are truly entertaining with their ""humility"".

For better or for worse, the culture is very open - no one is afraid to speak their mind, and the CEO actually responds to communication from individual contributors.  

Compensation and benefits are very fair, IMO - certainly not the best in the industry, but I have no complaints.","Linux subscription growth is slowing, and customers aren't as afraid to go it alone without vendor support, after seening the Amazon, Googles, and Facebooks of the world do everything in house.  Ansible and OpenShift are the big drivers at this point, and if you're not tied to one of those products, you'll feel like you're not that important.

The openess I mentioned as a pro can be a bit of a negative at times - sometimes you get streams of consciousness from product management  about road map items without fully thought out messaging, which will scare the sales staff away from a particular produt.  

There can be a cult-like mentality at times - some associates believe Red Hat can do no wrong because open source is inherentlly good, and proprietary software is therefore evil."

Your work life balance is exceptional and really good if you have kids and want to work a basic 9-5 job. You'll get 15 PTO days and the week between Christmas and New Years off without having to use PTO.  Majority of the people are very nice and genuine.","Red Hat calls themselves a startup but are far removed from the scene with 25 years of Dot-com experience. You'll often be tasked with using programs that are long deemed as archaic. My department alone used 30+ programs to be what they considered ""functional."" Some of these programs were last updated in the 90's and were not considered to be obsolete. You have no say in trying to offer opinions on how to improve processes but will be put in groups where you waste your time weekly on coming up with ideas of how to improve processes without the ability to make a real difference. 

The majority of employees at Red hat have never worked another job and are unaware the opportunities out there for them elsewhere. This encourages group think and a lack of innovation since few people have an outside perspective. As a manager, if I had someone apply to work with me and I see they previously worked at Red Hat for more than a year, I would not even consider looking at them knowing how little them likely grew while working there. 

Business outlook is always questionable. Ask anyone who works there what direction they see Red Hat heading, most will have no idea. The majority of the company runs on the belief everything is going fine(who knows why) so it should continue that way. If you're looking for a company who tasks risks that create payoffs, this is not the company for you.

Complacency: people around you are most likely ambitionless and have no drive to go above and beyond. They are okay with taking the paycheck and raise their families. 
Lack of innovation: if you are looking for somewhere with innovation and do research, RH is not it. 2 thirds of the company is sales and marketing. Very few people are actually on the product side.

- There are many instances of selective knowledge sharing and even some knowledge hiding (mentality remnant from its startup legacy perhaps). There is still a very clear divide between who is ""Red Hat"" and who is ""Feedhenry"".

- Red Hat is very USA centric, there is much talk about the Red Hat culture, but it is nebulous and difficult to relate to.

Mansplaining appears to be the de facto practice at this company.

Rapidly growing company without structured objectives also means lots of teams are fighting for overlapping responsibilities, driving distrust between would-be colleagues and wasted efforts all around. Newer leadership does not work well with more tenured leadership, trickling down to poor relationships between individual contributors on different teams and dramatically differing expectations.

Salary raise is always ""just around the corner"", your reviews are looking good, and then they find a reason not to. That's the common complaint across depts and coutnries.

Middle management has become really weird, not really knowing where products should head, so sometimes you end up rewriting stuff back and forth. That differs hugely per team, to be fair.
The higher management doesn't really care about the ""infantry"" and the lower management doesn't propagate issues higher. Sometimes, a rogue manager at high position comes up with completely insane idea, implements it despite general resistance, and then quits the company. Seems Red Hat is defenseless against this."

- Team work is not encouraged
- Unethical behaviors are not properly addressed and are tolerated

Don't buy their philosophy on being an open meritocracy, the group and company operate nothing close to that. The company culture is not what it was meant to be. Not only are they not open, they don't know how to operate in a productive hierarchal structure either. Lack of leadership, direction and actual management skills is prevalent.  It's a very unsatisfying group to work in. Very disappointed because if the team was run well by senior management, this could have been an amazing place to work.

Work from home - I am also seeing some staff taking advantage of this and cheating on company's time.   They come in very late for work (late everyday, taking long lunch breaks and leaving early, so maybe only work 4-5 hours everyday) and work from home more than what they should.  While some hardworking folks cannot get the permission to work from home even when they need to - kind of unfair, so it really depends which region you are from, who your boss is and if your boss knows what you are doing (hope those cheaters get caught one day).

Overall Red Hat is a good company with decent people, I wont say all of them are smart, some are quite dumb in fact... dont know what they talking or doing....."

1663,Red Hat,Great people to work with but leadership is driving the best ones away,2017-11-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The people at Red Hat are some of the most hardworking, genuine, collaborative, supportive and fun-loving people I have ever had the pleasure to work with. There is a sense of comradery that is unique and empowering (but that happens when people feel like they are going into battle everyday together).
- When leadership gets out of the way and trusts the team leaders and associates, there are amazing results created by phenomenal teams.
- There are pockets within the company that truly embrace and foster the culture and core values. Most of these pockets exist in the areas that deal directly with customers.","- Back Office management and leadership are not able to get out of their own way to allow people to develop processes and policies to support the growth that the company is experiencing. Stale leadership causes there to be missed opportunities and does not allow for trust in the associates to innovate and help grow the company to its fullest potential.
- Lack of accountability within leadership trickles down and impacts the team and projects. There is an aversion to setting clear success measures for internal projects which leads to failures on many levels that are not acknowledged, addressed or corrected.
- The high performers are overburdened and the underperforming favorites are given the opportunities to take on large stretch assignments. When they inevitably do not deliver, the work/responsibilities are passed on to the high performers to clean up or take the blame OR the project is abandoned all together without acknowledgement or lessons learned from the failure.
- Work life balance is poor for high performers. Low performers are rarely coached nor are deficiencies addressed . They are allowed to stay and some times are promoted which is the opposite of meritocracy.
- Management will hire subject matter experts but will not listen to them if it does not align with their personal agendas.
- Politics runs rampant and is difficult to navigate. This is due to the lack of accountability and tendency to give in to big egos or insecurities."
1664,Red Hat,Best Place I've Ever Worked,2017-11-15,5.0,Technical Writer,"- Wonderful environment where your coworkers actually listen to you!
- Freedom to shape your career into what you want it to be.
- Quarterly bonuses are fantastic..
- Intelligent, collaborative, and fun coworkers.
- Fantastic work/life balance.
- People say thank you. I feel appreciated.","I love Red Hat, but it's not for everyone. The freedom to say what you think and be heard means that Red Hat can be chaotic and difficult. Sometimes, it's hard to move forward because everyone has an opinion. Still, I wouldn't work anywhere else.
Some of the managers are young and inexperienced, so you may have to be patient with them. They seem to be open to learning and growing though."
1665,Red Hat,The world's foremost open source company,2017-11-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Red Hat is an enterprise software vendor unique for its commitment to open source software, employing many experts across foundational technologies. It's incredibly common to meet engineers who are brilliant yet humble, ""I work on (the Linux kernel/GNOME/glibc), no big deal"" that it's easy to forget that most companies don't have this level of talent. This is frequently because the best engineers are so dedicated to open source that they wouldn't consider working for anyone less committed than Red Hat.

Engineers are given wide latitude to work with the community and write high-quality code, even if it takes a long time. Depending on your role and responsibilities, working hours are flexible and remote work is common, which is an ideal situation if you have young children. Associates are encouraged to provide feedback on company-wide mailing lists and the subscription business model leads to predictable revenues and therefore consistent profit-sharing bonuses.","If you're not in one of the major offices like Raleigh, you can expect to be sidelined to some extent, unless you're in a role that includes travel to HQ regularly. I don't think this is intentional; just the usual ""out of sight, out of mind"" situation.

In many ways, working at Red Hat is like being at a non-profit: strong mission (devotion to open source), less stress than other companies, diverse workforce, but lower compensation than industry peers. The projects that Red Hat initiates are usually poorly-managed and chronically underfunded, so they are usually quietly discontinued after some time. Red Hat works best when contributing to projects that other companies are leading, such as Kubernetes and Docker, but that limits growth opportunities and reduces the value proposition of its products.

Despite the talk of transparency and openness, many leaders simply don't want to hear dissenting opinions (hey, it's human nature), so encouraging open dialog often results in employees unknowingly stunting their own career development by speaking out."

Many of the office facilities are great.,"I believed in Red Hat so strongly before I joined, but in my time there, I have unfortunately experienced a truly shocking level of mismanagement. I've seen many examples of career development being withheld from extremely and demonstrably talented and dedicated individuals, and given to the utterly unqualified, because of petty vendettas or personal relationships. Asking an awkward question about a policy or making an unwelcome criticism about a project can often mean the end, or indefinite stagnation, of an otherwise promising career. Many if not all of my contributions, even when made voluntarily at great personal sacrifice, go unrecognised and unappreciated.  Many of my colleagues are neglected and overworked. Conversely, those with friends in the right places are sometimes promoted for no reason, and can get away with anything. I am extremely saddened to have had this experience at Red Hat, of all the companies in the world Red Hat is not the one I would expect it from.

Red Hat right now still enjoys a good reputation in the OS space but as this is now dropping hugely in the world of containers and Cloud where the OS layer is nowhere near as important it's going to be a fight and it's both technology and fiduciary and I worry for their relevance positioning. 
Good offices, good remote worker support and good HR team who were utterly caned by the idiot former CFO who thought he could repeat Cisco and make this a fit company.","Thankfully the utterly incompetent CFO is now gone but a HUGE amount of poor middle management and regional directors remain. The board need to start culling people. Now, not in 18 months and only taking a look at themselves and seeing where strategic management has failed will breed new innovative repeatable success. Broken processes (Compass ha... yes thats an utter joke) and other platforms fail to deliver to an overpaid Head of HR globally.

1822,Red Hat,A mixed bag (engineering perspective),2017-02-14,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Rare opportunity to get paid to work on genuine open source projects.  Some very smart people.  Most customers are smarter than average too.

Some technical staff are given huge latitude to pursue their own paths within open source communities.

The bureaucracy is present, as at any large US company, but rarely gets worse than a bit of benevolent clumsiness.","The company is deeply divided and siloed between the traditional RHEL product and the myriad other product lines brought in via acquisitions.  There are continual management initiatives to try and build bridges but they're usually of the ""pointy haired"" variety and go nowhere.  Every 6 months there's a new ""common framework for X"" project, and another such project quietly dies.

There is a culture of cheapness, from placing offices in lesser-known towns, to constantly delaying salary cycles, to even asking some staff to share hotel rooms.

Groups that are supposed to span the silos, like docs and testing (which red hat insists on calling ""QE"") are weak -- the docs guys are good but too few in number, the testing guys are mostly junior hires who are given more work than they can reasonably be expected to handle.

Basically, it's a place you can carve out a very comfortable and interesting niche if you want, but to do so you have to be able to tune out the sound of all the chaos and waste around you."

Poor leadership in the field around customer and sales engagement understanding Red Hat's place in the bigger ecosystem.

1829,Red Hat,Sales,2017-02-08,4.0,Sales Representative,Great culture and people.,"Some growing pains. 
Unrealistic goals"
1830,Red Hat,Great place to work as a software engineer,2017-02-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- You get to work with the best engineers in the industry
- Everyone is very helpful
- Very high on transparency
- Open organization: You get to share your views with everyone and also question/appreciate decisions taken by others(this is the best part of Red Hat)","- US centric company(Almost all of leadership/management team in US). If you are from other timezones, you have to adjust meetings/discussions according to US timezone.
- Weak management. A engineer centric company."
1831,Red Hat,Went from great to average in 8+ years,2017-02-07,3.0,Principal Software Engineer,"- A pro that doesn't have a caveat is hard to come up with. 
- Remote friendly for the most part, but don't expect travel dollars.
- Newly created ESPP (better late than never and the result of equity grants being eviscerated)
- Benefits relatively standard. Nothing sticks out. 
- Opensource,  although you can work in opensource in many companies
- Lots of training available. If you are at a site, you can get all the training/certifications you want for free as long as the classroom has space. But there are no travel dollars for this. If you are remote, this is somewhat of a con. There is a fairly large amount of online training, but nothing that will lead to a cert.
- Smart tech people, but there are smart people everywhere. 
- The shutdown days have been made into company holidays, so you don't have to burn PTO and essentially get 4 more days off. The con on this is that if you carry over PTO into the following year, you must use it by Feb 15th. If you don't use it, you lose it. Yeah, this is actually a con for many people.
- Easy to get promoted up to senior level. Promotions are a dime a dozen at the lower levels. Everybody gets promoted.  I've seen some people get promoted who really shouldn't be. Principal level is harder, but the domain you work in can make the principal promotion easier. For example you would have to almost be Torvald's deputy to get a principal promotion in kernel space.  See cons.","- Equity grants practically non-existent now. No longer have a new hire grant. Retention grants may hit 1 out of 10 employees now and they are so small as to be about $2000 in stock per year. Likely the driver for the new ESPP program.
- Many management new hires from large behemoth companies. They don't fit here and have created a management versus worker mentality rather than the previous one team mentality. It's ironic because they bring the stuff that didn't work from their old jobs and make Red Hat like the company they left. The ""old-timers"" who have been promoted to management still walk the talk, but are pressured by these new people and all the junk/process they bring with them.
- Strange PTO policy. After 5 years you get 3 more days, 10 years another 3 more. 
- There is favoritism. Buddies get the promotions, the money, and the opportunities.
- Low pay. No formal salary merit increase policy. Your salary used to be reviewed every June, but no more. Seems to be just whenever your manager feels like it. So if you have a cost cutting penny pincher new hire manager from one of those large companies, chances are you won't see an increase and are underpaid. I've heard it may be an 18 mo cycle now, but haven't seen evidence that it's in operation. Besides why 18 months versus a standard 12 month year?
-  There is talk that the bonus could go the way of the equity grants.  Sounds like something Frank would want and since he is gone now,  this may not materialize.
- No promotion path after principal. Very few senior principals+ in engineering and non-existent in the support side of the house. The unfortunate result is there is no career path after principal. I've seen quite a few top level people (committers and the like) leave and this along with the other cons is why (particularly the culture change from the new managers).
- Used to get the tools to do our jobs. No longer do development/tech employees get workstations. You used to get a laptop and a workstation, but no longer. You get a laptop. The result is people self fund their hardware. Likely the change was some great idea from one of the new managers."

As with everything, individual experiences may differ, but I dare say that the overwhelming majority of people really enjoy working for Red Hat. 
There is  a lot of opportunity to learn, in form of courses, tech talks, and the likes. (not enough time to take full advantage of it though...)
Stress levels will very much depend on your department or team. For me, it was always manageable, and I dare say most other people feel the same.","I keep reading about low salaries. While it's true that salaries are certainly on the lower end, I don't understand the whinge about it: you know that before you sign on the dotted line. More importantly at least for me: The amazing culture and work life balance more than made up for any doller that I might have been sacrificing. You have to think about your priorities. 

I also keep hearing and reading about the culture going downhill. Again, there is some truth in that, too. Keep in mind though that Red Hat has grown immensely over the last decade. Changes are inevitable. Not everybody can deal with change. Interestingly enough, all the new-ish employees still think that Red Hat is a fantastic place to work at. Bottom-line is: Yes, it has changed, and become more corporate, but it is still a pretty damn awesome place to work at."

Also feedback Pattern on Glassdoor, if you see 1 bad review then you see 3 or 4 good reviews immediately shared and I have doubt it could be manager or specific team manipulated.

Red Hat Pune is dying ... Managers are the culprit... hence now it is not a good place to work.

People request you to take negative feedback's positively and if you know anyone at Red Hat, kindly confirm with them before joining do ask about the manager you are going to join. I can name some Managers but Glassdoor wouldn't allow.

Over a mere 18 months, many of the company's brightest leaders were driven out of the organization and replaced by big company groupthinkers who tried to apply a huge company bureaucracy to a thriving, unique mid-sized company in growth phase. In addition, this leadership has actively eliminated US jobs and shipped the work to India.

Possibility of career growth.","The career growth is not guided, that is you need to push for most fo the things yourself. Nobody is slowing the progress down, but nobody really tries to help you progress on their own as well. 
Some of the managers were ex-developers and are not really cut out to be people managers. Those people are then difficult to replace, but they send out a negative ""vibe"". Luckily those are mostly exceptions and not a rule by a long shot."

Overall RH is a very fast growing company and the brand name opens many doors.

1880,Red Hat,Great place to work overall but some true cons as well.,2016-11-17,3.0,Senior Marketing Manager,The people and the culture.,"Managers get little direction from the VPs and CLT and it impacts everyone negatively.

Competitive Dental & Medical Benefits 
Fair 401k matching 
Most facilities are nice 
Many friendly co-workers
Good brand equity in market","Red Hat has changed quite a bit since I initially started. While some of the changes are positive, many are not. I work in sales in a remote location in the US. The environment in my current office is similar to a 3 ring circus. Employees are being paid to surf the internet most of the day. It's common to see folks watching movies or TV shows full screen during the work day. There is no HR or oversight in this office, so management in Raleigh turns a blind eye to the productivity with a ""out of sight, out of mind"" mindset. This can be demoralizing for employees who want to come in and do a good job, because there are no tangible consequences for bad behavior, which is essentially the same as condoning said behavior. 

On a macro level, I've noticed there seem to be some subtle but visible negative changes in terms of budgeting that have trickled down. For example, many US teams workloads or the team itself are being moved to Pune. This change had diminished quality and accessibility of work formerly done by teams in Raleigh due to time zone differences, etc. I've also noticed more roles being outsources to CGS and SSI as a cost saving effort versus keeping those roles in-house with Red Hat. 

Management and Execs present the facade of open communication and transparency with employees, because they want to preserve their exorbitant paychecks. Meanwhile, the standard company merit cycle appears to have been abolished or suspended? The cycle is supposed to be every 12-18 months. Salaries at RH are already on the lower end for the market, and now I've been waiting 18 months for a standard salary adjustment. With COL and inflation, Red Hat is creating a retention risk for high caliber employees by not opening a merit salary increase window within a reasonable amount of time. I am at the 18 month mark, which they say is the longest interval, and still don't know when and if the raises will happen. 

Lastly, Red Hat seems to be hiring a lot of folks from major companies that are now experiencing frequent layoffs, e.g. , HPE, IBM, Oracle etc. This is fine; however, Red Hat recruiting and the managers don't appear to be looking for 'quality' candidates. Just because someone has a big name on their resume doesn't make them a cultural fit or a high quality employee. This is particularly evident with Red Hat's choice of managers. My team has a manager who prior to Red Hat had ZERO management experience. The training they appear to have received on how to effectively manage people is minimal, but no one seems to be providing guidance on how to properly manage the team."

1959,Red Hat,Enterprise Account Executive,2016-07-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The smartest people in the world work here. 

Small company culture, open source proponent which forms grass roots of company culture and following for the who's who of the full stack open source enterprise solutions universe. 

Small voices echo far in this company. Even the smallest idea or concern makes its way far beyond bare metal, chatter, through virtual environments, email correspondence, escaping corporate gravity in true open source fashion to reach the humble kernel at the heart of Red Hat. 

Red Hat, just as its portfolio of solutions for the enterprise proves to be a company poised to georeplicate itself tick by tick with clockwork reliability and intricate focus to detail just as it has since inception of the binary clock. Astonishing as to its pace but with its rules of business clearly defined, the company remains true to itself, honest in its value proposition, to its people, and to its open source roots.   

When I joined company, the company's main campus was still located deep inside the tech triangle in Raleigh, NC, remaining on college campus, deeply engrained in the advancement of education. Red Hat has adhered to its meager beginnings in the sponsorship of upstream communities which transfers to the familiarity and name association within the linux base as well as most other open source communities. The company has grown by leaps and bounds restructuring upon acquisitions and new product/service/support additions to its already impressive portfolio well as to accommodate for the diverse, emerging, and ever growing vastness of both the physical and virtual worlds.

Red Hats's sales support, pre sales, and sales enablement personnel include some of the broadest spectrum of intricately knowledged solutions architects, consultants, TAM's, and sales ops that the world has yet to produce. They take ownership to a whole new level in terms of their company, what they do everyday in most cases is far beyond the standard call of duty. 

I had many of chances to work with some of the founders and minds responsible for some of the ideas and acquisitions that have become part of Red Hat over time. Most of which have stayed on as direct segment product marketing managers and specialized Solutions Architects who are called on to educate, drive product innovation, assure cross platform functionality, to promote ongoing upstream innovation as to support the huge demand of the downstream enterprise market. 

Personality runs rampant through this company, specialized, prideful, and dedicated to inspire and be inspired. The worlds knowledge of Red Hat and overall opinion of the company is evidence of this. Yet Red Hat, although a household name in most shops is a refreshing twist toward modern day take on brand valuation. Never did I get the sense that that I was peddling a namesake or another service that was run of the mill. The internal support that I received always became a team effort when interacting with my clients. A hands on deck. no holds barred approach toward their needs. A win win for everyone and what a great feeling!

Sales are both direct and through the many channel partnerships which helps to give customers as well as teams span contractual confines, aid in pricing and sku flexibility, and better negotiate procurement constraints. There are also embedded software/hardware offerings through OEM markets which round the book, altogether the base of the pyramid in this well structured company provide even keel, a well defined course, agility, and capacity to stay nimble even through tumultuous growth and demanding times.","With every company there is change, patience is key, voice is necessary. Not really a con but within a company who employs some of the smartest people in the world, sets the curve for which standards of new technologies are based and expected to adhere to, the knowledge base is enormous and the pace is intense. I guess the con for me was the wanton will to want to know as much as possible. Word of advice. Be as good as you can at every aspect of your role, be known and take pride in what you are good at, volunteer yourself for opportunities, know the who's who of the company and what they are good at, learn from interactions (the good and the bad), build relationships, and stay on top of your resources."

1982,Red Hat,Open Organization Culture,2016-05-24,2.0,Solution Architect,Red Hat's open culture has a lot going for it in that many ideas do flow freely around the organization.,"However, ""open ideas"" are often vague and not targeted where they can do the most good. They often felt like they were just tossed to the wind, where a few interested advocates would tear them apart. Then they would die and be reborn several months later. Very little closure. 

I actually found teams to be more closed than other organizations I have worked with. My feeling is that emphasis on openness and meritocracy chokes out ideas that are specific and well-founded, but not quite baked. Less assertive team members are effectively silenced by others clamoring for attention. Daily incentives are heavily biased toward individuals and there is very little alignment or teamwork."

The director and several managers have no experience in documentation at all, which leads to a ton of quality and team management issues. Additionally, not a single manager has any real people management experience, which has created problems with low-performing employees, retaining (and recognizing) high quality employees, and recruiting, hiring, and training. This creates an atmosphere were senior writers, particularly, are overworked and stressed, and the doc team has a poor reputation with other groups.

Raleigh is great and Red Hat is worldwide.  I was lucky enough to do some international work which was fantastic - I was even able to arrange relocation to the UK when I married a Brit.  I built some of the best friendships I could have asked for and still keep in touch with several folks worldwide.  I'd definitely love to come back if the right offer came along some day but for now I've been lured away by cashy hipster startups.",Red Hat has become less of a tech company and more of a sales company.  Unfortunately that means leadership sometimes takes the technical people in directions that they lack understanding of.  The latest acquisition or focus may be something that is technically infeasable or out of Red Hat's expertise which leads to the company being spread a little thin at times.  Also salary packages are fantastic but they can't always keep up with trendy startups these days.  Sometimes Red Hat's Open Source stream feels backwards - it's difficult to explain to a customer how they've paid for enterprise support on hardened supported Red Hat products containing bugs that were fixed in community releases a year ago.  Just make sure you pick a few products and learn them inside and out.

- All Salary is fixed, insurance, shift allowance (huge amount particularly for night shift) is really good
- Location is great..
- Certification are free (provided your manager approves them - big catch). All depends on how good your relation with your manager and who your manager is... (what king of person he/she is..)
- Exposure to Red Hat product stack, especially emerging Technologies in the form of Technical meetups. This exposure is only undestanding of the product from industry scope and not from implementation perspective. But still to learn something, you need to know about it..","- If you are an Experienced professional  from System Admin background and particularly hired for Technical Support Roles (Global Support Services), and your main passion in life is Highest degree of Technical Growth in multiple vendor Technologies like Linux, VMware, VCS, VxVM, Cloud, then Red Hat GSS is not the correct place for you. I have give Red Hat Pune a 
2 star rating (2 out of 5) mainly for this point. Incase you are looking for stability and peace in life with high Brand value (Red Hat), then it is 4 out of 5..

- If your designation has ""support"" keyword in it, you will not get access to servers. Since Support roles are mainly to provide Technical Support and not system Admin support. Please understand this very carefully.

- In Technical Support Role you will get high degree of exposure to few components of OS,
so if you stay in Red Hat for more than 2 years, then your value for Red Hat will increase exponentially, but your value for Industry will reduce. As an example, Industry needs a 5 - 6 years experience System Admin to have exposure to multiple vendor products, server hardware knowledge, Scripting, automation exp, Clustering HA exp, VMware exposure. But being in Red Hat (vendor) you will only get exposure to Red Hat product stack, but that also in a few components, as the Teams are divided on per component basis (example Kernel Team, Ldap team, services team etc..

- No formal training provided. As is for US employees when they join in probation period..

- cultural divide between US employees and India Employees. 

- NO - onsite what so ever. if you ask manager, they may get stunned and may stun you..

Limited career progression opportunities as the company prefers to hire externally rather than promote from within. Career development conversations are often discouraged. No performance reviews so advancement is based on personal relationships rather than achievement. People managers often lack skills to effectively manage diverse personality types. No method for individual contributors to provide feedback or evaluation of their managers which can create challenging environments. Little transparency around compensation decisions. Familiarity with, or willingness to use, open source desktop productivity tools not required. No longer offering equity program to all employees leads to teams with some members who receive equity bonus compensation and some who do not."

This model allows them to hire thousands of software engineers who work on upstream open source projects.","For me, very little. Most of the reviews on here that mark working for red hat as unsatisfactory, are likely to be sales / services personal, who find it hard to adjust to the culture (having had former careers at IBM, Oracle etc).

No vision, just do what told by people that know less than you

2046,Red Hat,Political minefield - be careful and watch your back,2016-02-17,3.0,Services,Market leader in Linux. This opens a lot of doors. Most people are really excellent to work with. Strong sales force in the UK.  RHEL and Linux is really the company strength. All of the other technologies are poor relations. Pay was good.,"Red Hat UK and EMEA is riddled with management who really have no idea what they are doing, especially on the Services side. People have been promoted from within without any real ideal of what they are doing, or what good looks like. EMEA Services Directors have come up from the ranks with no experience of other companies, and as Red Hat grows this is a massive problem. There is a massive blame culture and infighting amongst the divisions. The Services management team seem to have a pathological hatred of the sales team, which is ridiculous and divisive. There is no sense of a wider team, so everyone is scoring points.  When speaking to VP levels, there is acknowledgement of the lack of skill and experience in other divisions, but their advice is to accept this and know when to run. 

If you are looking at working in Services as a consultant, be prepared for long long hours, endless travel and no development. You are a resource, that is all. Don't expect your Service Delivery Manager to pay you any attention either. You are better off as a contractor unless you want Red Hat on your CV."

Tremendous career opportunities including ability to work outside of your proven ""comfort zone""","Can be difficult to maneuver through change, growing pains,"
2051,Red Hat,Things to keep in mind before you join Red Hat,2016-02-09,3.0,Technical Support Engineer,"1) I was in GSS :- Best learning involved with regards to lab resources and peer to peer learning across all locations.

2) After working here for sometime, I realized the message of the Kung Fu Panda movie :- ""There is no secret ingredient"" . The stuffs anyone doing at Red Hat (Pune) could have been done in the current role outside Red Hat. Just that one does not believe enough. The good part definitely is exposure to good issues most of the times.

3) Lunch is chargeable @Rs. 50/-. All other items are free (morning snacks, evening snacks, tea, cold drinks, other edibles and dinner as well.

4) Excellent work life balance.

5) Free pick up and drop if you are in shifts.","1)  Managers/Supervisors :- If you are joining GSS (Global Support Services), then be very very careful from the expectations of the job profile for the frontliner role (i.e ATSE,TSE, STSE, PTSE roles). The assistance from manager is only in words and they never care to fulfill them. Managers here only want you to pick up cases from the new case queue OR/AND give some non sensical session on any technical topic so that their name is there on the monthly Ops review session that under x supervisor , associate y gave some training. In simple terms, you have a manager/supervisor who can do harm but no good. Also most of the managers are non technical and fail to comprehend the engineers' feedback.

2) Bonus :- You have a system of quarterly bonus. Its actually 10% annually which comes out to be 2.5% for a quarter. Now, if you close more than 80-90 cases per month for all the months in a quarter ONLY then you may expect to receive a bonus of 100%. This 100% is again in proportion to what your team is entitled to. So for example, after a quarter's end, a team is entitled to only 90% of the bonus (given the fact that the team closed less number of cases) so the associate who worked like a superman/bahubali shall actually receive  comparatively  a lesser share of 100% of the team's 90% as opposed to him receiving 100% of 100% of the team.

3)  People :- There are some old players (basically TSEs and STSEs) who are technically not worthy of their positions and always cry about their ""low salaries"".  However, these people have good influence over the leadership (strictly at the supervisor level only). Out of 100, there are ONLY AND NOT MORE THAN 5-7 people on an average who are worth interacting.

4) Salary :- Depends upon how you fair up in the interview and the requirement of the position. I've heard that Red Hat Pune is expanding but the new hires are getting lesser salary than the ones hired as recent as 6 months back. Usually they do not offer more than 30% and in some cases worse.

5)  Quality of the associates :- Average or worse. Roughly, there would be only 1 or max 2 persons in any team 
who would be just about good for answering questions of any level of complexity for cases in their respective queue . Rest all others are a shameless.

6) Other :-
a) Supervisors here all the time want their associates to give exhaustive sessions for the entire Pune region. Sometimes (infact most of the times) this approach is meaningless.
b) No onsite opportunities.
c) You can't use MSoffice or windows.
d) You have to jump in all issues of any complexity at any given moment."

The Open Organization is a complete sham, that book has zero to do with how things actually work day in and day out at Red Hat. Meritocracy is great in theory but is just not practiced, that is such a shame. 
At Red Hat it's not what you know, but really who you know, especially sales management! If you think hard work gets you to the top, think again.  Complaining and being seen as a possible HR threat will get you promoted faster than anything.

The tools used for collaboration (IRC, mass email lists on ancient email clients, etc) could be a lot better, but there doesn't seem to be any push to invest in it, despite the productivity gains it would provide.  The decentralized nature of the teams can also lead to challenges to working across products."
2073,Red Hat,Great company with lots of opportunities,2015-12-27,5.0,UK Field Role,"Excellent atmosphere. Red Hat is a large company but still seems to retain some of the smaller start-up culture it started out with. If you come to RHT don't expect handouts or to be led along, it's a company for driven individuals where great communication skills and resourcefulness are rewarded.",As the company grows it's attracting individuals who aren't exactly the right-fit. As a result the culture is being negatively affected. There's also some pay issues. The market rate for roles is completely out of alignment with some of the people who've been around at RHT for a number of years and have ascended within the company. This results in the attrition of people who are offered a significant increase in their current salary to move elsewhere. These are key people at RHT and losing them costs the company more than the difference in their current salary to the market rate.

2076,Red Hat,Great people & great culture,2015-12-14,4.0,Director,"There are great people here - my colleagues are some of the smartest and most passionate people I've ever worked with. They are at Red Hat for more than just a paycheck - they care about something bigger than themselves. The culture of transparency and collaboration is a refreshing change from ""traditional"" Fortune 500 companies. The opportunities are endless to do challenging, exciting, and valuable work. You don't have to take a traditional career path here. It's nice to work at a company where the collective energy is so positive.","Some aspects of the culture aren't scaling well with the rapid growth and it can be a bit chaotic. Despite a focus on collaboration, many people are surprisingly slow to let go of tribal knowledge and contribute to collective/shared knowledge and work. Not every department has the same feeling of collaboration or trust in their own people and/or other departments."

Like ""how did I ever get hired here""? The great part is that you're now part of an honest to goodness community that wants to help you succeed. The ""open culture"" that you're scoffing at right now is the real deal inside of Red Hat. If you are willing to learn, the opportunities are pretty endless. I'm also a remote employee and that's working out well...Red Hat does that piece right.","Not a company for people who need someone holding their hands to get things done. There's collaboration and then there's being dead weight. If you need constant supervision or have a thin skin, this might not be the place for you."

2090,Red Hat,Red Hat Summer Intern,2015-12-08,5.0,,"Red Hat was a great place to spend the summer as an intern.  They work hard to make sure that the work you do as an intern is a learning experience and adds actual value to the team you are working with.  They also have a great internship program in terms of making sure that all the interns get to know one another, hosting special events specifically for the intern cohort, and giving you opportunities to meet current employees at Red Hat.",There were no cons from my summer at Red Hat.

The culture used to be very ""Opensource"" and some what laid back, fun and you could express what you felt whenever you wanted.  Really had to explain, but it made people work even harder.  Now, Red Hat is turning into an IBM, Oracle, MS.....big IT company culture which is sad but has to happen being a publicly traded company.  Bringing in so many ex-""Big company IT"" into management has really ruined the OpenSource culture that made Red Hat what it is today. CompPlans are also reflecting those of IBM, Oracle, MS."

Whether it is your first company out of college or your 5th company as an industry veteran, you'll find all you're looking for here.",Nothing is handed to you. Work for what you want.

Supportive, albeit changing (see cons), management chain and it's not a call center role like most other support jobs. You're called an engineer (as opposed to a technician) because you actually get your hands dirty with the technology. Beyond that it looks fantastic on a resume.



CEO cares about the technology behind the company, will randomly drop in on internal mailing list threads getting his nerd on talking about having to compile projects from source for his personal uses.","- If you're good at what you do you'll advance quickly but then it stagnates, the pay is easily 15% below average (or lower). At the end of the day, it is still a support job so it can get monotonous.


Biggest con however is it is losing the ""open culture"" feel that Red Hat is known for as it gets bigger. Management is slowly transforming into the traditional ""top-down do as I say because I say so"" model as they bring in outside management instead of promoting from within."
2099,Red Hat,Post sales services,2015-11-29,5.0,Senior Technical Support Engineer,"Culture and corevalues - freedom, courage, commitment, and accountability. 
Our colleague engineers are smart and clever people with passion for <span class='highlightTerm'>open source</span> technology. I enjoy spending my time both at office and remote.

2102,Red Hat,"""Nice Resume""",2015-11-23,2.0,,Having Red Hat on your job resume.,"The management especially within IT are so out of touch with their employees.  They pretend to care about development with things like ""Compass"", but nothing ever comes from it.  In fact, the managers just push through it for HR.  Expect to keep the pay you get when you first start.  There aren't a lot of opportunities for advancement and most of IT will throw you under the bus to make themselves look better.  The CEO is also out of touch."
2103,Red Hat,Not as innovative as they think,2015-11-20,2.0,Solutions Architect,"Good customers, mostly good folk.","Zealots, not ready to sell any deeper into the enterprise. They take criticism poorly. Hire experienced people, then expect you to sit at a bottom rung until you reach their ideal."

Any initiative will be good before proved bad. Negative attitude is not tolerated.",Red Hat is growing so fast that internal processes and tools as not able to cope properly. This is being reviewed but it take far too long to implement.
2105,Red Hat,Generally good,2015-11-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is little of the overly-rigid rule following that very large companies (IBM, Intel, HP) tend to exhibit.  There is also relatively little of the religious self-belief that some more recent companies (Apple, Facebook, Google) suffer from.

Most of the people at Red Hat have a good attitude and are pretty easy to get along with.  Red Hat is very flexible in accommodating the needs of remote workers (many of the developers are remote).","The culture is in an awkward transitional phase between small and large company.  There is an extremely vocal minority of old timers who tend to react sceptically (to put it mildly) to new initiatives.

Red Hat salaries tend to be on the low side compared with US/pacific computer companies, and Red Hat does not tend to issue much stock (if any).

Many engineering staff are still working on old projects that they are very personally invested in, and it can be very hard to get people transferred to new work.

The travel policy is a little austere, as the company tries to control the costs of sending hundreds of engineers to large recurring open source conferences. 

In engineering, the best experience comes from starting your project (open source or startup) before joining Red Hat: many projects have long happy later lives at Red Hat, but not so many were started there."

2154,Red Hat,Avoid consulting,2015-08-16,2.0,Associate Consultant,"- There is a lot to learn and some of the senior consultants will do their best to take you under their wing and teach you everything they know.
- There is a lot of room to grow here professionally. If you are constantly on short stent projects you will learn a lot in a very short time, much more than other jobs
- Travel can be a plus, especially in the short term.","- Salary is below market and expect to be making what you started with until you leave. If they like you they will give you stock every 6 months but it is only to try and retain you as it vests a little every year.
- They seem to be a lot more focused on people who are good at BSing to clients than those who are excellent coders and get work done. There is a lot of favoritism toward the first half so the doers tend to get screwed over and treated like crap while the others get promoted straight up the chain.
- Work-life balance is extremely poor, especially if you are traveling. You should expect to live out of a suit case for most of the time you work here and expect to be putting in long hours all the time as Red Hat tends to take on very demanding clients.
- It is very easy to get lost in the system. I ended up on a project where the client kept extending my contract and because of that my managers seemed to forget about me. I no longer had my yearly review, salary discussions, etc. It was also impossible to get off of the project because it was bringing in too much revenue despite the fact I wasn't learning anything and was completely bored.
- Getting promoted is next to impossible unless you are a favorite"

2174,Red Hat,"99% awesome, 1% room for improvement",2015-07-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company culture: Love the people I work with to pieces. I have the BEST manager. Laid-back culture (i.e., my managers don't care how or where we do our work as long as we get it done--well). Freedom, courage and accountability are the company's touted core values--a lot of it is also about transparency and openness (duh). Also, it's the first and only company I've ever worked at that gave me the impression that the C-level types actually care what we think. Policies are often made/changed based on solicited employee feedback.

Good benefits: Quarterly bonuses, stock shares are often doled out as a bonus, 401k, etc. etc. 

Beer and food: Plenty of events with beer and wine. And food. Lots and lots of food.

In-house cafeteria: It's more of a cafe/grill. The salad bar is wonderful. Pizza is, meh. Sandwiches are pretty good, and they toast them for you if you want. I hear the entrees are usually wonderful, as are the soups. There are also tons of amazing places to eat all around the building within walking distance. 

Game room: Next to the cafe is a game room with pool table, ping pong tables, foosball, video game consoles, couches, air hockey...and even whiteboards, so you can work and play at the same time if needed.

ATM: In-house ATM (CFCU).

Gym: 10th floor has a gym--one room dedicated mostly to free weights and Nautilus-type machines, the other with treadmills, elliptical machines, stair climbers, etc. The gym has shower/changing rooms, too, and lockers.

Wellness and nursing rooms: Rooms are available on several floors for nursing mothers and for anyone who needs a time out.

Parking garage: Never have to walk out to your car in the rain.

WFH: Some people, depending on your manager, can work from home some. Varies from group to group.","Salary: Unless you're an engineer or marketing manager and such, don't expect to get the top salary in your local area's range. But a lot of times they make up for it in benefits--especially bonuses.

Expense reimbursement: All of a sudden, bam, they started pushing back on it without any warning or heads up, so people are getting burned. This sucks big time and people are pissed. Also, in general the penny-pinching efforts lately are annoying, especially when certain groups get seemingly bottomless corporate cards to spend on extravagant dinners and trips while others have to turn in their parking garage cards and get burned on expenses and can't travel much, etc. 

Some politics: It's not immune to a few asshats who want to ruin it for the rest of us with their petty politics and BS. But for the most part, people don't subscribe to that stuff.

Parking garage: The con is that it's also a public garage, so sometimes you drive for a while looking for a space."

2179,Red Hat,PSE - Fantastic right up until I terminated Red Hat,2015-07-14,4.0,Principal Software Engineer,"I worked at RHT 9 years.

Red Hat at one time was a place where you had ultimate freedom to define your own career.  When I first started and in to about my 7th year I had 100% autonomy.  That all changed, and is one of the major motivators in me departing.  I am not sure if this was a one off or a company-wide trend.

The management team for the most part is competent and looks out for the staff.

There are lots of bright people at Red Hat, especially in the OpenStack BU where I worked.  Red Hat has the best OpenStack development team in the world, so if that is your focus, there is no better place to land.

I learned significantly on Red Hat's dime, especially about team leadership.  I'm not sure any other company would have supported my learning experience as effectively.  Clearly we can't rerun that experiment ;)

Red Hat has a fantastic IRC and mailing list culture designed to implement a globally distributed engineering workforce.  This is its greatest pro, especially if you work from home.","I thought the pay was solid after racking up 8+ years of core+ RSU awards at the PSE level.  I honestly didn't think I could earn more, and Cisco offered 100k more total comp (although the job has slightly more responsibility).  So I guess the pay is bad, even for highly experienced people, although I can hardly complain - my total comp has 5*'ed in the last 10 years.

Red Hat at the PSE and above level is highly political even in engineering, which is fine - its like that everywhere, but if your expecting some daisy dream of no political behavior because Red Hat has open source roots, forget about it.

Red Hat values internal influence more then external influence mainly because many if its staff have wide influence over a variety of communities through their actions.  Internal influence is highly regarded as a result and highly guarded as well.

As Red Hat becomes larger, some managers are out of their depth.  In 99% of cases, a manager will do the right thing for the right reason.  Then there is the 1% action that results in a terrible outcome that is a mistake even a rookie manager wouldn't dare make.

Red Hat believes in the 1:25 philosophy so if you need much hand holding this isn't the place for you.

To keep on top of the system, you have to perform, which may mean long hours especially if ramping up on new tech."

At this point I've have handed in my resignation. Trust goes both ways. They eventually went back to the original enterprise bargaining and were not required to ask for the extra half hour work.

Lesser probability to regress in your career. You may get the opportunity to work on emerging tech.

Scope to grow and assume more responsibilities as the company is still not mature in it's practices.","No credible growth opportunities. This shows in willingness to hire for positions from outside rather than grow people into roles.

The organization has been through a period where employees were compensated poorly and still continue to be. Newer employees would easily out-earn existing ones. Don't stay here beyond a few years as it would be fiscally irresponsible. Also note this in the context of no growth opportunities.

Average quality of employees. A few stars here and there. But the rest are simply average or below average. Not everyone in the open source community is great to hire, and sometimes the company forgets this.

Lack of appreciation for viable business models. Some projects exist for the sake of vanity of the project leads, with no viable business model behind them. If there is any model in the rare event, it is involves legacy systems and solutions used by customers. Competitors outshine this so-called stalwart of opensource when it comes to sponsoring and releasing projects with customer validation.

Late to advances in various fields and resting of former laurels. The management is coasting along on achievements of the past, and on revenue earned from migrating legacy systems that were formerly revenue earners for competitors."

Secondly, applying to be a consultant straight out of undergrad is a completely different beast than applying with previous consulting experience.

-You get to learn a lot about corporate structure and different technology stacks by visiting multiple client sites
-The consultants that last more than a year are actually really great people
-You really do have the opportunity to climb the promotion ladder as high as you want
-Everyone assumes Red Hat consulting has the same talent standards as Red Hat engineering so it looks fantastic on your resume
-Management actually trusts their consultants immensely
-You work closely with some of the worlds top infrastructure technologies
-Red Hat certification exams are highly accessible and paid for","-The majority of our revenue comes from long-term staff augmentation contracts with huge corporations who can't hire their own talent
-Most consultants (especially straight out of college) are sent on 1-3 years of staff augmentation jobs before they're considered ready to actually consult on short term engagements with interesting clients. You may be stuck at the same client site for up to two years.
-You are a slave to the client. The severity varies widely between clients, but vacation time needs to be approved by the client, how you contribute to the team is determined by the client, and when you're expected to work late nights and weekends is determined by the client.
-Revenue numbers rule all: As a billable entity, your needs are frequently swept under the rug so the money keeps coming in.
-Contracts frequently mention that we are all 40hr/week employees which sounds great until you realize that just means we can't bill the client for all the overtime that is actually required but not talked about.
-Training time is offered ...with no time to take it because you're billable (i.e. you can't take any vacation this quarter if you're going on a training)
-Career advancement falls completely on the responsibility of the consultant to study outside the working hours of the client. If you only spend 40-50 hours a week on your career you will never get ahead.
-You get a special ""people manager"" who is responsible for your career advancement, but chances are they will have no time for you. The position is overworked and a low priority to fix.
-Because you're stuck on client site all week, if you ever want to interact with other Red Hat employees, you must do that on your own time."
2209,Red Hat,Great place to work,2015-06-01,5.0,,You'll gain invaluable learning experience working at Red Hat. The people here are also very smart and helpful.,The only con I can think of is the lack of opportunity for growth in some departments.
2210,Red Hat,"Was initially optimistic, but RH is not upholding values they espouse",2015-06-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Benefits seem to be in line with companies of similar size in the industry, e.g. (401k match up to 6%), reasonable employee contributions for medical/dental/vision 
- Good amount of PTO for new associates; however, you are required to use a few PTO days during the company-wide holiday shutdown, and you do not receive any separate sick days, floating days or bereavement days 
- Good brand equity on a resume for future employment opportunities","- Claim culturual values of the company are 'meritocracy' and 'transparency.' However, I do not think this extends to the sales org. Many incompetent people have been promoted based on favoritism and internal politics. Yes, this happens everywhere, but other companies don't claim to have a transparent meritocracy. If RH is going to be like every other company, then don't claim you do one thing and not enforce it by your actions. Actions always speak louder than words. 
- Along with the above, the org sometimes feels a little incestuous for a publicly traded company. They have a lot of RH lifers that are now upper managers and execs that have been promoted WAY beyond their actual ability level solely because they've been with the company a long time. They are now simply coasting in their cushy roles and not motivating subordinates or implementing positive changes...they are content with the status quo so as not to interrupt their gravy trains! 
- Red Hat as a company, and especially sales, is very male dominated. Yes, this is true in technology, but it's especially evident at Red Hat. For example, there are very few women in the channel sales org and field/inside sales. How have they not been hit with a gender discrimination lawsuit? I have been on sales calls where it's more of a ""frat house"" type mentality, with profanity flying and no regard for professionalism, which made me uncomfortable and alienated. 
- Culture of secrecy, gossip & backstabbing is common in sales. For example, I don't know what my 1st line manager and ""director"" actually DO. Again, it seems they are just on a gravy train surfing the internet all day and flying around trying to ""look"" busy, but it's all a facade. I have never once been asked how I'm doing or what I think could be improved. It's very much a ""we don't want to know and don't need your feedback"" type scenario, because providing reasonable feedback would require work on management's part to actually address and make a change, which they've made clear through their actions and promotions they have no desire to do. The people who are promoted are the ""yes men"" types who say everything is great to management, even if they have complained about it in gossip with coworkers. 
- Lots of 'low rent' hires recently. Seems with Red Hat's growth, they are lowering their standards for the sales org and hiring anyone off the street in certain geos. I don't know if this is a talent acquisition team problem, but I've noticed management has an attidue of ""that person will do"" when the attitude should be ""is that person going to be a rockstar in this role & an asset to red hat?"" As a result, several chronically lazy people (to the point where it's laughable) have been hired and will probably be coasting in their current role indefinitely since there are often no repercussions for bad behavior. 
- Compensation is starting to lack. The execs are making out like bandits, but unless you have the right manager to advocate for you, do not expect raises beyond 3-5% (sometimes waiting for an 18 month cycle or longer). This can be frustrating if you are trying to be evaluated on a more regular cadence or are underpaid for your experience solely because you have a manager who doesn't want to advocate for you. 
- Can be very difficult to partner with internal departments to close business - much more so than many tech companies. RH is very legal-driven instead of sales & customer-driven. This creates kind of an arrogant attitude that prevents business from getting closed unless the client meets RH's sometimes absurd demands, even down to basic things like info listed on a PO, order form etc that RH will hold up closing deals for. Red Hat is NOT HP some huge conglomerate, they need to take a customer-centric sales approach and create win-win situations to close business where the CUSTOMER is first. Without the customer, where would the business be? This can be frustrating to navigate for folks coming from companies with more pro-sales mentalities and fully baked systems in place. 
- Too many disparate internal systems for sales org. The way they roll systems out, it's like you are working for a 20 person company based out of a Silicon Valley house. Half the stuff they roll out is broken and glitchy, then you have to do extra work just to accomplish the same task that was working fine before. The rest of the time, they system they deploy doesn't have the functionality the prior system does, so you're forced to use something that actually makes it more challenging to do their job simply because some manager or analyst was trying to justify their own job. 
- Really cheap with company expenses. For example, we went on a trip and the manager had to literally send out 5-10 ""reminders"" about watching expenses, trying to get free food, etc. It came across as ""we don't trust you to act like adults."" They could have easily said, this is the per diem, don't exceed the per diem. Instead, it's like veiled reminders that you shouldn't spend any money (even though we are allotted the per diem), but they don't want to come out and say that directly. The ambiguity makes it stressful and makes it seem like you're not valued as an employee and part of the company, especially when other departments have more of a carte blance mindset."

Public has a positive perception of Red Hat.,"Unless you are a Director or above, you will be carrying out others' decisions - not making them.  Not even having any meaningful input.  Red Hat preaches against disengagement, while almost actively fostering it.  Opinions are best kept to oneself.  And, make no mistake, politics are very important at Red Hat.

Also, the software is difficult to make work, due to inadequate user interfaces.  And, support is spotty - despite this being Red Hat's main claim to fame.

The training department continues to cling to the notion that memorizing for tests is a good thing, despite lots of research in the field of education that bears out what we all know - it is temporary.  And, outsourcing the training department has made it almost irrelevant."

Nice fedoras.","CEO does a decent job running the company but is largely unseen as compared to other companies I've worked with. With few exceptions senior leadership is sorely lacking. There are VERY few (any?) that I'd categorize as motivational leaders that inspire great work. Mostly they are all managers of their own fiefdoms, fighting for their own interests at the expense of the larger picture. Also - they rarely turn over. Mediocrity is allowed to fester. Therefore there is little natural churn of positions leaving little advancement opportunity. If you've got 20 years, great, but there is no apparent fast track to build your career in 2-year incrementally escalating roles. They just don't open very often."

Salary is below industry average, they try make up with bonuses and stock but it doesn't work. They only get away with this because people would accept a lower salary for open source work, but we miss on great employees because of it.
Hordes of new employees from proprietary software companies (Microsoft, IBM, etc..) couldn't care less about open source and culture changes internally because of it.

- Another side effect of the distributed character of Red Hat is that many people are working from home regularly. My ""cube neighbors"" are arriving to the office in a frequency of a couple of time a month, or even less then that. 
While I appreciate the option to WFH when necessary, having all of the people always working from home poses the same disadvantages as the ones mentioned above for virtual teams. Arriving every day to a ""ghost office"" is not fun."

The folks are very professional, you can learn a lot, even as experienced sofrware engineer.
You can get expoesed to latest trends and technologies, aspecially in upstream (open source) version of the projects, depends which project of course.","I think the salary  reviews should be formalized, they are not tightly coupled with the employee assessment process, so in some sense it gives us employee less motivation to invest in these assessment processes.
For senior engineers who are already ""deep in the system"" it may be a bit hard to switch in the project to do something else (but there are examples when people actually did that) - sometimes it's a matter of the engineer taking an intiative , invest extra time, and perform the shift after showing results - but I think management should encourage this more.
Red-Hat is also an amazing place ify ou're a remotee and don't have a thriving IT industry near you - we have excellent engineers in places like little vilages in their home countries, and countries where the IT industry is not thriving."
2271,Red Hat,Worst ever in a 15 years' span,2014-10-10,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,Career development only if you get under someone's wings,"The Company is filled-up with people that only are thinking of retaining their actual place, no desire in developing the newcomers into other positions"
2272,Red Hat,Good for gaining knowledge but overall RH is loosing its stature,2014-10-08,2.0,Technical Support Engineer,"- Will get to learn a lot in a very less period of time. 
- Get to know best minds around you and will get to learn a lot from them.
- Salary is transparent. You get all the components mentioned in your CTC unlike project based companies like TCS, Wipro, Infosys where they slash huge amount from your CTC.","- Management performing a lot of experiments with their policies with mere hit-and-trial method.
- Management is more bothered about the figures and reports rather than the technical growth of the employees.
- They are not able to hire resources with requisite skills as it  would need them to spend more money.
- Salary structure is not appropriate and not competent to the market. And that is the reason good minds are leaving the organization.
- Employees are asked to work on Public holidays. Working on a public holiday is paid but still it is by force, not by choice.
- Micro management
- Some of the people getting promoted on the basis of number of years spent in the organization, even though they are not suitable for that appropriate role.
- Very less or negligible managers with technical skills."

5. You will feel confident due to communication with very high Customer Circle and Technically advanced.","1. The Management : This is really bad. You were initially able to select the domain in which you wanted to work in, now, it's allocated by the Management. You can not transit yourself in another domain of your interest.
2. Salary : Don't ask for Salary Hike, if you will ask, it will be denied or unexpected reasons will be given for NACK on Salary hike.
3. Employee : Want leaves! 
    Manager : What about NO? 
4. Work Pressure: They hire less technical people nowadays, don't know why. I see many technical people getting rejected but average getting selected which results into high work pressure on those who has expertise in a particular domain."

You can take Red Hat training courses and certification exams for free if you can get a break from your normal job duties to take them.  You get to work at a lot of different places, work with really smart and experienced people, and learn new things constantly.  I never feel under-challenged.","The salary could be better, but it's offset with bonuses and perks.  As a consultant, you may have to travel a lot, but this is something I personally enjoy.  While you learn new things every day, it can also make you feel like a newbie every time you go on a new project because there is always endless new things to learn.  You get placed in some very high pressure situations which can be stressful at times.  Promotions can be rather difficult unless you are an absolute rockstar."
2282,Red Hat,Best work environment I've ever seen,2014-08-19,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"People are passionate, committed, and capable.  ""Dead Weight"" is rare on a team.  Most teams are flexible and allow you to maintain an excellent work/life balance.","- While the technology used is often new and interesting, the problems being solved tend to be dry and uninteresting.
- Development teams have little input about customer requirements/needs
- There is a large gap of missing information from people in the field versus those designing/building products.
- Some teams become process heavy and seem to over complicate the work they are doing.  
- Red Hatters tend to be a different sort of people, they are more vocal on what they like/dislike on mailing lists with several sounding ""whiny"" at times.  
- Company is growing and losing the 'startup' feel"

Your stay at Red Hat is really what you make of it.  If you become complacent and are okay with doing the same thing every day, you might not stick around for long but striving to learn and do more is really how you'll thrive.","The company has been going through some growing pains the past few years.  There has definitely been a shift from being the little guy leading a revolution to becoming yet another big company.  The culture has suffered from it but compared to other places, it's not bad.

Open source is amazing. A lot of the people are great, super smart and committed. I had an amazing tenure here, but got out when the politics started getting to me.","Company is full of turds: underqualified hacks who have been with the company for over 10 years and promoted way above their capabilities, and recent refugees from big companies like Microsoft, Oracle, EMC who Red Hat thought they needed to legitimize themselves as they grew bigger but are just a bunch of dead weight. Political infighting like you wouldn't believe. If you can avoid the land mines, the toxic people, and the zombie projects you can get things done, but it's not the company it was three years ago."

Most decisions are made based on transparency, openness and how it will impact the community.

If you're not, it's still a great place to work as long as you keep an open mind.  Work is pretty flexible, sometimes even leaving it up to take the initiative to work on valuable projects.  Most people are really passionate about what they do, which makes for awesome work life.  However, there is also a real balance with life, offering pretty good PTO.","There seems to be a decline in the importance of Open Source for some people, making it OK to adopt proprietary solutions when convenient.  It's probably a side effect of a growing company, where a lot of the people coming in don't have the same vision and passion for Open Source."
2295,Red Hat,Good Open Source Culture Based Company,2014-07-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great work/life balance.
- Ability to contribute to open source projects.
- Has the welfare of its customers in mind.","* Company has grown beyond its initial roots. It has crossed $1B in revenue last year. Now revenue trumps culture. Company can get short sighted.
* Either Engineering calls the shots or management calls the shots. There is a clear divide between management and engineers. No intermingling."
2296,Red Hat,Political,2014-07-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, hard working colleagues and autonomy","Politics.  The company (at least back office functions) is full of back biting politics between and within departments.  Everyone is afraid of losing power and fights for position. A lot of smoke and mirrors without much truth to employees or higher management.  Many in leadership are checked out and are more concerned about positioning themselves outside of Red Hat instead of focusing on what needs to be done within their departments.

Also, lip service is paid to growth and moving within the company but for many in back office functions, to move is almost impossible because managers will limit your mobility to not lose the headcount number.

Collaboration, trust and transparency are buzzwords that are not lived out in practice at Red Hat."

Sometime difficult to accomplish goals because there are so many concurrent projects ongoing, it's not always obvious the priorities between them."

No stock, decent compensation.",2014-06-08,4.0,Sales Analyst,"Tolerant of sexual orientation / race, Decent Compensation, the developers have a great open-source culture, frequent free food, free soda and snacks every day. Team had pretty good cohesion and occasionally shared a potluck or a team-building half-day out of the office.","I was in the sales/analysts part of the company, and Red Hat's sales organization has a less open-source culture than previous jobs where I worked close to developers. I worked medium-long hours, and especially long hours around quarter ends, which diluted my hourly wage to ""not worth it"". I used Windows/Excel/PowerPoint, and our team did things the way you do them at all US / multinational mega-corps. I felt there were too many layers of management between me and the customer, and that it would take forever to rise through at least 3 of the 6 layers of the corporation's management (just like a pyramid scheme) to get good compensation. The days of stock options ended sometime between 2012-2013 for the bottom-level developers/analysts. I think even first-level managers still can get stock options, but the chance for real wealth has past. Most of these cons apply to most corporate jobs. I improved my Excel skills to even higher levels. I didn't learn or improve other valuable skills that I can make money with, so personal growth was  limited. I was praised for my effort and results, but never rewarded with more money, more time, or better work. I discovered my marginal earnings / hour were better managing my personal investments and fulfilling orders and improving the efficiency of my own little business during lunch, so I quit after 1 year. My managers said they were sad when I announced I wanted to leave, but didn't offer anything more to keep me. I think actions speak louder than words, and Red Hat's actions said it only valued me as a $28/hr (pre-tax) / $21/hr (post-tax) Excel and salesforce.com jockey. Red Hat offered no way of improving me into a higher-value role, so I left. I now make $35/hr on my lowest-value tasks, and can work as little or as much as I want, when I want, and still make enough to live where I like, and do anything I want all day, every day."

It is good to work for a company where everything is open source, from your desktop, mail client/developer tools, to the code you're developing or supporting.  This makes a refreshing change from proprietary companies.","If you work remotely be prepared to get routinely passed over for everything, not in the office means you're effectively invisible.

Much of the engineering work is just bug fixing, even principal developers seem to do little else.  If you want the interesting development work, you have to do something to be noticed, and then be prepared to back stab your way through the queue of people for that coveted work.  Then you'll invariably have to deal with the egos, and Red Hat has a lot of engineers with ego problems. 

Work-life balance can be frustrating.  I often get to work past midnight.  Not that you'll spend the entire time working, rather waiting for the baroque bureaucracy to complete.

This can sometimes make your life at red hat a bit secluded. Mentorship is hard to find in remote working model. Like all big companies it will boil down to which team you are working for, and who is your manager.

Flexible, independent (depending on group) work.
Freedom to propose, have opinions and instill change.
Interesting, exciting and challenging environment. We may be many things, but not bored.
Innovative, take-risk, release often - fail fast environment.","Meritocracy is not as strong as the old-boys-network.
Building an org based the smartest, best in class, type A people requires management skills not present at all levels (promotions often seem based on technical, not managerial skills).
Instituting change can be slow and painful - ruling by consensus is not always efficient or effective.
Limited work experience outside Red Hat, many associates know only the Red Hat way. Not effective in trying to increase maturity in a large organization."

They have develop some great solutions and technologies that have change the market place certainly with Linux Red Hat and Jboss. Great place to be if you are developer. Lots of good interesting projects to get involved with. New ways of thinking and a real chance to develop your skill set to your own benefit.,"Red Hat are making that transition from startup to enterprise, certain people cannot make that change and are holding the company back.  Expect to be micro managed, expect a culture of blame down from some managers to their team and individual contributors. 
The company wastes a lot of time on reporting who is doing what, so much so that they are wasting huge amount of resources doing so. 
There is a strong sense of dis-jointment between the sales and the rest of the organisation. 
As a smaller enterprise there is a lot of favouritism that goes within the organisation. If you are not one of the favourites do not expect much chance of career progression and be prepare used to further the career of others."
2342,Red Hat,A rare company that practices what it preaches,2014-01-27,5.0,Software Architect,"Red Hat has a strong commitment to open-source software. It contributes to the advancement of technology around the world, allowing people to build atop the work of others to produce products and solutions greater than the sum of their parts.

The corporate culture is by far the finest I have experienced. The culture of collaboration permeates every level of the business.","Red Hat's salaries do not always measure up to the giants of Silicon Valley. The work-life balance can sometimes be difficult to maintain, as everyone in engineering performs multiple jobs.

Red Hat can be stingy at times, such as requiring employees to room together on business trips."
2343,Red Hat,Outstanding products and brilliant coworkers,2014-01-26,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,"Truly lives up to the term ""collaboration"" and breathes the open source principles in day-to-day operations.  Some truly brilliant coworkers who are passionate about what they do.  The learning curve is very steep, but the environment is supportive and tech support engineers gain experience very quickly.  Train every TSE for RHCE and require they attain it to maintain their position.  Continue to develop internal and external tools to streamline workflow and make the organization more efficient.","The compensation is far from competitive.  This aids in attracting those who are passionate about the technology and open source culture; however, it is difficult to raise a family and pay debts on the poor pay.  Also causes a constant churn of the most skilled engineers."

People who believe in what they are doing and love it. When I first began working there, I really enjoyed it, but things really went down hill.","The IT department is full of incompetent people and people who are there due to nepotism. I really feel sad at having to say this, but the current CIO has really dragged the place down. They implemented ITIL and have generally preferred closed source solutions over ones that Red Hat itself sells. Just completely insane that they would put in place closed source solutions that specifically compete with Red Hat products."

Also, I get to work on truly ground-breaking ideas that I've never even thought about before joining the company. Finally, people listen to you here...no matter whether you've just joined and they're a few levels up the management chain, if your ideas are good they get attention.","The business is growing so fast it can be pretty hard to keep up with the things you need to know to do your job. Also, because we're so interested in technological innovation, it seems like we're constantly interested in a slightly better solution than the one we have (for a given internal need). These collude to produce an environment where documentation can sometimes be hard to find, and it can mean tracking down a specific person to get answers you need to do your work. Since we're a truly global business, that may mean dealing with awkward timezone differences to ask questions."

I've been there for many years, and it still has a small-ish feel even though it has grown 5x (employees) during that time. Most of my coworkers in the engineering department are smart, motivated, and good to work with. They stick to their principles of open source. Communication internally is very good. I feel like in general, the company cares about their employees and tries (within reason) to make us happy. It's a stable environment and I've never felt any concerns about layoffs or downsizing - if anything it's the opposite (growing pains).","Of all the jobs I've had internally, I've found management to be very hands-off. i.e. ""You know what you need to do, so do it"". At times I've wished I had more direction, but I'd take that over a micromanager."

2357,Red Hat,"Great people, great company",2013-12-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Employees are very passionate about open source, transparency, meritocracy, collaboration, etc.  
2. Employees understand and articulate the company values and hold each other accountable to them.  
3. Everyone is willing to pitch in to help solve a problem.  This sometimes results in 'too many cooks in the kitchen', but the eagerness to help creates a very supportive environment.
4.  Smart people who know their jobs.  Technical expertise in most functions is very high.","As others have mentioned, pay is not up to industry standard.  Red Hat has had extraordinary growth, and it becomes increasingly hard to justify lack of raises and low salaries to the employees, given the profitability of the company.

Career mobility is limited in certain departments and is very manager-dependent.  A bad manager can kill a subordinate's career.  Hasn't happened to me (fortunately), but I've seen this a lot.  

Speaking of which, we have some good managers, but we have a lot of BAD people managers.  The skills that it takes to be a good engineer, software developer, lawyer, accountant, etc are a very different from the soft skills needed to manage people.  Our HR is too focused on managers filling out forms as opposed to giving them real training on how to appropriately manage people."
2358,Red Hat,Lots of positive energy and momentum and a very flexible work culture,2013-12-11,4.0,Principal Product Manager,"- Lots of energy and positive momentum 
- What an individual/team wants to do is unbounded by the company in many ways. One can decide for themselves how hard they want to work or choose a more balanced work life balance (but still work and not goof off)
- the core competency of the company is open source technology knowledge and the free exchange of it on email lists and discussions. Provides a very valuable learning opportunity

2361,Red Hat,If you want to do technical work - Look no farther.I worked as Technical Support Engineer and the learning is incredible,2013-12-09,4.0,Technical Support Engineer,"1) Numero uno company to work on linux. And by linux, I mean enterprise grade, performance choking linux. Not fancy fanboy stuff (though it's still there). Put it simply, you put effort. You will reap astonishing benefit of the technology.

2) Incredible technology stack and unparalleled learning curve. You will meet and work with folks you never would have anticipated.

3) Outstanding people from all over the globe. And most of those guys (not the petty, mediocre sacks) are hell-bent to help you - provided you put the genuine effort. Result - A far better, improved technologist and probably better skilled, paid engineer.

4) It's open source baby (it's still now - subjected to change with the way of growth).

5) Add all four.","1) In India, the management is all squeaky and engaged in skirmish. The micromanagement has been induced to a great painstaking level and it irritates the good guys at work. People who are technically less adept will listen to those bs talks but guys who know their knowledge, will not care. Therefore, you will see good attrition rate of good employees. Don't trust me, ask the existing employees.

2) Bad, bad hiring. Right now, they are only inclined to hire technically inferior people/folks with no aspiration. That is demotivating.

3) Not everyone likes to work in weekend, night shift, holidays. It should be made _crystal-clear_ to everyone at the point of hiring that 'hey, this is support. All the unholy sum up will be there, as long as you are here'.

4) Once you are technically good and have achieved STSE/TSE/TAM level, it is *hard* to progress much. Because, with given workload, you won't be able to pursue own studies, unless you spend sleepless nights alone with a computer. And the management folks won't let you pursue higher. 

5) IMPORTANT - please let an engineer be another engineer's manager. I have had lots of managers and I don't think one of them was better than me, either technically or academically. For a company of the standard of Red Hat, that is pathetic. In fact, I know that most of them weren't engineers at all. Some mere team leads here and there with some management jargon which they blurb on the new guys."

I witnessed people screaming obscenities at each other in meetings, flaming each other over email in front of management and peers, and just general playground bully behavior that would result in termination at any other company. Oddly, the CEO recently discussed this culture in an article as if it were a positive. I can assure you that being insulted and degraded on a daily basis isn't cute, or clever, or tolerable. I and most of the people I on-boarded with lasted no more than a year."

Linux has become mature and this company needs to become more competitive with their other solutions.  Management is inept - incredibly so.  They are tactically focused on the weekly forecast call, lots of politics and there is an ""old boys mentality"" - if you're not one of the ""boys"" you have accounts taken away from you and the management simply doesn't support you when you need them.  BTW - this is an engineering company - I've been in a meeting where an senior solutions architect stated in front of a room of sales guys that the sales guys are ""slime that oozes from under rocks"".

There is a known lack of professionalism on how they should motivate and train their employees.

-long hours are the norm

2437,Red Hat,Best Company I've Worked for,2012-12-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Red Hat has a great culture. They value everyone's opinion no matter their title. People here have strong opinions and are respectful of others' opinions--in fact, they expect you to voice yours. After all, this is a open-source software company. Community and diverse opinions often lead to better products. In addition, the benefits, salaries, and bonuses are great. They may not be the highest in the world, but they're certainly trying to make each employee feel valued. My manager and his peers are often very encouraging of my work and welcoming of new, fresh ideas. In fact, they go out of their way to reward you. I've been in companies where hierarchy was more important, and salaries and bonuses were based on quantitative results (rather than qualitative). There are many huge company events, team events, extracurricular activities (sponsored soccer teams, etc.) and clubs to join. Free food & snacks. Upper Management/Execs are approachable and don't carry the elitist stigma. Once you're an employee, they continue to try and make sure you're happy and on a path to success. If this includes moving to another team, picking up new skills, or moving to another city (remote or not) then they'll make sure it happens.","You get thrown in to the mix quickly and are expected to swim. If you're on the right team (which is most teams, but not all), you'll have several helping hands. The Brand team sticks to themselves and is often unaware (and doesn't care) that there are other experienced designers in the company. For non-designers, this may not be an issue. Every other team that I have worked with has been awesome and accommodating."
2438,Red Hat,Good company with a terrible IT department,2012-12-12,2.0,Linux Systems Administrator,I believe the overall company is a good one and the environment seems to be positive outside of IT. I like the company's mission and how they seem to be executing on it.,"The IT department in the company seems to be exclusively concerned with covering the ass of upper management. Even the simplest technical problems are solved with the addition of more process on an already overly burdened system. While I was there, the IT department was rife with blatant nepotism and conflicts of interest. Even those that prove that they are toxic for the company are simply moved to other areas of IT and not terminated. Worse, the process has been shown to cause outages, yet the answer is to add more process. Between this blind pursuit of process and the toxic working environment, I am glad to be out of there and would never recommend anyone work in Red Hat IT."

If you are about to be laid off from HP or AMD, you will find yourself at home at Red Hat -- which is trying to become like HP or AMD.

Everyone is entrusted with their responsibilities
Comparatively less micro-management","Too vague in terms of process and career path.

In general, the staff at Red Hat is extremely bright and competant.  Red Hat's management is supportive and respectful and they encourage an excellent work-life balance.","Red Hat's compensation and benefits package is not competitive with other high tech companies (at least in the Boston area, which is where I work). Associates are expected to ""work for less""  to have the privlege of working for the open source leader. There are many open source advocates who are willing to work for less, but this attitude will deter many excellent potential staff members from considering Red Hat.

Red Hat is also experiencing some growing pains with respect to processes and tools. Processes are extremely complex,. As we grow, these processes and tools will not scale. More streamlined processes need to be instituted to allow Red Hat to grow successfully. Thereis too much red tape and management approvals to be flexible and efficient."

I feel like I'm making an impact in the industry, and that my contributions are visible at an individual level. My soul is not being sucked into a corporate machine.","The only con that I have is the fact that I work from home and don't have access to any offices (there are none nearby,) but that can easily also be viewed as a pro for many. I just need more daily interaction to feel that I am doing my best."

Reliable financials and internal movement means you will never worry about losing your job.

Amazing coworkers and frequently amazing managers.","Lack of driving technical vision. 
Overly conservative investment strategy from senior management when it comes to diversifying the product portfolio or being creative in penetrating new markets or driving deeper into existing markets.
