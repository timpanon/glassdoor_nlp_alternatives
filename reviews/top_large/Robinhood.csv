5,Robinhood,Avoid the Research Team,2022-04-18,1.0,Researcher,"If you join the research team at Robinhood, your therapist will finally be able to buy that vacation home they've been dreaming about (because you will be needing daily counseling sessions).","Joining the research team at Robinhood was one of the worst decisions I've made in my career. But here's the good news - you can learn from my mistake. If you receive an email from a Robinhood recruiter, delete it. If you receive an offer from the research team, throw it in the trash. You'll thank me later. Robinhood might look like a good option on paper, but beneath the surface it is a garbage fire and joining this company could turn your life upside down. Our stock is performing like a lead balloon (currently down 75%) because the company is so poorly-managed. The research team is no exception. The org structure is a mess. There's no strategic vision. There's a lack of prioritization and planning. There's a lack of support from leadership. There's a lack of transparency, especially surrounding major decisions. The internal politics are nonstop. Budgets are decreasing rapidly. There's an emphasis on quantity over quality and ""taking orders"" from stakeholders. Researchers are burnt out due to unevenly distributed workloads, aggressive deadlines, a lack of resources, absentee Directors, and a lack of scoping. Research projects at Robinhood can be especially stressful because the company is constantly shifting its priorities and strategies... and the executives tend to trust their gut more than they trust research. Internal surveys show the research team has poor work-life balance, low morale, and a lack of psychological safety. But these problems have been largely ignored. When researchers raise concerns, they face retaliation. A cloud of fear hangs over the team. Due to the leadership and the culture, most of the researchers are miserable. It's one of the most discouraged research teams I've ever seen and people are running for the exits so fast you would think someone yelled ""fire"" in a crowded theater. One third of the team has resigned in the past six months (since the new Head of Research took over). Two-thirds of the managers have resigned. Our team has one of the highest levels of turnover in the entire company. And the mood on the team has only gotten worse over time. Do yourself a favor and avoid the research team at Robinhood unless you want a front row seat to the sinking of the Titanic."

Work from home","It’s tough to put a rating on Robinhood. At first everything was exciting and different. Then leading up to IPO and post IPO things began to change quickly. In a recent meeting Vlad said his CEO rating was going down probably because of the current stock price. At that moment I realized he had no finger on the pulse of the company any more. The reason his rating is going down is because so many peole that were loyal and believed in the mission have been taken advantage of. They had their equity comp taken from them and been passed for promotions by outside hiring time and time again. Only to train their new boss and have roles and responsibilities taken from them. 

The environment that use to feel fun now feels corporate and leaderships answer to make everyone feel better is shipping products. The ones that care and try to voice concerns of employees turnover only get candid answers from leadership saying it’s natural from company growth. People really don’t voice how they feel because they need a job and the benefits.

First rule of business. Take care of your people. Robinhood will continue to stand out from traditional brokerages because the competition is infamous for burn out, poor ethics, pushy sales, and shady business. However has time goes by the employees who helped Robinhood pre IPO see the signs of it becoming the same."

While the tech and product side is constantly evolving, the live client support group is being built up in the vein of every other brokerage firm, when there is untapped potential to be something totally different.

And boy was it a fun one! The code yellow that lasted 3+ months were employees worked their butts off to make up for leadership’s negligence and incompetence. The company almost imploded, largely out of the ineptitude of the finance team to internalize the company’s capital requirements, the operations team’s incompetence serving customers during a time of high-growth and market volatility, and the marketing and legal team’s utter lack of communication to customers, employees, and regulators. The worse part about the experience was that the leadership team did absolutely nothing to help, thank or or support their teams through the crisis. They just told them to work harder, scapegoated direct reports, gaslit other teams, etc. I really don’t think most of them understood what was happening, much less knew knew what to do.

61,Robinhood,"***WARNING, HONEST REVIEW POSTED***",2022-01-24,1.0,,Free gifts every now and then,"I've been working at Robinhood for a little while. When I first started, things were great. As we started hiring new managers, things took an ugly turn for the worse. The work environment and culture has turned disgusting and toxic. The culture is based on creating a bunch of ""yes"" men and women who will ""buy in"" to the mass incompetence leadership displays perpetually. I learned more about trading and securities by reading the Series 7 and 63 books than I do in my day to day activities working here. We consistently bend over backwards for customers that have zero clue about complex topics such as margin and options when outages occur (which is damn near everyday). We continue to roll out experiments when the focus needs to be on stabilzing the platform and getting rid of the incessant app issues that occur daily. When you ask certain teams or departments for help, the snide and passive aggressive remarks you sometimes get as answers are unnecessary and comical at best. If I knew the answer, do you think I'd waste my time asking you?!?!?! Also, they get in their feelings when you ask a lot of questions too. The people they promote to management positions are unqualified and ""buy in"" to the brainwashed ""we are all friends"" mantra that is going around. First of all, we aren't friends, we are COWORKERS. If we happen to build a friendship along the way, great but we aren't friends from the first moment I meet you. What kind of psychosis is that?!?!?! I can go on and on but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Many of my colleagues have ditched this trash company and I'll be following them soon because I became depressed after working here. READ ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS because they are factual. They try to blind you with all the standard benefits but those benefits are outdated, the culture is absolutely trash and toxic, leadership is an absolute joke, Lord I can go on but I'll stop. Please listen to my warning, don't work here. You're better off working at McDonald's for real, this place sucks the life out of you!!!! STAY AWAY!!!

It is the specific and primary reason for my departure.

Managers were predominantly unskilled at role and had surprisingly little industry knowledge. Honestly the industry knowledge amongst the leadership was scary. 
- Felt like everything was reactionary instead of proactive. Constantly shifting focus and priorities instead of driving change and creating products
- Career pathing is ill conceived and there is nowhere for service employees to go. I was fortunate to go to a team that opened doors to more hidden parts of the business but most have no shot with over hiring and service promoting only those drinking the Kool aid.

The history with it is that it was a mess and had a couple of really toxic leaders and then had a quick change of general counsels. The current general counsel came in about two years ago and fired basically the entire previous legal management within six months. Some of those folks needed to be fired, but there were also people with long institutional knowledge who wanted to do the right thing. Many people were very hopeful when he came in, as they thought this would be the beginning of a well and professionally run the legal department. It was not. What legal and comms too got was an influx of Republican revolving door folks, including from the Trump administration, and other mercenaries and hangers on of the GC. Mostly in Washington DC. Nobody has been promoted from in-house except one very curious case but they have hired people that did not last 2- 3 months for management positions. Nothing has changed for the better - lots of publicized $$ to settle cases but as anyone can read from the media, a load of investigations continue.

Great benefits 
Pay is competitive",On call could be tough
82,Robinhood,it's an ok company,2021-12-30,3.0,Customer Service Associate,"great training, great intro into customer service",now work life balance. Advancement is easy but the compensation is not great even for advancement
83,Robinhood,Fun but not transparent,2021-12-28,3.0,Customer Experience,"Amazing benefits. 
WFH / Nice updated work equipment. 
You’ll work with some amazing people. 
Beautiful offices with free lunch and snacks offered onsite. 
Great COVID-19 response for employees. 
CEOS seem pretty cool and show face every week which is pretty rare for most companies. 
Young Millenial/Gen Z workforce. 
A fun environment overall.","Choppy licensing program that required employees to obtain the SIE/Series 7/Series 63 in 10 weeks which wasn’t disclosed to us when we onboarded. My advice to anyone going through or into the CXR program is to buckle down and don’t bank on finding internal positions if you don’t make it just because you saw others do so. They can and will terminate you while not batting an eye or offering  any guidance to the people that fail out. 

It seems the entire CX department is slowly but surely turning into another corporate call center. 

They’re constantly changing standard processes on us and I don’t feel they do enough to update or prepare us for these constant changes. The training on some topics could be way more in depth in my opinion.  

The work itself can become repetitive and boring and customers can get pretty abusive given our reputation. 
 
HR seems nonexistent and clueless when you ask them about PTO, your shares, annual bonuses etc.

Leadership leaves much to be desired as well and can be super dismissive.

They boast about caring about their internal employees and their career growth but it doesn’t show. The internal promotion/transfer system seems pretty broken."
84,Robinhood,Startup vibes in bigco,2021-12-27,5.0,Product Manager,"- High agency workplace
- You can make a lot of impact",- I can't really think of any
85,Robinhood,A great workplace!,2021-12-21,5.0,Registered CXR Representative,Robinhood is a very inclusive environment. I'd say the people are what make it so amazing! The benefits are great and so are the working conditions. It's overall a low stress job and I am grateful to work here!,"It's difficult to move positions especially if you've been there for a while. The growth and career development opportunities could be better in my opinion. Additionally, the 401k match should be 6% however it's currently at 3%. It'd be nice to have that be higher."
86,Robinhood,Not bad,2021-12-20,4.0,Fraud Investigator,"Supportive culture, coworkers and leadership",Rapidly evolving environment. Some thrive in this; some find it disorienting.
87,Robinhood,"Unproductively hierarchical, cult-like immature environment",2021-12-19,1.0,Product,"- Solid pay and benefits (relatively typical for tech companies, however). 
- Moderate to mild respect for customer perspectives (better than some companies, I guess.)","- Absolutely terrible work-life balance across all product teams. Robinhood moves from one disaster to the next, trying to find its footing amongst mediocre product launches. 
- Unreasonable requests from leadership constantly derail product efforts and create chaos amongst peers. 
- Cult-like worship of upper management and a zero tolerance attitude dissenting opinions. 
- Awful prioritization of resource allocation; product teams are highly reactive and seldom understand limitations of their work. 
- One of the worst marketing teams this side of the U.S.; firing the CMO hardly had an effect on useless marketing practices. 
- Promotions are driven by blind peer feedback mechanisms that hardly encourage transparency or authenticity. Significant bias in promotion processes and quotas for promoting employees (encourages extremely unhealthy competition). 
- Absence of diversity across leadership. Where is leadership representation for the BIPOCs that the company supposedly cares so much about (particularly Latin/black employees?) It is all a facade. 
- Toxic culture of gossip, cutthroat behaviors, and high school-like cliques that are unwelcoming of new employees."
