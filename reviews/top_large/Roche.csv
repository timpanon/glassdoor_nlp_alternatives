Probably many opened positions given the high turn over and number of resignations
They can offer very good wages but then you will have to sign a confidential agreement as they want to be known as not paying so well and keep most people as low as they can.","With high turn over, resignations and the 10 year continuous global restructuring, you should think twice before joining this company. 
Roche is largely and disproportionately driven by sales, rather than patient outcomes, with marketing department considering all other functions as a support to increase sales but not as strategic partners. 
All this contribute to a bad culture environment and lack of innovation which became obvious during COVID pandemic.
Even during these challenging times, Roche did not offer real support or working flexibility to employees (they may tell you they do but check the details). 
With many people leaving and constant leadership changes they increased pressure and workload on the one staying. 
They may feel they’ve checked the box for diversity with recent LGBT and disability networks but again it’s more for advertising purposes than real inclusion. 
There is no diversity in way of thinking, you won’t feel safe to speak up unless you agree with the majority.

471,Roche,Avoid at all costs,2021-09-26,1.0,Technical Consultant,"If you are based on the office, they have an on-site gym and subsidized canteen","Roche UK and Ireland is a company that speaks about their values of honesty and integrity without actually exhibiting them at all. I found them to be dishonest and in no way care about the patients we provide services toward.
The company is only focused on maximizing profit at all cost.
They advertise salaries as being market leading, but they pay between 80 - 120 % of the median market salary.
I was one of the most experienced consultants on the team when I left and after 7 years of year on year pay increases I was on scale at 81%. It turns out I was payed significantly lower than everyone else on the team.When taking the job after a restructuring I was told that, based on our experience, we would all be on the same salary scale and bonus structures. However after speaking with some of my team mates I found out that this was not the case. When I raised the issue, I was repeatedly lied to about my salary in relation to the team until I showed them the payslips two of my colleagues shared with me.
Their HR policies only catered for their UK based staff and even at that the focus was primarily geared towards their office based employees. The driver training the provided only catered for UK roads and they provided none for the ROI. Another example was they mandated Hep B immunity level to be retested every 5 years, but in Ireland (and the majority of the world) guidance was updated to say once achieved immunity is life long. As a result it's not possible to get retested 9nce immunity is proven. I said this to management/HR and that my GP would not test me. Their response was to find another GP and lie about my medical history to get the test done. 
I joined the D&I team in order to help correct these issues and was advised by senior management (including a director of Ireland) to stop doing so.
Career progression is primarily based on you're liked by senior management and not on your ability to perform at your role or your skillet. Also you are significantly hampered if you have a field based role.
The work-life balance was also very poor with regular long hours expected, in particular around responding to tenders."

- Realistically, there is very little chance, particularly with the recent hiring surge followed by a hiring freeze, that you will be able to move up within the organization. This is usually the case with most companies anymore, but for a company that preaches the personal development of its employees, it is hypocritical.

Working at Roche will open a lot of doors beyond given the brand and threshold required to gain employment. Everyone in Dia wants to work at Roche, so when jobs become available you're competing against the best of the best.","Each manager I had at Roche was a good individual contributor, often a leader among peers, but a terrible at managing people. Roche has a tendency to promote people who deliver results and view management as a way to give a career path for top performers, instead of carefully considering management roles for people who have skills for the role. This is likely common in most industries, but I found middle managers at Roche to be obsessed with their own personal career ambitions as opposed to being considerate of those of their team. Some were boldly two-faced, showing their best side to their peers and superiors and worst to the team below, and often the only forum to account for this is the 2-year GEOS survey. But often middle managers fire employees to game their own management ranking, which has the added effect of ensuring subordination of those who remain on the team. That said Roche is extremely progressive in their HR policies, I would not be surprised to see them calibrate this over time, and Roche also offers phenomenal leadership development programs and continuing education to help build soft skills. The problem is the self-centered middle managers who are only thinking about their next career step, and a lack of opportunities for candid manager feedback outside of GEOS. Pay is also considerably lower than the market rate in the industry, but career opportunities and benefits are top-notch."

- The brand is very well respected and recognised
- The quality standards are extremely high","- Because of the regulatory and quality standards and processes that need to be followed, it often feels like things take much longer to develop, improve/innovate, and approve
- Process-driven; still feels like the company is not too tech-savvy, apart from maybe a few divisions in the US

Pleasanton Santa Clara and San Francisco locations are filled with most Caucasian or Indian people. Even the people in HR are idiots and they don’t hiring many people of color. Once you work for this company you see the favorite within the business group teams. Even the hiring is ridiculous, I’ve been denied multiple times for positions I clearly qualify for and ones that I over qualified for and all they did was deny me. If you’re in the Bay Area and you want to work for Roche you have to be white or Indian or lucky. They have entry level positions on the Eastcoast USA but none on The Westcoast and if they are they’re from grad students. They really need to remodel the whole Bay Area when it comes to staff and employees. I use to really look up to this company and what they stood for until I found out all of this , Now I hate this company and wouldn’t recommend working for a racist organization."

The leadership wants as few people in SSF as possible, and the remaining positions are high paying, but come with high expectations.

We feel truly connected to that noble purpose, and it trickles down to our daily work as well. It really helps us refocus on patients to get us through even mundane or bad days. With the strong emphasis on patients, it almost feels like I am working for a social enterprise.
- The company is also very kind, compassionate, people-oriented and caring. That care is especially apparent during this Covid-19 pandemic. Simply unparalleled care and concern, that I feel so touched.
- Decision making is decentralized, hence there is a lot empowerment and room for small countries or small teams to innovate their own ideas in their own territories.
- It is also a truly global company without borders where anyone anywhere can participate and contribute to any project regardless of location.","- The decentralized decision making also birthed a plethora of systems that do not connect to each other, causing many process inefficiencies, confusion and complexity. It also slows down implementation of company-wide initiatives as it requires all or many stakeholders to agree and accept it first. I guess there are pros and cons to centralize vs decentralized anyway, so I can live with that.
- Regional or country leadership positions require international experience due to the global-connectivity of the company. Therefore, people with mobility restrictions are stagnated."

Nobody actually does anything but are always busy! 

Productivity is much lower than it should be; very little self-motivation and use of initiative (gets overlooked by managers who are concerned with their own career progression more than anything else).

The only pharma I know without a guaranteed flexible working policy. You're expected to be in the office in this dull town unless you have a specific reason agreed with your line manager beforehand - no working from home.

Lots of bureaucracy hindering change and complex processes required to navigate simple tasks but that is the same in every large company.

Very little opportunity for progression; excellent opportunities for personal development but it will mean nothing unless you are one of the chosen few (largely under-qualified folk who ""look"" the part). 

You will be constantly overlooked if you want to move up within the company.

Work life balance and benefits are pretty good.  Compensation is average.  Facilities are managed quite well.  Free snacks are available though that may change once the new cafeteria is ready.,"By far the biggest drawback is the toxic work culture and weak management.  There are a number of managers who do not have their employees' back, leaving them to fend for themselves until they either become toxic themselves as a survival mechanism, or leave the company in time so that self-healing can begin.

Politics is par for the course - yet it is the intensity level that takes it to a whole new dimension.  Power grabs, empire building, scapegoating, and undermining other teams are openly on display without appropriate action (and sometimes not even a reaction) from local management.  The one transgression not on display, by virtue of its definition, is backstabbing (which also happens quite often). 

There are some that complain about too many processes.  This is not a start-up anymore.  There is a lack of the right kind of processes that can propel an organization to efficiently reach its business goals.  Removing the brakes so that one team can work faster without fully appreciating the impacts on other teams results in a longer time to reach the organization's business objectives.

The Molecular Solutions cultural values plastered on the walls are mostly viewed as wall art as local management often do not practice via leading by example."

They are really nice and willing to help at any time.  All in all and from my experience, I would just advise not to work in the site (not in Roche as a company but just in this location)","Sant Cugat Digital Hub (just talking about my experience there) :
This site does not take care of employees. It is not the mission of the Site to keep people / Talent. That explains the high grade of people rotation. Every month people are leaving and new ones are coming. 

There is a big lack of structure, this makes difficult to work for the department and to understand what they expect from you.

Flexibility concept of this site have a total different meaning here many times. It means that you need to be flexible for working at 18.00, 19.00, 20.00, 22.00, etc. They sell it as something good but it is not the case because of that reason. 

 Even though they say the opposite and they really believe it, there is still the culture of, if your boss is in the office you must stay in the office till he leaves. The Digital Hub and Diabetes in general works like a big Silo. This means that if you are expecting to be able to make a career from here forget about it. Maybe Roche Diagnostics (in San Cugat as well) it is different and it is worth to try.
 
If you want to live in Barcelona, then it will take at least 1hour by public transport to reach the site. It does not matter where you live in the city. At the end of the day it always take 1 hour (forget about the car because of traffic jams).

Also, as a multinational HQ, I would expect more prominence of English, however, there is still a german first culture for many communications, signage, and forms, this detracts international assignments.

Some will be very good friends with someone who is more important.

Managers and senior managers can come on board with no experience. Directors may have 0-3 years of experience. The politics are very thick, and not even close to fair. Being competent in this department is a severe handicap because that makes you a threat.

The girlfriend of the married boss may never come to work, and her job may be dumped on your lap at the last minute. Your ""superior"" coworker may spend all her time working for her contract clients instead of your shared employer, and all her train wrecks may be dumped in your lap. You may be treated as a slave by a boss with dyslexia who searches for typos in your work, can't teach you anything, takes credit for your work, and doesn't know how to lead. None of these people will ever cooperate with you by sharing necessary information or even telling the truth. They actually want you to fail at doing their jobs for them.

High standards of work
Development opportunities. Though it should be noted that some managers treat development opportunities as a bargaining chip e.g. “you can only work on project x if you do it in your own time on top of your normal work” if they know you are interested in something and may concede to their request, whereas someone else who wasn't interested in it would just be given time to work on it.","Too endless to list in this department. Worst thing is the horrific management. Worked in this horrific department for several years hoping things would get better. Roche is a fantastic company to work for but unfortunately you experience a company through the department you’re in and this is a rotten one.
It is incredibly political and competitive with people ready to stab you in the back at any moment. 
The worst aspect of this place is easily the management team as the culture bleeds from the top down. They lack integrity, are not understanding or fair at all and see people merely as pawns to milk everything out of; with 2 of the male managers being the worst. Accusations are constant and you will regularly have to defend yourself. Management are only interested in benefiting themselves selfishly and are more than happy to throw you under a bus to make themselves look better. The manager you get will define your experience of the job, as approaches are inconsistent. 
Worklife balance is non-existent in this place with people being encouraged to work overtime for no compensation everyday until 11pm-2/3am and during weekends. 
You will not get just credit for your effort and results but instead praise and opportunities go to the management’s favourites regardless of their actual ability and performance.  
This department might be alright as a stepping stone or learning experience for a short period of time but I would not recommend it for any long term option. All in all this is a toxic work environment and not a good place for your mental health. I have seen many talented individuals fall foul of this place."

- It's impossible to get fired if you're a full-time employee

- While there are smart people in the software org in Belmont, everywhere else has pretty terrible talent in terms of tech
- Terrible innovation, lots of no, everyone is afraid to change anything
- Outdated technology and systems
- Cheap with employees
- Not very smart people in business, which is why diagnostics is treated 2nd class to pharma
- Recruiting outside Belmont is awful
- SO much bureaucracy it's absolutely frustrating
- Tons of promotions, no development; they happily keep low performing employees
- If you disagree with the status quo you're outcasted, berated, told you aren't ""One Roche"" just because you have a different opinion
- Terrible, I mean terrible, culture
- HR is absolutely clueless in terms of people development, career growth... especially HR leadership"

The company does genuinely promote a good work life balance. Lots of in-house promotion means that the opportunities are abundant.","The culture is interpreted differently depending on which department and which manager. Theoretically you can speak up when things are wrong however it is frowned upon and managers don't have the time to actively listen. People are too worried to speak up about inefficiency and how it can be improved. ""How"" you conduct yourself  is the number one priority in 360 feedback,  therefore people are reluctant to speak up for fear of appearing confronting the status quo.  It appears that management training is not always effective, some are  rapidly promoted  managers  overseeing big teams  who are  under pressure to progress trial conduct. These middle managers lack understanding of site or study operations or regulatory expectations but manage people who work in clinical trial project oversight.  This makes people feel over whelmed with lack of support and clarity and poor onboarding. The on boarding is inadequate given the complexity of the organisation, lack of middle management knowledge of operations, and the numerous systems and platforms. This can  leave an expert CSM or contractor feeling like a rookie when they first join Roche. People stay because it's easy to move on to another role whilst enjoying the benefits. If you play your cards right, keep your head down, work around inefficiencies  and make sure all the right managers know you and  love you, you get ahead. This is what is meant by the ""how"" in real terms."

 Functional experts and people managers seem to be less rewarded  than those that lead high visible projects.

The best thing about Roche is the customer. Get out there and meet them. Thats where the best stories are.,"The company has always been far too internally focused.  It is a deep seated element of the Roche culture that has not been effectively countered and so now it is just being ignored, and consequences are coming to the surface.  Long term internal focus is costly in the long term.   

The company has changed over recent years as margins have dwindled and the diagnostics branch prepares to greet commoditisation of its once dominant product offering. 
Experience as a quality is stepping aside for generic thinking and business-by-textbook. 
The Dx branch did not take enough of advantage of its leading position while its competitors suffered major setbacks.
Now the competition has caught up, it is becoming difficult to differentiate, meaning an increasing reliance on customer loyalty, which benefits from long term relationships with trusted company specialists, whose experience is now undervalued.  Available resources are reallocated to patch ailing hardware that should have been obsolesced many years ago.  

Take your experience somewhere where they know it is valuable and and never let them tell you that you can't do what you believe."

Functional leads and support staff are great to work with, and the work is straight forward.","Middle Management

Some of the directors and senior managers are not competent (many are though).  

The incompetent ones are the obvious elephants in the room, but upper management doesn't seem to reprimand appropriately, and prefers to sweep it under the rug with a guise of using the Culture of Accountability versus tackling the problem head on.  

The incompetent middle management personality types fall into two main categories: they are either never around, or they are micro-managers who don't know what they are talking about and mask their ignorance and incompetence by questioning and talking condescendingly to functional study team members.   

The micro-managers get so wrapped up in details of everything, but they're never around to know the details so they endlessly scrutinize all the work the study teams performs which inevitably stresses out the team members who deal with the details and study work on a daily basis. It would be one thing if they understood processes and had valid, constructive feedback and points to make, but they question and scrutinize for the sake of hiding their own lack of knowledge and to feed their superiority complexes at the end of the day so they can go home feeling accomplished for doing something other than complaining and pushing emails all day.

The micro-managers also have a double standard of what they require of functional study team staff compared to what they provide themselves. They require transparency but do not complete the flow by being transparent downward (even to their own staff); They harp other functional areas to complete dependencies sooner than expected to compensate for their own delays in timelines. 

This ultimately crushes morale and turns staff off from even wanting to interactive with these individuals."

There are many people at Roche in the UK that are deadwood, sitting in senior positions without adding anything to the business. If you work for one of these people then you are generally fine if you can create benefit to them (ie make them look good; allow them to take all the glory) up to a point. However, if you have ambition and want to progress you will find there is little opportunity because of this deadwood. Even if you excel you will rarely find an opportunity because people like to keep you below your capabilities (this has a corresponding effect on pay, whereby Roche is in the bottom quartile of salaries). This has lead to a culture of bullying in the UK, literally dozens and dozens of people have been forced out as they are cheaper to get out the door then the 'lifers' that are bullying.

The jobs are interesting and challenging.,"Roche is a very political organization with very few experienced people in mid- and senior management level positions. Employees are not judged on their contributions; they're often judged based on who likes whom resulting in significant amounts of mobbing (bullying). Consequently, top talent frequently leaves the company and this is weakening their sales and marketing strength. And if you're a woman in the organization, your chances of being promoted to a management position are slim. This is a company that actually has an MBO to promote women into management roles. What does that tell you about how women are really thought of at Roche? If you're a man and you know how to mob your staff, your chances of getting ahead are far more increased. Treating your staff fairly just doesn't seem to be the real Roche way even though you will read that 81% of employees are happy working at Roche. It's rubbish! Don't believe one word that Roche employees are so satisfied with working there. If you are considering a position with this company, don't walk...RUN in the opposite direction!"

Management works with their employees and aims to take care of their own.","Compensation has been declining over the years. Benefits are good, but salaries are low and upper management seems reluctant to keep their pay rates competitive with anything but the lowest of industry estimates. Vertical movement is difficult to achieve. Contract/temp workers are not paid competitively and are 'forced' into cut-rate benefits policies from Roche's choice of staffing firms.

- The trade-off for the great benefits is that salaries can be 10K lower than what you'd find elsewhere for a similar job title/role.
- Success within your career path depends mostly on who you know and how well you fit with your direct manager's personal focus and leadership style.  Employees who are stuck in a rut career-wise can become ""unstuck"" by moving to a different department/manager.

Highly competitive salaries with bonus and depending on your level, stock options.  
They do a great job of providing top notch healthcare, dental, 401k matching and so forth. 
They value personal time and all the managers I had were great to work for except one (he is no longer with the company).  
I would still be with the company if they didn't shut down the location I was at.  
Each time I was impacted by a restructured job,  I was able to get a 10% retention bonus for my stress (you would get it if you stayed to your end date as well).
Very good severance package when large groups are impacted.","I worked for Roche for 14 years and other than the last 5-6 years it was a great company.  My advice is if  you are working for Roche in the IT area, you are at risk of yearly stress of losing your job due to restructuring and sending jobs around the company/world.  In the past 6 years, my job was impacted 4-5 times.   I had to either apply for a new job or take a package and leave.  All of these were due to OPEX realignment of personnel.  Senior management would move head count from one location to another without always understanding what they were doing.  The latest push in the US is to send IT to Genentech in CA, Madrid, Spain or back to Basel, Switzerland.  The Nutley location was closed down after 100 years of service and the US headquarters shifted to Genentech.    

The merger of Roche and Genentech has not been the smoothest.  Each company is still a separate entity and supported by different IT departments.  

Genentech has not experienced the headcount loss experience as of my last day.  They are in for a shock once it does.    You have to keep in mind that Roche is the typical Swiss based company, and Gene is the typical San Francisco company.  They are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum.    Roche is extremely process driven, cost conscious (with regards to IT) and doesn't like to deviate.  Gene is agile and flexible with the mentality of ""get the work done as quick as possible.""  They don't let cost act as barrier necessarily.  Gene is able to bypass process and make their internal customers happy with rapid turn around times.  This is the direction Roche is trying to go but with processes still in the picture."

Many of the younger employees are adventurous and athletic and participate in cycling and hiking and cross fit. Ventana cares about its employees and offers a lot of benefits. Being owned by Roche, there are many opportunities for advancement or relocation, and even just movement within the Tucson location. There are quarterly staff meetings and other events which are catered. The campus is smoke-free! (although this doesn't stop many of the employees from smoking on the sidewalks) and Ventana's management does a lot to promote good health, being a company whose motto is to improve the lives of cancer patients everywhere.","The largest complaint I had was how long it took to push a project through to completion. A lot of this was caused by implementation of Roche policies after the acquisition, and some is caused by a lack of communication between departments, which is a bit baffling when one considers the number of meetings which take place. These issues are ones which I believe plague many larger companies. Ventana certainly continues to make efforts to fix the procedural problems. There are also some issues with using old technology and re-implementing designs which had flaws in the first place, without spending more time and resources for innovation."

- Promotions can be difficult to obtain, at least at the individual contributor/lower management level.  At the same time, remaining in the same position for longer than a few years is a bad idea, as it can give the impression that you aren't interested in taking on new challenges and potentially target you for the next round of layoffs.

The health insurance was just ok. But at least we had health insurance. 

Like a lot of PDI contracts we had to use our own cars and the reimbursement was not that great. 

The biggest con was we were not hired on to be full-time reps. We worked on a contract for over two years  really getting the word out to the HCPs and the company didn't think we were good enough to be part of their actual organization. If they thought there was a big problem, they should have fixed, retrained, and addressed that issue with the currents reps they had. We were very dedicated to moving their sales forward and in the end it was a slap in the face.  Of course, there will always be reps that take advantage of the situation.

Hundreds of people have lost their jobs without ever knowing the real reasons why.  Many people throughout the Roche Divisions live in constant fear of losing their jobs. 

When an individual is  ""re-orged"" out, HR will put notes in the employee file such as ""not eligible for rehire"" - even if the employee was in good standing at the time of the ""re-org"".   In some cases, particularly brutal managers will destroy a person mentally first in hopes that they will quit first - especially if the individual might be up for a severance package if they were to stay and get ""re-orged"" out instead.  

 Individuals in the sales organization have it the toughest.  They are the scapegoats for all the Company's woes.

A root cause of the ruthlessness is the declining business in several of the Divisions and overall inability of the organization to meet profit margins year after year."

- Generally friendly work environment. 
- Majority leadership is genuine and means to do well. Just don't always know how... 
- Multinaltional, international company with great career prospects
- Majority of people I work with are great.","- Highly hierarchical and bureaucratic at times - which creates a very political environment. 
- No work-life balance. Leaders do not care enough about employee well--being. 
- Leaders don't always walk the talk - i think mainly because they don't know how as opposed to being hypocritical
- Bonus system could be better. Performance Management & Compensation system not conducive to innovation or getting the best out of employees - Too short term driven and individual vs. team driven."
3339,Roche,"Good company, but...",2013-05-08,3.0,IT Service Manager,"Salary and benefits are among the best. 
Employees are usually respectful to each other. 
You usually don't have to work overtime.","Very slow decision making processes due to highly bureucratic perspective.

3340,Roche,"Not a good place to work, period.",2013-04-26,2.0,Marketing Research Analyst,"You meet a lot if good-natured people with positive attitudes, but only untill they realize that promised opportunities were just carrots on a stick to get something out of them.  In our division there were few people left with more than 8-10 years experience.  That seemed to be the point where employees gave up trying to work with management and left.  You could see people's demeaner and attitude change the longer the were with us.","They keep the carrot and hit you over the head with the stick.  In 6 years with the company I saw lawsuit after lawsuit by employees and vendors.  Roche has the attitude that they're too big to lose a lawsuit, so they basically enter into contracts and, after getting what they want, they walk away from their end. 

Most co-workers complain that Management approaches them with promises of promotions if they add extra work and assignments.  After the Managers get what they want, there're no promotions.  

Another common practice is that you can't ""resign.""  Many, many ex-employees have found that they can't use Roche as a reference because, when you resign, HR puts ""Terminated"" on your record.   Roche is so paranoid of employees going to the competition or a vendor that they trash your record to keep you from finding another job.   This is begging for a class-action lawsuit.

Each month our department sent an e-mail with the names of employees no longer allowed on the premises and that security should be notified if they were seen.  Each month there were at least 3 new names.  It got to the point of absurdity.  Whether those employees were fired, or resigned and then labeled as having been fired is unclear.  But with what we knew of HR's practice of labeling all ex-employees as having been fired, it really crashed moral."

Honestly, that is really how it has been the entire time that I have been with Ventana.  They manufacture top quality diagnostics products that people can believe in, and that are helping to save lives every day.  The most rewarding part of the job is during the all-employee meetings, Dr. Grogan presents the employees with a case study on a patient where Ventana products have helped to save their life with a focus on personalized medicine.  It is very enlightening, and it definitely lets you know that you are making a difference in the lives of all patients afflicted with cancer, regardless of your role.  Benefits are amazing, and there is a ton of opportunity throughout Ventana and the rest of the Roche community.","Along with the tremendous mass of those who are welcoming, there are some select individuals that I have encountered that are not, but these are few and far between within the company.  Contracted employees be advised, I am currently one and will not be hired on permanently because there is no room in my department.

Benefits are actually pretty good.","Work/life balance can be questionable, depending on your manager.  Too many directors and VP's means that the company is too top-heavy and not enough focus is on what is actually going on.  Quality is spouted as something very important, but it is frequently sacrificed for profit.  There are no career opportunities for hard working employees, though if you are willing to dive into the politics and social aspects of the company, you can move up quickly, regardless of your qualifications.  The cultural beliefs are something else that are propped up as important, but again, if you actually practice them, you get nowhere, especially if you bring up anything negative (such as potential issues).  Finally, there are certain members of HR that seem to have it out for certain employees.  Instead of being fair, they are totally and completely biased and they are never wrong in their own eyes.  If you get on their bad side, you will not be treated well at the company and you will not get the promotions you deserve."

- Business casual attire in many departments, with casual Fridays","- Departments and teams seem to be restructured at least annually.  Upper management's continual shifts in focus and strategy are stressful for employees.
- Company says they value innovation, but in terms of business processes, management and many individual employees appear to have difficulty accepting new ideas or changes to existing processes.  There is a tangible fear of doing things differently, and it can take months or years to get a project completed.
- While company is beginning to take steps to promote employee career development, it is difficult to get a promotion in some departments.  Going above and beyond your job description, and doing outstanding work, aren't enough.  If you aren't perceived as management material and playing into the politics, it can be tough to move out of your current position.
- Company is making attempts to increase diversity at highest levels of leadership, but still has a long way to go.  Company's top executives are all middle-aged white men.  
- Managers and higher levels spend far too much time in meetings and seem disconnected from day-to-day business and their teams, as a result."

The company is in a transition as it becomes more integrated into the Roche culture.,"The company views promotions as a privilege vs.  paying employees for the greater responsibility & more work that will be performed.   The company cannot survive without their Specialists (product-specific experts) to help the Account Executives accomplish their jobs, as selling, contracting, negotiations, etc. are very complicated.  And yet, Specialists make nominally more than Account Executives, even though they work harder & have much more responsibility.

The people are very nice and there are social activities for those interested.  Roche is a stable company that rarely seems to have layoffs and often is buying new companies.,Sometimes upper management seems somewhat distant.

Very sales driven affiliate, sometimes lack of strategy and concentrating on delivering numbers.  Work-life balance is rather poor, it is expected of you constantly to take on new challenges and overachieve. Roche is not interested in keeping people regardles of your track record and seniority. Very hard training on Roche values, if you don't fit in, they will get rid of you rather quickly.

3489,Roche,Frustrating ... uncertain about the direction and strategy for the DC operation.,2012-02-21,2.0,,Benefits and pension plan are generally better than the industry at large.

3492,Roche,Disappointing place with mainly male lead senior management team.,2012-02-04,2.0,,Good pipeline and fellow employees are striving for success but feel time for a senior management shake up as company has grown too fast and too quick and thus too many processes and procedures rather than chances to flex your autonomy.,With it growing very quickly the support functions are massively over stretched and thus very little support given for employees.

Politics is the word of the day at Roche.  If you're politically savvy, you'll go far there. Of course that could be the case with any company, but it plays out more openly at Roche, in my opinion."
3496,Roche,In 30 years working in manufacturing it was the best place I was ever employed at.,2012-01-09,4.0,,"Great pay, benefits and working environment.","Extremely political environment.  If you were not a major brown noser, you were not advanced.  Only those that either kept their mouths shut or cleaned the bosses office were given opportunities to shine.  Providing outstanding performance was not enough, except to keep your job."
3497,Roche,Too much politics.,2012-01-06,2.0,Systems Engineer,The only reason to work here is to get a good foundation and understand the methods of a proven player within the biotech/pharma industry.,The team I worked with was awesome but there is no communication between middle management on project status. One day we are working on a particular project and the next day we switch and just to keep things interesting we switch back on the third day. Too reactive and not proactive. Maybe its the lack of resources and the fact that decisions are made by a bunch of suits that have no clue about the actual work and only care about the bottom line.
3498,Roche,Over worked and over managed,2012-01-04,1.0,Field Service Engineer,"Products provide superior staining, making for fast and reliable patient diagnosis.  Produts are considered ""top of the line"".  Impressive technical apptitude from the support staff.","Poor managment.  Technicians are are given all the responsibilities with none of the authority for most situations.  Expected to put company before family.  Employees are asked to provide ways to improve operations, but when they do, thery are chastised and reprimanded for not being a ""team player"".  In short, the company structure is a ""Comedy of Contradictions""."
3499,Roche,Used to be a good company,2011-12-28,2.0,Informatics Project Manager,"Helping people in need
Good benefits package",Ongoing retrenchments and no thought put into retaining people with experience and redeploying. Spending a lot of money when people are retrenched and in many cases they come back as contractors.
