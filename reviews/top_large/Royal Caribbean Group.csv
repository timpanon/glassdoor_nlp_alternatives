170,Royal Caribbean Group,It was overall a good experience and an eye opener,2021-08-21,4.0,CRM Executive,"As I was the first and the only Local CRM, it was challenging but my colleagues were very helpful. I enjoyed my stay here. My team manager is also very wise, a good leader and I've learnt a lot from her. She's one of the people I look up to even though we don't work together anymore. 

During my time, even the interns, come out learning like as if they worked here full time because the work scope we gave them is always marketing related. I am just not sure if now is still the same.

Dress wise is smart casual.
 
I can't advise on Attendance and Punctuality but when I was there, our manager wants us on time at least. It was pre-Covid so WFH is not really encouraged and managers want to see you in office at least. But when I got into an accident, they allowed me to WFH and I was able to do so for a good 2 weeks at least (I think). I am a diligent worker so I guess they trust that I'll do the job without being monitored. 

There's not much opportunity to climb high the ladder though. The team structure is very small. If you want to get promoted, you'll have to find another job.

The marketing team I belonged to has been one of the department that was dissolved and moved under US HQ. I was only around 5 months in the company when it happened. 2 of my colleagues were retained as their work can't be replicated overseas and needs to be local based. So I'm sure if anyone will join the company and will be working alongside them, they will be in good hands.

Just want to highlight here that during the restructuring, they provided councelling services and gave us an ample amount of time and flexibility to look for another job. I was soon to get married that time and will have huge problem with my pass but the management was kind enough to extend me another month so I won't have issues and can stay long enough to apply for another pass.

I can say the management is pretty generous enough to their employees and ex-employees. Even though I wasn't part of the company anymore, they still extended an invitation to me for the free cruise. I was supposed to get this had I stayed for a year there, only didn't had the chance because of restructuring. When I was still there, the parties had a lot of prizes too. I won a lot of things while I was there. Huge cash vouchers and hotel stays.","Like any other company, as a new joiner, there will be orientation of what the company is about, the business in general, etc. But the actual scope of work you need to do? You'll have to learn it eventually on your own as you do the actual work. The journey is not that smooth. I believe I'm a fast learner but it took me around 3 months before I truly understand all about our product. I thought it's just my learning curve but turns out it's also the same with the other new joiners. The good side of this is that the people (at least the team I was in) were very kind, accommodating so it kinda lifts the heavy burden of the workload."

Stand by cruises for employees! In my experience, most of my co-workers were very nice, hard-working people.","The thing to remember when seeking employment there is that you will be tethered to a phone in front of a computer taking call after call all day long and are expected to adhere strictly to your schedule.  Believe it or not, every minute is measured and affects your ranking.  The lowest ranking employees get the worst schedules, such as working closing shifts and weekends. You will hear about it if you are not in compliance even by a minute! You can be fired for being out of compliance too often. So you literally have to walk around with a timer on you.  I worked there 13 years and for most of that time, supervisors often did not know how to do their jobs effectively or even how to motivate their team without being negative or threatening.  Most of them had been away from being on the phone for so long they could not remember the pressures or demands of the job, so could not adequately lead or even assist their team members.  It wasn't until recently that management started to retrain and evaluate supervisors to make them more effective."

736,Royal Caribbean Group,Disappointing experience,2018-08-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great product, office location and fresh fruit twice a week","Don’t be fooled by the big name, this company does not meet expectations you would have in any way.

- Lack of communication, nobody knows anything, people who execute decisions are missing information to do their job effectively, all in all a pretty big mess
- Senior management acts without any clear strategy, Barcelona managers in general without any idea what they are doing, no competences in managing people, also there appears to be no logic whatsoever in business decisions
- No team events, no real attempts to create a nice company culture
- No professional or personal development, no training (except the access to a LinkedIn learning platform where you do not find any real indepth knowledge), you are not able to learn anything, not even leadership skills because of poor management: managers lack professionalism and cannot be taken as a role model
- Company doesn’t care about professional growth or if you are learning anything
- Officially no flexible hours, no home office, no innovation when it comes to HR
- Toxic work environment where departments work against each other and not together, if any error occurs guilt gets pushed from one side to another instead of finding a solution together
- Zero collaboration, no team spirit to reach goals together
- Employees got paid the minimum they can get away with, not what you would expect from such a well known company
- Offices in other countries have been shut down, now one person does the job which has been done by two or three before
- Nobody listens to country representatives and cares about quality, it seems to be more important to respect hierarchies and keep employee cost as low as possible – shame on you! This is not how you’ll be keeping up with innovation!

Nobody in the office seems to like what they are doing which creates a kind of sad atmosphere, in general not a good vibe, even energetic people lose their motivation after some months in this chaos."

The department ranking, unfortunately, relies heavily on performance metrics that have little bearing on the actual customer service you provided.  The performance metrics can be easily ""gamed"" to improve your ranking, which the department supervisors tend to ignore because the better numbers make them look good to their managers.

You are not a living breathing person, but only a statistic generator and a revenue generator.

Management is completely oblivious and do ""employee engagement"" things that are more appropriate for 2nd graders than grown adults. One example of these is that every day that you meet statistical goals (which is possible, but 100% based on the luck of the draw on your calls) you get a ticket. Collect enough tickets and you can exchange for silly little toys like slinkys or small snacks. If this company used child labor, this would be appropriate.

Management and promotions are EXTREMELY favoritism based. You could have stellar stats and revenue generation numbers, perfect attendance, but if a single member of management doesn't care for you (even if you've never really met them) you are out of luck for any promotion. May as well not even bother trying.

Yes, you get a free cruise after a year there, but to be honest, its not worth it. Would you give up one year of your life for a cruise worth (at most) a thousand dollars? Find a job you love and just buy a cruise."

Some of the policies they create anger the guests who then take it out on the staff.
The create policies they expect you to impose, but when a guest complains, they throw you under the bus, leaving you to take the downfall.
Something in the food is bad, perhaps they use saturated fats or trans fats - during my health checks, it was noted that my cholesterol levels had doubled.
Due to stress my overall health was affected. It was recommended to head office,several times by visiting management, that I be transferred to another ship because the relationship between myself and my immediate supervisor was not a healthy one (she undermined me in front of the team, was unsupportive). However, they ignored this. I learnt that my head of department did not want me to be transferred and as they had so much clout with shoreside, I got stuck with a horrible supervisor, whom shoreside also knew was not a good boss. Yet they did nothing to change this, in the form of accountability.

The call center works on rotating shifts, with 4-month shift bids based on ""metrics"" that are only partially in the control of the employee. ""Compliance"" (adherence to a schedule picked for you) is a big factor in shift bids, but getting stuck on a call that takes you into/over your breaks or lunches is not mitigated at all, making that really unfair. QA scores of your calls are random - seems like the ones you know you ""nailed"" are rarely chosen to be QA'd. Working in a call center is challenging because the rotating shifts make it very difficult to make strong working relationships, which can sometimes make or break an employee's morale.

They have very high expectations for some employees and low expectation for others and the cultures in different offices creates a lot of friction.

Think super market circulars and ads that promote daily deli discounts and you'll be fine. Not much time to concept or dream up the next big idea. Write mediocre copy real fast and you'll make an impression. In the end,  I felt that RC wasn't really interested in copy that set them apart from the other cruise lines. Perhaps they don't need to.

1165,Royal Caribbean Group,"Completely Disorganized, Cheap, High Turnover and Favortisim",2015-03-11,3.0,Technical Architect,"Pay is fair, that's about it.

There are cruise benefits but no one at the company that I know has even gotten on board, meaning it's first come first serve with seniority. 

If you get to travel on the ships there is that, but they will put you in the smallest room possible and usually you'll end up getting sick.","Shoreside the company is a complete mess. I have never worked for a company that was so large but so dysfunctional and unorganized. Managers are not qualified to be managers and hire assistants to do their job for them, vendors are hired left and right with high turnover to cut costs, and many online platforms are outdated or not being used so information is all over the place.

They love to hire recruiters which means high turn over as they use these people on a need be basis. Once they are done with them they hire someone else (to save money) and almost never offer training so people are thrown into projects mid way. Forget about moving to another department or getting promoted within, if you aren't someone's friend in upper management and you mention another position you are more likely to be fired and blacklisted from RCCL indefinitely. 

Most managers are promoted from within, meaning they play favorites and usually hire their friends at the company. Many managers spend their time gossiping at work, walking around and telling jokes, and doing everything but managing others. The managers don't offer constructive criticism, they expect you to know what they are thinking and what they want done at all times and if not they will tell you to go look for jobs at jobs.com. On top of that, most of the managers in the IT department are extremely noisy, they will track your IP addresses and ask other employees to start a file on you if they feel like you are 'not working hard enough'.

One manager asked me to message certain employees friendly questions to 'test' their responses. This manager also was promoted from within and didn't want his job but was forced there, and clearly had no idea how to manage employees as he 'tested' them with sneaky games.

There is no work life balance  shoreside, you are expected to be there early and leave late, work through your lunch break and  be a corporate salve. Most people working are working on specific projects and are not sure what other people that are sitting next to them even do! There are a lot of people who are two faced here, there are a lot of liars, and snakes, it's corporate america's worst nightmare.

There are also multiple online platforms and knowledge bases that are not used or maintained. Information is everywhere and it's disorganized. Things are done and over and over again multiple times because no one knew it was completely the first time!"

From April to October it is VERY normal for 150-200 employees to have been fired EVERY year to which they then hire on the average 250 new employees between October and December.  January through May they hire handfuls of people off and on.

I can see expecting the best from an employee, but if there are complex issues that are affecting the employee there is no one to help out and no time given to work it out.

1219,Royal Caribbean Group,The life of a cruise ship musician is a love/hate relationship.,2014-07-17,3.0,Orchestra Musician/Stage Band Musician,"Travel.  Free food.  Free room.  Lots of free time.  Lots of sun.  Fun people.  Cheap drinks.  Lots of parties.  The chance to make friends from all over the world.  Gain the perspective of people from many third world countries, who are usually working on the ship under different circumstances than you.  Once and a lifetime experiences like skydiving, hiking through the rainforest, snorkeling in the great barrier reef, touring fantastic cities all over the world.

Also playing music every day can be fun.  You might end up with a great band!","First off, the lifestyle can wear you out after a long contract.  The crew areas are not the same as the guest areas.  Extremely small quarters.  Tight, bleak hallways, annoying, ever present hum of the ship's machinery.  Many of the crew members are rude, unintelligent, and have no social skills.  You will not have  a lot of privacy.  As an orchestra musician you will likely have a roommate, and there are very few areas of the ship to find solitude.  

Not much room for upward mobility.  As a musician, you can move up to musical director, but that's about it, and they make only slightly more money than the regular orchestra musicians.
The crew food is often of pretty low quality, and because of cutbacks, is getting worse all the time.  The party scene may become overwhelming.  Many people working on cruise ships are overgrown high school children, and will need a liver transplant by the time they are 40.  ...and probably some therapy.

The musicians might not be that great.  It's kind of a crap shoot.

Best advice I can give: If you have the choice for your first contract, go for a short contract (0-4 months) or a vacation fill."

You are forced to work a ridiculous amount of hours on weekdays and weekends. Your personal life takes a back seat here. There is no such thing as career growth. You will learn nothing other than surviving under the most stressful working conditions I've experienced. I'm no stranger to hard work but the way we were treated was simply ridiculous.  The culture is one that rewards bigotry and incompetence, and punishes good employees and productivity. They have no idea that they're actually hurting themselves.

Gourmet food in the cafeteria for only $4 for a whole meal
State of the art fitness facility with the best fitness coordinator on the planet
Working with travel agents is much nicer than working with direct guests
Incentive pay
Pay is good for this area","1.  Because the groups/STAR department has more training than individual reservations, the company literally dumps calls from 12 different departments on us constantly, but requires us to keep up with the 300 groups assigned to each one of us without giving us extra time off the phone.   If we are five days late making our call outs for group deadlines, we lose our incentive pay, but we aren't given the time to do our jobs.  So, many times we work off the clock so that we can stay on top of things.  Then, when a bunch of people left the groups/STAR department for several other departments, they only hired about 1/3 of the replacements they needed for the people that left, and just increased the number of groups we each have to handle.  Their reasoning was that we are getting our work done, so they don't need as many people.  Right.  It's because we are working without pay so that we don't get penalized for not getting our work done!!!

2.  50% of the shifts offered to us in Springfield either have split days off (like Wednesday and Sunday), or a closing shift.  I understand that they need to staff  the closing shifts, but everyone hates them because we have to clear the queue before we can clock out.  Sometimes we are there an hour after closing.  The company needs to offer higher pay for people assigned a closing shift.  That way, people would take the shift by choice and other people could take some of those primo shifts.  I might take a closing shift by choice if it paid a dollar an hour more.

3.  The new Quality Assurance scoring is ridiculous.   The intent of it is great - better customer service, but they need to make it a coaching thing and not tie it to our incentive pay.  I've rarely seen anything as nuts as this company's new QA system.  It's Alice in Wonderland. 

4.  The top ten ranked people in our department are on leave through the Family Medical Leave Act.  Those of us who show up for work everyday get ranked lower because we get more QA scores and more opportunity to commit some faux pas like saying port charges instead of ""non-commissionable cruise fare.""  If people aren't there, they should not get top ranking.  Those of us who do OUR jobs and THEIRS both, should be rewarded with top ranking."

Too many people worried about their bonus.  Much of their day is spent justifying their bonus.  The profits are not shared with the employees.  Only upper management is rewarded.  They increase upwards of 18-50% in 2010 and the employees received just 3.5%  The cruise request is rigged and you are often not told until the night before if you are approved for a cruise.  Can't use that benefit unless you live in Miami, unless you want to spent a fortune for last minute airfare.  Politics is too huge - and it determines raises and promotions.
