38,SAP,Great company to work for,2022-04-04,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"The people are amazing, and my line of business specifically is very close and everyone is there to help and support one another. I really love how SAP as a company seems to really focus on the small details - like paying for office parking, actioning initiatives around inclusivity and committing to taking action towards a more diverse workforce. The perks are awesome, and there are so many different jobs that it's fairly easy to move around if you find yourself interested in pursuing something else.","Information isn't easily accessible - you have to talk to people who have been around a while to learn most things - because in a company of that size with so many sales streams, it's simply impossible to store information centrally. 
Also - for a software company, the technology we use for creating order forms is absolutely tragic. 
Lastly, the company processes are not built for volume sales - so if you're looking into a sales position make sure you end up in LE."

45,SAP,Good company,2022-04-04,5.0,Marketing,Very friendly work place and people,I don’t think there are any cons
46,SAP,The good and the ugly,2022-04-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Good working environment
- Competent colleagues (depends on dept)
- Good pay (if you are good and push for it)
- Work life balance if you are lucky
- Gym in the office
- Share options (FV of share is questionable tho)","- A LOT of politics and bureaucracy
- Nepotism, called networking here, but no, nepotism
- Some people are in the wrong places. Promoted based on bein good BS artist and overselling.
- Calculation of pay increases is laughable. they say they take into account current and predictable developments, but I could hardly see that
- A LOT of work if you are in finance/accounting, long hours even outside of busy seasons
- To above, if your OT are not paid (not all depts have this), pay per hour is ridiculous for the amount and type of work
- Top management/heads are more often than not absolutely uninspiring and BS their way and you to squeeze more work and cut cost (hi ""Agile mindset"")
- ""SAP Talk"" -> no standard or structure whatsoever, not enforced, not tracked, hence unclear and impaired development, future career prospect are vague. Only few managers really care about you growing into strong professional and are capable of listening to your development needs.
- Development is impaired also due to unavailability of budget for it (there simply isn't any). All internal offerings are a complete waste of time and bring little to no additional value, better sign up for some linkedin training (which is thankfully sponsored by SAP) or better yet invest yourself into some quality certifications/education, the company won't spend a cent on you unless you are an executive. --> They say most learning is on the job, which is fair enough, but what it means is that they throw it all your way and you have to figure it out, cause noone really knows details (especially if the person doing it before left the company). Can I call it good learning? Yes. Quality learning? Hell no."

- Great support with customers from higher-ups. Support with regards to hostile customers was beneficial
- Good benefits in terms of pension and insurance
- Flexible hours","- Salary is much lower than colleagues in EMEA.
- Salary and benefits are also lower than average in the Dublin market.
- Bonus is less of a bonus and more of the remainder of your salary being paid out.
- No meaningful pay rise was paid out in 2021, which impacted take-home pay during times of rapidly rising inflation.

- Customers were very tough to work with sometimes; with some being hostile and rude. Had a number of customers openly swear towards me during services and question the competence of SAP experts due to communication issues.
- Customer Technical Quality Managers were often unable to present customer objectives to us and also lacked ability to effectively plan services. 
- Lack of a definitive training and development plan.
- Training material is often cumbersome and near impossible to find in times of urgency with no clear resources available.
- Senior team members would hold back training materials to increase their productivity rather than ramp up colleagues.
- Senior team members would also be double or triple booked on services, causing services to be unavailable for junior team members to develop their skills and knowledge on services. 
- US and Latin American shifts were assigned to engineers with very little noticed

- Awkward work environment at times, due to an almost high school like dynamic - almost bullying in some places.
- In addition, some older colleagues were bordering on harassment to younger employees in the company; particularly female associates and interns.
- Heavy competition between managers which can be disruptive."

Comp and benefits are great.,"One's overall experience is driven by the individual's reporting line. My experience was horrible. I was marginalized and harassed by my manager. Expectations were rarely defined and unclear when they were. SAP owns Qualtrics which is leveraged internally for evaluations of management. These surveys carry weight at the LOB level but don't seem to resonate at lower levels.

There is significant technical debt and an aggressive high risk, high reward plan to close that gap. Time will tell, but the practicality of that plan has to be questioned.

- best organisational culture!! There is NO other company that does Everything possible for its people and for the world. This includes: 
* best inclusion & diversity policy! - I feel that now it's ""trendy"" to promote diversity, but for most companies it's just marketing. However, SAP takes so many steps to promote real diversity (gender-wise, neuro-diversity, belief & orientation diversity). 
*best environmental policies! - going zero (zero waste, zero emissions, zero poverty) 
* best initiatives for education, especially in poor countries 
*a lot of benefits for employees: - transportation allowance, food allowance, private pension, shares, library subscription, 7card, incentives, bonuses, more vacation days than required by law
- being a big company, you will work with teams all over the world (or at least the continent where you're based), as such you will most likely get the chance to travel 
- opportunities to grow inside the company
- constant surveys about the work environment and what more you could wish (and they actually act according to results)
- FLEXIBLE workplace - flexible locations, flexible hours (according to how much your actual job allows)
- continuous trainings 
- onboarding process 
 - individual learning - there are a billion resources to help you learn whatever you feel you need in your job","- continuous trainings - while it is also a big pro, can be a con when you are too busy with your current tasks
- individual learning - while I personally love it, I know from past experiences that some people don't cope with learning on their own.

Compared to other companies, SAP is well run, professional and courteous (something I have grown to respect the more I move through professional life). One caveat is it really depends on your line of business. 

I have good memories of SAP and I found majority of people in there to be very nice in general.

I found SAP a nice place to work and never felt under undue pressure. One thing I found with SAP is its technology is everywhere so if you get good at ERP type technology it can open doors in lots of other companies. 

Benefits are ok, I found the stock plan was a great way to save and I generally maxed it out each month.

Most of the management I found ok to deal with and in general nice. No big complaints or conflicts. Most managers SAP put in place are fairly competent and in general, sane. (This may sound like PR speak but that is my honest experience).

I also found they are sincere about outreach things like including colleagues with autism, disabilities etc. Its a place that is respectful of differences. In general a chill place to work. However on the flipside it isnt overly PC or forcing certain things.","Certain lines of business of business have varying reputations. Some of them are overworked and over stressed which accounts for a lot of turnover. There is a obsession with SLA's often to the detriment of further learning or root cause (despite what management say).

Compared to other tech companies SAP payscales are a bit anemic. If you are on a low grade it can take a long time to get up the payscale.

SAP is also slow for pay rises and people will walk out the door who really should have been taken care of better. There is a lot of attrition in certain sectors because of this.

I felt attitudes towards things like getting certifications or getting further education to be not the best. 

One manager point blank told a colleague he should have a think if he really needed a certain course. I found that a bit limiting.

Pay is also slow to come and with the landsape the way it is, its easy to get payrises across industry.

Galway location is in general a glorified support hub with some additional development work."

SAP has also an incredible work environment, full of interesting challenges and projects across several industries and specific SAP products. People have the ability to shift within SAP Products from time to time. SAP has been always, by nature, a company that incentivized it's employees in continuous learning but there was often the question of time. I believe is now progressing to a more openness culture of providing such time as technology is shifting and people need continuous learning to be up to date with SAP tools and management is recognizing such effort demands.","Company is still shifting from OnPrem world to Cloud and therefore some areas are still walking this road, for example Product Management knowledge sharing and release management is difficult to access. Specific information not yet available but demanded by customers can take some time to be available. Seems that still there is few people managing each area and who can provide important insights to customers. This is one of the biggest handicaps at the moment in my opinion."

If you feel stressed you can focus on alternative work different from the daily. You can go to different kind of conferences, you can choose from variety of trainings, you can work on yourself and etc.

It's a great place if you consider yourself for proactive person who will have the freedom to express creativity.

There are a lot of people which can learn from. There are accessible tools which give us the possibility to connect with different specialists and have nice guidelines from them. The people are very open to self improvement.","The bad things at SAP Bulgaria which are frustrating and really future deciding is that all of the processes are incredible slow and the salaries are far from competitive which leads to a lot of attrition. Leads to loosing key members from the teams, leads to destroying good bounded teams with great cohesion...

Also SAP lack of fast adaptability in the current dynamic life. They are loosing ground and positions compared to a lot of companies with their slow decisions.

At SAP Bulgaria the salary raises are incredible low. Not sure if there is lack of investment or something bigger in the mind of the people with power. It's unbelievable how slow you go up financially compared to a lot of companies in our local region.

If want to progress fast and you are expecting to be paid well for that - SAP Bulgaria is not the company for you. You will feel unappreciated and unmotivated, because you will be disappointed how SAP Bulgaria value your work financially over your progress. Of course this could change in the future if appropriate investments are made."

They hire mainly on contracts and once your contract is over, unless you’re best buddies with the manager, there’s a good chance you’ll be let go and they will just hire a new employee on the same contract you started on to replace you. Not only that, there’s a good chance you’ll have to train the person who will replace you! 

Working under the contract agency limits you so you can’t attend social working events and even have a separate Christmas party to your colleagues who have a permanent position. You don’t get any bonus or overtime pay. You are expected to keep adding to your workload with new responsibilities as time goes on and no additional pay. Very clicky management, in order to progress anywhere, you need to be close with management.

You get sufficient breaks.","upper management can get hooked on emerging technologies and try to push for new things that do not necessarily improve our workflows. Worst case scenario, they will completely change out our tools every few years.
Progression can also be slow compared to other companies. People tend to stay in their positions for quite a while, so vacancies will tend to be in other departments. Frankly I consider this to be a plus, but I understand some people dream of climbing the corporate ladder, so I placed it here."

1378,SAP,"Good company, but serious flaws",2021-11-02,2.0,Senior Business Architect,"- many, well meaning colleagues
- global structure
- market leader 
- work/life balance ok","- if you are not an executive yourself, your job and main purpose is to make the executives look good and successful
- strict top-down culture
- visibility is often more important than competence 
- if you want to make career, you would have to be part of one of the buddy circles, where positions are deployed among them. Otherwise T4 is a hard-stop for your development.
- clear two-class-society in career chances: If you are sales/quota carrier, all doors are open for you, if you are working in presales, consulting or development, your job is to make quota carriers achieve their numbers, nothing else.
- clear two-class-society in benefits: if you are sales/quota carrier, many benefits financially and non-financially (Hawaii) are possible, so a self-optimizing culture within the quota-carriers is normal. If you are not part fo that, bad luck for you, you get far less of the cake (if at all). 
- Everything is marketing now. As much as SAP does heavy marketing to the outside world (everything is ""improving peoples lives"" or ""save the world""!) as much it does in the meantime the same marketing to the inside. But thats logical: Since everybody wants to appear successful, this is the way to go and huge efforts are spent to make her/his product, area, offering etc. look 
- Especially to the inside HR is doing HEAVY propaganda how great everything is at an amount that is at times grotesque.
- Since now the new KPIs are on gender-equality, at times competence does not matter at all and promotions are given that are non-reasonable and frustrate many competent colleagues (of all genders)."

It's difficult to keep track of each one that is required. 
2- Timecards are really difficult to complete and are very closely monitored. Project managers are assessed on how much of their day is spent on actual customer interaction rather than getting through internal admin work in a timely manner. 
3- Salaries for project managers are really low in comparison to the rest of the industry.
4- Project managers are stretched and required to manage too many projects simultaneously, this ends up causing an issue for customers when project timelines are missed. 
5- Not all senior management are good for their teams, some of them do not offer very good support like their counterparts.

Fantastic travel opportunities (pre-pandemic)
Most people have wonderful personalities and are truly decent human beings","Too many organizational shifts. Having atleast 1 new manager every year is the norm, and going back and forth on ""new direction"" is also very normal.

Too stuck in old ways of thinking for tech companies, hard to implement change without getting hammered with corporate red tape.

HR is the biggest problem (with the exception of the Diversity and Inclusion Pillar which is phenomenal. ). There's very low EQ for alot of the HR staff and many of them have long tenures so they are just coasting at this point. Even when doing internal transfers, HR can be terrible. Direct quote from HR during an internal transfer when negotiating level and salary cap ""If money is all you care about, maybe SAP is not the company for you."" Why would you say this to someone who already works for SAP? 

I also think there needs to be better company wide training and evaluation on how to deal with situations of harassment in the work place as HR consistently botches the handling of these type of situations. Again, the exception is the Diversity and Inclusion division of HR which is top notch at SAP."

Where do we/what do we do by taking leaves?? Not all employees are at safe location. Also previously there was some flexibility with each team allotted budget, to use it in a better way & more options.This year the policy is like, those team budget can be used only for lunch, dinner/virtual events. Why SAP restricting these much with lunch & dinner even at pandemic situation & majority of the employees are not happy with this proposal, still forcing some things just in favor of some management. This kind of behaviour seems to be like SAP is becoming like a service-based company and has reduced value of employees concerns. There are very less onsite opportunity for senior employees in Labs India Bangalore.
Even though its a german based company, there is no facility with in SAP Labs India, to learn german. Atleast other companies provide the same."

There was quite a bit of resistance to the SAP culture over the past few years. Now that the changes are taking shape it is easy to realize that SAP has a more sustainable structure and plan for the future. My company had more of a wild west mentality that smoothed over some problems with agility and talent in a few departments. Now that markets have matured it is obvious that those less talented departments needed to be revamped. I have confidence in SAP to manage that task going forward.,"It is a very structured organization that has many layers compliance.

This probably depends on the position you are appliying for, but in most of the times I see people being hired due to politics stuff (they know the manager or know someone else in the area) instead of good skills. 
The hiring process in general lacks on transparency. 
This is pretty common issue in the corporate world but I have high expectations from SAP so this is still a problem here.

The second major issue that I see in the company is the career progress, but this probably also depends on the area you are working on. Even if you are performing better than others, this wont make too much difference on your career progress like salary increasing or promotion."

Most coworkers are great, friendly and always willing to help.
Great Work-life balance.","Almost everything used at SAP, at least in my team and department is proprietary, so you will become out of date with current technologies and this will make switching companies or even jobs inside the company really hard.
Managers are completely out of date with current technologies and prefer doing things the old way. A promotion will take years and normally people are promoted based on their relation with their managers. 
Code is extremely bad, there is no accountability. Some senior programmers who have been years in the company are extremely condescending and even aggresive if you question their methods.

2982,SAP,Great Place to Work!,2021-05-05,5.0,Technology Solution Director,"SAP takes care of it's people and is a highly matrixed organization that focuses more on getting work done and less on organizational reporting hierarchies. SAP is the worldwide leader of enterprise software focused on enabling key business processes. They are constantly innovating and have had good success with HANA, S/4 and their cloud integration and extension strategy. SAP's industry depth and expertise is unmatched. SAP Account Executives have executive level relationships at most of their accounts, which makes it easier to upsell other complimentary solutions into the same organization.","The gravity of the organization lies in Walldorf, where most of the engineering leadership resides. On the technology side, SAP has a unique, non-standard vocabulary (Cloud provider = Hyperscaler, Enterprise Data Warehouse = Business Warehouse, Meaures = Key Figures, etc.) The marketing of SAP tends to be 12-18 months ahead of reality."

2994,SAP,2 years at SAP Concur that unfortunately ended on a sour note,2021-05-03,3.0,Market Development Representative,"- The office environment was quite fun, especially in 2019. Everyone was very sociable, jokey and fun to hang around with.

- The SAP name. This is what draws a lot of people to join Concur despite the slightly lower than average salaries. Having the SAP name on your CV is very valuable.

- The SAP benefits. The share scheme in particular is great. You also have access to great internal resources such as training, career coaching.etc

- There have been some really great characters throughout both the MDR and RSE team (and actually some of the RSD's too). I have made some friends for life here.

- You are really forced to be innovative and hard-working if you want to see success here, so there is a lot of room for personal growth. The Concur product is considered a 'nice to have but not a priority' by most businesses, and currently sits in a mature market with new competitors popping up every week. Navigating these challenges is great for your skill growth, as this really represents being 'chucked in at the deep end'. If you can find success here, you can kill it at ANY other SaaS company.

- Pre-2021, there was actually a decent vibe about Concur. We had nice company days out (watching the horse racing, a sports day, BBQs and a solid Christmas party) and the office was quite fun to be in. We'd regularly go for drinks in Maidenhead, and would quite often go out in Reading. Even when we were forced to work from home, we had plenty of virtual socials and other bits of fun.","- As of January 2021, there were 15 active Outbound MDRs in Concur UK SMN (a few others were on long term sick leave). Leadership decided that they weren't happy with the MDR team's performance, and instructed the MDR managers to put 9 of us on 'performance improvement plans'. This was done very quickly without prior warning, and the plan targets were so high that they were basically unobtainable, essentially managing a bulk of the team out the door. All 9 of us have found new jobs and resigned in advance of being dismissed. A vast majority of those pushed out were only hired in March 2020, and so had only worked during the pandemic, yet everyone was made to feel like they were individually incompetent and lazy, rather than recognising the obvious challenges of selling Travel and Expense software in a pandemic when no one is travelling or expensing.

- The Senior leadership team are (for the most part) young and inexperienced. Many have no experience/training from other SaaS or tech companies, and a few key figures joined Concur in its heyday between 2004-2013 when the business was drowning in inbound leads and tearing up a largely untapped market. The same leaders now have no idea how to navigate a mature market with new competitors popping up every day, let alone a pandemic where demand for our two biggest products (Travel and Expense) is almost none.

- Managerial tasks such as Salesforce report building, managing inbound leads and helping new starters quite often get taken on by subordinates as certain managers are unwilling to do them, or learn how to do things they don't understand. They focus on busybody work like drafting long corporate internal emails/teams messages, gathering feedback for marketing or copious team meetings and 1 to 1's rather than effective deep work that would really help the team perform better against their quotas like identifying good accounts, building reports and helping out with some prospecting where appropriate.

- Whilst not a widespread issue at Concur, I have seen bullying behaviour. We saw an individual MDR called out for missing a marketing lead (an easy to make mistake on our complex and messy Salesforce) on a Microsoft Teams call in front of the entire company (hundreds of people). Another MDR was also harshly interrogated during a standard territory mapping presentation - the MDR in question was struggling with a terminally ill father. Such behaviour seems to have been swept under the rug thus far.

- In 3 years there have been 4 people promoted from MDR to RSE (roughly 1-2 per year). I would not join as an MDR if you have serious aspirations to be a software salesperson as you would be taking a massive gamble with the odds stacked against you. Even consistently good performance is no guarantee as I've seen brilliant candidates with very high quota attainment turned down. You'd do well to invest your time somewhere else where there is a more well-trodden path of promotion.

- The Concur product is a bit old and tired, plus it is expensive and struggles to compete with the slicker competition in the SMB space (think of how the technology of Monzo compared to the older, traditional banks in the UK a few years ago).

- For a SaaS company that sells a product that is supposed to remove manual data work, SAP Concur doesn't drink it's own medicine. They have only just implemented a basic version of RingDNA, and don't really have any other modern prospecting tools/software that are almost the industry standard in other SDR teams in other companies. They don't have Outreach, Gong, SalesLoft, Lusha, Hunter, Refract or any other modern prospecting tools, and instead manually dial numbers from a slow Salesforce CRM. When I joined we were still prospecting using desk phones!

- There is quite a lot of snakey behaviour from a few particular RSEs. I had to consistently fight off said RSEs from poaching my opportunities, using the ever-changing rules of engagement and labyrinth-like CRM as a cloak over their actions. Favourite top-performers break rules all the time and don't get so much as a slap on the wrist."

Access to trainings and learning resources
Opportunities to work at Labs campus","All the pros mentioned are directly controlled by your ""Peoples"" manager. He/She has all the power and liberty to decide whether you get to enjoy these perks offered. Thereby allowing room for bullying, toxicity and harassment.
Most of these Peoples Managers are like government employees who don't keep them selves upto date with the current work culture. Most of them don't even have proper soft skills to talk coherently with their subordinates. How do you expect them to recommend trainings and guide their subordinates?
Projects and billing hours are a priority in SAP SDC India, with little or no room for innovation. Despite raising this issue in the Employee Survey, my manager downplayed the concern in group meeting with no hope of any improvements.
I personally experienced a stressful and toxic environment despite my organic curiosity in technical workings of SAP cutting edge technologies.
Where an average SAP SDC project lasts from 1-4 months, I was working in a project for over 4 years. This was because I delivered over and beyond for my client with custom solutions. I got little to no support from my competency colleagues during all the 4 years of my project tenure. Most of them had no inclination towards custom solution development. I don't know if this was also because of general mentality to stick to SAP standard solutions or personal grudges held against me by the competency lead for DMLT department.
The DMLT competency lead in Bangalore is one of the most toxic personalities I met in my 10 plus years of career. He holds personal grudges against employees if they are doing well or speaking better in group meetings. He has serious insecurities and psychological issues which haven't been addressed. Many internal employees I personally know have problems with him but only handful have complained to HR. The HR has been burying the complaints against this character since the time I quit the company in 2020, as I didn't see any action taken against the DMLT competency lead."

3220,SAP,You better think twice,2021-04-09,2.0,Software Developer,"- Above average social benefits package
- Not the worst place to be when it comes to stress levels","Working Environment:

- Almost absolute lack of management empathy
- No feedback is being given from managers. Goals and expectations towards employees are either expressed in a vague manner or not at all.
- It's not uncommon for L1 managers to have zero technical competences and / or absolutely no leadership skills. As a result new hires unknowingly end up playing a game of ""Russian roulette"" with their careers.
- Most of the time L1 managers are in pursuit of expanding their teams with no real reasoning from business point of view and with no plan on how to onboard and grow over time the new hires.

Workplace:

- A total of four offices within the city of Sofia all of which offer a different environment and employee benefits, making it quite unfair for some.
- Some of the office buildings are pretty much impossible to go to - no public transport, a handful of parking places etc.
- With the growing number of employees and the poor planning offices are now ""crowded"". This makes it practically impossible to accommodate new hires or even book a meeting room.

Products:

- Plenty of politics and unfair internal competition within the company.
- Future vision and company strategy are just a bunch of buzzwords - there's a pressing need of an internal restructuring, laying off the poor performing employees in the process.
- TTM, TCO and ROI are just terrible. It's not uncommon for products to spend years in the making before being ditched without ever ""going live"" due to their business irrelevance."

Relaxed atmosphere in the office

Good location for me","Salary is an complete joke compared to competitors. The yearly increases in salary Sap Ireland gives to their employees is laughable. This is because the Ireland location is treated a low priority area from top tier management. 

After a more than year you get very demotivated to work due to this as no matter how hard you work your not rewarded sufficiently. Most employees feel the same way hence they end up leaving for a better wage elsewhere.

Employees are not been given the change to work from home full time after the pandemic. For some reason the company thinks that employees must be in the office because ""collaboration"" is better in the office :/. Other rival companies and most IT companies have given this option to their employees full time. Yet SAP are always a step behind. They wont even consider this for peoples personal reasons."

The company has completely slept through so many occasions to grow, that it hurts. The only growth the company comes up with is to the cost of its own business and via acquisitions.  HANA was the last big product that really hit the market. That was 2011! Doesn’t speek for ingenuity."

- Team support and environment is great;
- Can sometimes work from home;
- You get to work on international projects with people from all over the world","This is a review for SAP NSC, which means, this is a consulting job.
As a consultant, I don't feel I really belong to THE SAP, and this is due to the fact that I have the quality of life of a consultant, meaning I have to be available for anything the client wants, and I thought, being at SAP, I would be more protected from this than from other consulting companies, but I've found that not to be the case. For me, this is the biggest con. So, manage your expectations for that, if you're thinking about joining SAP NSC.



- Although it's SAP, in my case it's services (a.k.a you're really just a consultant), so everything depends on the project/client you get;
- This means work-life balance is not great
- Lot's of stress (depending on the project)
- Pays less than normal consultant firms in Lisbon
- You don't have a lot of say in what you do, simply because you depend on which projects ""come up"", and have a high-level pressure on SAP NSC to have ""100% allocation"" to projects

- Not really a con, I guess, but being that you get to know and work with people from SAP who come from all over the world, it really puts into perspective how much less you're paid for ""more"" work, and can really compare quality of life with these international colleagues, which is a bit demotivating."

- Culture: The company is really big, and as ever big company sometimes things go slower than expected but there's huge opportunity if you want to innovate collaborate with different areas and projects. The best thing for me is the availability of people from all over the world to help, to teach or guide you in anything you need. 
- Learning: As a tech company with solutions for end-to-end business processes, you'll learn A LOT about different industries and business processes and you'll have ot become not only a tech expert but a business process expert, so if you have a learning mindset, this is a great company to be in since you'll work with the biggest companies from all aorund the world to solve their challenges.","Leadership less focused on career develoments: Sometimes is unclear the path for growth in each role and it feels that it may take longer than expected to grow , which is why a lot of competitors steal great talent form SAP. Although there are great leaders all around the company, a lot of them are way more focused on achieving the results than on the growth of their team, so there's room for improvement here. 

Other than that, SAP is by far the best company I've worked for and HIGHLY recommend it."

- Flexible work environment with options for job sharing, part-time schedules, telecommuting, etc. that supports better work life balance
- Good career opportunities for all, as demonstrated by a diverse leadership team at mid-management level","- Company-wide vision, yet area-specific execution plans often results in success in 1 area and inefficiencies (e.g. integration challenges) in other areas
- In select areas, the siloed thinking is actually at leadership level and not operational level where it is preached as at operational level, everybody feels the pain of ineffectiveness or inefficiencies and will pull together to improve things
- Frequent (at least annually) reorganizations with seemingly no lookback on lessons learned from previous reorganization

Words of advice to leadership:
- Besides having a unified vision, a helpful add-on would be holistic execution plans for all areas
- ""Be the change you want to see in the world"" by consistently demonstrating collaboration across groups (e.g. diverse SteerCo members for projects, partner more with other groups for deliverables, set up peer reviews for projects and deliverables, etc.)"

We have this one pager site wherein we can see how we can cope at the same time still doing our best in our every task. They also provide different health programs and even personal learnings that we can do while on lockdown. As I must say, it's my 4th year and still happy.","Since we have different locations, as much as I wanted to meet all my colleagues from my team, I can't because I need to travel to the other side of the world.

- While it is pivoting to a more customer centric org, it used to be a very old school 'sales organisation' with processes setup to benefit mainly sales reps. These processes still exist so it can end up being a tug of war with the sales team. The processes also enables the sales team to go rogue at the expense of other teams.

With the COVI-19 situation, we had no redundancies and people were at the heart of all initiatives.","HR policies are complex and not retention oriented, meaning that to have a salary increase or a promotion will be easier to leave the company and come back so you are not held back by HE internal policies. So loyalty doesn't pay off. SAP can have an open position with the budget approved for it, but if you are internal is more likely that you won't get that package that the external will get, only because increase in more than x% are not allowed."

- Genuine and compassionate management
- Amazing pay and other non-tangible perks. Good progression considering the size
- You spend everyday working with some of the most polite and intelligent colleagues there are out there!!!","- Some days are longer than others
- The product portfolio is unnecessarily complex at times
- The ‘old guard’ processes can cause unnecessary headaches"
5131,SAP,Lack of investment in employees,2020-09-29,3.0,Development,A lot of great people at SAP,It is much harder to get converted to a full employee at SAP than any of the other places I've worked for especially during this pandemic. Though there are early talent programs they are not hiring as much right now. It is a disservice to the recent graduates as they have no way to enter the company full time.
5132,SAP,Pretty good,2020-09-29,4.0,Project Manager,Culture and flexibility is highly valued at Concur,Currently no cons to give SAP Concur
5133,SAP,Join if you want to make the company better,2020-09-29,3.0,Technical Program Manager,"SAP North America's benefits are slightly above average for a company of its size. They have pretty standard dental, medical, vision, 401k, parental leave, and PTO. One perk is unlimited sick days. Their employee equity plan has relatively no strings attached. The one downside is that they partner with an obscure company out of the UK. Customer service is poor, and their investor portal has a lackluster UI.

The people are nice, and everyone is well-adjusted to remote work. They don't mind kids or dogs in the background of virtual meetings. A perk (at least for me) is that SAP does not require video during virtual meetings. There's sort of an unspoken rule not to use video. I personally enjoy it. I can dress comfortably, and I'm not distracted about how I look on camera.

North American leadership is very community minded. When tragedy strikes, they respond. They've created relief programs for natural disaster victims. After George Floyd was killed, they hosted multiple All Hands sessions and diversity education sessions. They testified in front of Congress. Even now that Black Lives Matter isn't making headlines, they continue to promote minority causes and small businesses. They are not afraid to ""get political."" One of SAP's core values is inclusion, and North American leadership works hard to foster that. SAP in principle is a progressive, equal opportunity employer. For example, they had training about non-binary individuals before it became ""mainstream."" They also have an Autism at Work program.

It's very possible that you'll work with people who are all over the world. It can be very rewarding (and something to brag about).

The North American offices are LEED certified, which means they pass stringent environmental standards.","Right now, the SAP I love looks very different. From my perspective, global leadership's attitude has been essentially, ""Shut up and do what I say."" They don't understand or care about how our internal processes work. They've forced us to roll out solutions that aren't ready for customers, or solutions that customers don't even want. In order to meet their deadlines, we have to implement complex manual workarounds to get the job halfway finished. To be fair to current global leadership, SAP's processes were complicated before. Unfortunately, selling has always been the primary goal. We have a poor track record of actually delivering quality service. But the current pressures we're facing are making things worse. Add all of the COVID complications, and now you have a place that really isn't fun to work.

Though SAP's pledge of inclusion is admirable, it is not always practiced. Hiring practices can be elitist. To be frank, leadership is primarily white men and high caste Indian men. Our current Board is all white, mostly German, and only has one woman (there will be two when 2021 starts). Our first female Co-CEO—a loyal, beloved member of SAP—""parted ways"" with the company less than a year after she was appointed. 

Overall, I am disappointed in the current state of the company. I think it has potential to be a great company, but not with the current people in charge. 

If you want to make the company a better place to work, then please join us. If you're just looking for a job, I recommend looking elsewhere."

5216,SAP,Cutting Edge.  Industry bellwether. Employee Centric.,2020-09-23,5.0,Product Strategy Director,"Working at SAP gives me a sense of pride. When you walk into a meeting with a customer, you are looked at not as a software provider but as an advisor to the business. This is because the offerings that SAP brings to its customers are often the market defining products. So we have a direct influence in shaping the markets that we operate in. 

Having worked in the software industry for the last 15 years, I can say that it’s not just the products of SAP but also the employee policies here that are a topic of envy. And this is not just related to the remuneration. SAP takes a genuine effort in its employee well-being through a host of engagements. Right from day one you get the feeling that you are part of a large family and it creates a true sense of belongingness and camaraderie. SAP is quick to adopt and very often at the forefront in defining employee policies that are in step with the changing dynamics of the workforce. 

From a career progression standpoint, the worldwide presence of SAP and the comprehensive portfolio of products, made it possible for me to explore multi-disciplinary and multi-region career options. Overall the combination of a market leading product with a truly employee centric philosophy is what makes the SAP culture stand out on its own.","Reacting to a dynamic market requires constant changes in strategy and in an organization the size of SAP this becomes a change management challenge.

The salary was very small for students and to receive the position takes just very long like 2 years

My mentor was very rude and unfriendly and did not communicate with others about the learning plan which he established and I was held accountable for it

Many students were excluded one by one (in time i was working there) for reasons like: ""you're not communicative enough"" or ""
you don't have a very good relationship with your mentor"" , ""you're stubborn"" etc.

The newcomers had to learn theoretical things and we were listened to every day like at school if we learned them and we had to make presentations every week where a lot of pressure was put, they asked us practical questions (although we didn't do those things practically) and they were never satisfied(
especially the manager).

The most of the colleagues were unfriendly and did not have the curiosity to meet the new ones.

5499,SAP,"Great place to work, learn, grow and continuously develop",2020-08-28,5.0,Vice President,"Despite being the world’s industry leader for business software, SAP managed to keep a “small team” feeling - where colleagues work in a respectful and agile way. Key focus has been, and is, to deliver value for SAP’s customers (internal and external). From smaller enhancements to reimagining entirely new business processes, SAP brings some of the smartest people in the industry together to drive and solve tomorrow’s technology innovations. Knowing that a majority of the world’s economic activities are processed on SAP systems, and seamlessly connecting producers of goods with consumers, makes us proud. Knowing that many of our technologies and financial contributions are used to help and better the life’s of less fortunate world citizens, shows commitment to purpose and heart.

SAP’s management solicits and uses employee feedback in its daily business practices resulting in an environment of trust, respect, and genuine practice of “employees are the most valuable asset”. Being part of the SAP family means, one never runs out of options to further develop, learn, grow, and take advantage of opportunities. There are thousands of colleagues that are ready to support, be it for business mentorship, a personal challenge, or simply to have a friendly competition of encouraging fitness tracking as part of work-life balance and a healthy lifestyle.

SAP has generous benefits and pay – which is only one part of the equation. The boundless opportunities, with learning opportunities, advice and mentorship – as well as the ability to work with and learn from top international industry talent is a priceless experience not many companies can match. I can highly recommend SAP to anyone looking for a true opportunity that goes beyond of just being a job.","At times, the things that make SAP such a great company, like individuality, innovation, autonomy in one’s job, can be the biggest challenge. 

Establishing a good network of key contacts from day one is a must, and allows tracking and following of new developments across the entire organization – even outside one’s business area. Find a good mentor and be prepared to work in a “team work” approach. 

While working remote might be acceptable, working closer to an official office location may also help with establishing those relationships (though most leadership is distributed throughout the world, as in many global companies). 

SAP being an European company, the treatment of employees is very fair and considerate (maybe more so than many US companies) yet they are not immune to continuous changes in the industry, which leads to organizational enhancements from time to time (for the most part not reductions, yet changes in managers or teams). These will be easier to digest with a good network and a positive attitude in place."
5500,SAP,Very good pay and work environment. Perfect Work/Life balance,2020-08-28,4.0,Solution Architect,"Work from home (even pre covid), flexibility. Good pay and great pension.",Strategically speaking SAP is a bit lost. It has accumulated this massive techinical debt over the years and now needs to be agile enough to compete.

5505,SAP,Great culture!,2020-08-27,5.0,Customer Engagement Executive,"Good people, great pay & wonderful culture",Growth & promotional opportunities are limited
5506,SAP,"SAP may be okay, but life at the Concur subsidiary is misery",2020-08-27,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,I honestly can't think of any. All of the ones I can think of would be disguised insults.,"Concur cares about you. They think. As long as you are exactly the same as everyone else at Concur. As long as you don't complain about anything that happens to you at Concur. As long as you keep your head down. As long as you don't ask for any assistance from outside your team. As long as you don't complain when your assignments are literally impossible without assistance that you can't get. (As long as you can prove that you were working very hard and producing a product, it doesn't matter that it does not and cannot work.)

Concur seems to have a management training program which turns out people who exult in trying to make every employee like every other employee. Two employees have different strengths? NOT ON MY WATCH. We will not assign people to tasks that they excel at. And if we accidentally do, then we will make sure that, if your task is not high status, you will not get any promotions or significant pay increases, no matter how important that job is.

Nothing gets done at Concur unless you know someone. Filing a ticket because you need a static IP address at your desk, so you can do tests? It won't be denied, it will simply languish for six months, until you contact this guy you know who tells you who would know who to talk to, and three hours later you've tracked down someone to take care of your problem, and an hour after that it's done. Woe betide the remote employee who doesn't start out with an automatic support network of the people in the offices near him.

HR/benefits is never your friend. Example: you read the rules of how the 401k matching works (updated for this year!) on the company's benefits web site, and schedule your 401k contributions accordingly. Except the matches don't come in properly. So you file an HR ticket, which gets ignored. So you go and find the appropriate person via networking (see above) and say 'look this isn't working how your document says it should'. And they say 'wait where did you get that document' and you say '...the benefits web site?' And two hours later they write you an email saying 'thank you for pointing out that document, it was wrong and we have removed it and the right document is elsewhere and it says that you're going to lose out on several thousand dollars this year and that is not our problem.' And if you want your money, that you were entitled to according to their own document, you will have to sue them, because not giving you the money you were entitled to is a hill that they will die on.

HR/benefits makes a LOT of mistakes. For example, issuing incorrect W2s, and then having to correct them, and issuing incorrect CORRECTIONS, and having to correct THOSE. And then next year issuing incorrect W2s AGAIN.

Like 'accidentally' taking double the legal amount for HSAs out of your paycheck, and then telling you that they couldn't correct it themselves, and that you would have to do so (even though the HSA contractor they use says that it's their responsibility to correct it). And then in order to correct it making you sign a document that says 'the undersigned has been advised to discuss this with a CPA or a tax law expert' and then refusing to pay for you to discuss this with a CPA or a tax law expert. Even though they are the ones who created the problem in the first place.

Like giving people the wrong cell phone reimbursement policy, and then after they've put in their expenses for the first two months, telling them that that was not the right policy and that it was their responsibility to know what the right policy was.

Like their parent company (SAP) having an on-call-time pay policy, and Concur accidentally allowing on-call-time reimbursement for one person, but when the other people who are on call and want to be paid for it too ask for it, Concur discovering their 'error' and lecturing them on how all developers should be DevOps and should expect to be on call 24/7 as part of their job description. This despite mediocre pay and benefits, no stock options, and crappy bonuses. ""Look, if you have to work from 5 AM until 7 PM on January 1st, hung over, and you miss a party you were looking forward to for weeks, that is not our problem. Maybe you can ask your manager for a day off. But not two days off. That would be crazy.""

The most astonishing thing about working at Concur is that there are still some good people there. I can't imagine how, though."

However, it is being transformed to simpler ways to do things"
5695,SAP,"overall, a solid place to have a career",2020-08-12,4.0,Customer Success,"As a whole, SAP is a great company to work for. It's successful and stable, the pay and benefits are competitive, and the corporate culture is extremely conducive to establishing a long-term career with the company. Generally speaking, once you're at SAP and have established yourself as a solid performer, the company makes it relatively easy to explore other roles in other areas of the company, and many people take advantage of this flexibility and enjoy long and happy tenures with the company. 

SAP is constantly changing, which can be frustrating for some, but it definitely helps keep things interesting and is a necessary part of adapting to the needs of the market. 

The fact that our CEO openly encouraged employees to submit Glassdoor reviews says a lot about him.","Like any large company, there's a potential for politics to come into play; and like any job, whether you love or hate it will be largely dependent on your boss, the leadership of your specific organization, and the culture they establish. 

Management opportunities can often be based on personal connections over merit. There seem to be lots of examples of people quickly jumping from the bottom of the company into very high level positions after working in ""the office of the CEO"" but how those opportunities are assigned is a mystery to most employees.

SAP also touts a focus on ""diversity and inclusion"" - while it does seem that we have at least some diversity in the lower ranks, diversity in leadership is severely lacking. There is a clear focus on promoting women into leadership positions (there is even a stated goal for that) but so far, that seems to be limited to caucasian women. Having been at SAP almost a decade, I can't think of a single upper management position held by a person of color."

5711,SAP,Phenomenal Company!!! - just a few small critiques,2020-08-11,5.0,Education Consultant,"So many pros -- the pay, benefits, vacation time, work/life balance, parental leave. Higher ups at SAP really do care about our wellbeing. SAP's response to the COVID-19 crisis was phenomenal and showed great leadership. They immediately closed all their offices and training centers and shut down all non-essential travel. They sent free masks to all their employees, and gave us all an extra day off to get out of our home offices. Although in some cases, SAP is known for older technologies and interfaces, that isn't often the case anymore, and you can join a group work on cutting edge technologies. SAP does a great job promoting internally and allowing employees to move around to different roles and positions while staying within the company. If I ever decide to change my role, I know that I want to stay with SAP.","A lot of optional benefits you can take advantage of at SAP, like tuition benefits, fellowships, etc., is all determined by your direct manager's approval. This is extremely disadvantageous to those of us at SAP with managers that don't believe in these opportunities and don't want to use any of their budget for these items. More importantly, your ability to move up in your career is determined by your direct manager, and this is an extreme disadvantage with some of the managers they've hired. Also, it is very difficult to get fired from SAP, which means that poor performers at both management-level and individual contributors get shuffled around to new groups rather than getting let go, which brings down all of SAP with their lower standards."
5712,SAP,Global Company and truly inclusive - love the culture!!,2020-08-11,5.0,Director,"SAP is always striving to be better than they currently are. They are strategic customer centric and community focused. I am very impressed with the care for employees during the COVID crisis, taking a regular pulse of employees and addressing their needs like mental health, work from home challenges , childcare challenges, social justice issues etc. They offered additional matching funds for BLM and social justice organizations. They have a focus on sustainability and partner with not for profits for volunteer opportunities. They have invited guest speakers to open our minds to the challenges facing society and allow people to ask questions in a safe environment. I can go on and on.","Being a global company, the downside is the need to work early/late hours to meet European and Asian Time Zones, working from the US. 
Also need more diversity on the board."
5713,SAP,full work from home is possible,2020-08-11,5.0,Senior Project Manager,"work from home is real, great compensation benefits,",slow inclusion of new business acquired into SAP culture

5724,SAP,Best place to work!,2020-08-10,5.0,Vice President Sales Strategy and Operations,"One of the best things about working for SAP is the abundance of opportunities across multiple parts of the business. Across my 10+ years with the organization, I've had the opportunity to work on many different strategic initiatives. I genuinely feel like I am influencing decisions with the work I am doing.

Second thing I love about SAP, is the flexibility around work hours and location. I've always had an appreciation for this benefit but now during the pandemic it has been reinforced. Upper levels of management are very supportive of working outside of a regular ""9 to 5"" work day. Some days I start early and end early, or other days I work a bunch of blocks throughout the day to get my tasks completed.

Third item I love about working for SAP is the generous days off. It is unusual to get this many days off in North America. I never feel like I'm going to ""run out"" of days.","When you work for a company that has 100,000+ employees, change takes time to implement and even more time to adopt."

They've given us 10 days to use for crisis leave like taking care of family or decompressing as kids are at home; this is not for sick leave which you'd use if you or anyone in your family gets Covid-19. They even sent all employees reusable cloth masks to use and kept us update on the current Covid-19 situation worldwide. Prior to all this it was great going into work and meeting with colleagues and eating lunch together. Now our whole UX department meets on virtual chat every Friday or so just to chat during lunch hour about none work stuff. SAP has also asked for Fridays to not have meetings so people can get work done and flexible to figure out the new norm with staying at home.

SAP-Concur offers a great work-life balance.","Policies & procedures have become ridiculous. We have literally gone back 10 years in time to manually keeping track of issues with our new ""Issue Tracker"". Nothing is automated like it used to be. 

Also, finding the right resources is tough and the documentation and training are severely lacking. 

Making sure new employees have proper access is also a headache. Half of the managers have no clue on how to get proper access to new hires. 

As a woman working for a large company, there is a huge pay gap between men and women. I know this because my referral (who is male) was hired on making 10k more a year than me for a lower position and this was after I had been with the company for over a decade.  While Sap-Concur has made some strides to improve the pay difference for me, it is still not enough. I am barely making more than the new hires that I am expected to train and mentor."

5792,SAP,"ReOrgs, No Diversity, & Lack of Career Opptys if not from SAP HQ",2020-08-05,2.0,Advisory Executive,"- Global Recognition
- Good Acquisitions in RPA, ML/AI (need better integration w/current solutions but still good path forward)
- SAP Cloud Platform is very promising
- Fair Pay
- SAP skills are still very marketable","- Very little diversity.  Especially in leadership & seem to HIGHLY prefer German men in top ranks.  Pipeline is an excuse.  I have even heard complaints from other countries talk about this.
- No regard for career/career growth.  Many reorgs and you are just placed anywhere.  I have seen engineers/developers moved into communications and marketing.  Same for product dev/mgrs who specialize in UI/UX and developing tech/software products reorged to roles that have very little to do with their skills.
- The leaders frown upon workers trying to move into other organizations.  Example:  An ex-CIO or Big 4 MD wanting to move back into the more tech side or services orgs from Advisory.
- Cloud strategy and cloud-readiness is still lacking
- Partner strategy should look to cloud and more products than HANA.   HANA products should focus more on top cloud services and position as solutions(ie. HANA integration w/IIoT data intensive solutions as well as analytics & ML services) as well as SAP solutions for faster and greater Time -to-value (TTV) for partners and clients (this helps all succeed)
- Need to integrate across all SAP tech more.
- Real strategy & change on services esp. with partners which can drive exponential growth and not just re-positioning and marketing what we have.    When working with partners need to want to succeed thru & with them not as an avenue to sell your product or services.  Use a reseller for that.
- Too many cooks problem....to get something done, everyone comes out of the woodwork wanting to be in meetings but never wanting to do the work or own the issues and challenges just the rewards.  This is a huge delay in accomplishing things.
- No real sales, marketing, product and growth strategy.  Just words and no execution.  Sales is transactional ""hoping"" to resell to existing customers.  No real bus dev & expansion.  Lots of gatekeeping with the excuse that a mistake was made several years ago.
- Ageism is a beast here and it is discrimination.  ""I want younger"", ""I want older"".  I want diverse with skills and experience.  I've seen multi-gen teams work."

Good benefits and generally kind people. In my experience, your managers actually want you to take your vacation and care about work/life balance. 

If you're good at your job, you can get a hefty amount of restricted stock pretty regularly.

A lot of job opportunities at the company are internal only, so there's a pretty normalized culture around hunting for new jobs within SAP. This gives you ways to grow when you inevitably hit your team's ceiling.","There's a lot of division of responsibility. This means unless you're lucky enough to be in an influential pocket of the company, your ability to do things quickly or have an impact is HEAVILY blunted. Worse, a lot of the teams you'll need to work with to do your job are pretty poorly-performing.

Diversity is lacking, especially among leadership. The people in charge are mostly German men. Since a lot of functions are global, even people based in the US will often have layer upon layer of male German managers.

Reorganizations are a constant fact of life and often seem based more on political power struggles for headcount than any logical ordering of labor. If you're lucky, you'll keep your direct manager and impact is often manageable. If you're unlucky... well thankfully it's only happened to me once."

5934,SAP,SAP Product Support Division - Needs improvement,2020-08-03,2.0,Senior Product Support Engineer,SAP in General is a good company with wonderful benefits. It gives the employees room to grow and gives them wonderful extra time to help your family cope with any troubles in life. SAP also tries to fulfill best in employment salary and bonus structures.,"While SAP as a company offers great benefits, the problem is within the Product Support division.  People who may apply for Support engineering role should look elsewhere due to the reasons below.

In Product Support there are two main tasks (i.e. could be inhumane too), that is so tough that it requires you or forces you to work nights and weekends.

I) First task: Man the Expert Chat Channel.  Why is this so tough? First there is not a lot of people who may help here (or it adds a lot more work to your daily requirements). If you somehow walk away to go to the bathroom or you are helping other customers online, there would be a flag or an alarm to management that there is nobody manning the chat (Or you are not manning the chat).  This makes employees start to feel anxious to the point that SAP Product Support becomes a very stressful environment (i.e. unhealthy). 

- If going to the bathroom gives an employee stress then this is simply a requirement that is inhumane (HR issue)
- This makes employees very stress to the point that they may quit the company (which happens a lot in SAP)
- Turn over is pretty big
- This task also adds to the overwhelming number of requirements that the support engineer needs to do daily
- This is also going to be recorded in a report that is available to management - how long did you logon to Chat?  They can use this number against you.

For example: If the support engineer needs to help 5 different customers daily with their issues technically that may last 1 to 2 hours each (in a web session call or deep dive session), this chat (i.e. you may get between 1 to 3+ per day) will add another 30 min to 2 hours each on top of the already scheduled 5 customers (10+ hours).  This will either push other important customers aside for the next day (lower customer satisfaction) or would make the support engineer work beyond normal working hours to fulfill the requirement.  SAP is wondering why they are not getting high scores in Customer Satisfaction, it could be that the process they placed could be stressing their employees to be the best they could be.

If you do this daily, you would have tired and highly stressed support engineers which will then be burned out. This may show up in our customer satisfaction results as your engineers are not fully rested and can only give 5 minutes to each new customers (i.e. ping pong effect).

 II) Second Task: You are also required to work nights and weekends (Saturday and Sunday).  This is one of the hardest one that is given to any support engineer.  Yes they may ask you to take some other days off or may even give you money but it also takes away the most important thing a person needs and that is time with family and time to recharge oneself.  We can argue that the chat + weekend support makes an engineers life hard.  Wait til you miss a call or work during the weekend, this is where you would feel what hell is like at work.

These 2 tasks from product support is one of the most challenging thing to swallow (your mindset needs to be a zombie).  If given the opportunity to work for another company or division in SAP that do not have these requirement, I would say sign me up immediately!

Last issue is as soon as you get to a particular level, there is no more growth.  You have maxed out.  Your contained within your level per budget limitation.  

If you can work in SAP in another division, that is good. Within Product Support, it is tough."

5960,SAP,Best Employer of my 23 year Career,2020-08-03,5.0,Cloud Operations Specialist,"SAP cares about its employees. Yes, really! It recognizes that its Human Resources are its most powerful resource. SAP has created a culture of people first, whether that be rewarding its employees with bonus days off during Covid to ease stress, gifting stock options or providing amazing free learning/class opportunities to ensure health and wellness. I have never felt that SAP talks a good talk but does not back it up with action. There is a clear path for advancement. The compensation is fair. The flexible work environments are a plus. As a working mom, I have never felt unable to put my children first before work commitments.","Change is a constant in the business work, particularly with tech. However, I have experienced more than average changes and re-orgs in my time at SAP. For example, I have had 4 different managers in one year as part of various re-orgs. My colleague has had 6 different managers in a year and a half. This leads to a feeling of job insecurity that is never good. Also, while SAP was ranked #1 for diversity by Forbes Magazine, my personal experience does not match that. There are no people of color on my team. Tangentially, I work with only one woman of color and three men of color. Older employees tend to get re-org'ed out. The Board is white and Germany with only one woman currently in what I would consider a 'more female"" role. To SAP's credit, they have stepped up in 2020 to address racial injustice in a meaningful way that has been more than lip service."

Everyone is nice beyond belief and extremely competent in their different areas.  Developing software for mega-projects is an unsolved problem and you get to work on it with great people.,"It's very difficult to develop software at this scale. It's very difficult to manage at this scale. Teams can function agily at small scale, but it can take a long time for large scale features that span hundreds of teams to solidify into action.  Small companies can't dream of taking on problems of this sort, but at the same time, everything you learned at a small company has to be reinvented."

SAP is enormous so navigating the ins and outs of an enterprise this large is reality; so yes, there will be cliques here and there, there will be managers who aren't as adept as other managers, and change is constant. Thing is, in 2020 successful companies have to keep inventing and innovating. If you stay stagnant in this global economy, you'll struggle. I'm listing this as a ""pro"" - there is no hand holding at SAP. The company has invested mightily when it comes to self-learning and if you take advantage of these options and invest in yourself - you'll be successful. There's plenty of opportunity for growth and movement within the org and not just from a professional standpoint. The company offers and supports sabbaticals and fellowships. The technology provided to employees is top-notch. Want to use a mac and not a PC? Sure! Need supplies now that we're all working from home? No problem, order what you need (in reason, obviously). There are many 2018 reviews stating how people were leaving certain SAP brands en masse - and while there is some validity there, many of them expressed regret 6/12/18 months later.

5984,SAP,Couldn't be any happier,2020-08-03,5.0,Client Success Manager,SAP is an amazing company to work for. It provides a diverse and inclusive environment. Leadership lead by example. I learn something new every day and I feel valued and trusted and my hard work is always celebrated and acknowledged.,I seriously can't think of any right now
5985,SAP,Company Walks Their Talk,2020-08-03,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"Very inclusive policies, supportive management, collaborative environment. Competitive compensation and benefits. Strong work/life balance. Opportunities to grow. Even in the midst of the pandemic - they remain a strong and ethical company.","You probably won't have a lot to whine about around the water cooler ;-)

Big companies grow more slowly - not going to leapfrog  up the corporate ladder like you can in a startup."
5986,SAP,Great Place to Work!,2020-08-03,5.0,Program Manager,"Collaborative, Inclusive and Global Organization that Values each and every individual, be it a Full time employee or an intern with full leadership support for Career Growth and Progression.",Can't think of any Cons!
5987,SAP,Awesome benefits and better work-life balance with SAP,2020-08-03,4.0,Senior IT Architect,Employee benefits are best compared to non-FAANG companies. work culture is non-toxic for my BU. easy to work with manager and HR is approachable with single click.,SAP can improve on performance benefits which is shared between pool of employees and on and average is low compared to other companies in this area. Immigration is very slow and many times that's the reason new talent goes to competitors than SAP
5988,SAP,Great company to work for,2020-08-03,5.0,Development Manager,"Flexible work hours, excellent handling of the Covid pandemic, very good benefits, listens to its employees, good work-life balance,","Agility,  ability to change direction quickly like any big company"
5989,SAP,A company with a soul,2020-08-03,5.0,Software Developer,"1. Flexible work schedule. Able to have a life after work.
2. Tons of internal learning opportunities.
3. Generous health benefits.","1. A bit slow sometimes for decision making, like any other big tech company. 
2. Difficulty to change roles within company."
5990,SAP,"Caring company, over centralized, bad strategy",2020-08-03,3.0,Product Management,"SAP has a genuine goal to make the world a better place. Stress levels are moderate, and work-life balance is good.","Decisions are made in Germany. Company isn't leveraging cloud-assets well, but instead trying to create a monolith (like the failed MSFT strategy of the early 2000s). In SAP's case, there is an over-focus on ERP. 

Since decisions are centralized, they are often arbitrary and ill-informed. Too often you hear ""that's a board mandate"" which shuts down discussion of the value to the customer or value to SAP of a decision."
5991,SAP,"Awesome work but in-competitive pay, politics and bad for career growth",2020-08-03,3.0,Lead Product Manager,"- Company knows where its going. Yearly business goals are very clear and to the point. Main focus is on the integration between multiple business units and their products
- SAP Products are awesome and stand up to their vision to run the world better 
- Diverse culture, lot of wonderful people
- Opinions are valued and respected.","- Middle management is often seen in panic mode and is in-competent, lack simple decision making abilities. I have seen small decisions move around from Org's CTO team , to Product team, to Engineering team  and feels like people either lack in power to say yes/No or are simply incompetent to run business. And I work in a team which interacts with almost all business units, I have seen this problem all across SAP.
- SAP pays very very less compared to other companies in bay area. Salaries in SF region are comparatively higher, thats a known fact, but even compared to the competition and their partners in Palo Alto/ South Bay. SAP pays 30-40% lesser than Google, Facebook, Netflix, Apple, even lesser their immediate neighbors, VMWare.
- Another big cons, lot of promotions happen in the T4 level, while people in T2 and T3 are struggling to prove their worth to their managers. I have seen very worthy people denied of promotion, while their middle management takes credit the work climbing up the ladder very quickly.

For all these reasons , I have seen very smart people frustrated and looking out for opportunities outside every now and then."

They are not an obstacle to getting work done, but they do nothing to help get it done or provide direction in what should be done.
Executive leadership changes - At this time (August 2020), recent Executive Board changes leave some uncertainty as to the direction of the company and the competence of the leadership. Need some more diverse and experienced members and need to communicate better.
Organizational changes are frequent - Partially due to rapid acquisitions over the past decade, but organizational and leadership changes can be very frequent and by the time you adjust to one reorg, there is another.

As I said in the title SAP is great, the Successfactors product is it's problem child","I was a member of the Successfactors support team. A job which is known throughout SAP to be a nightmare and high stress . There is a Top down management model where there is no thought as to how the decisions they make will impact the work force add. They are so focused on stats and spreadsheets they are disconnected for the common work force. 

I was there for a few years and every year the workers survey results had no faith in management, extremely high stress which resulted in burnout's. No progression at all through the position. There is a very high turn over rate because of the issues above

They lack experience due to the fact that they do not want to promote their employees for the work they do and people eventually leave...these people (if replaced )are replaced but college graduates which starts the cycle. They come in, train up, get good at the job and are doing the job of a senior engineer and don't get paid fairly, get burned out due to stress and workload, they leave. They leave for a better opportunity,  better pay, and better work conditions elsewhere....then the cycle starts again.


So if you value being included in management decisions, the chance to progress within a role getting compensated fairly for the work you do, and having an acceptable level of stress in your day to day job.... Successfactors isn't for you. 

Also if you want a good sports and social Club.. avoid the galway office. You really get nothing out of it for the amount you pay in."

 Leadership survey process makes sure employees are taken care of and their needs are fullfilled. 

Performance based stock awards, medical benefits, time away from work, paternity and maternity leaves (almost 12 weeks plus)

You are mostly rewarded based on performance and at times based on relationships","If you are an U.S. employee and not a citizen, rely on visas to legally work, it's really difficult to grow here since lot of hiring managers do not want to deal with the administrative overhead of handling visas and the process, you will not be able to move within the company as freely as a citizen would. This limits your growth potential.

If you want to gain global exposure or want to move to different country to continue your growth to avoid the constant anxiety around U.S. visa process, you have to deal with the global mobility bureacracies, COVID has made the already difficult international transfers impossible, it requires board level approval to move between countries, SAP touts the run simple mantra, there's one for running simple. If nobody but board could take decisions on an international transfer, you can understand how bureacratic the processes are here.

Diversity - If you look up the L1, L2 and L3 leaders in SAP, you can figure out how much diversity is respected in senior leadership, it's only at individual contributor level and gender diversity at leadership level, you should start empowering people from different ethnic groups."
