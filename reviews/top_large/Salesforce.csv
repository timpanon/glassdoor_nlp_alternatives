- I worked on one strategic project that was nice. It used Node.js/Express. Kept me busy for 6-7 months.

- Later in my time I picked up new technologies (Mulesoft/Slack) and made relationships with SE's. I generated my own strategic projects.

- Lots of flexibility. Remote work. Just get your stuff done on time.","- Need to build relationships to have certain work opportunities. If your a ""I like user stories"" kind of person, this will become a problem after 1 year. On the upside you get to pick what assists you work on. I would often pick up the more interesting coding requests like an Eagle. If you hate flows, you don't need to work on flows if your already busy! I'm not sure anyone was aware of my Eagle strategy until I told them. Watch like a hawk and take what you want. 

- Too much front-end, not enough back-end. But you could say this for Salesforce tech in general.

- To HR management: Leveling system should be fixed by +1."
50,Salesforce,Great Company,2022-04-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Very nice people and competitive salary.,Somewhat chill. Not easy to get promoted
51,Salesforce,Great progressive company with a lot of enablement,2022-04-01,4.0,Strategic Account Manager,Innovative technology that is constantly evolving,Products are very expensive and a lot more than competition
52,Salesforce,Quotas are aggressive,2022-04-01,3.0,Account Executive,"Resources provided by the company are numerous. Whatever you need, they have it or want to get it for you to help you be successful.",The quotas are very aggressive and in my experience only about 10-20% achieve them. OTE numbers aren't very relevant when few achieve quota. Most large volume sales cycles are long and Salesforce switches account ownership too frequently to accommodate cycles of that length.
53,Salesforce,"Great Experience, Staying for the Long Haul",2022-04-01,5.0,Director,"- Great salary, time off, benefits package, and culture
-Focus on Diversity & Inclusion and the programs to back it up
- Ability to drive your own career
- Flexibility and ability to work in hybrid environment or remain 100% remote","- Growing size means more bureaucracy 
- M&A activity with large acquisitions
- Can reward popularity over merit on certain teams"
54,Salesforce,Review,2022-04-01,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),Great sales culture with a lot of resources,Fast paced environment might not be the best for some sales people
55,Salesforce,Amazing company to work for,2022-04-01,5.0,Business Development Representative,Honestly a great experiece / culture and best place to start a sales career,"9-5 culture, which makes it seem more lackadaisical"
56,Salesforce,Trust is hardly a value,2022-04-01,2.0,Solutions Engineer,"Competitive ESPP

A lot of reusable assets for sales.","Below market compensation.

Over-carved, oversaturated territories. You can't make the same money here that people did 5-10 years ago. Upper/middle management will happily gaslight you into believing otherwise and on occasion even lie to you about future compensation or potential work life balance."
57,Salesforce,Best company I've ever worked for,2022-04-01,5.0,Account Executive,"Personal development, Meaningful work, Talented colleagues, Value driven, Very focused on personal and mental health of their employees, Marc Benioff is just the bomb","You need a good work-ethic, be professional and effective, and take care of yourself. It is easy to get lost in work."
58,Salesforce,Awesome place to workv,2022-04-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Multiple teams. Really good culture,Depending on the team comp can slip
59,Salesforce,"Great Company, Day to Day just ok",2022-04-01,3.0,Account Executive,"- Salesforce has a great product and growing suite of products to sell. Most customers and new leads are happy to speak to Salesforce.

- Great earning potential, obviously if you are doing well, but even if you aren't, product spiffs and bonuses can help towards making your OTE.

- Benefits cover almost everything you can think of. Highest education reimbursement I've seen in tech companies. Base pay in esmb could be improved, but it depends where you are in life if you value the cash or benefits more.

- Room for promotion (it can be slow, but no slower than most big tech companies).

- A no brainer move if you aren't already in the tech industry- one of few tech companies that seems to be open to hiring non tech sales backgrounds. A lot of the cons below happen everywhere so you may as well benefit from Salesforce's great benefits and commission.

- Their selling methodology isn't for the faint hearted, but you genuinely will learn a lot about selling.","- There are 4 layers of management between you and the person who manages SMB . All these layers are forecasting to each other and it just seems to fuel the micromanagement activity and meetings for the sake of meetings culture.

- Managers only care about their team number and really don't care about how you are doing individually. Leads to micromanagement when the team isn't doing well. If you are doing well, there's no real incentive for you to do better for the sake of the team, it's just what your manager wants.

- Territories and verticals are very uneven. Best territories given to more tenured AEs which happens in a lot of companies, but makes your first year difficult to succeed without some luck.

- Really not much culture day to day. There are team dinners and days out but not much is done to create a sense of fun in the job itself. This was the same even in the office.

- No recognition outside of $ closed.

- Apart from one or two, the product specialists only seem to want to help when your deal is about to close."

I am surrounded by strong women who are amazing team Leaders and workers. Management is fair and cares a lot. I'm not the best employee. I would consider myself incredibly average. I do feel that this is the first time in my career that my skills are accurately rated. I am given the opportunity to as they say ""level up"" with very detailed one on ones. This model only works for those who want to be better engineers and customer service agents. 

I never feel as if my caseload is too much. in fact, I have the free time to help my team reach resolutions and educate myself on my product.

I really hope to retire here
Before this, I owned my own business, and before that, I was a contract IT. I rather eat a whole brick house than work at any other company.","I'm pretty sad only 50,000 people get to have the joy to work here. I am honored to be one of them."

151,Salesforce,The hype is real!,2022-03-24,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"- Innovative company and culture that is striving to be best-in-class when it comes to driving social impact, emphasizing diversity and inclusion, giving back to the community, sponsoring employee wellness and development, and carrying out sustainability initiatives. Salesforce lives and leads with its values from the top down and encourages transparency and feedback throughout the organization. 
- For a large enterprise, Salesforce works hard to ensure we are agile and nimble. The company is not afraid to fail fast, pivot strategies, execute on new ideas and proactively lead with a bold vision in the face of a rapidly changing world. The phrase ""Better, better, never best"" is a great way to describe the culture.
- Individually in my customer-facing sales role, I enjoy being able to work with so many different types of businesses and executives. It's rewarding to help clients succeed, transform, and adapt their businesses - and it's also a fantastic learning experience for my own development. Because Salesforce has such a huge platform, we are enabled to have conversations with every business department and are empowered to deliver real value. While we are selling a technical product, working at Salesforce allows me to elevate the conversation by leaning on Salesforce's own internal success and leadership to inspire my customers.
- There is a sense of pride in working here; there are just so many cool things about this company, it's hard to list them all!","- The job itself is not ""easy."" Because the company is always innovating, always bringing new products and solutions to market, and always striving to stay at the forefront of the most pressing business challenges and trends facing our customers, there's constantly new information we need to learn in order to be trusted advisors to the clients we support. It's a lot to learn and stay enabled on; this is a company that thrives on fast-paced change. 
- Additionally, because our platform literally does everything, there are a variety of ""point solution"" competitors big and small that we have to constantly stay one step ahead of. Fortunately, Salesforce invests in product specialists, competitive intelligence teams, and other resources to support you.
- You can definitely make a lot of money here if you are a top performer. That said, I get the sense that our base salaries are less competitive than comparable software sales roles at other high tech companies. That's a tradeoff to working at the best company though. Once you work here, you can get hired wherever. In fact, many people leave the company in order to get a MUCH more senior role somewhere else, and then leverage that to come back to Salesforce at much higher role and salary band. Staying at Salesforce might mean that your upward mobility is slower."

- historically I would have said the company genuinely cared for each employee and would have a stake in each employee's success. I guess with huge growth that has to dilute... still a great place to be... but not as great as it was (hoping with offices reopening that will change back)
- equality and diversity - I feel that compared to most big corps - we do Equality and diversity pretty well and there is real momentum and backing and finance to keep doing better. - I really believe that the leadership and rest of the business want to do business the right way.","-It is very big, and if you are not someone who puts yourself about a bit I think it could feel quite anonymous

However they were very complimentary on my performance and said that they would like to consider me for another role when one was available. I did not think I would get a call back. However, within a couple of weeks I did, and they sped up the normal recruitment process for me in order to get me on board.

The company is hyper political internally. Getting ahead is rarely about what you've done, but more who you're friends with.

Have a solution engineer to lean on, and many co-primes.","Salary is not competitive. If you bring up promotion / raise, your manager or RVP is in the ""red"" for attrition, they will not entertain a conversation and have you wait until the new fiscal year. 

Internal promotions are also not transparent. New hires are compensated more than loyal tenure employees, resulting in lots of employee churn, despite tenure reps are doing more training cause managers are useless.

Managers will encourage teams going to the office cause they're scared leadership will realize how useless they actually are and how little value they provide."

This company ""walks the walk"" with regard to their core values. They embrace your individuality, and encourage you to pursue your passion within the company and your community.","Not for people who can't create content and communicate product value to an audience. Part of the interview process requires you to put together a presentation for a panel of interviewers. You give a 15-minute elevator pitch. with only an outline provided. You have to go create your presentation based on research, and the marketing materials that are available online. I felt like this gave me an opportunity to showcase my individuality and unique style, but others might feel overwhelmed."
395,Salesforce,Outstanding Onboarding Experience,2022-03-02,5.0,Senior Solutions Engineer,"I started at Salesforce about six months ago as a fully remote employee. One of the most challenging things with any new job is getting ramped up to perform to the best of your abilities.

Salesforce has blown away any preconceived notions I had of what an onboarding experience should be like. From providing me a coach during the interview process to that I am presenting the best version of myself and my skill set to an thoughtfully laid out onboard plan.

I do understand that I may have a different experience than others because each department also controls a large portion of onboarding. However, I don't know of another company that spends 3-6 months ramping you in all the relevant areas you need to be successful at your job. Afterall, my success is ultimately the company's success.

Additionally, I was paired with both a mentor who had been in the job for some time (12+ months) and a buddy who was only a few months ahead of me and can still remember all the struggles and challenges.","In regards to the onboarding experience, I have absolutely none. I have never felt more cared for or empowered to be successful than I have here."

* Consistent pay, benefits, PTO
* Smart peers
* Good company culture and values
* Manageable scope of work without much deviation","* Cultural indoctrination; you need to fully buy into the Salesforce culture to be a fit. If you don't drink the cool aid, you won't be a fit.
* Still lacks diversity in parts of the organization; cultural and gender diversity remains a challenge.
* Your role is to stay in your swim lane, scope of your work is defined and you are expected to stay in your swim lane.
* In order to get promoted, you either need friends higher up or fit a very specific Salesforce profile. There is partially still a glass ceiling for many minorities."

-Brand Recognition
-Great Benefits and Learning Opportunities","I don't know what the culture is like on other teams, but my team is not diverse at all. I'm the only black person on my team, and even on our larger 30 person team, there are only 3 people of Asian descent (which is nuts considering tech demographics overall), everyone else is white or white-passing, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. There has been a lot of marketing recently about Salesforce meeting its 50% underrepresented goal a year early, but that number includes all women, and if it didn't they'd never meet their goal. A lot of middle managers are not interested in diversity and definitely not inclusion. Even if you're hired here as a black employee, you won't be treated equally and people will question your experience and abilities constantly. It's demoralizing, and it explains why retention is so low. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you have a bigger goal in mind for what you want to do next."

""Leadership"" that specialized in gaslighting and very blatant threats. An HR department that chooses to sweep complaints about senior leaders (from multiple people and orgs) under the rug. HR seemed to purposely omit exit interviews for many people I knew who left for some of these reasons. Constant reminders about how we're all ""Ohana"" but yet numerous mass layoffs with little warning, PIPs were given to people for little to nothing, unreasonable expectations were set to purposely to drive people out of the company (i.e., expecting an associate engineer who joined my team to deliver the same level of work I was within their first month... they quit last year too).

Politics ruled the world; you couldn't get anything done unless you were doing a favor for another team or going to the top of the chain to force it down someone's throat... which people often thought was funny to do on a Friday afternoon to force others to work the weekend. Initiatives were constantly changing before the previous one was completed. Management never really seemed to know what was actually the focus of the month because, quite frankly, they were moved around so often and so overloaded, they rarely knew more than the ""1000 foot view"" of the product they were supposed to be managing.

Hours mandated were ridiculous; some days we worked until 3 or 4am and were expected back on shift by 9 or 10am; wasn't uncommon to work 60 to 80 hour weeks, occasionally seeing 90 to 105 (yes in a single week and no that'snot an exaggeration). A considerable amount of talk publicly about ""work life balance"" but it wasn't present in the slightest in our org.

I could honestly write another entire thesis on the things that weren't great about working here after my 7 years. I left because I just didn't want to deal with it anymore (like MANY others) and I've literally talked a number of people out of even trying to apply. If you're young, single, and love to do nothing but work your life away, it'll be a great place to learn but don't get stuck there in the golden handcuffs if the position doesn't suit you. There are MUCH better places to work who will treat you like a person instead of a feature delivering dog."

Often new managers are poor and take a couple of team cycles to learn the role and until then tend to be dashboard refreshers and somewhat micro manage.

- Inaccurate promotion timelines. I was told that it would take 12-14months to promote to Ae. This is wildly inaccurate. Average time to promote is close to the 2 year mark. You have to jump through ridiculous hoops to make yourself eligible and if you fail 'panel' you have to wait another 6 months to promote

- Territory alignment is wildly unfair. Very much a 'get what you get and don't get upset' and the last person in gets the worst patch which lead to massive turnover

- Turnover in the Dublin BDR unit is massive atm based on all of the above

- Massive cult culture. When i left none of the management/directors reached out to wish me well. Felt like i was shunned for moving to a better opportunity."

At a company / division level, there is ample and motivating communication with the values, focus, programs, and events of the company. The on-boarding program is pretty well organized. The processes, such as on-site Covid testing for the office opening (for employees who want to) have the employees well-being at forefront.","The ramp up is pretty steep and takes serious effort. 

The internal libraries documentation is a little lacking. For better or worse, I end up spending quite some time reading / running code to learn the ropes.

Flips and inbounds will also play a big factor, depending which market you're in will ultimately determine your end results. Anyone outside of Sydney or Melbourne good luck!

Employee well-being initiatives and company values such as trust and customer success sound great but are not really being practiced
Assess your potential direct manager because they can make or break your experience at the company. Ex: sales people who became direct managers and are not great people managers, and direct managers who do not have sales experience and are out of touch with reality."
774,Salesforce,Toxic Sales Culture,2022-01-27,3.0,Account Executive,"Salesforce is an incredibly reputable company to work for. It really is the best resume booster you could ask for that sets you up to be recruited by almost every company. The benefits are top notch- healthcare, ESPP, wellness stipend, and discounts at a variety of different companies. The offices are absolutely beautiful and an impressive place to take friends and family. I have heard that most departments are really great to work for, but be VERY careful to do your due diligence in figuring out which ones those are.","Underneath its grandiose, towering presence and pristine public reputation, lies a dark reality in the sales organization. I could never recommend a career in sales at Salesforce for these reasons:

Compensation: Salesforce's base and OTE's are well under the market rate for Account Executives. On top of that, you are punished financially for being promoted within the company, and will receive a base/OTE that is 10-20k lower than external hires. Due to this, there is incredibly high turnover, as long term Salesforce sales employees bounce to other companies to receive proper compensation and many of the sales teams are constantly dominated by new hires. Territories are created in a way in which only about 20% of reps will hit their annual number so base your expected income on your base rate and how comfortable you would be living off of that number. 

Customer treatment: Salesforce redistributes territories every fiscal year, meaning customers are given a new Account Executive every year. This leads to extreme frustration and oftentimes, customers being sold solutions that they don't necessarily need. Expect to be dealing with many angry customers during the first part of the fiscal year, and cleaning up the mess created by the previous AE.

Management: From my experience, I have had some of the most micromanaging and condescending bosses of my career at Salesforce. Even though I am a remote employee, I constantly feel as if my boss is looking over my shoulder through the constant Slack messages and tracking of my daily activity (call/email volume). The worst part is the culture of toxic positivity. Never admit that you are struggling either with work or in your personal life, as that will be used against you in one way or another. Favoritism is rampant and is gifted to those who go out of their way to express immense gratitude, compliment their boss, and NEVER admit frustrations, even if valid. Sorry, but I'm too old to act like a corporate robot monkey. 

Career mobility: As I mentioned above, in the sales organization, your pay will hardly change as you go up-market. Switching into other departments is nearly impossible as you must seek VP level approvals, navigate the lousy internal recruiting teams, and build up a case as to why you are more valuable than external hires. This is why there are so many Salesforce boomerangs... 

Ultimately, I had really high hopes for the Sales Organization at Salesforce, but was super disappointed by my experience. I understand that not every experience will be the same, but I think it is important to look past the facade."

890,Salesforce,Very high pace in exchange for great compensation and benefits,2022-01-17,5.0,Senior Account Executive,Salesforce not only preach for employee well-being but also represents it into their compensation package. You can really make money if you manage to catch a great patch and customer base.,"Company still evolving in different countries and creating their future structure, therefore you can find some decompensated situations between executives."

902,Salesforce,Amazing workplace - Amazing people!,2022-01-15,5.0,Project Manager,"Great working culture
Great salaries
Challenging and dynamic environment",Aggressive growth goals sometimes is a little bit stressing!
903,Salesforce,Good place to get your career started!,2022-01-15,5.0,Business Development Representative,"I worked at a very small SaaS company before coming to Salesforce. I wanted my next step to be at a company where there were options for moving up career-wise and have the potential to increase my income. Both SDR and BDR roles can be a grind but you learn a ton, have great colleagues and are compensated fairly for your successes. They also have good benefits, an ESPP plan and 401k / RRSP matching. Post-BDR, there are multiple AE avenues for you to explore (core, verticals, or co-prime) and other options such as becoming a Renewals Manager or Solution Engineer (though not as common). Overall, I would recommend Salesforce as a great place for people to get their career started.",Metrics can be intense sometimes and a grind.
904,Salesforce,"Overall, decent company",2022-01-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Benefits, culture, exciting projects to work on",Work-life balance can be better
905,Salesforce,bdr,2022-01-15,5.0,BDR Representative,nice culture and environment. Employee centric culture,"none as of now, overall great"
906,Salesforce,Too big for it's britches,2022-01-15,2.0,Marketing,"You learn a TON, and are exposed to some really incredible people here. I wouldn't change my time here at all and have met some of the best mentors and smartest people in the industry. Benefits are great, WFH flexibility and the stipends are wonderful. There is a lot of opportunity to move around within the company and learn new roles and duties, which is lucky, because in order to move up you will have to move around.","The promotion system is broken. Period. Only promoting 1-3% of your workforce every 6 months is a broken process and gives over-perfoming employees two options if they don't get promoted that round - wait and see, or move into a new role within the company at the higher title. Or, the route I took, leave the company. I understand putting a cap on the amount of promotions each team can have, but it can cause teammates to have to wait YEARS for a promotion they should have just been given. 

And finally, ""Ohana"" is BS in my opinion when it comes to those in leadership. Those not in leadership totally embody that spirit, but the amount of politics, backstabbing and egotistical leaders in this company is unacceptable. When you disagree with someone who doesn't understand your job but is in a leadership role, you are punished, get duties you enjoy doing taken away from you, and told to make things better without any guidance on what is actually broken. 

Salary is also way under in comparison to other companies. Salesforce used to be at the top of salary ranges, and have unfortunately not kept up with the times. 

Every year the employee survey continually highlights these issues, and now with some of the top employees in the company moving on to greener pastures, I really hope they tackle these problems. It starts from the top."

Also love the benefits like ESPP, 6% 401K match, and HSA. Also everyone I’ve reached out to or interacted with have been super friendly and helpful. Overall this is has been a great job to start my transition out of undergrad.",Not a real downside but something to note is that while working you have autonomy over your day to day actions. So just make sure you can motivate yourself and create your own structure. Also SF is big on building your own brand so you need to take ownership of your brand and put yourself out there for exposure and advancement in your career.

You can tell they really care about giving everyone a fair chance. I'm incredibly thankful to Salesforce and this team for giving me their time.

Getting VERY big and a series of promotions from without and seemingly disingenuous internal promotion systems (you cannot brag about how many new roles are open when a majority of these new roles are already spoken for by the people in the roles you killed off).

Was shocked by the level of micromanagement, time wasted on internal meetings, and sense of self-importance.

He will revert the decisions of tenured & seasoned executives, his ELT, or any C-team member in a second. This devastates the teams and people doing the work.

Competency is not a criteria for C-level jobs. Marc's favoritism is. One needs only to look at the exodus of Marketing talent (at all levels) in 2021 to see the impact of his most recent CMO selection.

With an army of talented leaders, but very limited opportunity for them to actually make decisions, the battle for ownership of the remaining work is more important than doing the work itself."

I now work with people who are passionate about their jobs and most importantly have the skills and desire to execute. 

I was drawn to Salesforce with the idea of a ""Stake Holder"" based approach to operating a successful company. Guess what, it is just not marketing. As an employee at Salesforce, I am engaged in numerous programs from buying trees to community service, to mentoring and training underserved communities. I come to work everyday knowing that I am part of something bigger and positive.","Some of the internal processes at Salesforce still feel ""small company"" and others are way too over-engineered.

Everyone is here to do their best.","As with any large company, sometimes there are processes that slow things down, but more importantly the processes that are in place are there with meaning, rather than just checks and balances."

A lot of smart and dedicated people in the legal department and other organizations across the company.,"It's a marketing company, meaning perception is more important than reality. Corporate values and culture are not always embraced by individual managers. A lot of politics and backstabbing and managing upwards with little concern for team health. Promotions seem to be based on who you know vs what you contribute, and length of tenure at the company is more valued than skills and experience. It's not uncommon to see qualified leaders come in at an individual contributor level and being managed by people with less experience who are lacking in substantive knowledge for their functional area and untrained in people management."

 kindness.
- The process was very challenging.
- The expectations of you are very clear.

I am looking forward to be a part of Salesforce Ohana.",Be patience with the process because it is a long and exciting journey.
1129,Salesforce,Do not go anywhere near the Technical Support Org now if you can avoid it,2021-12-15,1.0,Tier III Technical Support Engineer,"It pays well.
It has good benefits.
It has some good employees, usually not in the managerial side.
The technology is amazing.
If you have no better alternative, it's a good entry place that will look good in your CV.","Brian Millham hired the executive that destroyed Support with the permission of other Support managers around the world and against the advice of any Engineer that works/worked in the company. That executive and his team have pushed A LOT of terrible changes to make the Support Org just a well-paid but poorly-handled call center environment with a lot of pressure. 

Instead of fixing what was broken, namely the headcount of Engineers that diagnose Cases in a rapidly evolving technology, they justified their new appointments as The Bosses by pushing changes that have broken the Support Org. 

Some of those changes: Tierless model (but with tears, ask about that joke to your subordinate, Brian), Slack, a chat for ""collaboration"" outside of the Saleforce platform where now Cases are handled (working half in a chat, half in a CRM, brilliant), every Engineer working every type of Case that someone, arbitrarily, considered non-complex, Tier 3's now customer facing instead of focused on the technical side of things, experienced people leaving like never before, the ones that are left moved around to work on things they have no knowledge of...it's all wrong.

If you're considering a role in Support and you have no job or different alternative, take the Support position, they'll be desperate to hire people considering the attrition they're having. That said, be ready to have patience because the ones making decisions have zero knowledge of the day-to-day job and they'll frequently come up with something that makes your day harder and your job slower. They won't listen to your feedback and they'll keep going on, even if it's detrimental, because someone above them said so.
If you have alternative, please go somewhere else and save yourself the trouble. The current managers/directors will be out sooner rather than later and, hopefully, the things will be back to normal in the future.

It's a good company and the technology is awesome but this particular department is currently handled by non-technical folk that are too egotistic and arrogant to listen to the people that does the job."

Direct managers are very supportive, pay is good (but not as great as you might expect), benefits are good, flexible on remote vs in office.","Can be very stressful at month/quarter/year ends. Deadlines can be incredibly hard to meet - even when working with teams of some highly motivated and intelligent people. Generally speaking, people are very passionate which is great, but can lead to conflict if there are competing interests. This can be uncomfortable, but is something you have to get used to. Upper management is 50/50 on saying the right thing vs saying something completely tone deaf (though admittedly, this ratio is still much better than most places). Work life balance is often talked about and encouraged, but when push comes to shove, the work has to get done, and sometimes you’re left holding the short end of that stick."

I remembered the days when we actually had great, caring, nurturing, open-minded leaders, where we focused a lot on a great culture and work-life balance.","However, the recent years' experience was more like a 2-3 star company. The culture is definitely not the same anymore. All the decisions are top-down. Some of the leaders don't even have domain knowledge. The culture became very political. Promotions were very unfairly done. No career band framework at all. People being overworked and dragged into political plays.

1182,Salesforce,"Not the best, not the worst. Not a place for introverts",2021-12-08,3.0,Solution Engineer,Pay and benefits are good.,"Salesforce is better at buying outside talent than it is at developing its own people which is why there are so many boomerang employees. People leave to get the experience they need to go to the next role they want. There are no formal performance reviews meaning being promoted to your next role is very subjective depending on whether or not your leadership team likes you. Additionally, for the all the talk about showing up to work and embracing your authentic self, at the end of the day all anyone cares about is how you show up on a dashboard which incentives people to log things they did not do sometimes to an absurd degree like someone logging that they worked 70 hours a week every week for a quarter and then getting an award for most hours logged. 

Relatedly there is a huge emphasis placed on managing your personal brand. If you come from a cultural background where you are taught to do your best work day after day and expect that to be noticed in merit of itself, you will be disappointed working here at least in the sales organization. You have to have the desire to talk about yourself a lot and be a self promoter. 

Lastly, I want to share something I personally observed while working here. In my first sales team which was predominantly white, we had one female person of color on the team. She was exceptionally hard working, eager to learn, and dedicated to her job. Management and her colleagues did not support her in the way that was needed for her to reach her full potential. Moreover I believe they made work difficult for her in an effort to push her out of the organization. I never understood why. Maybe she didn't fit a type that her team was looking for. She later left to join another company where she is, unsurprising to me, doing very well. I would have thought that retaining and supporting talented employees of all backgrounds would be a priority but especially employees of color given how much Salesforce as a company talks about diversifying its workforce."

The company (who claims their value is trust) employs managers who speak about their employees behind their back. The manager would cancel all the meetings I scheduled for us witout saying a word about it. Also, I heard him speaking about other people a coupld of times to find out later he did the same for me and my BDR in other meetings. That's all in terms of trust in practice. 

Also, for some regions, they push on selling and they have done zero market research. Therefore their product is not only worse than competitions, but also 10 times more expensive.

Money as with other companies, but the amount of stress and mismanagement - not worth a month staying there!"

1435,Salesforce,Mid Commercial Core AE,2021-11-01,3.0,Account Executive,"Good benefits, SPP, Great product, interesting customers, work some big complex deals. 

I’ll get straight to it, overall your experience will be dependent upon your RVP and AVP, territory and your mentor. I personally came to salesforce to sell to new clients, be challenged and force myself to grow. At my previous company it became very rinse and repeat. At salesforce none of your conversations will be the same and you can drive some very unique business outcomes with the products at your disposal. The core role is basically just knowing who and what resources to bring in for each conversation, you are a quarterback. You get a six month ramp quota that you can attain if you put in the work, but there is some luck and timing involved to that. Your first year you will probably get subpar to okay accounts but they will usually throw you a bone and give you 2 or 3 buying accounts that are actively doing projects or buying. This role is not for guys who sit around and do inbound all day, it’s very prospect heavy you will have to get creative and be humble. If you have a good BDR they can make this a lot easier for you. First two to three months are a grind you probably won’t hit a good stride in meetings until month three. Overall I like the role it’s just sales fundamentals, get activity, be consistent, listen to clients needs and align the proper people/solution to their problems and thats when the money comes in.","Pipeline management is a lot of work and your deals will be scrutinized heavily. It can be difficult to have a sense of direction in the core role since you can approach it in so many ways. Coprime AEs like marketing cloud or tableau are pretty weak they usually aren’t true sales people. Some people get dealt bad hands in their territory. Salesforce sub verticalized accounts this year so a lot of people are struggling to hit their numbers, but this should change next year and you also close most deals at end of year. Accounts have been shuffled alot so expect your clients to be annoyed they have their 5th AE in 2 years."
1436,Salesforce,Committed to cultural values,2021-11-01,5.0,Principal Solutions Engineer,"Salesforce presents a clear ideology and backs it up with action. Aside from the community of motivated, intelligent coworkers, one of the things I like the most about working here is the feeling that I'm contributing to a company that actually cares about the world around it beyond simple profit.","It's grown a lot and connections require more work to maintain. Growth has the potential to dilute the overall vision, but so far things are holding solid."
1437,Salesforce,Aggressively growing organization that values employees & promotes culture of trust,2021-11-01,4.0,Senior Manager Software Engineering,"Work with talented yet humble engineers who strive to retain the culture of trust. 
Org with well-defined processes and tools that ensures smooth on-boarding. 

Struggles/Challenges of joining new organization - will always be there but the detailed design documentations, historic slack conversations behind a certain feature/product and a true open culture surrounded with friendly people around you make the journey pleasant.","Huge organization with deep hierarchy in leadership, will bring along challenges in translating idea to reality. Its no different here. In a way its good as these ideas go through a process of churn in their pursuit of weighing their merits, but these acts as road bumps to reduce the pace of innovations."

Micro-management exists under some management but feedback are not welcome because they always pushed things back as your own problems.

Health insurance is cheap, for actually extremely good plans. The lowest tier is completely free! Good dental and vision care too. Lots of time off to volunteer, but the biggest standout is the $100 per month wellness reimbursement, which can be used on lots of different things. If you use it, it becomes an incentive to take care of yourself and an effective $1200 per year of extra pay.
Management is extremely flexible about when and where you work, which is extremely convenient.","Get ready for senior leadership to forget that your job exists, unless you're in sales. ~80% of All Hands Calls are focused entirely on sales, and the majority of training you have to complete is sales focused, even if your role is not in sales.

The newish job definitions created transparency, but don't always benefit the employee or the company when something outside of the box is needed. A PM working on a new product that will take a multi-year effort does not meet the requirements for their job or promotion because everything is based on an existing product and working with Scrum teams.

1677,Salesforce,Complete Waste of Time,2021-09-25,1.0,Strategic Accounts AE,Zero as far as I was concerned.   It’s all about an every changing PowerPoint narrative that is high level at best — and the “next big thing” everyone was directed to focus on —  which changed at least 3 times in my short tenure.,"The huge number of sales “overlays” is shocking and a complete disservice to shareholders.   Very few were evenly moderately well versed in their “cloud specialty”.    

For a company that invented CRM, the instance of CRM the Reps used is a compete mess of a maze with duplicate account records, thousands of overcomplicated widgets and very little explanation for why they were needed or even better; why not sunset them?   Many were useless and last used years ago.   

Most shocking was discovering that less than 40% of the Reps make Quota.   I never once heard on an All Hands call any reference to Quota Attainment — it was all about the record breaking prior Quarter or Prior Year Growth — and as a result how awesome everyone was!  While growth is a critical metric, when Quotas have almost zero chance of being attained, the model is broken.   Or it’s just simply disingenuous.  Thinking high caliber (and highly recruited) Reps are going to stick around for their base salary with the hopes that next year’s account list “might” be better is a non starter."

1685,Salesforce,Buyer beware,2021-09-23,3.0,Account Executive,"-AMAZING BENEFITS, great health care, ESPP, maturnity leave, all that good stuff
-You will meet great people who will push you to be your best
-The CEO actually cares
-Cool swag, events (when we were in the office), office is really cool, great office perks
-Being a power user of Salesforce will serve you well in the future and having Salesforce on your resume means you can get a job anywhere","Now time for a reality check, hence the ""buyer beware""
-High expectations no matter what. If you have a bad territory expect to not make any money and be constantly stressed about numbers. Doesn't matter what you do, they only care about numbers/ACV closed
-Management needs a little work in the compassion area. Working through a pandemic and political turmoil is pretty difficult to sell CRM to small businesses who just had to fire half their staff or are GOING OUT OF BUSINESS but we are still expected to ""get creative""
-If you are lucky, you will get a territory that has an account that shouldn't be aligned to you but you will make your number from it cause management will look the other way since they want the ACV for themselves
-Brand is absolutely everything, Anything you say or do will be held against you. You say one wrong thing it will get around.
-Pay is horrible. You get a $1/hour increase when you get promoted for each role and they frame it like your OTE will be much higher though. FALSE, again unless you have an amazing territory, 25% of people ACTUALLY hit their number/OTE. So good luck with that. 
-Office perks are no longer. Since everyone is remote, half the perk of the job was all the cool things at the office. Say goodbye to that if you work remote. 
-PTO, don't even bother trying to take PTO... ever. You will fall behind or be guilt-tripped for taking it at all. Want to take PTO at the end of the month? ha not a shot. Want to take PTO at the end of the Quarter? good luck getting that approved. Want to take time off after the fiscal year ends? ha then you are the sucker who isn't working on their pipeline generation for the next year. 

Overall, great company. But if you want to go into sales here, get ready to have your ego, confidence, and sanity ripped to shreds. I would recommend any role here BUT sales."

1696,Salesforce,Don't believe the hype - lots of cool aid and group-think,2021-09-21,2.0,Senior Solution Engineer,"Phenomenal products. The platform is unreal, honestly they sell in spite of themselves a lot of the time. Most lost sales are of our their own doing. Pay is ok - they don't expect much, and pay accordingly.

A lot of autonomy, the brand buys a lot of credibility and the opportunity to get involved in great work and great customers.","Sadly a very big strong culture of group think, not a lot of true independent thought going on (generally actively discouraged - a lot of ""but this is the way we've always done things""). 

Culture is predicated on a lot of cool-aid drinking - espouses values ""trust, customer success, innovation, equality"", these look nice on a slide but are sadly mostly lip-service. The company simply expects people to believe these things because they have a well established brand, rather than earning them and living them day to day (which an alarming number of people do not). Most of the actions they take in this space (equality especially) are often quick-fixes that look nice on a headline but don't fix the underlying problems

Fundamentally most of these values and even the view around ""making the world a better place"" are absent inside the company. Once you're in, it's all about the current quarter's revenue and not much else. Long-term customer relationship management or strategic planning are almost entirely absent from KPIs or discussions, everything is about the immediate sale opportunity and how much money it will bring in - Customers' relationship managers generally get shuffled every year, so the customer never really ends up with a strong relationship. 

They generally depend on the fact that once you've bought and invested in the system and embedded it into your processes, it's too expensive to switch, and palm off implementation to 3rd parties and don't take ownership of success/failure for the customer, too busy already focussing on the next quick sale."

Many people are willing to jump in and help wherever possible. Company has excellent benefits and the majority of people who work here seem to really enjoy what they do.,"High pressure environment felt mostly by sales teams. Most power is taken away from the AE's to be able to run and execute on deals, which feels like a lack of trust. RVP's and AVP's are expected to come in to 'save the day' and close the deals vs empowering the team. Big opportunity to upskill AE's, RVP's, AVP's and SVP's on executive engagement and how to have value driven conversations with customers instead of leading with product. By promoting strong AE's to 1st line managers, they don't have the training and coaching in place to make them into good leaders."

This job taught me a ton about persistence and focus and I most certainly would not have the job I have now (alliance leader at a global SI) without the lessons I learned in this role.","Month over Month quota can prove to be extremely taxing on a person's motivation and self esteem over time. It doesn't help that the quota usually does not change each month...so you are expected to hit the same metrics in December as you are in a more normal month like October.

If you are starting at the bottom, it is a long grind to the top. The Commercial AE role you can bridge into from AE can be very challenging as MuleSoft is designed for Enterprise companies. I personally chose to switch companies with 2 years experience under my belt."

Having been at other companies where you are worked to burnout and then some. I also know that some roles here are taxing and overwhelming as well. I have not experienced that in this role. This is an advisory and support role. You will be relied upon to know the platform, know security schemas, and some architecture and help, guide, and teach customers best practices. There are a lot of reading, learning, and conversations. 

Presentation, communication, demonstration, and soft skills are also needed for this role.","Sometimes you feel like you are on your own, and have to figure things out. 
Not a lot of 1:1 development, you have to feel out what you want from your manager
Not always sure I am ""on the right track""

It's not a great job for anyone who needs constant reassurance, you will do best if you are a go-getter and can network on your own with your teams.

- Great work / life balance as no one expects anything from you","- Salesforce is a business oriented company, so no high tech is present there. Some orgs are stuck at Java 6
- Some engineers have no clue about modern technology
- Lot of people are hired by referrals, so they all know each other from their former companies
- Salary way below FAANG, no extra RSUs for those who can't sell themselves. You won't get promoted just because you are smart, as all promotions are a political things.
- Not everyone might understand Indian work culture"

 Left after two years, I feel like the whole environment became much more hostile towards employees. At the beginning there was more learning space, career advancement expectations and good management, but I think the company lost track of the value of the employees lately and they are experiencing high attrition rates as a consequence. No space to express opinions and suggest improvements, some markets are restructured and there is no easiness of communication. Most of the colleagues who started with me left for better opportunities in terms of salary and benefit. HR is very slow at replying and they closed the main Public (internal) channel of communication- I guess because there were too many complaints to take care of. Management is often disorganized and issues are solved slowly if ever, resulting in frustration for the employees and possibly financial and work balance consequences. Satisfaction surveys are often handled out but results are not taken into account- or at least that’s what seems like. Some teams were asked to disclose if they undertake interviews with other companies. No clear vision to go back to office and giving reassurance to teams."

When the pandemic hit, Salesforce made sure that its employees were well-outfitted to work from home, and emphasized prioritizing mental health and balancing new work/life struggles. (Note that it wasn't all rosy, Salesforce also chose to do a round of layoffs during the pandemic, even though they were experiencing a record quarter, which caused a lot of controversy.)

For as large of a company as Salesforce is, it is reasonably transparent. Employees have access to executive leadership, and have opportunities to ask them tough questions, such as regarding the layoffs they chose to do during the pandemic.","There is a lot of pride in Salesforce's culture, which can often feel a bit cult-like. I joined Salesforce through an acquisition, and the leaders at the acquired company seemed much more used to tough questions than leaders that I observed at Salesforce.

There's also a lot of internal training stuff through their internal trailhead platform that seems more time-consuming and less value-packed compared to other companies I've worked at."

When a company stops taking care of its employees, the customers are next. The non-productive overhead has increased significantly and they are now cheating their sales and sales managers out of commissions. This is no longer a place for experienced or top producing AE’s. They will screw you out of money any chance they get and hide behind the policy. It's really sad actually. Even medium producers have compensation challenges. Go elsewhere unless you don't care about money or are a new or mediocre sales rep. Top talent won't get rewarded here."

The benefits are great and when you have the right team you can win business.
For the right job this company is a no brainer to join.","Local leadership is so focused on female diversity outcomes that talented internal and external candidates that don’t fit that profile are overlooked. Very “stepford wives” without any people of colour in senior roles within the CEO’s direct business (at least that was the case last year).
Lots of people politic to get promoted - straight talkers and doers are often side lined vs “brand” individuals. 
Targets have become unrealistic and territories are carved so thin that by staying you are effectively giving yourself a pay cut each year. 
The culture has become bloated with self importance. Nothing humble about the way it’s presented. 
Over focus on certification and pointless training. Seems to keep an army busy while the workers barely get time to see customers anymore.
Work/life balance depends on your role. Plenty of people seem to have lots of time to be volunteering or involved in non-revenue generating activities while other people are smashed."

- Competitive Salary and Great Overachievement Earnings
- Philanthropic and encourages use of your time to volunteer
- Great company to have on your CV.","What they're doing is working at a business level. The company is a rocket ship, still. But it's at the expense of its people. Below are a few of the cons I find most frustrating.

- Micro Management on an extreme scale. I joined just before the pandemic and it has gotten continually worse since being forced to work from home. You don't feel trusted.
- Unrealistic workloads. 
- Encouraged to manage your work life balance but chastised if you actually do it. I've been scolded for having my car serviced at 2pm, or taking annual leave at a quarter cut off to celebrate a birthday.
- Meetings for meetings sake burning precious time.
- Saturated account sets. Prospects get bombarded continually from all angles of Salesforce and have been for over a decade.
- Lead generation is down to you. You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts. I have not had more than 3 leads passed to me in almost 18 months.
- Always an ""urgent"" action that needs to be taken. Often which is not directly impacting your ability to engage with clients."
1979,Salesforce,It keeps getting better!,2021-08-17,5.0,Devops Engineer,"The culture - Salesforce's core values are enforced at every level; no one is paying lip service to diversity, inclusion, and valuing people above profit. The benefits are unparalleled, especially for parents. There are a million little benefits that all really add up. I was offered by role, at a higher salary than my previous role. However, when I added up all benefits, it came out to almost doubling my salary!","I am not loving trying to be a part of a large, global team, remotely. Many offices remain closed for safety, and our teams are spread out geographically such that I may NEVER meet most of my coworkers in person."

1982,Salesforce,"A good career move, but the politics can be brutal",2021-08-16,3.0,Director,"I worked at Salesforce for almost 10 years, over a lot of growth. There was a lot of opportunity to do different things. There are some great people at the organization that I worked with, and for a while felt well compensated for my contributions. Having Salesforce on your resume is a great career builder.","As the company has gotten bigger, roles have become more narrow. I had looked to move into another role for a while, but, as a director level, there weren't a lot of opportunities - Salesforce is hiring more and more junior people to fill roles. My position was eliminated and replaced by an analyst level person straight out of college. Many other higher level ( read- older, long-term employees) folks were part of the same layoff in 2020. 

You will have many different managers while you are there - I had 13 in 8 1/2 years. So, if you have a bad one, wait - they will move into something else. The bad part of this is its hard to make a mark when you constantly have to re-prove yourself. 

The company used to give raises every year - even just a cost of living raise. This stopped around 2017 or so. So negotiate your upfront salary well."

1994,Salesforce,It's a mirage - Do you research,2021-08-13,2.0,Account Executive,"Similar to other reviews pros. You can find their benefits packages online. The company acquires new business almost semi-annually so you can potentially move around.

Benefits/Perks/ESPP
Some amazing coworkers
Pretty good c-suite/ Amazing middle line managers
Great managing Covid - Listened to the employee feedback for the most part","There are reviews here with 0 cons which I find hard to believe for a 60K employee company. They jam public surveys down our throats to get the image of the ""Best place to work."" Seems like HR is rushing to drown out poor reviews....

Salesforce is an okay place with some very, very toxic people. I've met one of the worst human beings of my life here, and with how the world is in 2021, that's saying a lot. First-line leaders are more often bad than good. Back office draws territories randomly every year, and leaders have very little say, so it's the luck of the draw. Under 20% of reps hit quota and meet their OTE for a company already underpaying due to their name. You need to hit quota to get paid a reasonable amount which only happens once maybe twice a year if you're lucky. Managers won't acknowledge that you have a bad territory and have the same expectations as the leading rep. Leading rep makes 3 to 4 times the amount of everyone else and is put on a pedestal but everyone including themselves knows it's the opportunity given. Accounts change every year, so prospecting is demotivating, knowing the work you do will go to someone else. Essentially an order taker with not enough orders to hit quota. Very saturated market. Inundated with pointless nonrevenue generating admin work/meetings. Inundated is an understatement. The majority of the information logged within the CRM is fake due to the pressure to meet all of the initiatives and stay off the naughty list. Leading to inaccurate reporting which leads to increased expectations.

You will be drowning, gasping for air as your first-line leaders stand on your shoulders with their heads out of the water... for the most part. If you can tread water for 2+ years, you will get the Salesforce stamp of approval on your resume to find a better, higher-paying job. 2-3 year turnover is drastic. HARD WORK DOES NOT GET YOU AHEAD. Your mental health and wellbeing will deteriorate.

Please do your research and reach out to folks working there to get their opinions."

They do not publicize retention. Microaggressions, bias, and unequal pay are still issues. Zero accountability, even from teams tasked to lead this work. From a technical standpoint, it can be easy to pigeonhole yourself into their proprietary stack such that those skills are less marketable outside of the Salesforce community.

You can't quite see the termites, but the underlying rot has set in and been reinforced by all of the Oracle and Microsoft intake.

They have very poor work culture, low pay and lots of pressure and humiliation in the name of regular feedbacks, promotions etc. You will be under lots of pressure constantly.","Your manager will be giving you pressure by doing regular nit-picking instead of giving feedback in a proper way. Folks with higher designation are always preferred, and they can give any feedback of yours that they want. If you are stuck somewhere in work, then you cannot reach out to other teammates for guidance as they if you reach out to them they will give a negative feedback of yours.

Despite all the lip service to “equality” the idea of it within the workplace culture is selective an applies only to those who cow and obey the party line. 

2. Salesforce puts the CULT in CULTure. There’s an underlying expectation that Salesforce should fulfill every part of your being. From spiritual, “join this mumbo jumbo mindfulness session lead by some trendy junk shaman” to the political that seems to only represent one side of an issue.

2080,Salesforce,Grateful for SFDC but it's not a walk in the park,2021-08-02,5.0,Sales Enablement Program Manager,"There are tons of great opportunities at SFDC if you seek them out and take advantage of them. The brand recognition is huge and working here will only help you in your career. 

-great benefits and perks (could be a bit better for such a large company) 
-great SF office location and in office perks. World-class for sure and lots of resources to set you up for success when working in office 
-quickly adapted to WFH once Covid hit and is now on a path to a flex working even after office restrictions lift. The ""success from anywhere"" model is not just something the company preaches for customers 
-dedication to giving back, volunteering and making the world a better place 
-commitment to the company values
-lots of very hard working, smart, passionate people 

For a long while, I never thought I would work at a better place than SFDC and I think that opportunity could still be there if you're on the right team.","The company culture at Salesforce has changed a lot in the 4 years I was there. I felt like things really changed in late 2018/early 2019 when the company started to see quarter after quarter of success, plus the SF HQ tower opened. 

Within that change, what I felt was us moving towards being overly corporate and people constantly seeming stressed out. There started to become a very formal feeling wherein coming to work meant that people we afraid to say what they thought, decision making became harder because of so many silos within the company and politics abounded. 

The politics at SFDC were probably the most stressful thing for me. It was hard to feel valued when the company is constantly reorging in some area, having layoffs even after record breaking quarters and constantly pivoting. It takes a lot of dedication and energy to grind at Salesforce but it also started to become mind numbing when I realized that it would be very very hard to make it to the top & for it to be worth it. 

The promotions process here is also really murky. They've tried for years to create transparency but it just isn't. Many promotions, even a title change promotion, require you to interview for the role which feels tedious and like another hoop to jump through to prove yourself. 

Another major con for me was that when I changed internal roles, there was no pay increase. This meant that I didn't see a salary promotion of any kind for nearly 3 years. After some time, it starts to feel like you're just a cog in the machine. When I would try to approach financial compensation with my manager, she also would get very cagey. For a company that is raking in the dough, it sure doesn't feel like the wealth is being spread around. 

This is a great place to work if you are either 1) starting your career and can climb the corporate ladder & then jump off to somewhere else or 2) are coming in at a senior manager or director level."

Trust and Transparency is the great qualities of the Salesforce. But it seems the recruiters don't care at all.  Even though referred so many people, Not sure what's the problem, They never got the call for interview. Also, another experience with them, Some of the recruiters at least don't response to the pings when we ping to them for information, Even after pinging so many times. If they don't respond at least to the internal employees, not sure how they interact with the interview candidates. This is very disappointing how they treat internal employees and at least they should respond. I understand ping people are busy some days or times. But not 2/7 or week. Honestly the recruiter experience is worst experience, They don't care at all. They don't respect time and they don't respect individuals and don't reply to at least internal employees. Also I had heard so many that, Even after candidates performed well, Finally the result is the candidates were rejected."

Tons of enablement and assets to leverage in selling, however a lot of the materials live in disparate locations making it tough to navigate. You work with a huge extended Salesforce army, many of which are specialists on a specific product so you’re not expected to be an expert on all solutions which is nearly impossible considering the amount of products you have to sell. You will learn so much here about the art of selling, they truly do produce some of the best sales talent. ESPP is nice, but so is equity which as a sales person you don’t get because they think your commission is enough but the reality is if you’re not meeting your monthly goals then you’re not reaping any of that “benefit”. Monthly wellness stipend is nice and so is the name recognition you'd get on a resume.","1) When starting out they will give you the worst patch to see if you can turn dry lemons into lemonade. As you get more tenured you may or may not receive a better patch, it depends on how you want to navigate the favoritism game. The more popular you are with leadership, the better the accounts and the more flips you will get.
2) To be successful it's all about the 3 T's: Territory, Timing, and Talent in exactly that order. If your accounts aren't growing, you will have a very difficult year ahead living on base salary alone which is already way lower than market. Be prepared to spin your wheels which can often feel like high effort low return as CRM decisions don't happen overnight.
3) Every start of the fiscal accounts are shifted around which can be frustrating both internally and externally. The revolving door of AEs makes it hard to establish long term trust with customers. 
4) Be prepared to invest a lot of time fixing CSAT issues from poor implementation left behind from the rep before you.
5) The majority of ACV is made in Q4 which is around year-end holidays, making it stressful to take time off."

2. Good benefits.","1.You'll need those benefits to seek treatment for issues that result from prolonged exposure to Salesforce's toxic environment.
2. Promotions are based on favoritism rather than competence, responsibilities, and merit. Image is the ONLY thing. They rely on something they call Salesforce style (or something) which is really just a way to allow unscrupulous managers to manufacture unmeasureable reasons to deny you a promotion. 
3. There are several levels of managers who add little to no value but cause a lot of pain. They literally spend all their time going to meeting and running orders down the chain. They couldn't do any of the ACTUAL work if you dared them to. Then they have lots of free time for politicking and deceit.
4. DEI ""efforts"" are nothing more than marketing. They want to see themselves as good people without doing the actual work. The truth is that discrimination is rampant and they do nothing about it. Nothing other than increase DEI-related marketing while they gaslight black and brown employees.
5. Pay is significantly lower than you'd find at other companies in the industry.
6. They will consume your entire life and all of your energy if you allow it through overworking, forced volunteering, forced ""fun"", and all that family talk (all the better to manipulate you).
7. ""Employee Success"", ""Ethics Point"", and the ""Warmline"" are all HR. Their role is to protect the company from liability. They don't actually care about employees.
8. They periodically send a link, via company email, to come to Glassdoor and provide a review. What person who needs/wants their job would follow an email link from their employer and give anything less than 5 stars?"

Prospecting is very difficult as you sometimes only have 3-10 accounts to work with in total, but the target seems to be created from a growth mindset where every account is going through a full digital transformation.

Not all managers are great.
There's turnover here because the training programs and talent that attract people to Salesforce also attracts other companies to steal from Salesforce.
To move up, you need to self-promote and network - if you're not comfortable doing that, you'll be frustrated. Sometimes the ""one love"" vibe can get old/feel disingenuous - it's still a job.

There is a TON to learn here, and it overwhelms some people because they don't expect it, or refuse to jump in with both feet. If you don't like constant change and growth, please don't work here."

Promotions don't come with pay increase. Overly saturated ""woke"" culture is often overbearing. Under the banner of ""business is the best platform for change"" you will be lectured via email or company webcast on each and every recent social issue as they occur. It is not uncommon for a SVP or above to email their organization on how they feel about a particular social issue.

- Great benefits
- Good pay","Your Account Executives control your destiny. I came in as an outside hire for the first 4 months in the role my Account Executives had no time for me to learn about their accounts, what their goals were and wouldn't let me into their key accounts to help set meetings. This affects my KPI's and was expected to perform with little to no direction. It's radio silent in my 1:1s and was asked to come up with points of view into their new logo accounts. They don't utilize their BDRs correctly and believe were supposed to research all of their new logo accounts and come in with a step by step plan. How am I supposed to do this with no knowledge or direction on any of the products or goals? I've been told by other reps that you have to internally sell you AE's on why things should be opportunities. It's very gamey and if you don't know how to play it...you're in for a rough ride."

Pay and benefits are great.

You feel safe to work here in terms of equality. Salesforce really does shine in this realm.","The push for productivity on top of enormous amount of learning material pushed on people here is unrealistic and stress inducing. During the pandemic more work was given than less.

Getting a promotion requires you to push numbers rather than do work that benefits the team. All of the number fibbers and cherry pickers are the ones getting the back rubs here.

Work/life balance is not respected all that much. It's stated that you should strive for a work/life balance, but the amount of work given does not allow it, and you'll usually find yourself frantically looking for extra time to fulfill work that's been unrealistically dumped on you. 

KPIs are unrealistic given the extension of some issues that customers raise.

Upper management makes quick uneducated changes that usually goes against what everyone in the org would recommend, but they do it anyways."

Ultimately giving them an ego boost. I felt like I was living in a simulation. An ornament. Most of the people at SFDC are smart, but brainwashed, and not smart enough to realise. Lots of people doing jobs that aren't necessary, and it's kind of sad and depressing because they think they're actually doing something meaningful and contributing to something, when in reality they're really not, and just ticking a manager's box.

The only difference between Salesforce and all the other large tech firms is Benioff. He is the master of PR and CNBC love him. He's the master of spin and promoting Salesforce as the ""purpose driven"" company to address the world's social and climatic ills. Other than that, you will work 24x7 and no matter where you are when it comes to your experience, be micro-managed by people less qualified than you. The expectations on quota are no different than any other firm and you miss the mark...you'll be shown the door. Also, expect to drink the kool-aid big time in term of ""social justice"" and other initiatives to push the BS marketing efforts. You'll be REQUIRED to engage with a non-profit or charitable organization and demonstrate/prove 10-15 hours of community activity. This is nothing short of fascist.

The resources are great, but they reference other resources to other resources, it's difficult to find quick answers to things at times as you will get stuck in a rabbit hole of content.

Accounts / Territories can be saturated, lot's of whitespace for AMs. So you have to be good at finding new business to be successful. 

There are too many measures and KPI's. Every week there is a new KPI to try ad hit.

Some are good but those below are doing anything to be noticed. Salesforce used to have a great culture but lost this a long time ago due to hiring talent from slow beurocratic red tape enterprises such as Oracle. They used to say they dont want to be the next Oracle but that is exactly where they have gone. 
Leadership within the support organization specifically is appalling, no vision, no care for employees and very blame oriented. No accountability from global support execs all they care about is ensuring if something goes wrong they can shift blame. This has resulted in a toxic environtment. That along with most new support roles being only hired in their India offices is leading to a poor experience from employees elsewhere and customers are suffering for it also with unhappy employees.
This is not to say there are not some great departments but support is certainly not one of them, stay out of the support organization."

+ Excellent treatment of a global workforce mostly working from home, such as home office allowances, extra days off etc.","- Anyone not in a direct quota carrying roles is treated as a second-class citizen, and the sales side of the business (e.g. account executives and sales leadership) is revered and constantly lauded on internal calls.

- Obsessive fixation on hitting quotas and revenue targets, which drives a culture of upselling (even when the customer doesn't really need it—despite their ""Customer Success"" value).

- It is difficult to relate the SE pay and bonus to company performance—despite ever-growing revenues and beating last year's results, this never really translates into a significant increase in pay/bonus.

- Murky promotion and career progression process that gets called out every year in the employee survey, but nothing really gets done about it. Hiring budget seems to be spent on bringing in more AEs (the quality of which varies considerably).

- The open, sharing culture has led to oversharing, and useful information and documents are scattered across a load of different sources (Google Drive, Quip, Slack, various Salesforce orgs)—with no single way of searching across all of these.

- Lots of internal ""noise"", which can distract from the day job (webinars, endless all-hands calls, irritating Slack channels etc).

- Internal culture can feel a bit cultish at times and there is a growing disconnect between the US and non-US workforce. You have to drink the Kool-Aid to get ahead.

- The internal Salesforce org (Org62) is a mess making it very difficult to navigate, Lots of duplicate data (e.g. accounts and contacts) across the organisation, which leads to internal fighting over territories/customers.

- The company swings between big corporate and scrappy startup: some internal processes are excessively bureaucratic and long-winded (e.g. requiring manager approval for a $5 software purchase), and elsewhere decisions are taken on a whim.

- Some employees can feel ostracised if they don't submit to the (exceedingly) left-leaning, social justice obsessed political views of the organisation.

- A globally distributed workforce means that emails and Slack messages come in at all hours of the day—depending on the team, internal meetings can start early or run late into the evening."

I'm also lucky to have an awesome manager who helps me bring my best self to work and encourages me to look ahead and explore different roles to grow into for future reference. It also feels great to work for a company that shares the same values. The company is focused on customer success so it doesn't waste time on corporate BS. The company makes informed decisions based on data, employee feedback, and to always stay ahead.

2613,Salesforce,Is it a good idea to get into Salesforce CSE? you decide..!!,2021-05-24,4.0,Customer Success Engineer,"1. Salesforce as a company has really good policies towards employees.

2. Allowances, leaves, compensations, and salary for each role are above market standards.

3. In Salesforce the company will bear your expenses to a limit if you want to pursue a course or any other... Also, any Salesforce certification/training that you choose is free of cost.

4. The company is really flexible/ has a good culture.","** This is from my experience in CSE (Customer success Engineering) **

In CSE currently, there is Dev-support and Non-Dev-Support:

-> Scenario 1: You got recruited into the Non-Dev-Support teams:

Non-Dev-Support teams: CRM-Config, CRM-Usage, EDI, etc...

The work that these teams do apart from CRM config is basically niche... Your learning curve will DRASTICALLY fall down.

You have to keep up with the technological changes outside of your team while working with cases related to your team, if you can't do that you are done. 

You will fall into a black hole where you will be an expert in a ""niche"" but can't use it outside of Salesforce. Therefore, you will be hooked to the company.

Even if you decide to go out of Salesforce with your ""niche"" as I have mentioned in the pros... Salesforce pays you well. Therefore, your salary will be high... This creates another problem that is - High Salary - Niche (or Limited) knowledge.

-> Scenario 2: You got recruited into the Dev-Support teams:

Now, In this team, you will have opportunities to gain a vast amount of knowledge but the workload is ""TREMENDOUS"" that you wish you have time to drink water.

Most of the people who join this choose one of the three options below:

- Quite after 2 - 4 months.
- Gain all the knowledge that they can and quit or change teams.
- Stay here forever by becoming ""niche"".



===============================================================

Putting the above scenarios aside in CSE - Associate, junior, senior, whatever everybody does the same work but are paid differently.

There are no job level boundaries - Associate, junior, senior, whatever everyone has the same metrics.

There are N number of examples where a senior has no idea what to do but a junior is an absolute rockstar and yet the senior is paid wayyy...... more than the junior.

Another example:

Let's say you are a junior in Salesforce with an X salary and 2 years of experience in Saleforce. Now you have friend who works in Y company for 0.5X salary and 2 years of experience in Salesforce administration work.

Now, When a senior position is open in Salesforce. The general logic that anybody would think of here.. Let's promote one of our deserving guys as Senior and let's hire someone from outside as junior right?

But that not how Salesforce management works... our managers do not even mention to us that there is a senior position open. Instead, they specifically mentioned that we are not supposed to apply.

Now if you refer your friend to this senior position... Dude, he will get the job - be your senior and earn 1.5X salary while you will be stuck in the junior position for 1 more year.

===============================================================

These are just a ""few"" scenarios."

We sit in employee town halls discussing flex time and working from home, but the leadership in this department wants to micro manage their teams and press their thumbs down on everyone.

What's worse is that it appears that the HR folks are either powerless and so they go along or they are in on it. Several coworkers described experiences of being horribly berated by hatchet folks in HR based on ""complaints"" that HR would not clarify or explain. They described being pulled onto phone calls and told they have to ""apologize for what you did"", and when asked what they were talking about, would be told ""it's impossible that you don't know what we're talking about and if you don't then it's even worse than we thought.""

Some have hypothesized this is how Salesforce rattles employees they, for whatever reason, decide they want to leave ( inside scoop indicates this is another maneuver by some VPs to create ""opportunities"" to shape an org the way they want when they get key folks to self-select out) but have no reason to push them out or worse yet, the employees were actually considered high performing by prior managers.

I highly recommend anyone considering Salesforce to stay away unless it is the best you can get because its a huge company, if you get on the wrong side of just about anyone it could get really bad for you and there is nothing you can do."

It's well-known that in order to be paid fairly at Salesforce, you have to leave the company to get your worth. It's incredibly disconcerting that top talent isn't valued, and that the company is essentially betting you won't take the risk of leaving in order to be paid fairly.

3017,Salesforce,Great place to work,2021-04-06,5.0,Account Executive,Culture and compensation - top company,"Takes hard work, but is rewarding"
3018,Salesforce,Fake culture at Salesforce,2021-04-06,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"good benefits & ""fun"" virtual events","The culture is extremely fake. A lot of politicking and constantly being told to ""stay in your lane"". I'm not sure why this company is always in the top list on glassdoor when it's clear they don't truly care about their employees. They care about the work produced, not your psyche nor your well-being."
3019,Salesforce,Culture eats strategy for lunch,2021-04-06,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Best company I've ever worked for. It's amazing to be part of a company that managed to grow in a super fast-paced without compromising its values and culture. It seems like everyone is always walking in the same direction towards the same goals - we are truly obsessed with customer success. ""Your success is our success"" is not just a generic moto written in the walls to keep people motivated, but what's demanded from each and everyone of us every single day. 
No easy for company with 50k+ employees to have such a great alignment. And it's true, maybe there will be some misalignments here and there, but all in all, I can just say how proud I am to work for a company that appreciates such noble values. 
Onboarding is overwhelming - specially if you're in a sales position, but the opportunity to connect with great people, learn from the best professionals in the industry through a structured enablement methodology is a great privilege. 
As any sales department, people will fight over deals or accounts, but Salesforce has taught it all: processes have been put in place to avoid conflicts and make disputes easier and fair. 
When it comes to innovation, it's literally at the center of everything we do. Salesforce is always 10 steps ahead of the market, planning the next tech hit or next move.","Remote onboarding takes a bit of the excitement of exploring Salesforce, feeling welcomed and connecting with colleagues.
New hires may feel it's too much information and too many things to digest in a short period of time. Trailheads, Astro Courses and Online Sessions can be very exhausting and too theoretical. Having AEs, Managers and colleagues sharing real-life experiences in a fire-side chat can be a great way to learn new things and practice some of the concepts discussed."
3020,Salesforce,Great company culture and truly great performance rewards!,2021-04-06,5.0,Associate Product Manager,"Great culture, great opportunities for entry level Product Managers to build REAL impact rather than menial maintenance tasks, great mentorship programs and learning growth support and great financial packages + performance review salary increase","Does not have automatic annual stock refresh option but have base pay increase option based on performance every year, number of junior roles especially in Product Management are very very scarce, mis-matched networking opportunities for APMs hired with the program versus the ones hired outside the program."
3021,Salesforce,"Great team, horrible internal processes",2021-04-06,4.0,Senior Solutions Engineer,Salesforce is truly a collaborative and innovative environment to work in where they want to let employees come to work every day as their authentic selves. My manager is great and empowers me to reach towards new roles that inspire me.,"The internal support processes are truly horrible, which is ironic considering that we sell an internal ticketing solution. The company’s focus on revenue has gotten far too large, they’ve cut budgets in all the wrong places; it’s seriously compromising our ability to deliver solid products and customer success resources to our customers - even the ones paying us millions of dollars. Customer sentiment towards salesforce is declining. Salesforce needs to focus on its core competencies and stop building out and selling half baked solutions to its customers."

They don’t listen to the surveys we take about our managers or the company

Employees are just numbers and ACV.

“You are here to learn” fail once and see what happens 

Hypocritical behavior from people who wish to empower you, in the end they only talk the talk.

Fake political positions, the CEO earns 20m a year, if he was concerned about the earth, poverty etc he would spare some for others. (Many other examples)

Women are always preferred to management director positions solely because they are women and not based on their competences

Team spirit is inexistant, people won’t hesitate to shame you to their manager and steal deals off you.

Company has been growing forever.","Between my offer and day of joining I get a call saying things have changed and hence my role and my manager will change. I still went ahead and joined. 

In last 3 years I saw my role getting marginalized and eventually killed. And the way this was handled or rather not handled, was disappointing - no communication from HR or my manager till 3 weeks before the role was going to be eliminated. 

In general while the company is growing, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will grow. 

The company puts more incentives on the ""Core"" or Prime sales and not so much on ""Cloud"" or co-prime sales. Co prime sales are clearly 2nd rate citizens."

Benefits are great, most folks feel pride & excitement working here and the 'giving back' is real (7 VTO days!).","At times the Vision seems to shift with each major acquisition, the commitment to Values of equality and innovation ring untrue and the hard selling, ruthless culture takes over.

You will receive no support, will be constantly bullied by people who think they are the smartest in the room but have no idea how the companies they sell into actually work. Their only advice is “be strategic”, but leadership has no clue on what that even means. The group is run by politics. 

Run as far away from Salesforce as you possibly can if you are offered a role in enterprise, unless you want to be treated like dirt and live a completely stressed out life. It is miserable."

- A dozen ways to send messages, no added benefit to clarity or communication
-Kumbaya atmosphere immediately stops when mistakes are made, which feels disingenuous

I think it's also why the majority of employees are are not only talented, but great people (albeit predominantly white). 

The CRM technology works and it's super exciting to work at a company that's so innovative (even after 60K+ employees, countless acquisitions, and 21 years in the biz).

The benefits and pay are top notch (I love being able to pay my bills - hooray!)

C-Suite leadership that can acknowledge their mistakes (I'm lookin' at you, Brent Hyder!), and seem to genuinely want to make things better. I would also say the same about the leadership within my operating unit, for which I'm grateful, but that is not consistent throughout the company. 

If employee success actually reads this, I will totally list them as a pro (although the daily emails always make me smile, so I guess that's a pro as well).","I had a super rocky start at Salesforce and my experience is extreme but not unique: 

I had 4 managers within 15 months, starting 6 weeks into my Salesforce career (90% due to poor luck), and by the time I had my 4th I felt demoralized and completely incompetent. Personal brand is everything, and if you don't have a manager that's going to support you in this regard, you should start looking for another job. Thankfully lucky manager number 4 recognized how I was feeling and got me into a much better place. As of this year, I'm happy to say that I've never felt more supported or appreciated. 

Unfortunately, not every employee has the chance to turn things around, and get the Salesforce experience that the company sells. I fear that this is especially true for our employees that are not white dudes (not to say that they haven't had issues as well, but like many things in this world, the impact is disproportionately on our URM and female employees).

Over time we're putting fewer and fewer resources into customer success, and while it hasn't affected the business yet, it's only a matter of time.

Recruiting is a nightmare to work with - I've never had my referrals treated so badly, and it's so embarrassing, I've given up."
3246,Salesforce,House of Cards. Political and toxic.,2021-03-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Early in your career you learn a lot. 
There are a lot of great people too.","Politics is rife, lack of innovation, culture of highest paid persons opinion, a lack of autonomy, a nightmare to get things done, do not follow through on what they say publically. Not unlike house of cards people will do whatever it takes to get ahead, your career can be derailed in an instant.

They have lost who they are and what made them special in the time I've been there. It used to be a great company. Needs reform from the ground up."

People who work will get nothing and those who don't will get promotions. 
Even if you do your best you will not be appreciated and some who are close to the manager will be appreciated for no reason. 
Had a good experience till 2persons joined the team and spoiled it fully.
Never supported by manager to grow in career."

A little more focus on a combination of the two and finding the right balance between numerical metrics and knowledgable skills & know-how needs to be recognised/implemented.

- Exposure really only to sales vs. other business units. It can feel like BDRs are being put into one bucket (sales making machines) vs. ""you can take your career anywhere"" promised in interviews.

Your metrics combine into a weighted score that determine your eligibility for promotion so you can’t ever miss your oh so high metrics or it will ruin you.

Yes, the pandemic has changed the way we do everything but honestly 95% of the company worked 90% remote before the pandemic so what I'm currently experiencing cannot possibly be as a result of the pandemic.

The culture used to be people oriented where you could bring your whole self to work. You could count on a face paced environment but very clearly direction on objectives. You could expect leadership to be focused and thoughtful in their plans and direction. No more.

The company still pays lip service to ""Ohana"", equality, and our values. However we have increasingly promoted really good engineers into leadership roles -- senior leadership roles to boot -- who have little idea about what it takes to be an effective leader. The company is disorganized and entirely focused on delivering everything yesterday that there is no room to focus on ""Ohana"" and taking care of the people in the process.

Marc no longer is an active, visible leader in the organization. That falls mainly to Brett Taylor who seems content on turning Salesforce into Google.

If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have returned."

3555,Salesforce,Sales at Salesforce,2021-02-10,5.0,Account Executive,"- company is very innovative 
- lots of work perks
- lots of training and resources available to help develop employees",- virtual onboarding can be a bit overwhelming because of how much training/ knowledge you're expected to absorb in a relatively short amount of time
3556,Salesforce,Amazing place to work,2021-02-10,5.0,Customer Success Manager,Work life balance training and assets are suberb.,Internal moves and promotions can be political and difficult
3557,Salesforce,Smoke and Mirrors,2021-02-10,1.0,Account Executive,The Salesforce platform is amazing and so is the training that they provide that is usually onsite in San Francisco.,"The ""culture"" at Salesforce is extremely toxic. Everything that they do is purely lip service. Their work life balance? There is none. Diversity, do they make diverse hires? Sure, are you welcome into the office? No. How do they keep getting such great reviews? Take a look at the reviews, most of them are from employees that are 6 months or less. Right after you attend training(which is great) you are sent a survey to rate them on Glassdoor. You are on a high from training and have no idea what you have gotten yourself into yet so you give them 5 stars. Fast forward if you are an AE you are given your territory that has generated virtually no revenue from the year before or was oversold by the previous rep(you are then stuck with handling customer service issues due to poor implementation) and a number that is impossible to reach. Multiple times a week you are required to have a 1:1 with your manager to go over this territory where you are trying to make lemons into lemonade. Nepotism and favoritism runs rampant here. They allow other employees who have ""put in the work"" aka been there the longest to get the best territories and therefore they are hitting their number and eligible for promotions. The irony of this is that they are also tasked with training new employees where they have the attitude of "" pull yourself up by your bootstraps"". They are little to virtually no help because Salesforce fosters an environment where you personally have to be #1. Anything or anybody that could interfere with that is seen as a threat.  I could go on about how terrible of an experience this was for me and I also recognize that this isn't everybody's experience as well. However I would be lying if I didn't cringe every time I see articles talking about their next initiative."

- not a month without a gift (private concerts, weekend at the CEO's place in Hawaii, sports cars and Cartier watches given away during events or simply for good results)
- commitment to giving back to charities and communities
- very good compensation, generous stock option and free share packages
- to juniors this is wonderland, feels like a cult to the founder
- robust and clear onboarding and ongoing trainings and career development","- seniors are unempowered: there is no real P&L, even the President/EVP of a geography does not have a real P&L. They don't have a balance sheet to manage either. All major decisions are taken in San Francisco by the same 4 people
- if you are not an affirmed Democrat you are clearly excluded. I remember this mandatory fundraising diner for Hillary Clinton. Anyone not paying and going was clearly set aside afterwards
- highly political at executive level: achieving results is considered obvious. What matters to progress is knowing the founder, ""culture and behavior"" and ""personal brand"" which means personal preferences, lack of meritocracy, and fierce competition to build one's ""brand"" (announce results before others, take credit for others work etc)."

3573,Salesforce,"Good professional experience, Inauthentic Culture and Colleagues",2021-02-09,3.0,Alliance Manager,"Great brand on resume 
Learn how to be “sales-y”
Unlimited PTO and flexible work
Good benefits 
Good employee services 
Strong product branding/marketing... basically blows the competition out of the water 
Great training on Trailheads","Culture does not encourage employees to be authentic, instead puts pressure on everyone to have a strong “personal brand,” however as far as I saw the majority of people just adopted the same sales-y brand. 
Collaboration was not easy because teams were territorial and defensive. Felt like people were always watching their backs or backstabbing  to get ahead (and this area in particular always scores low on the internal employee surveys).
No visibility on how performance is measured and how promotions are decided. 
Find myself in meetings where everyone’s saying the same thing just for the sake of saying something and getting visibility. And these are the people who are rewarded. 
Marc Benioff is out of touch. When you keep harping on about “Ohana” but then layoff thousands of employees during a global pandemic when you’ve been reporting major YoY growth, it shows your true colors. I get it, it’s a business. But don’t pretend otherwise. It’s so fake. 

All this is to say that Salesforce has a very very very strong sales culture and it reflects in its employees. If you can drink the cool aid and go with it, great. But if you value authentic colleagues who genuinely value team work, trust, and collaboration - it’s going to be tough to find here."

Companies like Google, T-Mobile, Facebook - all give employee stock. What doesn’t Salesforce with its mega growth? 

401k match is nice but lower than the average. 

Good boys club still exists. Females are treated differently. 

Leadership will never remove middle and lower managers who should be gone. Even after managers get multiple reports filed and complaints. They are still there.

Salesforce focuses on building programs, communications, trainings, and resources to support employees in a continuous way.",The cons are much like any company's during the times of COVID. Missing in-person connection and finding it difficult to build deep connections in an all digital world.
3650,Salesforce,"Honestly, great place to work at",2021-02-03,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"I joined Salesforce Singapore as my first job fresh out of university, and truthfully, it's really the people that make this place an amazing place to work at. Different teams will have different ways of working for sure (dependent on the manager), but overall I find colleagues here willing to share their time and expertise. Even as a junior member of the company, I was never made to feel afraid or hesitant in approaching a more senior colleague for advice. 

There is a lot of trust in my team, which has been especially invaluable in this whole work-from-home situation. The autonomy and flexibility granted in my role is also surprising, but practical I suppose – considering how large the company is growing, it's difficult for a manager to micro-manage the activities of every single team member. 

The remuneration package is fair (not top-of-market however) and comes with lots of benefits.

Most importantly, managers in Salesforce are super supportive about lateral movements within the organization, and outside of it. Telling your manager 'I would like to seek a new challenge this year' is not taboo here. I've lost count of the number of colleagues who have changed roles over the past 2 years I've been here.","Change happens constantly, and sometimes it's uncomfortable, or jarring, even. You're not suited for Salesforce if you're looking for a cushy role where you can just 'settle in' and relax. The company is always evolving, and you have to be adaptable to go along with it.

A large company also means that increasingly, more operational processes have been installed. Is it a pain? Yes, sometimes. But is it bearable in the grand scheme of things? Also yes."
3651,Salesforce,"Great place, but hypocritical at times",2021-02-03,4.0,Escalations Success Guide,"Super flexible hours, depends on your manager - some micromanage but most are chill.

2) Leadership - Benioff and Salesforce leaders are visionaries and highly engaged. I trust them to make the right decisions for the company.
3) Internal Mobility - you are encouraged to explore career opportunities in other functions if that is of interest to you","1) If you are very senior (15+ years experience), I would avoid CSG. Upward career mobility is very limited and leadership makes very little effort to promote a career focused organization. Revenue growth is the primary motivation, career development takes a back seat.
2) Reporting hierarchy - it's ridiculous at some levels. You could be reporting to a peer at your level who's competing with you for promotions, salary increases, recognition, etc. Conflict of interest, you think?
3) Yearly Re-Org: the intent is to position the company for growth, but the rationale and results do not always make sense. It definitely puts the customer through an uncomfortable transition period."

3691,Salesforce,Continues to be a great place to work but..,2021-01-31,5.0,Lead Member of the Technical Staff,"- Working with some of the most talented people in the profession
- Cutting edge developments
- Management structure in Technology that genuinely listens and acts on feedback
- Good benefits package (health, dental, wellness/fitness reclaim, education grant)
- Depending on direct managers a lot of freedom to take calculated risks 
- Internal network very willing to help out and share knowledge and success
- If you are dedicated and willing to put in the effort required you will move up the ranks but don't view this as just a 9-5 alone. You are encouraged to keep a balance but that's not always possible.","- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. 
- The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company.
- Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there.

Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date."

- Flexibility in terms of your schedule, location, and being able to step away when needed

- We know how to work hard and play hard, can we say Dreamforce! 
- Opportunities for upward mobility. As long as you work hard and do impactful work and establish a strong brand you can thrive here and carve out your own career path. 
- Amazing benefits and support for working parents e.g. 6.5 maternity leave, 3 month paternity leave, flexible return to work schedule, fertility benefits, etc.","- Can be bureaucratic at times being such a highly-matrixed organization
- Although innovation is a core value, company size can interfere with ability to be super nimble and agile for certain departments at times (but this not unique to Salesforce, most large companies struggle with this) 
- Hard work is rewarded, but you also have to be diligent about establishing your brand and getting visibility with those who have power to help advance your career. So if you are not comfortable advocating for yourself and sometimes shouting your wins from the rooftop you may not want to work here. This is very true in Marketing, perhaps not all other BUs. 
- While diversity is a core a value, Salesforce like most tech companies are not as diverse as they think, so something to keep in mind if you're a minority. They are, however, making HUGE priorities around DEI initiatives particularly with recruiting efforts."

It is very obvious the leadership has liberal/democratic believes and so do many of the employees. I personally like to avoid discussing politics so I find it really uncomfortable. 

2- It’s such a big organization that it takes a while to understand how it is structured and your career path options. 

3- The Management layer seems to be there to check a box and doesn’t seem to really be trained or given the tools to train and develop their team. I report to someone that does a different role than mine and every time I ask a question related to my role they refer me to a peer in my role cause they don’t know the answer."

Especially with COVID, lots of meetings and that limits productivity.
A little too ""woke"", even as a liberal (ie we're distancing ourselves from our Hawaiian/Ohana culture because it's ""cultural appropriation"") - I think conservatives have to keep that mostly under wraps (common in big tech)
I've heard (haven't experienced) that promotions are somewhat political and very opaque."

- Management is lacking coaching/people/leadership skills, you are heavily managed on opportunities and numbers, but very little on personal improvement.

3827,Salesforce,Very well thought thru Org & true sense of family/Ohana,2021-01-20,5.0,Principal Memember of Technical Staff,"1) OHANA! When I was joining Salesforce from Microsoft, with over a decade of experience in the industry, I had doubts in my Mind - if what Salesforce claims about ""caring for employees"" - is it all real!? After being in the company for 6 months - I must say - oh boy! it is 200% real! Lemme fire an example: At my previous gig in a Cloud company - we had an excellent policy to take a break whenever we need. But, as most of the Cloud teams are always in FIRE - taking that day off and being able to disengage from work was really hard - esp. for someone doing inter team collaboration work - it was just super hard. Here - at Salesforce - they thought this thru & in addition to that ""you can take a break whenever you need"", they invented - wellness breaks - declared 1 day OFF a month - so that the entire org will take a day off - as a result of which - I truly am able to disengage from work and have my day off! Introducing policies - and going extra mile to really mean them - is a sign of honesty. 

2) MARKETING! SALES! In my previous gigs I worked for a couple of world class engineering teams. I know for a first hand - how it feels when we shipped a world class - truly distinguishing and ground breaking engineering product of that time & IT WAS NOT marketed at all! That was a very LOW point feeling. These old companies don't just understand - the need for telling people what we did! They assume that the world is following them :). At Salesforce - your engineering work is in safe hands - as most of the times - it is very much part of the plan & aligns with the bigger Company goals & will be marketed really well.

3) PROCESS! There are strong signs of process-oriented thinking every where. Right from my experience as a new joinee - the amount of information and processes they introduced to me during Onboarding to day-to-day work to creating every team to be a true round-the-world team - very well thought thru! Salesforce has scaled really well to this 50K+ employees sizes - because of these very thought thru processes - on which they continually iterate and make better!","1) TECH PERCEPTION! Salesforce in general is seen as a ""UI on a DB""! Most of the cool tech that happens in the company is unknown to the outside. Its almost like an enterprise suite - QUIP doc, Tableau for business reporting, CRM for sales, Marketing cloud, now the new SLACK for employee comms!

2) ACQUISITIONS! Acquisitions could sometimes bring in low quality code bases to hustle or integrate with!

3) 401K match is less when compared to FAMG."

After all these year when I try to reapply for a similar profile that showed up, I get a response stating my application is not a match which is not true coz I did same stuff earlier in Salesforce.

Just like any other company they are in the business of making money and will dump any loyal employee if there is a way to increase the stock price. Watch out after any new company acquisition as the billions invested in the purchase will need to be compensated with laying off thousands of loyal employees in any region (not just USA) even when there are billions of cash in the bank. Laid off victims were given a couple of months to"" find a new position/role"" within the company except to my knowledge NOBODY I know got that coveted new position, I'm sure someone did but how many out of thousands of laid off employees... probably 1%, 3%? Oh yes, there was a high percentage of over 40-45yr old laid off employees as we all know younger employees cost less. So a lot of talk about diversity but in practice it seems there are just some categories that are considered for a diverse work force, older employees are not one of them.
After you get laid off HR will become very unresponsive, YMMV.

There used to be more of a startup mentality and more freedom. I’ve noticed an increase in administrative activities as we have rapidly grown this past year. 

The “target income” is much less than what recruiters advertise. I’ve overachieved my metrics and have done an amazing job yet have been stuck at an associate title. I am paid less than others who are external new hires in my same role. 

I was told “although I qualify for a promotion, there are many others on the bench who did not make the promotion cut last time. If I want to be at my desired salary I should leave for a year so I am an external hire and then be rehired back in.” I do not want to leave as I love my team but unfortunately I may have to in order to advance my career and avoid red tape. This doesn’t make sense to me since it would cost Salesforce more to replace people than simply giving raises to those who qualify."

Fake culture - I say it in this manner as the term Ohana doesn't really mean anything. It's just thrown around a lot to make you feel warm and fuzzy. Salesforce does things like, send out emails with a list of people's birthday's and anniversary dates that's automated using information from a database. They also send out surveys asking questions about management and your mental health indicating they ""care"", but there is never any follow up or fixes put in place to address it.

Individual contributors often end up managing up and receiving little support. Leadership consistently meets minorities with skepticism, doubt and microagressions. They severely lack empathy and have one vision of success. It’s a very homogeneous culture. If an employee is different, they are gaslit and “othered.” It’s been consistent that BIPOC employees experience mental distress at hands of peers and leadership.

- Perks in the tower and holiday party are impressive
- Sales tactics and strategies are great for growth even as an experienced rep
- You’ll meet very talented sales rep with a wide variance of styles
-ESPP
- generous maternity/paternity leave. Although this will affect your likelihood of be promoted","I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are:

- Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps
- Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing
- Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized
- Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else.
- Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps
- Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure.
-Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you
- Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling

The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers

The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed..."

4244,Salesforce,One of the best places you can work in..,2020-11-27,5.0,Instructional Designer,"The trust they have on their employees is something that's worth mentioning..You actually feel that it's your family, your second home..From the day I joined till today, I have only and only positive things to say..Their technology is top notch, their culture is top notch, their employee benefits are by far the best in the market..And Salary is way above the market standards, so don't bother negotiating :)
It's going to be really difficult for any one leaving this amazing company as they make sure you have a tough time finding another company better than them.
So proud and honoured to be a Trailblazer.",None as of now.  Cab facility is not available in Bangalore.
4245,Salesforce,Outstanding place to work.,2020-11-27,5.0,Strategic Account Manager,The Salesforce culture and values are in the DNA. They care about the customer and staff equally to ensure everyone is looked after.,There has been no downsides.
4246,Salesforce,Great vibe and energy - even when doing it all remote!,2020-11-27,5.0,Strategic Account Executive,The benefits and culture are fantastic! I've never worked at a company that truly values their employees the way that Salesforce does and tries to strike a great work/life balance with flexibility and positive encouragement at every turn.,"Lost to learn.... it can be a bit overwhelming when you start the onboarding journey, esp as I have had to do all of it remote. The instructors and leads do a great job of making us feel welcome but there is loads of content to get through in the first few months!"
4247,Salesforce,"Great culture, work and vision",2020-11-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'm always challenged with meaningful work, I feel valued, my team and partners across the organization are incredibly supportive and I know the company has incredible vision and will continue to grow and accomplish great things.

And personally I feel proud too working in a company that is on such bullish growth trajectory with organic and inorganic growth these past years. Simply amazing!","Direct management would determine whether you'll be staying in Salesforce for long or short-term.. Unfortunately thats the case for us, current leader is not someone most people would look up and respect due to his communication style and mindset - this has really discouraged the direct and extended team."

There is also flexibility and mutual respect within the unit so that everyone is able to collaborate better.

Between the interview experience, onboarding, employee perks and benefits, and day to day experience, Salesforce has lived up to the hype it receives as one of the best companies to work for amongst so many lists and awards. The culture is unparalleled -- for being such a massive company, the transparency and communication from the top down are extremely impressive, and you never feel like you're out of the loop or don't have access to the resources you need to answer your questions or concerns.","The only con I can think of is that it is hard to get in -- even getting an interview is challenging, but if you connect with someone on LinkedIn and get to know them and work with them, they might be able to serve as a reference that might increase your chances of getting your resume looked at!"

4267,Salesforce,"Great Role, Expected Responsibilities, Good Management, Comforting Covid Response.",2020-11-23,4.0,Sales Strategy Analyst,"The role is as expected. It allows for experimentation in process and areas for improvement, while considering the historical context of why something is the way it is. 
Being entirely remote (because of COVID) since beginning, there is good work/life balance. 
The company has given WFH Stipends for employees and has excellent communication in the form of All Hands meetings (very frequent) and email communications.
I feel respected for my experience, and not pressured on my performance. 
We are all in the same boat, so we all have essentially similar expectations.
The pay is good, as are the benefits (I expect would be better if work was in person). From what I understand, the promotion and salary reconsideration processes are fair and equitable.","There are a lot of processes in these roles that could be consolidated company-wide (or at least department-wide), that are not, which often times results in duplicate work or straying from the norm. Those processes need to be standardized. 
Sometimes it is hard to feel like a dialogue flows between colleagues, which is expected in an all remote environment, but a challenge nonetheless. The same goes for culture building, but efforts are being made, and I expect this to be more of a result of Remote work, and not the team/department. 
Processes often are overly complicated and should be assessed to whether or not they add value or could be simplified."

The company has stepped up and provided resources for self-case and encouragement to take care of ourselves, including PTO, remote work, etc.
- Compensations and benefits some of the best I've had in my long career
- Obviously, SFDC is a very profitable company, so I worry very little about the long-term viability of the company
- Before the pandemic when I went into the office, the workspace is excellent with snacks, a meditation room, etc.
- My team has been great to work with really open and collaborative, and many individuals outside my team have been willing to help me with advise or guidance","- Change management and communication is not Salesforce's strong suit -- this can sometimes cause internal friction, or even have negative customer impacts because folks who need to know about changes may be not in a loop
- Salesforce's approach and general attitude is very product, sales and marketing centric, which has been key to our success. However, for those of us who are in the services side of the business, the resources and enablement materials at our disposal is not as bountiful as they are, for say, SEs and AEs, so we not set up for success as much, making the job more difficult.
- While Salesforce often says they put the customer at the center of everything they do, those who are not customer facing sometimes lack the ability to put themselves in customer shoes, but those of us who do interact with customers rely upon other internal teams to make them successful, so often times the biggest challenge is navigating our massive organization and hoping you'll be able to get the attention of the person who can help, and hoping they have the resources and time to help your customer."

Most managers don't have an interest in developing, coaching or helping their team. They are paid on the performance of a territories growth and not individual success so as long as they are hitting YOY targets, which means they aren't concerned about individual success. Success is heavily dependent on the territory and winning the ""Salesforce lottery."" People seem friendly but are very exclusive with only your ""brand"" being the leverage you have for success-- even if you are performing well or the hardest working. If you are looking to move verticals etc.. you can easily be blocked by your manager if they want to keep you for their self-interests. The management has created a self-serving environment where people don't really care or want you to have a fulfilling career. You will be shunned and humiliated in front of others if you speak up.

The compensation and benefits are at the top of the industry standards. The leaders here truly care for those that work under them, and wellbeing is something that is emphasized and preached. Honestly, I have never been happier at a job before.

Chatter is ridiculously distracting. So much activity and information thrown at you - I had to hide/ignore it.
Google slides are the worst. Bring on Microsoft Product Suite, that's what all our customers use and prefer.
You are shunned if you don't get a Mac. It's bad. (not a fan at all - prefer windows) Macs are way harder to set up a home office and a ridiculous amount of peripherals and cords needed compared to Windows based home office and connectivity."

Idk where these people came from but they are micromanaging, unrealistic, unhelpful, insulting...like the list really goes on. Maybe my expectations were too high coming to this amazing company but there needs to be more training for leaders.
- Promotion process is terrible, you're expected to ""network"" to find any answers to anything and it ends up being a huge waste of time more often than not. And don't even think about leaving the sales org. Managers don't help and People across the company look down on BDRs. Also, the pay compared to other places is not good at all. $50K base in seat and after you promote to the next step. OTE increases in next role but not base salary no matter what you promo into.
- High metrics, low commission
- Like any other sales role, you are made to feel as though you are only as good as your numbers
- The metrics are INSANE. Everyone knows people are just BS'ing their way through bc the metrics are so unrealistic
- Work-life balance is horrible if you're actually trying to do your job the legit way and its high stress all the time despite whatever is going on in the world

- Great culture with focus on equality, encouraging employees to give back and focus on wellness","- Some of the co-prime sales teams are dominated by white people or those from USA, France or Australia.

I certainly made a few friends their for life.,"The IT security department is highly political and externally hard to make any meaningful change. Senior leaders are there to protect themselves and have stopped focusing on helping the company or it’s customers as a whole. Senior leaders to often dictate the way something should be with very little interest in others views.  Sadly departments have been siloed and are often forced to compete with each other instead of collaborating together.

No matter what is said, Salesforce does very poorly when it comes to supporting remote offices. If you aren’t working at one of their major hubs on the West coast of the US, then expect very little support or compassion when it comes to working in a remote office, or a non-HQ timezone."

Lots of sugar to keep you excited about your company ( at the same time they want you to be healthy)
Great office ( even though the decision of if you will get a seat depends on which team you work for)","Equality (Pun intended): IN spite of one of the core values of the company being Equality, the organization is RIFE with inequality. It first starts with who gets a seat at work. A company that boasts of technology and how they help businesses, they have no idea of what their growth is or will be. The tech teams grow inorganically leaving all the other teams to cram into rooms. There is clear discrimination right from senior leadership on who gets a seat and who does not. Tech teams are treated like kings and no one ( including the CTO)has the power to change their minds. There is a very heavy tone of ""ENTITLEMENT"" when any one approaches these tech teams or in discussions with them , something the company is very proud of. Even the facility team listens to what the leaders have to say and implement them. 
The Internal communication board even has a forum for people to vent, that is a great place for humor, with people complaining about the flavor of yogurt served in the fridge and many more trivial things.This (in)equality is not just limited to seating options but to pay, travel benefits and how they are treated by the infamous HRBP's ( or the human resources) They too clearly are unequal to teams, paying full attention to Tech teams and quite clearly ignoring smaller teams. I have met my ESBP twice till now ( official meetings) in my entire tenure as they are too busy taking care of the bigger teams. And  who is there to ask them or question them, no one!! They seem to be the busiest team in the office while none of them are visible in the office post 4PM, imagine now when it is virtual. Talk about an easy job in Salesforce.
Then there is a great term that they keep using ""OHANA"" like from an episode of Black Mirror they want to make sure you get sucked in to the idea of ,while the company really does not care. BTW that means' Family"" in Hawaiian, while no one is treated like one. Just giving people a lot of cupcakes and goodies( SWAG as they call it) is only marketing their company and the employees lap it up like puppies with a new chew toy. This is what the company's idea of a family is, give them stuff that is absolutely unnecessary and make them feel like they get ""SO MUCH"". Employees need to be bribed to fill up surveys, because well they don't do anything without a ""gift"". 
Any one who is planning to work for this organization should be particular about their ethics policies, which is an absolute joke.I am aware of some employees who were victims of this team, they either did not get justice for their complaint or were terminated for wrong decisions. I wish I had that kind of job where I can decide peoples' fates based on whims and fancies and no one to answer to. I strongly believe they have monthly targets to get people off the rolls!
I know the HR team will scramble and get this review off this platform in an instant ( BTW one of the other values of the company is transparency).

India offices are filled with wrong leaders and sadly nothing from the above will change."

4697,Salesforce,The WORST company and the LAST COMPANY that you should consider - all is just MARKETING GIMMICK!!,2020-09-04,1.0,Sales,Good compensation and benefit overall,"Salesforce APAC is the bad and poor management compare with other regions.
Politics, Blaming each other, ""Pointing finger"", inconsistency, MICRO management, insult and public harassment (especially during forecast review), favouritism are all happened here. It was bring me to surprise as they have been always proud to be ""THE BEST WORKPLACE"", but in reality, IT IS FAR away from best workplace.

Value:
They put ""TRUST"" as number 1 value but it is not the case. It is just MARKETING act to drive market perception and attract people to join.
Micro management has been cascaded from top management to manager. They grilled people during forecast call, humiliate them in front of peers, inappropriate wording that I have never seen in my whole careers. 
Value number 2 is ""Customer Success"" which is all MARKETING only. What they care is only BRING THE DEALS IN, at every cost! They are not really care even the customer ended up with fail implementation, they just ""hit and run"" sales management.
Value number 3 - Innovation, they tried to launch new innovation but their partner ecosystems are not ready. A lot of escalation happened and nobody would like to take the ownership.
Value number 4 - equality, Favouritism are happening here. People got promoted just only because they pleased top management. You need to be their inner circle to get promoted. 

TRANSPARENCY is the BIGGEST problem in Salesforce. Last week was ""sad week"" in almost every region in the world. After strong earning report, they announced that there will be a ""reshaping the business"" which is LAY OFF - which was the same day they cut thousand people around the world. They called - ""RESHAPING "", ""People that get impacted"", ""Sunset organisation"" and any other terminology then LAY OFF. 
They says that they are growing and actively hiring but the fact is: A lot of peoples are resign and very rare for people to stay more than 2 years or even 1 year, they keep hiring because they need to fill in the position."
4698,Salesforce,Mixed Experience,2020-09-04,3.0,Marketing Cloud AE,"Marc Benioff is a true visionary, compassionate, fearless leader.",There are a number of incompetent leaders who diminish the abilities and talent of the people reporting to them. Company is very sales and revenue focused which often drives the wrong behavior in the sales teams - making them less concerned about doing what's right for the customer in favor of making their quotas. Customer Success team is hugely understaffed.
4699,Salesforce,Nice company to work for,2020-09-04,4.0,Principal Solutions Engineer,FTO is a myth - have to beg manager for time off,FTO is a real myth as it all depends on your manager. I've never seen this model to work in any company as you have to beg your manager for time off and usually that means delayed workflow or getting someone else to cover. Not a practical vacation policy. Would rather see PTO based on time served and get that paid out when I leave the company.

4701,Salesforce,Obsolete Management and Working Style.,2020-09-04,1.0,Senior Associate,"Benefits such as wellness allowance, great office location (centre of Tokyo).","JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. 
Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication.  This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means.
When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend."

4720,Salesforce,From Ohana to Osama,2020-08-31,1.0,Account Executive,"Salesforce

 is globally a good company with a great portfolio, a solid set of values, and a good engagement model with their clients. Revenue grows constantly year on year and share prices have skyrocketed recently. Employees have the possibility to take enroll in a beneficial stock purchase scheme. Other benefits include wellbeing reimbursements, life insurance, education.","Salesforce Asia with its only office in Singapore has witnessed a very poor management performance since the beginning of 2019.

Portfolio:
Despite the overwhelming strength of the Salesforce portfolio, Service Cloud (the customer service centred arm of their CRM) is the only well performing product. Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud (dubbed the ""Attrition Cloud"" by sellers because clients tend to cut relation with Salesforce after unsuccessful deployments), MuleSoft, and even the latest promising acquisition of Tableau have not received enough management attention to deliver proper results.

Values:
Salesforce has an outstanding set of values with their 1-1-1 model giving value back into the communities (1% equity, 1% of employees' time, 1% of their products.
Also, the concept of the ""Ohana"" is a unique criteria. Ohana is Hawaiian and means ""family"". Employees, clients, partners, and the whole ecosystem are regarded a part of that family. Unfortunately, many employees in Singapore will not be able to testify that family ambience. Start from April 2019 numerous sellers have been hired to serve the ASEAN market out of Singapore (based in Singapore, working in Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand) with the effect that territories have been mutilated and numbers have become difficult to achieve. At the same time it has been announced that representations would be established in the ASEAN countries (see above). But no communication has been made as to what would happen to the Singapore employees serving those countries when the changes would come into effect. Start from August 2020 people have been fired by HR without prior conversations from line of business and been given 2 months notice (the author of this review not being one of them). Others have been offered up to 60% pay cuts to change their Singapore contracts into local contracts in the respective countries, if they would not accept, their employment contracts would be terminated. 

Client engagement:
Despite putting the client in the centre of everything, Salesforce has not helped many clients that were severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Requests had to be handled by the Account Executives and cases have been dragged along months to finally tell the clients that no reductions in their contract commitments would be approved even though those very clients just had lost 30% + of their workforce."

- 2nd hand observation: He creates toxic environments to the team and practice poor communication skills to the team with dictatorial leadership style, leaving most team member frustrated and demotivated.

Opportunities to grow and try new things for people with 15+ years work experience. The social responsibility and commitment to Ohana culture seemed really enticing. But a bit of a sham and Salesforce taught me that work shouldn't be a ""family"" because the most dysfunctional social units are typically families.","As time progressed, it grew more and more ugly. The unintended consequences of growth saw people who were completely incapable of managing themselves leading large teams and even divisions (with the leaders who hired them scared to fire them and admit their failure of promoting them). People who were, frankly, not prepared for the role were given Manager, Sr. Manager, Director, Sr. Director, and VP roles. Towards the end of my time there I spent most days preparing slide decks (apparently VPs can't read anything but slides) and writing scripts for a Senior Vice President who would need to be coached on what to say at meetings to his superiors. Incompetence hires incompetence and quickly tries to root out anyone who questions that. The spirit of the company got lost at some point along the way and now it is more a holding tank for some of the most mediocre people who happen to have extremely high opinions of themselves. This company is often thought of as an innovative company, but it really runs like a government bureaucracy (I have experience in government) where everyone walks around talking and acting a little like the Stepford wives. But very little gets done. There are a few teams who have good leaders that run really well, but most don't. There is a remarkable amount of fear within the company when it comes to speaking up and trying to tackle hard truths. If you are good at your job and do good work, stay away from Salesforce."

Full freedom, ownership, and responsibility of your deals and clients. You have the last word regarding stuff related to the sales process and your voice will also be listened and respected in any other area or topic.

Amazing structure and processes. Everything is thought and in continuous progress so there is always something or someone ready to give you answers or help you out.

Huge incentive package with repetitive SPIFFs and bonuses that can rocket jump your final compensation and motivation. If you mix it with all the benefits and perks Salesforce provides, you can really simply focus on working.

Feeling of family, understanding, and respect since day one. Values of Ohanna and Equality are not just a commercial label but something that's put in practice every day.

""Limitless"" career progression. New positions, clouds, acquisitions, and markets are coming up in a really fast pace manner so you can visualize your future next step within the company in a very early stage.","Information overload. Having an already impressive world of solutions, with new updates, apps, integrations, or products coming up every month, is almost impossible to stay on track about all you should know. The resources are limitless and helpful but you can get lost in a huge ocean of data that can lead to a little bit of desperation.

Easy to fall in an only work mindset life, and it will be your fault, not the company's. Moving into Dublin (not the most exciting and cheap city in the world) for a job will already tell enough about you. This is a demanding job with a lot of freedom and perks from the company (the company and the management are the number 1 rest, holiday and work/life balance importance praisers) but if you want to do a good job and perform as you are coming here to, expect to work very long hours and days, especially in the beginning.
 
Don't expect to be a free bird as you used to be, probably never. Targets are ambitious and so is your compensation and benefits, so expect to be tied tight and monitored on a very regular basis. With the working from home, it has been more accentuated that some might confuse it with micromanagement.

Never is enough. Like any other sales company in the world, no matter how much you sell or work, you can always be asked to do little more. Take ownership of your pipeline and expect not to get the foot out of the gas pedal until the holidays break, no matter at which number you at.

The party is almost over. If you are coming from an startup, you should see Salesforce as that older brother that used to be in all of the parties getting into its mid 30's. He knows what the fun is about but is now switching into a more responsible lifestyle and will only join those parties once a month let's say."

The company has shown its true colors during the covid pandemic. Impossible quotas as is with no quota relief during pandemic. BDRs are measured by how much Monopoly money they put into Salesforce and how buddy buddy they are with their AEs. The company says one thing to the press but treats its employees a completely different way. I have not felt any instance of “Ohana” since being here even though I was super excited to work for Salesforce.

I've had a change in manager in the six months I've been at the company and the whole process was managed really smoothly. I have huge respect for the management and the way that the department functions with AE's and SE's. 

Support through COVID and having to work from home 5 weeks after starting was amazing. There was financial supporting in getting home office equipment and there were plenty of resources made available to ensure mental and physical health through lockdown. These resources are still in place now (daily wellbeing sessions, email updates and weekly leadership sessions to name but a few).",- There is never enough time in the week to learn everything and it can sometimes be overwhelming to try and get up to speed on the products (particularly when the company is buying new companies all the time and creating products for the market to deal with COVID workplace issues in addition).

COVID put all companies to the test and Salesforce reacted with their employees (and customers) first and still continues as the pandemic stretches on. I have been incredibly impressed at everything they have done and continue to do to make sure we still make money, keep our health and family life in mind, and over communicate so we know exactly what is happening inside and outside of the company. 
COVID aside, the people they hire are all really talented and a culture fit so you are working with incredibly smart people that want to help you succeed even if they don't benefit at all. I don't think I've run across one person yet that hasn't offered to help with anything I need now or in the future. 

The bar has been set incredibly high and I don't see myself making a move to another company anytime soon, even if I was offered more money. I am happy at my job and feel really supported and am encouraged to take breaks or days off to recharge.

4897,Salesforce,Top Company in Software Sales,2020-07-24,5.0,"Account Executive, General Business","Salesforce was the first to pioneer Saas, and is the leader worldwide today. This is a fantastic platform to sell, that is known universally, and is adopted for a reason. The product works, and it works well. This is a product that any AE can be confident in, and for me being confident in what I sell drives my success.

Further, Salesforce takes care of it's employees. I've been blown away by the pandemic response. Salesforce is not only a place that a strong AE can make a lot of money, it's a place you know where management stands. Salesforce management publicly came out and said there would be no lay-offs(there weren't), and pro-actively rolled out programs and incentives to take care of employees.

Salesforce is a place you can grow your career, and you can constantly learn. With all of the acquisitions, you can switch to a new product that interests you, or pivot into leadership.

I've worked a number of places in my career, and Salesforce is the best so far. There are absolutely downsides, which I get into below, but for me personally I plan to be here for the foreseeable future. Frankly, I believe in Salesforce's leadership team and strategy. We are making some incredible acquisitions and are positioned to be the undisputed cloud leader in ten years.","Politics. If you have only worked at small companies, big companies are a different beast. Salesforce, like any big company, has an element of politicking to it. At any company playing ""the game"" is important, so expect that here. 

Large quotas, and small patches. Salesforce has fine tuned territory management, and some ae's have stronger patches than others. It is important to succeed early and often so that you have the credibility to be assigned stronger accounts. New employees not willing to hustle and prove themselves do not last. This is how every big company is in my experience. If you don't have a ton of sales experience, make sure you start at a lower title with a larger territory. Big companies are harder to ""learn the ropes at"", as you are competing with the best of the best for things like territory.

Other than the above, Salesforce has been the best move in my career, and I'm thrilled and proud to work here. I've never found a place without the above cons, and the pros far outweigh them for me."

4918,Salesforce,Horrific,2020-07-19,2.0,Regional Sales Director,"Benefits, interview process is very warm and welcoming, salaries are not bad, product is the main positive thing","Being in the middle of a pandemic salesforce likes to receive the positive light. Reallity - hardcore business with no mercy! Internally the EMEA and particularly the continental ESMB Management team is falling apart. Years of bad politics, false promotions based on favourites rather then knowledge is creating a toxic environment. All good sales leaders have left. Now they only have junior managers who don’t know anything and can’t lead. AEs are too afraid to take them into calls! There is no direction just constant change and this is so tiring. Everyone just thinks about themselves! Not worth the job. There are far better leaders and company out there really trying to work with people without burning them out and just replacing them with somebody younger!"
4919,Salesforce,APAC Employee Program Coordinator,2020-07-19,5.0,Associate Specialist,"Best Working Environment. Everyone is quite approachable, there is a sense of family.",There are none to point
4920,Salesforce,Great place to work - with caveats,2020-07-17,4.0,Program Architect,"Salesforce is a great place to work, for a lot of people a lot of the time. My perspective is mostly from consulting services/CSG, but there are some things that apply across the board.

-Excellent focus on work/life balance. Better than anywhere else I've found in terms of consulting or engineering jobs.
-Excellent salary. My title maps to ""senior manager"" level as an individual contributor, and all things considered I am extremely satisfied with it.
-Health insurance is excellent, in terms of coverage/cost/options. One of the better plans I've seen.
-401(k) is excellent if you're an investing wonk. The match tops out at $5k which is middle-of-the-pack, and the plan is through Fidelity (meh) with which you get a good selection of funds, but more importantly, BrokerageLink to invest in the wider markets, and the ability to contribute after-tax beyond the 402(g) limit and auto-convert to Roth with 1 phone call to set this up. This is relatively new in the marketplace, and still rare. Tl;dr is you can contribute as much as $52,000 to your plan for 2020 and characterize as Roth in the end, not $19,500, regardless of your age (research ""Mega Backdoor Roth""), which is a huge benefit for financial planning for highly-compensated employees.
-Working for Salesforce comes with a lot of cachet within the world of software vendors and partners, and access to awesome tools and information. If you've been a consultant or worked for an ISV and geek out to the product, you're going to love it here, and often be able to get involved with really interesting clients, projects, and internal initiatives shaping future product development.","I did say ""caveats"".

-RSUs are low as compared to FAANG and there are no refreshers - hence, there are a lot of boomerangs, and a reputation as a ""retirement home"", because there is no reward for working harder if you are not also trying to get promoted.
-Despite claiming to have a culture of open debate, it doesn't exist and there is seemingly no motivation to change this. For example, even though they say they will answer forum questions relating to the weekly allhands, they never do if it pertains to an internal policy. There is no upward feedback mechanism, except for your direct manager, and on many teams this is a ""player/coach"" who has no involvement in setting the policies of the department. There is an ""airing of grievances"" forum but it is heavily ""tone-policed"". Bottom line is that if you get stuck in a bad situation or team, your options are to change teams or leave, there is no opportunity to improve things from within.
-Silos and a lack of coordination result in many internally competitive and duplicative efforts, and inefficiencies. Product-wise there is crossover between Marketing Cloud and Pardot, Tableau and Einstein; and Vlocity/CPQ/B2B Commerce for example. Whatever's new and shiny (acquisitions and Dreamforce announcements) gets love, but if your area is not, good luck getting Trailhead modules or product management to prioritize new feature development. There are approximately 90 billion different efforts to create documentation for consulting resources for how to do their job, all run by different groups and stored on different platforms. And because Slack and Microsoft are viewed as competitors, there is no company-wide collaboration tool like Slack or Teams, it's just a bunch of incomplete tools like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter and Quip and email and....
-There tends to be a lot of politics between teams, even beyond the product-related competitive/redundancy issues. 

In short, if you like what you're doing, and who you're doing it for/with, you're in a great position. But if you don't, you're going to have a bad time. I don't know anyone who was unhappy with their situation in Salesforce who subsequently made it better, at least without changing teams."
4921,Salesforce,Phenomenal Company To Work For,2020-07-17,5.0,Technical Architect,"I’ve been fortunate to have been here long enough to see it go from a mid-size vendor company to a behemoth, and throughout the company has retained most of what I love about working here, even with 5x the workforce.","Constant reorganizations can be fatiguing and a lot of them were terribly ineffective, but is to be expected with a company that challenges convention constantly. It has also been frustrating how often you will change managers, makes it very important to promote yourself up your management tree."

Learn how to balance a high volume workload 
Overtime pay","During my time here, I've witnessed countless examples of discrimination and inappropriate comments from management, specifically my manager. This behavior is accepted. Salesforce is not a company that welcomes open, honest dialogue and feedback. If you disagree with management in any way, expect retaliation.

There are people in management positions who have no business being there. When you have questionable leadership, it causes many issues and problems that go unnoticed. In my case, I was subjected to report to someone who lacks the basic qualities a good manager must have: empathy, understanding, active listening, patience, strong communication, transparency, and loyalty to your team. Don't expect any of those qualities in many of the managers at Salesforce. The managers here continue to ""kick down and kiss up"" to get to where they are today. My manager lacked maturity, basic professionalism, and self-awareness . He has said some derogatory things about women, made incredibly inappropriate comments on team calls, and speaks to some of the females on his team in such a brash, disrespectful manner. It did not help that the person he reported to, the next manager in the line of management, was inherently cold and disconnected. 

I have never seen such self-serving managers in my professional career. The recruiting managers and leaders will never have your back. Example: If a candidate feels as though he/she should have gotten a job they interviewed for and chooses to retaliate against the recruiter ( example: write a bad Glassdoor review and name you), recruiting leadership will reach to place blame on the recruiter. Bad Glassdoor review = bad for the brand and the ""brand"" is #1 priority at Salesforce. EVERYTHING that is done at this company is done as an effort to strengthen their brand. It's all for show. All they care about is being perceived as ""a company that cares"" with an ""Ohana"" culture, when in reality, it is all about optics and concealing an incredibly abusive, toxic culture. 

Be prepared to also have a manager that takes credit for your success. You did well because they ""set you up for it"" and ""coached you."" (During my entire time there, I have never learned anything valuable from my first line manager - with the exception of what kind of manager I will not be one day)

Recruiting here is a factory. It's all about pumping out hires quarter after quarter and hitting an arbitrary hiring number at any expense, even if you have to bend the rules a bit. Example: having people have start dates when they're still employed at their current employer, pressuring sales candidates to start immediately without giving a notice period to their current employers and using manipulative tactics like saying ""If they really want this job, they will make it happen""...etc.

Salesforce hires most - if not all - recruiters on contract first. They reassure you that the contract thing is just a Salesforce formality and should you be a perform well, you will be converted in a year or less. I saw first-hand a couple of very high-performing recruiters get let go simply because they refused to play the ridiculous political game that is expected of you. 

Recruiting here is a rat race and lacks any nuance or creativity. As a recruiter, you do not have a voice or opinion. You are a sheep in the herd following the leaders. The ""leaders"" only care about branding, how the company is perceived, and how they themselves look to their leaders. They care very little about the actual recruiters doing the work. Recruiters are at the very bottom of the totem pole. If you hint at any disscontempt with your role, team, manager, company - you will be shunned. 

I can't speak for all of the recruiting teams and the entire company, but this is my honest feedback about Sales Recruiting at Salesforce. I wanted to provide honest feedback to future candidates who are considering leaving full-time roles for this often unpleasant role. If you choose to, use this as a resume booster if you're trying to break into the tech industry and then get out. Understand that the behavior you will witness there and the treatment you will likely receive is not okay. This is not how respectable companies operate. There are so many better opportunities at other SaaS companies where you will be treated with dignity and respect."

5048,Salesforce,#Dreamjob Not Always,2020-06-11,3.0,Program Analyst,"Quality work/life balance - This is baked into the benefits and culture. Although, you need a manager that actually supports this for you. If you have that it is great but, when you don't it can feel defeating. Personally, I have experienced the good and the bad with this. 

Training - Trailhead is a wonderful tool that provides a great introduction to many products/services. It's self-guided and you can pursue what interests you at your own pace. 

Time off to volunteer - Again a great benefit but, your manager has to be supportive of your endeavors. Employees are encouraged to give back using the 1/1/1 model. On one hand you are praised if you meet or exceed the number of hours you give back. If you don't have a manager or a team that does a lot of volunteer work, you might be criticized or singled out for ""wasting time."" 

Free Snacks - This is nice when you need a 3:00 snack or can't get out for lunch. 

Access to great perks - Wellness activities, a gym, workout classes, a benefit you can use to pay for massages. Unlimited vacation time, sometimes free tickets to events.","""Diversity"" - There's a good lip service but, the reality is that upper management is mostly white. Until there is massive change in how recruiting and cultivating talent happens in the tech industry white guys are going to begat more white guys. Chances are pretty good they don't have friends or connections who are POC. This also holds true from people who come from other tech companies. When rats jump the ship they tend to bring other rats with them. 

Not so subtle hints that you have to hold a ""right"" set of beliefs/values - you have to get onboard or made to feel like an outsider. If you question or don't hold a certain 

The idea that Salesforce can save the human race - Salesforce is an innovative tech company with products and services that help customers do business. Be that! While SF is the biggest and holds a huge marketshare, it has created this idea that it can somehow save the world. 


Surrounded by lots of people who don't actually work with you - there are some teams that have a larger representation in certain hubs but, if you have a team that is largely based in one hub it can get lonely being surrounded by people who are largely irrelevant to your daily work life. It can also infringe on W/L balance. 

Ohana seating - Gross. Everyone needs their own desk and space.


""Data Driven"" - Sometimes translates to manipulating for personal gain and benefit."

No RSU’s for sales ( unless #1 rep ) 
New territories every year so you can’t build lasting  relationships.  Customers and AE’s are burned out from starting over every year. 
Territories are extremely small so either you make great money or your squeezing blood from a rock.  Favoritism is real.
Micro management due to monthly quotas ( even though you are comped on a quarterly / annual number ) 
Management makes you “play the game “ and create fake pipeline to ensure “activity” on dashboards. 
Cap overtime ( currently told zero overtime ) even though recruiters include this in their OTE package pitch when you take the job.  20-30% less bi-weekly pay because of it.  
Too many products with Co- Primes that do nothing and get compensated on your deals.  All you need is the Co- prime engineer to help. 
Too many layers in sales and management so it’s slow to get ahead quick.  Average 3-5 years to get to next position.
Every end of month is a fire drill. You feel the burnout during the holidays when you can’t take time off just to close the end of month ( even if you are comped quarterly / annually )"

5098,Salesforce,Ohana Banana Skin,2020-05-24,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"Company values permeates every communication and you are strongly encouraged to ‘give back’ to society. It not only makes you feel that you are making a difference, it also makes you more credible in the eyes of the customer. 

You can have the joy of working with some great people with sharp minds that embodies the Ohana mindset.","This was once a company I genuinely felt pride in working for. Now the narrative has slipped into a sense of window dressing for the media and the market which shines through in several ways: 

Time tracking and process adherence seems to have taken over every corner of the company. A few years ago you felt that you were encourage to be innovative and to spend time on deep level analysis. Now you have to justify every hour of your day and not necessarily to to the benefit of the customer. Turning more Oracle than Google. 

Work load pressure is immense and there is an increasing number of people on long term sick leave due to stress. Managers are very often in a different location to you and there is very little awareness of the difficulty this can pose around communication, a sense of overwhelm and time available. 

HR does not have a presence in the smaller countries. This affects the health of both staff and relations as employees do not know who to turn to for a ‘sanity check’ conversation if a situations arise. HR processes are clearly there to support management and protect the company. There is a lot of talk about the feedback culture but the reality is that constructive criticism only works with few of the managers. 

Overall the sense is that the many hires from Microsoft, Oracle and similar has begun to take over the company mindset. It is much more ‘Me First’ than what is to the benefit of us all - and the customers."

If you’re new you’re 90% certain to get a terrible patch. Middle management is weak - usually people that have survived long enough. Senior management is a revolving door like football managers.

A few recent hires in very senior management in ANZ (incl. Pip, Ian) have been received positively.","Your experience here will completely depend on your direct manager and reporting line - and that's a very mixed bag of people. There is a lot of ego at play in some leaders and a total lack of EQ/empathy - be sure to interview your manager through the hiring process. There is nothing as demotivating as a sales manager who doesn't have basic leadership skills or self awareness.
They have over hired Account Executives as they believe that this will drive limitless growth in the region. Result being that everyone has territories that are too small to give them a reasonable chance at succeeding. Attainment is poor even from those who have been with the business a number of years and have been successful in their previous roles. This DOESN'T stop huge amounts of pressure being placed on each individual to hit pipe gen and sales targets (even during COVID).
Very few people have hit their quota or anywhere near it in the last few years. 
5-7 years ago this probably would have been a great place to work but it has changed considerably since then.
People don't trust the anonymous feedback surveys so the business doesn't understand the huge amount of grumbling that is happening behind the scenes. AEs are unhappy and many are looking elsewhere. But management also does its best to make you fearful about leaving in order to keep you in place to avoid more turnover.
They made most of their customer success group redundant last year.
Aside from COVID, there seems to be a major aversion to letting people work from home which to me highlights that there is a lack of trust in their people. Some management speak down to their team like they are children.
Very few female leaders in the sales team - not sure the organisation is honestly asking themselves why this is? People talk the talk about diversity because it's a SFDC value but that's not necessarily how they really think or execute. I don't even think most of them are capable of thinking outside their own experience."

- Hugely stressful job.

My 3-star review is a mix of Salesforce as a company (5 stars) & the BDR role (1 star).

Salesforce is a great company, with a great portfolio of solutions, & a great CEO. I believe had I a different role, I would be submitting a very different review.

However, from my experience, I simply cannot openly recommend the BDR role. It's seen as a necessary stepping stone role towards AE, is an awful role in itself, and I found myself dreading going into work every day & always came home stressed."

The past 3 years in the ECS team has been incredible, both on a personal and professional level. I have made friends for life because the culture within this team is without a doubt a family unit. On a professional level, I have had my ups and downs for sure (I'm in sales, it wouldn't be natural if I didn't), but under the fantastic leadership, I have been educated, trained & coached into the salesperson I am today.

In your signature you are not authorised to use your contract title as engineer but you are a ""Success Agent"". Weird and fake Hawaii culture of ""Ohana"", but when is down to work you are measured for how many cases you close per day, and if there are no cases is your problem and you have to go steal cases to other teams, where is the Ohana sorry?

This is pretty minor, but I think a major con is more systematic. As in there is so much information and resources but they’re not organized well most of the time (files and such).

There's a science to success here and there are benchmarks to live up to. Like any other corporate environment, there are a lot of talented, smart, type-A individuals. Put too many people like this together and you run the risk of creating a toxic, impatient, self-interested culture.

Sr. Management is pretty disconnected with what actually goes on the ground. 

Middle management is huge popularity contest.

What bugged me this most is the preaching of diversity and inclusion, yet they constantly hire and promote a very disproportionate WHITE staff in their Sales org. Particularly evident in their Central teams. Very very few minority leaders and individual contributors are actually hired, retained, groomed for success, and promoted. It's almost as if they hire diversity to check a box for their board and shareholders? At the end of the day, yes, the best producers are rewarded, but if you're going to promote such values, at least walk the walk, because the company can definitely afford it."

- Great breadth of technologies to learn and acquire new skill-sets.
- A good work life balance, flexibility in work schedule and occasional wfh.
- Regular conversations with manager and overall transparency across the board.
- Company provides an internal career fair of sorts to help you look out for a change within Salesforce itself.

After reviewing the contract; I noticed major discrepancies in the verbal vs. written offer in salary/PTO.

I called to ask for clarification and the offer was immediately pulled - less than 48 hours after it was extended -- as a direct consequence of ""asking questions"". 

Bizarre, appalling, and entirely illegal (pressuring a candidate to sign under duress, breach of contract, etc) and unethical practice. Be prepared with a good lawyer if you want to work here.

FYI- went through 4 rounds of interviews- initial screening with HR, then hiring manager, a panel interview team, then a case study."

5182,Salesforce,"""Ohana"" is the real deal",2020-04-27,5.0,Mid Market Account Executive,"- Salesforce really sticks true to this ""ohana"" mindset. They really do go above and beyond for their employees

- Annual audits are done so nobody is underpaid and Salesforce will fix any discrepancies. The amount of transparency they give back to employees is exceptional

- The technology is incredible. I knew Salesforce was a tech giant before I got here, but I didn't fully understand their reach and portfolio. You hardly ever say no to client

- The speed at which things get done is astonishing. The product gets better every day

- Customer service is great, they really know what they are talking about which is refreshing

- The offices are what you would expect from Salesforce. Fully stocked with snacks, coffee, and sometimes food will be catered (not to common). If your office has an 'ohana' floor it is a really neat place to grab a cup of coffee or hold a client meeting

- The brand recognition is great. Everyone knows who Salesforce is.","- There are so many different places were information lives. Salesforce does their best to organize this, but there are too many different places to search. 

- You will never learn everything and at first it can seem overwhelming. It is great to rely on your SE's, but with so many different products it can feel impossible to manage

- It goes without saying, but Salesforce only hires the best. You are expected to work extremely hard. I always feel like the dumbest person in the room which isn't a con per se. If you are looking for a ""comfy"" sales job this is not it for you.

- Getting a hold of people can be difficult. Calendars are always filled and not everyone is sitting in front of chat. You need to be patient waiting on resources"

The managers (and even the Executive Leadership) are really engaged and transparent. I appreciate the generous paid volunteer time off and encouragement to give back to our communities. That goes without saying that the benefits are also really competitive.

The company truly INVESTS in its employees. You have opportunities to learn and make yourself more competitive not just internally but in the greater marketplace. Everyone wants you to succeed. 

Marc Benioff is an incredible CEO and such an anomaly in Silicon Valley. I've never witnessed a CEO that seems so in touch with the world around them. He's so approachable and truly cares about the greater impact that Salesforce has on the communities it serves. His investment in the environment is one of the things that really drew me to Salesforce, specifically the Benioff Ocean Initiative. He's not just another talking head in Silicon Valley.","It's obvious, but Salesforce is a giant tech company. ""Building your personal brand"" here is tough because the teams are large and span multiple continents. This is not a place where you can just do your work and expect to be noticed. If you're not motivated to stand out, you probably never will."

- hard to get to know people from other roles and departments and learn more about what they do
- training/enablement can be disorganized at times, but some of that is to be expected due to the fast-evolving nature of the industry and software offerings"

Behind the smoke and mirrors, there are lots of product issues, career planning is non-exsistent, former Oracle leaders continue to foster a toxic culture.  Marc B is too busy with other priorities and his celebrity lifestyle, that he is disconnected with what is happening on the ground with the culture and customers.  This year's planning and re-organization were short-sighted and poorly executed.  Executives very focused on short term results and lacking in long term strategic focus.  It is a house of cards financially and constant fiscal engineering to prop up the numbers for the street.  Sales and marketing lack any fiscal restraint-- spend money like drunken sailors.

Very few hit quota and they will not discuss the possibly of it being a lack of opportunity in the territory. 

As for the culture...it's not just that there's an extreme lack of diversity but also how they treat their few minorities. I've met so many people across the company in San Francisco, Toronto, Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Boston, New York, and Dallas. Black employees everywhere have had a bad experience here. It's really changed me mentally. I'm a very sociable person but since I came to Salesforce I've been very isolated. Yes, I've spoken with our HR but even black employees that worked in HR have said they have the same gaslighting experience. It's sad because I can tell that the majority (not all but those I've reached out to for help) aren't interested in change but they continue to push their values on ""equality"". It's extremely triggering."

I wanted to explicitly share this with those of you who are looking forward to be part of Salesforce Ohana in current scenario , you will have excellent experience. 

Quick story :
I joined for onsite role and I was entitled to get a company phone which was delivered to Salesforce office , before I could pick it up company declared a hard shutdown.

5240,Salesforce,Bullying amongst female employees a HUGE problem,2020-04-02,2.0,Director,"Competitive salaries
Ability to progress within company
Volunteering opportunities","I had a wonderful experience working with Salesforce for the first 3 years of my employment there. 
However, for the 18 months that followed, my life was made hell. I am so disappointed to say that this was a result of constant bullying from female employees.
I had been cursed at and shouted at by a senior female leader repeatedly and in front of other employees, and when reported this to my director was told that there was nothing he could do as she was a VP.  This went on for a year.

There was extreme and constant bullying, negativity and back-stabbing from females in the US Marketing department, so much so that when a colleague went to interview for that department, the Head of Marketing told her they were having lots of problems on the team with bullying and back-stabbing etc, and was it something she would be able to deal with (the answer to which was obviously no).

This type of bullying just became the norm, and was totally accepted.
My own first line manager, who was also female, was incapable of giving any type of constructive or positive feedback, particularly to female members of the team, would openly speak negatively about senior leaders in a team meeting setting and was regularly described as being extremely de-motivating by all team members. Again when reported to more senior leadership nothing at all was done about this.

I would regularly end my day in tears, spending more time trying to ward off this bullying than being able to focus on my actual work. All of this was documented to my director, and to Employee Services however nothing was done about it. My director would speak with me maybe once every 3-4 months, so I was subjected to bullying by my manager and made to cope with this by myself.

My mental health, sleep, appetite and general well-being suffered dramatically and when I mentioned this to my director he told me that I should just go to Employee Services, he also asked if maybe I was having personal issues.

Again, my first few years with Salesforce were great, I had amazing team members, male and (amazing) female leaders in Ireland and Canada. However working with management and marketing dept in the US was an entirely different experience and in the end proved to be unbearable.  I was stuck in a horrible situation for far too long, with no support or outlet, totally isolated and unable to seek guidance from management.

I do hope something is done about the widespread and consistent bullying that is carried out by female employees in the US offices, particularly with regard to the infamously volatile and toxic Marketing Department."
5241,Salesforce,Most inclusive workplace,2020-04-02,4.0,Senior Solutions Architect,Inclusive work culture. Great synergy with manager.  Great career growth opportunities.,Salesforce platform experts are required to travel frequently.
5242,Salesforce,"Mostly positive experience, even after my role was eliminated",2020-04-02,4.0,Technical Producer,"There are a lot of perks of working at Salesforce, at least for my role. I had the option of working from home and many people in my role did so as well. The office has open (""Ohana"") seating to accommodate that. This suited my personality well but if you prefer face-to-face meetings with your team members, this might be a negative for you. Throughout my time at Salesforce I had coworkers and managers that lived in different states than me. Which is fine nowadays considering all the virtual meeting options. There are free snacks and drinks in the break room. If you become a parent while at Salesforce, you have the option of taking up to 6 months paternity leave at 80% pay, which is outstanding at least by US standards. I never ended up taking the full 6 months for either of the kids I had while employed at Salesforce, I guess out of a dumb sense of duty to my coworkers and Salesforce. Don't do what I did. Take the full 6 months and don't regret it. I enjoyed all the people that I worked with and I had the opportunity to work with a lot of big name accounts. Overall I thought it was a positive experience. My role was eliminated which is why I had to leave Salesforce. I was not happy about it but they were very generous. After my role was eliminated and my role responsibilities were taken away, they continued to pay me for two months while I looked for internal and external opportunities. I was able to find another opportunity outside of Salesforce prior to the end of the 2nd month. Had I not found another role, however, they would have given me a generous severance package in addition to what I had already been paid. I would imagine that is a lot more than most other companies would do.","My role (and other roles in my part of the organization) became very specialized over time, which I assume to was to help with efficiency in client work. But it also meant that I was doing a lot of the same tasks over and over again. I found there was little opportunity to branch out to take on responsibilities of other roles or to learn another role. I knew several people who left Salesforce because they became frustrated at their lack of advancement. People in my role also had a billable utilization goal of 36 hours a week. If you did not have that much time billable, it was seen as an issue. But you are not always in charge of how much work you had or what work was available. Which is true of many businesses, I know. Also, if you wanted to take time off, you needed to find a backup (or multiple backups) to take on your account work while you are out. Which can be difficult if everyone is trying to work 36 billable hours a week. And you had to train them if they had never worked on your account before. So taking time off was a chore, at least for my role. I ended up taking only maybe 2 weeks off during a year. I regularly hit my cap of 300 PTO hours and stopped accumulating PTO. And the billable utilization goal was pushed so much that they started tying it to the quarterly bonuses. In the end, it didn't end up meaning much because my role was eliminated even though at the time I was regularly billing 36+ hours a week.  Ultimately, I would preach to not drink the Kool Aid. They preach that everyone that works there is part of the ""Ohana"" and is family but don't buy it. This is probably not new to a lot of you, but it's just marketing. They are a business first. They don't really care about you. You have to look out for yourself first and foremost. If you start buying into it even just a little bit, that's when you don't take as much time off as you should or don't take your full 6 months of paternity leave out of some sense of obligation to the ""Ohana."" Take advantage of everything they give you down to the last PTO hour because they will happily discard you without hesitation when they don't see value in you as an ""Ohana"" member any longer. If you feel stagnant in your role, use your free work time to help yourself or get out of there because they will not help you take another role."

It is a great company to work for. My co-workers were wonderful people, super helpful, and genuinely wanted each other to succeed.  There is a culture of feedback. I always felt like I was in a safe space with my manager and could speak candidly.","It seemed like the good old days of slingin software at Salesforce is suspended for the time being. The market is saturated with the customers left over that DO NOT want to move away from their homegrown or preferred systems. Or they do, but can't get there personally to change their whole company's way of doing things; OR the company's employees stage a revolt and flat out refuse to use the software the owners are about to buy. If you don't mind that internal struggle of, why in god's name aren't these people getting it, then you will do fine.

I was in the Quarterback position and regret that decision. DEFINITELY, go in as a Specialist IF you are hired as an outsider. (Meaning you have had a successful run at other sales jobs and didn't 'grow up' at SFDC as a BDR) Reason being, you will be able to focus on your one solution to learn the ins and outs of it. Granted Specialists will have some of the same responsibilities as Quarterbacks.

Working here IS A LOT. That's the only way to describe it. As a Quarterback, you are: managing the deal, which consultant to introduce the customer to or which consultant they already have, internal SFDC Specialists and team for your manager/BDR/Solution Engineer/Service Specialist/Marketing/Pardot/ECommerce/and literally every possible solution they have or will acquire down the road. You will need to memorize enough of each to know when to pull in those Specialists and be able to sell the idea of exploring this other solution to the customer.

All awhile you as the new hire that didn't 'grow up' in SFDC have to learn all the actual products and be a technical expert for the customer.  Your current customers will ask you technical questions and THERE IS NO ONE TO SEND THEM TO. Now, I don't mean this literally but there isn't much support for the customers unless they pay for it. They will have to wait for standard tech support to get back to them in 48 hours. And in that time, YOU are the person they are asking to solve it for them but you have no idea because you are not the technical expert and either give answers you humanly can or put them off until support gets back to them. This happens a lot and is not a one off situation.

Oh and then you have to go back to that customer the following week and ask them to enter into an evaluation for xyz tool that will solve xyz need that they most likely don't have or have been asked many times before by other reps. 

Every month, you have to visit your customers in territory, whether they want you to or not. There is definitely evidence that meeting your customers in-person and getting that face time puts you in a better position to really make a difference in their business. But, it matters what type of territory you have. Long-term customers and 1-3 year old customers are not the best. Either they know what SFDC can do for them and are tapped out on what they need/want. Or the newbies had horrific and borderline criminal implementations that they can't justify any more expense on a system that wasn't implemented correctly or not even in use yet. The push for monthly visits makes sense, when it makes sense....

Finally, your previous experience will make you. Have you worked before in a ""team selling"" environment? Have you sourced consultants? Team Selling here is on steroids and can involve eight to nine people internally. Consultants are your Partners for winning deals and sometimes they are the reason you lose or delay deals. If you get a deal delayed, then you will be blamed for not managing your Partners. Similar experience will bolster you but if you have done well other places that lack the consultant piece or steroid team selling activity, then that is just another thing you will have to learn on top of everything else.

It was a great experience and this is definitely not to dissuade anyone. More so for those hired in directly into a sales role. This is what you need to know before starting. 

Good luck :)"

I fell for the hype, the branding, the “perks”, the “culture”, the philanthropy. Now, I can speak from experience that the culture is fake. Benioff might mean well and the company might provide perks so that from those on the outside looking in, this is a great place to work. I just know that during the months I’ve been here, I haven’t had any time to see the Salesforce park or have coffee in the Ohana floor. I’m on a small team and other than my manager, the others have not said 3 words to me, unless I’m talking to them in a group setting. No “how was your day?” Or “Do you want me to show you around?” How’s that for culture? I tried to walk to a meeting with a team member and she completely ignored me. I’ve never felt so lonely at a job. The Ohana seating makes it impossible to get to know anyone. 

I am so busy from the moment I get in but accomplish nothing. We have so many meetings... meetings 85% of my days to talk about nothing that can’t get accomplished through emails. Or the meeting is about the same things we just met about 2 hours ago. The culture is not about being productive or getting things done. It’s about looking/feeling like important topics are being discussed, sitting in conference rooms, and over complicating the strategy. We just spin and spin and then we go home, and do it again the next day. Every single thing I’ve worked on since I started have been scratched or changed because the process or overall strategy has changed. How does anyone work around here or get anything done in this type of setting and without concrete decisions being made?

The on-boarding is very chaotic and management isn’t aligned with the actual on-boarding process. They don’t factor in how long the mandatory trailhead courses take or take the time to onboard you. Becoming Salesforce and Bootcamps are just thrown into the schedule and are disruptive to the day-to-day workflow. (I’ve had to reschedule because there are other meetings that conflict).

5306,Salesforce,"Not what it used to be, would not recommend",2020-03-10,2.0,Ambassador,"Great snacks and cool offices, decent benefits, casual office attire","This used to be my dream job, I loved telling everyone I worked here and how awesome it was. Then as time went on, I realized it was all fake. The marketing team makes you believe that everything is perfect even when it's not. There is no way to move up even though people say you can. You will be promised one thing then later told the opposite. To move to a different role internally you have to move to a position of the same level or below, you cannot go up (called diagonally) in another department. Even if you make it happen, they keep you at the same pay and level for 6+ months so you will do more work for the same pay. There is NO INCENTIVE TO STAY!! I have known so many people who leave for this reason, then come back a year or so later 3-6 grades higher with better pay and benefits. Recruiters love that because they say it shows how great the company is that people come back, they could have saved themselves time and money by just promoting or transferring the person to the place they wanted to be at. My manager left after a few years and then they hired someone externally who had NO MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE EVER!!! He was the worst manager I have ever had by far, he was rude, disrespectful, sexist, inappropriate, and completely useless. I was appalled at the way he treated his employees and when I brought it up to HR they basically said I couldn't prove it. Then other employees from a completely different department witnessed him scream at people and they went to HR and still the case was closed because ""lack of evidence"". Several employees were asked to work overtime without pay  which is illegal for hourly employees. When I told my bosses boss that I was leaving, they offered me a promotion, but I would have had to move cross-country, and I was told there was no budget for moving costs, so I would pay them all on my own. As for salary, since it was a ""cheaper cost of living"" that there would be no increase. I laughed at this insulting offer to work more, have more responsibility and no increase in money while moving cross country. I declined the offer and they were somehow shocked. I left and never looked back, I am so much happier now that I left."

5312,Salesforce,Unfocused and lacks integrity.  Some nice people,2020-03-09,2.0,Technical Instructor,"Most people in Salesforce are genuinely nice people.
Very nice benefits package
Generous pay","It does not pay to have integrity at this company. You'll do well if you can smile and say ""everything is fine"" while the building you're in is actively burning to the ground.
I was sent on multiple interviews for a position within the company in a department that I wanted to transfer to before being told they would not actually hire me and were just sending me on the interviews for reasons completely unknown to me.  To be clear, there was a hiring freeze already in place and they STILL wanted me to interview more with no actual plan to hire/transfer me.
The ""Family First"" policy is garbage.  They said this motto about a million times when I worked there. When I needed it so I could care for my family member (My fiancee needed major back surgery),  I was told this would not be a problem, was later told this was a major problem and she wasn't family, and then, after we got married, no one checked to see what I said about us being married was true.  To be clear, Salesforce wanted to tell me who could be my family but then didn't care if it was actually true in the end.  I could have lied and had the wedding we actually wanted and had been planning, instead of rushing to get married at the courthouse so I could get the leave and she could get the surgery on schedule.  
There doesn't seem to be a strong decision-making process. I was sent on retreats I didn't need to go on to hang out with people I never saw or communicated with while I needed to be at home to handle important matters. I was told this trip was imperative and I couldn't miss it. When I got there, no one knew what the trip was for and it turned out to just be drinking and games and a pep rally or two.  A complete waste of valuable time."

The solution is good.","They promote equality but the reality is the environment is toxic. Filled with 'preference' and bias, if your boss like you then you can get the good set of accounts to work on, otherwise sorry you are on your own. To protect their image of best place to work, they 'create' lame reasons to make you leave on your own or terminate you, instead of being seen as firing / layoff people. Lots of politicking between management, the Ohana is a marketing gimmick, the reality is the management are mostly ex-oracle bringing along their old habits and culture and practicing them in here. Most of the great talent had left the company and the original good culture is dying. This will be the last place I recommend anyone to join."

5315,Salesforce,Think Again,2020-03-08,1.0,Account Executive,"The company provides a few good perks such as insurance benefits, unlimited vacation, etc.",The company is a marketing machine with slight of hand and bait and switch mentality.

Certainly this is one of the better paying companies in Toronto particularly in the non-sales world. Yes there are also snacks etc if you like that sort of thing and are drawn to it. It’s also nice that when you leave you can put Salesforce on the resume. Nobody can say that’s not a good thing.,"There’s a lack of trust in some leadership.   Coaching is at a minimum. Having had roughly 9 managers in my tenure, I’ve had only two who have provided feedback to help me grow. That’s not a very good ratio. My current one’s response when asked after a customer meeting with an executive was “I’ll let you know if you’re doing something wrong”. That’s not in any way helpful. It’s impossible that I’ve done everything right in one of those meetings and I expect feedback to help me grow. I’m not asking for my hand to be held. I’m asking for guidance. Something you expect from your leader. The office can be quite clique-y and you have to fight your way in. Not quite the Ohana people hear about from the CEO."

5323,Salesforce,Do your due diligence and put some thought into Salesforce before joining,2020-03-04,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"1. The Salesforce Platform is actually awesome and can be integrated into just about any business in some capacity. 
2. Pretty good benefits although they are pretty standard for a tech company.
3. Office snacks and drinks are good, although many tech companies offer their employees catered lunch which Salesforce doesn't.
4.  There are a lot of intelligent sales people that you can learn a lot from.
5. You get more leniency on working from home the more senior the sales role you are in.","-The Salesforce recipe is to grow and split territories and squeeze every rep as much as they can. This is how they report double-digit growth every year to their investors.
-You are compensated the same irrespective of the products you sell, however, management only cares about the core products you sell (Sales/Service Cloud). To the outside world this may not make sense, however, you are looked down upon and will get performance managed if you are not selling enough of these core products. I'm not a lawyer but this doesn't sound legal under Canadian labour law.
-“Teacher’s Pet” Culture - Majority of reps (80%) don’t hit their quota but you can still get promoted and have your career accelerated if you play the “game” and suck up to management. 
-Colleagues who have been here for a while say it used to be an exciting, fun company and now it’s far more corporate and there are a lot of unhappy people in the office."

But in the end, I decide to post this because I feel the need to share what we went through.

Last month, Salesforce laid off a good number of customer success group members, including myself. I don't know the exact % or number, but it is not a small percentage. People will likely think I am negative toward the company because I got layoff. And you are right, who wouldn't be. 

Over the years, I truly believe in Salesforce and put lots of heart and soul into the company. This sudden layout is not fun and now gave me lots of uncertainty about my career and how do I support my family going forward. Salesforce talked a lot about Trust and Ohana, but this move killed both ideas for me. Where is the Trust when Salesforce let us go when the company is doing well and continue to hire many other roles. Where is the Ohana when Salesforce management cares purely about the books than the well being of the employee. Salesforce will say they are assisting those of us impacted to find another role internally. But the reality is there is little help, we are on our own to find a new position. There are some great people internally trying to help, but they are doing it on their own and not because Salesforce management asked them to. Many other hiring managers wouldn't even give us the chance or response to us. I do not blame other Salesforce Ohana not sensitive to what happened to us, it didn't happen to them, so they do not feel our pain.
The bottom line is Salesforce put the books over employees which is the opposite of everything Salesforce stand for and claim to be.."

Ohana, VTO, Customer Success... They are just words. In my team, we were obliged to work on bank holidays and not allowed to take the day back off when it  was BH in the country we covered.  There is no flexibility in WFH. But what's really the worst is the management. In Salesforce there are no leaders, just poor managers. It all works around internal politics and friendships with people crossing borders continuously. Also, those ""managers"" text you after working hours and have no respect of your personal life. There is no interest in who you are as a person or your background, just how much you're closing. It's the least human company in tech I have ever witnessed and keeps losing talent year over year. I had a burnout and had my manager talk poorly and joking about me with team members and peers. Just one last thing, AEs are pushed to always complain about business partners (Solution Engineers, Sales Dev and Customer Success) when they really are the only ones to make the job qualitative and worth it."

Promotions are political and unfair. Leadership has been telling their people that they are working on a fair and unbiased promotion process for years, but there is no proof that any work has been done.  

Management can often make employees feel like they are replaceable. I hate to break it to them, but smart/talented recruiters do not find Salesforce Recruiting a compelling enough organization to work for.  If leadership wants to retain people, they need to have productive conversations around succession planning and salary increases.  Salesforce Recruiters and Sourcers severely underpaid. 

Recruiting leadership preaches about how Salesforce is ahead of the game with URM (under-represented minorities) recruiting. In reality, it is nothing but a numbers game for them.  The more hires they make, the better they look in front of Marc Benioff. They've been so fixated on increasing the numbers, that they've completely forgotten the meaning/importance of having a diverse workplace.   How about we change the narrative from ""we need to hit our URM numbers every quarter,"" to ""lets think about the importance of cognitive diversity and thought."""
5418,Salesforce,Best company I've  ever worked for!,2020-01-29,5.0,AMTS Software Engineer,"You always have the chance to work on interesting work.

Team members, management, and overall company culture are very supportive. Management will set you up to succeed by providing all the resources, trainings, and other tools needed to make it to ""get to the next level"" and advance your career. I personally have no immediate plans to switch teams because I currently love the work that I am doing right now.

I have seen people easily move across different teams and organizations (lateral and vertical) within Salesforce without issue. This is important to those that want to eventually work on different projects/teams/technologies within the company.

The company promotes a lot of volunteering for employees and is consistently active within the community. It's recommended and encouraged for employees to volunteer and give back and they set a side a large amount of VTO (Volunteer Time Off) for you to do so. I absolutely love this because volunteering makes such a big impact to those in need.

You are treated with dignity and respect working here. I have never come across any issues while working here but there is always an open channel to communicate with management (direct management or other management) if you do encounter anything.

Senior management is very honest and transparent during meetings/emails/town halls, ect. with what is going on within our organization and company as a whole.


Besides all of the stuff mentioned above, there are:

- Excellent Work/Life Balance (I've never worked a weekend, I get off on time each day, and have never felt any stress while working here) . All of our work as a team is consistently completed by the deadlines too!

- Unlimited opportunities to learn and grow your career with tools/resources readily available. (The company promotes enablement and provides you with a bountiful of resources to get to where you want to go in your career) It's just up to YOU to activity take initiative and take advantage of them!

- You have the ability to take Professional Led Salesforce Certification classes for free

- Tuition Reimbursement
- Commuter benefits
- ESPP
- Amazing health insurance packages
- Awesome views from the top of the Salesforce Tower
- Ability to work from home every now and then (varies from team to team and role)
- Baristas available in the main buildings to provide free handcrafted coffee and tea
- Professional Chef's making food at the top of the Salesforce Tower and in Salesforce East
- Arcade games, pool tables, ping pong tables, foosball, 
- Various ERG Groups to join (they do a lot of events that are fun and good for the community)
- Social groups to join (Board games, video games, camera clubs, exercise/workout classes)
- Lots of comfy sofas/lounge chairs
-  Access to the Salesforce Park
- Awesome holiday parties!!!
- HUGE Dreamforce event every year (Really fun and informative)

-The sales cycle is interest, many things to learn every day.
-I want to believe that your experience and opinion about the company depends on the team you’ll be working in.
-Health insurance and 5k to spend on a course per year.
-Plenty of opportunities to grow.","-You basically can’t trust people in your own team cause they will find the way to steal your accounts and opportunities.
-People are selfish and self-focused, they won’t help you unless they will get something in return.
-If you are an Account Executive and you want to spend time with an SDR, you will be judged cause they hate each other (worse than a kindergarten).
-No balance at all between work life and private life: you are asked to work at weekends, work at night after entire days in the office, work during bank holidays (well, bank holidays are not allowed). Allowed to take days off only in August and February. In some teams like mine you can’t even work from home.
-You have to travel abroad 3/4 times per month and they want you to take flights at dawn or at night cause “you can’t lose working hours”.
-One of the best values is volunteering - guess what? Underestimated and not taken for real in my team.
-Managers only care about numbers, you are not a person at all.
-People underestimate people working in other companies cause they feel they are the best but they are so poor and sad inside.
-If people leave cause they feel bad, the other “teammates” and managers will make fun of them.
-Micromanagement: your manager will expect to be cc’d in every single email you send to your customers."

Management run reports to see where they can help you, not give-out to you. And flexible working is totally supported. You are allowed do what works for you and micro-management does not exist here.

5481,Salesforce,Quality company,2020-01-07,5.0,Software Architect,"Onboarding is 2 weeks for us techies - very comprehensive and required, no manager can steal you from it. Gives confidence and great info to get your hands dirty quickly. Company is NOT a rigid, formal, old school shop, neither is a start-upy - it seems to be a well run, human-oriented enterprise with focus on educating the workers and giving them the right tools. Management is very attentive to feedbacks and surveys, they discuss any negative found in process and attempt to address it. Folks are helpful, mostly transparent though there is a bit of that cast-system mentality in some folks. Management is not much tolerant to silos, they try hard to break those.","Intense at times. Silo breaking must go on. Process of getting approvals to push features is not basic. Context switching between projects, some shutdowns / restarts based on resources is pretty regular, at least in my org. SF Downtown location is challenging for some due to long commute, though shuttles are offered along 101 and other routes."
5482,Salesforce,Culture of Learning and Problem Solving!,2020-01-07,5.0,Associate Customer Success Manager,"I got hired a few months back as part of Salesforce's Success grad program. Coming straight out of college where I got to study and work on interesting challenges in 7 different countries, I was looking for a culture that promotes continuous learning and problem-solving. Salesforce proved to be beyond my expectations. 

Being one of the most innovative companies in the world, there are so many moving parts that make this company great. There is always interesting stuff to fill your plate with. What amazes me is that even though the company has grown to a headcount of 40k+, the opportunities and encouragement for cross-team collaborations match that of a startup.","If someone is hesitant to change and prefers a predictable 9-5 schedule, Salesforce may not be the best fit."
5483,Salesforce,Never been prouder to work for any other org,2020-01-07,5.0,MC AE,"great brand recognition as it pertains to sales, independent autonomous schedule, great benefits, encouraged VTO, infinite opportunities for growth, promotion, relocation, etc. , opportunity to work with incredibly talented people.","Very quick moving environment  (acquisitions, team or product changes, realignments) .  Not all teams operate at same level of expertise so managing co-prime and core relationships can be as difficult or more difficult as managing customer relationships.

But regardless of the team and despite all the sweet talk about the ohana culture, your number one goal should be to watch your back at Salesforce!

5499,Salesforce,Fantastic place to work!,2020-01-03,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"The three years I've worked for Salesforce within the ECS team have been the most impactful and enjoyable of my career. 
I work in a diverse team both culturally and cognitively, with over 13 different nationalities represented. There is a true feeling of family within the team, who are motivated, coachable and a true representation of the Salesforce Ohana values. I honestly look forward to coming to work everyday, to be part of the fantastic office atmosphere and contributing to something special. 
The leadership team have a brilliant ability to shape an effective go to market strategy and disseminate to the sales team, enabling consistent and immaculate execution. 
It's an exciting, fast moving business to work in with endless opportunities to develop and progress. The coaching is first class and whilst I develop professionally I'm also given the opportunity to give back to the community by volunteering my time to meaningful causes. 
It would be remiss of me to not mention here Zahid Jiwa, who leads the UK ECS team and has built something very special. He encapsulates the Salesforce core values and his team is a true representation of this. The impact he has had on my career has been profound.","It's a fast moving company so be prepared for change, which also brings lots of new opportunities"

5502,Salesforce,Just another cog in the tech machine. You don't matter.,2020-01-02,1.0,Executive Assistant,"Benefits, meeting other unhappy colleagues who helped me during my terrible experience at Salesforce","Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. 

Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. 

Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. 

I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade."

Onboarding experience is thorough and well supported
Products are truly market leading and the company aggressively pursues market leadership where products are not leaders (either through investment or acquisition)","High pressure culture of performance. Everything is measured and compared frequently. 
Corporate values are not well translated down to an individual team/manager level and can be inconsistent locally with company values.
Manager capability varies significantly and your manager has a big impact on your success"

5508,Salesforce,Hypocritical leadership turning a blind eye to incompetence,2019-12-30,1.0,Data Intelligence,"On one hand, there are some great colleagues and amazing leaders that work there. The pay is pretty decent for the market, and generally speaking in a lot of teams you can expect good work-life balance.","On the other end, there are some incredibly toxic and incompetent leaders who seem to have the top leadership in their pocket, and so they make everyone else miserable. My department suffered a lot because of such a leader. It didn’t just impact people, but also the business bottom line. And the company is losing money because of that leader.
I have seen other reviews, where some HR person responds empathetically and encourages people to come forward to them “so that your concerns can be addressed”. Please don’t do that. I have gone to that very person before I left the company, with mountains of documentation regarding the dysfunction, and the absolute disregard for ethical concerns. They flat out refused to take action, even after acknowledging that very serious mistakes were happening. They went on record to say that since nothing could be proven in a court of law, they “don’t need” to do a thing - so much for “Ohana”. Not just that, they didn’t keep my complaint anonymous, and the very people who I was complaining against, now had all power to openly punish me.
The top leadership is very much aware of this department and it’s troubles. They do nothing. At the same time they keep talking about how other FAANG companies are such awful places to work, while ignoring their own backyard. If I had any time to waste, I would make my experience public and let public opinion decide if Salesforce walks the walk.
I lucked out that I saw the true side of this company and how they dealt with issues. I was considered a great performer, and had no trouble finding another job with a higher scope of responsibility - so it’s completely not my loss to have had to leave Salesforce."

5512,Salesforce,Lots of Perks - Saturated territories and unattainable goals for Sales,2019-12-27,3.0,Account Executive,"Tons of perks, but no time to enjoy if in sales!
-6 month maternity leave
-great PTO/VTO opportunities
-great travel accomodations","-Bro culture
-uneven territory distribution
-Constant shuffling of divisions
-unattainable goals (most sales teams only had 1-2 people who hit goal out of 12)
-Constant pressure/fear of being fired
-Managers tend to manage up to their managers, do not focus on team members success"
5513,Salesforce,Even better than I imagined,2019-12-27,5.0,Senior Manager,"Awesome people
A company that really does care (!!)
7 paid days per year to volunteer
Beautiful offices & great technology

5519,Salesforce,Account executive,2019-12-23,5.0,Account Executive,best company and technology and people,Dublin :) its not easy to live there
5520,Salesforce,Great company,2019-12-23,5.0,Account Executive,Great company with a high moral compass.,No sick days and PTO is not increased to account for them.
5521,Salesforce,Nope,2019-12-22,1.0,BDA,"Competitive environment, good snacks and drinks",The Chicago office is extremely competitive. They make you feel as if you’re going to be hired and they kick you out the door. Unfortunate. The employees are great but the management is awful. This program really needs to redo their management.
5522,Salesforce,BDA SDR BDR experience,2019-12-20,4.0,Business Development Representative,"Solid company, good for your resume
If you work in a customer facing role (pre sales sales post sales) you will really get solid work experience which will help you in all your future roles forever
Market leader
Great product to sell
Benefit on par with other tech companies in Dublin
Management gets a lot of training
Access to a lot of training/personal development course
Really a lot of opportunities for networking, people believe in it and act accordingly","The location is awful, it is depressing to work not in the city center - yes they’re moving to the docks but it’s still pretty far from downtown and won’t happen before 2021
No food - just some snacks, and pretty bad/unhealthy ones. These 2 points might seem trivial, but you will spend quite a lot of money on Luas and food, trust me, not to mention the time lost when commuting 
Career progression is there BUT it is extremely slow, which means it also takes a lot of years to move out of Dublin if you want to stay with the same company (4/5 years)
It takes a lot of networking to move between functions (BDR to SE or CS)
Harsh split of fixed and variable salary in AE roles (50-50)
Level of stress always depends on the manager you get 
There’s not much of a fun element at work, besides the people, who are for the most part lovely and motivated. But no fun company kick off abroad, no cool off sites abroad, no happy hours, no end of quarter drinks... just compare it to other big tech company like Linkedin and Google - it’s much more boring
The WFH policy for sales dev is non existent (1 day/month). Pretty ridiculous when this is an EMEA HQ and people are coming from all over. Allow people to go home and work from there to see their families, without having to take PTO all the time.
Politics - it is a corporation, so it is political. It’s very clear that sometimes people get a role over others just because they are better liked, not because of their skills. Always need to show your best face which can be exhausting"

5578,Salesforce,Boomerang back to Salesforce,2019-12-03,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,Best front end system(s) of engagement in the business. The platform earns you time to speak with all executive lines of business about strategic direction and where you can support their success. It's one of the biggest reasons that I've come back to the company. There's some great competition for enterprise sales with AWS and Google Cloud but I'd much rather speak to executive stakeholders rather than IT about Infrastructure. Lot's of meat on the bone for things to sell with recent acquisitions.,"It's up to you to build healthy boundaries around work life balance when you are working at the fastest growing enterprise company in the world. Occasionally, you can get boxed in with certain verticals (teams) not wanting you to venture outside of their linear career path. Emerging commercial business roles are subject to transactional sales and relationships but show me a company where that's not the case. Occasionally implementation partners are not adequately prepared to take on large deal implementations which can result in customer satisfaction issues.

- Cramped offices, poor selection of snacks"
5583,Salesforce,Not a good place to work. Unequal territories,2019-12-02,1.0,Account Executive,"Good benefits, Free snacks","I was with Salesforce for a year. When I started I was made a lot of promises regarding the territories being fair within the team. However, once I got my territory and saw how it was compared to other territories across the team, I realized that 80% of the territories in any given team are bad. Only 20% of the accounts/territories are good and in which the sales people make money. 

And Management knows this. So if you are an Account Executive aligned well with Management, you are set. However, if you are like the 80% of the account executives, your fate is NOT in your hands as you will get bad accounts. 

They know this. The management's objective at least in the Toronto office is to only have 20% of the people make their #. They dont want anyone  to be 200% of their #. They expect 80% of the reps to miss their #. 

The territories are extremely disparate. There's a lot of partiality in who gets what accounts. Be very careful when you join as an AE. For other roles like Marketing, Ops etc I've heard its a good place to work. 

However, for Sales its just like any other company. Dont fall for their lies when they tell you that the territories are fair. To give you a specific example, in the Toronto office there is one person who has 10 president's clubs. He makes a lot of money and his manager and his manager's manager are as expected totally aligned. He is a good rep. However, so are others on the team. However since he has always had the best territory the makes club every single year. Its ridiculous. 

If you've been in sales for a while, and comes across an environment where ONE person has made club 10 times and every one else has made club 1-2 times in the last 10 years, what would you conclude. 

The territories are uneven. The management is inept. For example this is the first company that I've come across where the Sales Manager's quota is not aligned with the team. For example in a team of 10 sales reps which a quota of $1M each, the manager doesnt have a $10M quota. His/her quota is way less than that. So even if the team misses their #, the manager makes his/her #. I had never seen that in my sales career. 

So to get promoted to a manager's role, you need to be connected to the right people. 

Be very careful in joining this company. For Sales its not as advertised. For other roles it might be different."

Some people thrive in one environment or the other, but Salesforce seems to have a little of both.

Salesforce offers great resources and training to develop selling skills.

Great products which make the interactions with the clients very rewarding.

The team mates are nice and fun even tough there is little actual team spirit and everyone rather fends for themselves.","Micromanagement:
We have WEEKLY targets which fist of all requires Sales reps to justify themselves every week and exerts unnecessary pressure to close deals to unrealistic timelines which is damaging the client relationship. This also leads to non-stop pressure on a weekly basis which leaves no time to regenerate after a stressful month-end.
While we are free to structure our days as we wish there are countless data points collected in the CRM which is used as a tool by management to exert additional pressure.

Management style:
We are not treated like professionals but more like interns who are here to learn and need to proof we are worthy of doing the job we are hired for.  There is nothing more important than closing as many deals as possible as quickly as possible. Based on this all decisions are made disregarding the client relationship, the professional opinion of the sales rep or the health and the wellbeing of the rep. 

Unrealistic goals:
Quotas are set unrealistically and only a handful of people are going to make their targets this year. On a bad month you go home with 2000 Euro which does not leave you much to live with an average room rent of 1200 Euro. Two of the teammates even live in camper vans."

5607,Salesforce,Incredible company & products - Increasingly farcical sales roles,2019-11-20,4.0,Account Executive,"Being the market leader across a wide range of solutions is an enviable position to be in. Customers are typically willing to discuss and engage with you based on our reputation alone. 
There are some highly intelligent and capable people right throughout the organization. This means that projects and evaluations can become very creative and the standard of work is typically incredibly high. It is by the far best place I have worked in terms of learning from those around you. 
The benefits are second to none, including health insurance, gym membership, fertility/adoption allowance, generous maternity/paternity leave, a degree of informal flexi-time. 
The offices are decent, with fresh fruit and snacks available. 
There are a wide variety of career options available, both internally and also externally due to the expanse of the Salesforce ecosystem.

Altruistic culture runs right through Salesforce and is truly ""lived"" as opposed to being just talked about.","There is a real lack of cohesion to the sales organization. When you first join you are pretty left to fend for yourself and see to your own integration. 

The sales targets are completely ridiculous and the compensation plan has been making it more difficult to make money every year. This year I am going to make approximately €25-40k (depending how my year finishes) less than the average of my last two years. The overall attainment figures for sales people are in the toilet. This will not be made clear during your interview and will not be openly discussed with management as to what a realistic quota should be. This ultimately has created a toxic environment where people feel undervalued due to their inability to hit an unrealistic target. In theory, everyone can make good money. In reality 90% of people will miss their target and the majority of commissions will be left in the hands of the few. 
The increasing product offering of Salesforce brings problems in terms of collaboration. It is not always easy to find the right person for the right meeting in good time. This can make it difficult for customers to do business with us, as the sales process can become protracted. 
While career options are varied, the criteria for promotion isn't ever clear. It is often a case of 10 people interviewing not knowing how many roles will be filled, not knowing when they will find out and unclear feedback as to why they did/didn't get the role. Naturally this has caused people to question the process."

Overall it's impossible not to say this is a great working experience, even if it ends up being a valuable chapter in a larger career.","The base salary is relatively poor although the ability to make commission can be massive. 

With that said, it comes down to the companies you're working with and there are plenty of very talented people at Salesforce doing poorly for this reason. The inverse applies as well - although the overall people standard is high there are some with mediocre talent and effort who stumble blindly into huge paydays.

I was in top 2% achievers, which results in salary of more than 250k.","Achieving your target depends heavily on the distribution of accounts/opportunities and therefore on luck and/or on the appreciation of your manager when (s)he distributes accounts and related opportunities. Salesforce managers refer to equality as an important principle, but some individuals seem more equal than others..

Most sales do not attain their targets in Belgium and base salary is low. There’s even people earning more on mileage expense than on base salary and commissions combined for several months.
Be careful when stories are told before you sign your contract about very high salaries in case of going above your target. Almost none of the sales achieve >100% of their target and you typically enter without getting any decent opportunities.
This obviously allows for direct pressure from the start.

Poor package of benefits overall (e.g. no company car despite fiscal advantages in Belgium and not even a sales allowance/'representatievergoeding'). Unless if you’re one of the lucky few who goes well above targets.

Very poor culture in Belgium in particular and poor coaching as well in my view.

Also, in my case, there were several issues with payments, with Salesforce claiming that they would start paying (still waiting for payments now that were due more than a month ago). They don’t seem to care about local laws and rules in a small country to them like Belgium."

Inspiring people and vision and a strong desire to try and do right by the customer. Also deliver amazing events globally.",Very sales focused and growth targets are very aggressive. Career opportunities are surprisingly limited and very talented people can get stuck in roles for years as the structure is so flat in marketing and the team is so lean that there’s often nowhere to go. Management is also very hit and miss. Some are great and others are incompetent. This inconsistency means that those under good managers do well and those under bad managers get stuck. The company needs to invest more in training people to be leaders and coaches rather than just putting them in charge  due to tenure. Workload can be extremely high and overwhelming so it takes a while to work out how to get by without burning out. Also tend to employ highly experienced people to do a lot of execution as headcount is so limited they need to hire people who can create a strategy and execute it. This leads to frustration among people who could be doing so much more but get stuck in the detail of delivery.
5647,Salesforce,"Best place to work, but",2019-11-01,3.0,Solutions Engineer,"Product is generally great, the company is very organised, good vibe in the office, everybody is very motivated, 7 working days a year for volunteering, frequent parties and celebrations. 
You are treated like a family member not just an employee, even if this means expectations from you (see Cons)","Career progression and salary increases are 100% related to the personal brand and not to quantifiable results, this leads people to abuse of the internal social networking platform and any other brown nosing opportunity for self promotion. This may be a plus if you have that attitude, otherwise you will find it frustrating. Due to this, management is represented by some excellent managers and others who are not but have been good in leveraging the above.
Salesforce as a family: you are expected to be enthusiastic, participate and promote all sort of social events they serve you. Opting out of something you are not interested in lowers your personal brand.
Work-life balance is hard: stressful days masked by great fun on social media, work in the weekend is not uncommon."

Even if you have been a seller for 30 years, one full year at Salesforce will elevate your game. You will leave here a far better seller than when you arrived. Their operational expertise, sales execution, deal inspection, etc., are better than anyone in the business (for now). 

I've worked with some of the smartest people I ever have in Enterprise software. Imagine the top 10% of the sellers at your current company.  Now imagine that the entire Salesforce sales organization consists entirely of that top 10%.  Yeah, that describes the intensity.","The executive leadership team at Salesforce exemplifies the values they espouse and  they truly believe that the world can be changed by business. Unfortunately, the values that are core to our belief system (doing what's right for the customer, trust, etc.) do not filter down to the actual sales process. There's a tendency to encourage customers to do things unnatural to their buying process, all in the interest of making the month. 

You will subjected to immense pressure here. The company, to their credit, has tried to emphasize wellness with meditation rooms in each office, etc. But much like volunteer time off, I know very few sales people that have time to enjoy those perks outside of offsites.

With only 50% of AEs exceeding plan, your success depends entirely on timing and territory. AEs who have not missed their number in years come to Salesforce only to fail because the alchemy involved in assigning quotas. There's a reason why so many AEs turn over after less than 2 years.

With our diverse product set, the list of what a CORE SE is supposed to know grows constantly with insufficient specialist support.  I'm a high performer in terms of ACV, but since our comp is more weighted towards team goals I'd rather have a life than have the extra few bucks.  I've been asking for help all year, but hiring hasn't kept up with attrition on the team so its getting worse rather than better.  I think management does care, but it takes so long to hire and onboard new SEs it takes 3-6 months to get any relief.  The promotion process is murky, leaving me wondering if its even worth it to do this.

I am able to network with upper management frequently and have access to clear expectations on my career path.,"I started contract and then moved full time after 6 months.  I am ok with this process and understand that this is how people are brought on into the recruiting org, however I do not feel there was full transparency through the onboarding process.  The info I was given first interviewed (as contract) regarding the full time process was not super clear.

In always being flexible, easy to discuss my concerns with and available to assist via text, email or voice, my questions were answered and clarification provided when requested. The expedient manner in which I was introduced to Salesforce and walked through the recruiting, interviewing and onboarding process stood out from other IT companies making all the welcoming difference.

Customer Supports are the most pitiful people I have ever seen given that they have to support the products that are not even documented whatsoever and the product managers are ditching them being unresponsive & supportive.

The company needs to grow in order to keep their investors pleased however almost all territories in all regions are already saturated so they are now being forced to riskier moves - riskier M&A like tableau and territory like China.

The three T's applies here... Territory, Timing and Talent. Salesforce deliberately assign miniature territories and switch them up annually. It forces reps to be hungry, desperate even when you only have a year to close the account. Heaven forbid one of the two accounts that you are assigned goes bankrupt/is acquired/has a spending freeze that year... you're going to sit on the sidelines for a year and hope that you get a decent account the following year in the 'Carve'. If that doesn't work out... you're gone. I've seen literally dozens of top performers getting turfed due to this circumstance. Sales is a rough game sometimes and it's brutal at Saleforce.

- Snacks in the kitchen","- Working from home is absolutely forbidden despite many of your colleagues living in different cities. 
- 4 sick days a year. If you take any more time from that, you'll then have to use your PTO hours. We get paid hourly, and they do not allow unpaid time off. 
- 8:30am to 5:00pm standard hours. Not sure why the extra half hour is needed. Don't even think of trying to leave at 4:57pm, even if you are crushing your targets. 
- Pay is below industry standard but most will argue, ""But you get to put Salesforce on your resume"". Most external hires take a lower salary than their previous job and oddly wear that as a badge of honour. That's how Salesforce executives want you to feel. The CEO is a billionaire, he didn't get there by paying his employees fairly. 
- Good luck trying to change departments if you ever feel like making a lateral move within the company. Salesforce has a policy stating you must stay in the same role for a minimum of 1.5 years before being allowed to move laterally into a different segment of the business.

If you are from an acquired company and not into salesforce tech stack, then be very careful , you will be fired immediately after your knowledge transfer and if they feel that you are no more required to carry on with the work, even though you had spent years together in the acquired company to build the product.

- Attracts good talent and you get to work with cool people","- Poor work-life balance, it’s all about work. Late night messages and sometimes those bringing call for action for next morning.. And this is getting worse as all management layers feel the need to “contribute”..

- Customer success has changed to customer second; this is confirmed as common view in recent employee survey. It’s all about running the revenue up, on cost of some customers being outright screwed over under time pressure from us. It’s terrible to see this change, having been following this great company for many years.

- You get promoted by making your numbers. You can be as disrespectful to Salesforce values as you wish to be, as far as the numbers are on the board. This is not a nice environment to work in. This is a shark tank..

- We are taught to be hustlers. We make stories of how great the prices are in certain month and how my manager has a budget for the extra discounts He would like to spend with you as a special customer. Big news: the discounts are always available for those willing to actually buy and there are no budgets for “special discounts”.. The only big diversion from this is January, when it truly is a buyers market. 

- It is high pressure, always.

- You don't really have to work hard","- Racism is prevalent everywhere.  Unless you speak Hindi or are a South Indian, white male, expect no growth.  They speak Hindi in meetings, and are not inclusive at all to others outside this group

- Liars.  They won't tell you the real function of the job.  They claim to be great at tech, but its all very outdated technology.  It moves very slowly, so don't expect to work on anything new while at Salesforce

- Absent management.  Managers are never around and they won't help.  They are also racist if they are South Indian.  They choose to talk only to others on the team of the same race as them and only promote those individuals

Working on customers less than 100 employees = super transactional business. We preach customer success, haven't once seen it as an actual priority.

Total lack of perks offered in other top rated companies crucial to differentiate environment such as: NO GYM (allowance is taxed),  NO BREAKFAST - bran flakes don't count, NO LUNCH (forget lunch). 

Underwhelming promotion. Moving from Sales Dev to Account Executive responsibilities increase ten fold, base pay stays the same.

Growth means a lot of fluff while targets grow (by 20-30% YoY) and your account base reduces.

Commission doesn't incentivize closing big deals, shocking. OTE is 50/50, targets near unattainable.

Starting to become an increasingly micro-managed environment which does not pair well with corporate growth. Managers analyze logged activity word for word. Ridiculous.

Give it a few years this place will start hiring and firing like Oracle because it's perceived as a Top Place to Work when it's a middling environment at best. Google, FB, Airbnb are in a league of their own.

There is a heavy process around advancement, the main activity being developing your own brand.  This involves gaining sponsors at various levels and promoting yourself (sometimes unashamedly) heavily throughout the business.  This 'brand campaigning' is by definition political.  It is also biased towards those that have the time to commit to it.  It is largely dependant on a full and present management chain and those who are actually fully active making a difference at their customers, or who are under resourced and performing multiple roles to serve their customer, do not get the chance to 'seize the opportunity that Salesforce states that it presents.  The result is that the talent in the business feel undervalued and the promotions go to the people who have shouted the loudest.  It is a real shame, Salesforce isn't the company that I wanted it to be."

I didn't see much in the way of manager training or ensuring that the right ICs were promoted to people manager roles. Annual reviews are in no-way transparent. You are assessed on a set of criteria that is not shared with you (either the criteria or the assessment results). My review was five minutes: ""You're doing great!"" There was no actionable feedback, stretch goals or written documentation for me to learn and grow from.  Leadership in my org very often resorted to bullying and openly shared negative feedback on their own peers with their reports. Several times while working there, I lost my engineering title due to re-orgs and was told that they ""didn't want to transfer headcount,"" so was left with only limited technical work to do for long stretches. And that's my biggest complaint - at least in my org, hard and innovative work was not championed but rather avoided in pursuit of very easy and short-term goals."

Snacks
Nice view from the upper floors","Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades.  Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. 
- 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened.
-Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you  do not know enough to provide an accurate review.
- No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. 
- If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. 
- If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. 
-Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents,  60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. 
-No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting.  Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. 
-If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" 
- Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. 
- When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. 
-If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc.,  and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion."

Psychological safety is a term thrown around at Salesforce - it means nothing when the people who are meant to champion and protect you are the ones abusing their place.
My manager simply didn’t work, she was hard to contact and I only saw her in the office when someone more senior was visiting (sucking up to the boss). Of course, she had no trouble taking credit for my work or blaming me for things she was meant to do. She made me feel tiny and insignificant to the point of feeling ill before having to meet via video chat (where she would dial in from random places where she was ‘working’). The worst part is that our SVP was aware of this, yet here we are.

The people are great and their is a real team environment.  People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer.  I've never seen another company close to this.  Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity.  As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches.  It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time.  Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia.  Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. .  No other company can say that.  Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5.","That said the compensation is a quagmire of BS.  First you can already expect an OTE significantly less than what is the norm in the industry.  Worse still is the 40 acts of vaudeville to figure out if you will get paid, if you get paid and what amount they base it on.  We are out there saying use Salesforce as your system of record and every month my Xactly has little similarity to my sales in Salesforce.  Come on, guys.  Let's not be hypocrites!  Then when you think it can get no worse there is a virtual rubics cube of ways you lose ACV or see $ clawed back.  You have to be an accountant to figure out if you can sell to an account and retire quota.  It's ridiculous how many times, in a short time I have not gotten the full value of my sale due to some arbitrary attrition I was not even aware of as a co-prime.  Do you want me to sell or do you want me to audit the accounts to see if I can retire quota with a sale?"

- Well-rounded corporate stance ranging from PTO, wellness, volunteering, philantrophy that stands out
- Marketing is amazing, very well funded and really helps drives sales cycles
- Constant innovation, R&D and acquisitions helps evolve the story and value proposition constantly for customers
- Truly a business-impacting company (i.e. not just trying to sell software), transformational capabilities
- Career Path is astounding, the ability to explore/try new roles as the company grows is a solid differentiator.","- Pace: simply put, the frenetic company growth is unsustainable.  At its peak, think of back-to-back 80 hour weeks, juggling 6 tasks at once, back-to-back meetings & calls to get the job done properly.  Annual quotas that continue to go up isn't something that go on forever, right?
- Management: The company is growing so fast, first-line managers are going to be the weakness that cripples this company.  Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones.  To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce.  Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far
- Customers get tired: We all hear our customers are tired of getting ""nickled & dimed to death"" because we keep on coming out with new features, new acquisitions, new bundles that cost ""only $xx more per user/month""."

After almost 6  years in the company, that dream was coming true. Everything was good, excellent in fact. I had a great team around me and a real leader as a manager. The hours were long but the work incredibly fulfilling. I finished work every day thinking I was doing something really special and was a valued member of the team. Then things really started to change...","At the end of the day, even with awesome results and giving every ounce of energy, commitment and passion to a company, you start to realise that you’re just a number to Salesforce. New leaders come in and focus on managing up the chain to further their careers rather than motivating and inspiring their teams. Worse still is that Salesforce thinks they’re doing a great job. Despite continuing to deliver massive success for the company, I started to experience the presence of huge egos and selfishness that went beyond anything I’d ever experienced in a company before. The treatment of some staff around me was shocking and the whole Ohana I used to believe was real was falling apart across the whole sales team. I decided to leave and can honestly say that it’s saved me and rescued my belief in how a business should be run.  Customer success and trust are no longer the core values, it’s growth no matter what the price to employees. Big companies can still fail and if you don’t start to realise that many of your people are incredibly unhappy, the continuous growth you once saw will start to slow down. Don’t get me wrong, I think the top level leadership team is amazing but it’s the people in the middle who are really letting Salesforce down."

If you can suck up to your manager you can get all your perks. 
Some teams to prove themselves, try to step in other teams projects and take over and send them out. 
Some managers think their reports should work like their servants and should not express their opinion, too much partiality.
When teams move under different managers, this becomes rampant.  
Managers from certain ethnicity have very less opinion on women workers. Have seen several emotional incidents several times. 
I am sure this is going to become big in coming days as SFDC is becoming a giant.

This wasn't obvious to me because the compensation was considerably higher than at my previous company. I wished I had asked more questions and had asked for a higher title.
(3) No cafeteria at HQ: you need to leave the building to grab food. This by itself is not a big issue. In fact, it means you have so many different lunch options ... every day. Yet, the ability to socialize with co-workers within your team and more importantly outside your team is not as easy as at companies where there is a common lunch area. At my previous company, lunch break was an opportunity to run into people and have a quick chat, which was helpful for maintaining relationships."

Plenty of learning opportunities thanks to their company own Trailhead learning environment, paid certifications that are highly valuable on the market at the moment.  Free snacks, fruits and soft drinks.","No information has been given beforehand that a certain amount of certifications had to be passed first, which comes as an utter surprise to everyone when they start and is adding a lot of pressure to an already stressful situation as a new hire.
It was already suspicious that half of the team got rehired at the same time, but it turned out that this team had generally an extremely high turnover. The job itself was absolutely not challenging as it was merely an entry-level position, but immediately after joining we got told that there is a hiring freeze for the next months. It turned out that nobody for years had been given the chance to move to other teams. 
I got yelled at by the manager in the most unprofessional way and learned that this was normal there in this team. Well, it's not normal and absolutely not acceptable at all! I can only warn everyone to join who hopes this position could be a good start with Salesforce. It's a dead-end street!

If your stats are fine all is good with the world but may god help you if you go below threshold. And if they don't like you it won't even matter, simple as that.

2) Globally, great culture
3) Fantastic product","There was a change of sales management in India that happened about 2 years ago...and since then the company's culture -  that Salesforce is famously known for - has taken a huge beating in India. 

1) They've gone ahead and hired several of their close aides / colleagues from their previous organizations - Oracle, IBM, SAP mainly - at senior roles and they've formed a coterie. They take no efforts to learn the Salesforce culture of people first, integrity, hard work, sincerity and being Salesforce Smart. They feel they don't have to as they're backed very well by their aides.

2) They also operate with an attitude that they have a much better enterprise mindset than the long timers. In reality, most of these people have very ordinary customer facing skills, mediocre understanding of technology, hardly any industry connects (nothing that they could bank on at least). And guess what, they're extremely transactional. Nothing strategic in the way they operate or the direction they give. There is lots that they have to learn from long timers - in terms of customer skills, selling skills, product skills and knowing the company. 

3) Last year, the business grew well. Not because of them, but despite them.

4) Some of the best people - who proved themselves time and again have quit due to this change in culture and have joined competition, but the people who made them quit and their aides have got promoted. very very surprising. 

5) Recently there was a positive / welcome change at APAC leadership level. And now you can see this India sales mgmnt putting up an artificial face to show they are the custodians of culture, being fair in their practice, people leaders, etc. I wish they were only sincere about this."

- Employee success is really good.
- There are some genuinely talented people who can help you learn.
- If you get on a good team (which is a stroke of luck), you might have some good projects to work on.
- Good brand name & external perception.
- Depending on team and your abilities to talk in badly run meetings, you may end up experiencing a huge growth.","- A very unsafe culture. Predatory behavior in meetings. Only a white can do such a thing and not face any consequences because trust is a right for the whites and for colored it is a loosely hanging privilege which might be lost anytime and needs to constantly work on earning the privilege. I saw people even at Sr.Director level (who was colored) just leaving the meeting not knowing what to say or do. Eventually that Sr.Director (who was top notch) left the team in the name of personal reasons. Believe it or not, those whites even got promotions and MVP awards.

- Nepotism is prevalent. I was fully surprised by the way an engineering lead was lifted up to a top level leadership level so quickly (< 3 months since joining) without producing any good results. He was referred by another well positioned person in the team. The guy lacked humanity and was untrustworthy. He was aggressive, inconsistent, unresponsive, over-confident and was stepping on others toes a lot. Even providing feedback in the feedback app with facts to stop doing such things didn't help.

- Absolutely no transparency in promotions. People who did great things didn't get promoted and they left. I was a founding engineer who worked for closely 2 years. Many of the peer reviews were extremely positive. I was involved in some of the top level architecture meetings, was openly stated in those meetings that this is a really critical piece so i was needed to do it and ultimately got the job done from me, only to let a white take over the project once it was done and I saw others getting promoted who built on top of the work I had done. My manager didn't say any bad things in our 1:1s, he promoted others, resigned and just before leaving he talked to me for a minute over a phone call and we never met. I was the biggest fool to trust these people.

- I was low balled on the pay and the recruiter lied to me that salesforce doesn't do any sign on bonus and negotiations.

- Extremely operations heavy culture. Once a product is built and released to the customers, the pace at which things move is unbelievably slow. Leadership kills innovations, condescends on engineers who innovated and worked hard to build the product and makes everything operations centric."

They'll only do what they want to do and all your ideas will be given to others and they are projected as their ideas.  Totally biased and even after multiple feedbacks with the proofs they do not want to accept.

They will always tell, there's more to come in the future stay tuned. It's not about promotions or hike percentages. It's about ethics and integrity which the management will oversee always. Sometimes it's clearly evident and visible to everyone in the team that something wrong is happening and the local leadership in Hyderabad, never want to fix it. 

They just want to bypass it saying the (people who get support from management)  trying to do something extra why don't you support him instead of giving feedback. 

Later, the people who actually want to work as a team and share some feedback with the managers will be targeted big time and will be treated as like slaves or even worst them,

Support - Worst support that I have seen in the service industry. These guys never understand its a product based support, not a BPO. With Salesforce having three releases a year with all upgradations & patches, it will be difficult for a support person to keep up to date all the time. The worst way of calculation with regards to the headcount.

They say they're hiring people but for a quarter 50 people for a backlog and burden of thousands of cases is not working. Outdated metrics are being used to calculate productivity and other year-end calculations.

Employee Success or HR: Apart from very few members Zaira Banu & Rajesh I do not see others responding to the questions raised by the employees.  I'm not biased towards the above two but however, their work speaks for themselves. 

Now coming to the recruitment, Salesforce always recommends the employees to refer people to the organisation, however, the recruitment or referral process is worst (there is no other least word for this). 

I have referred around 10 profiles to this organisation, all the profiles haven't been considered. They stay in the first or second stage for almost 2 to 3 months and then the status changes to No longer in consideration. When we try to contact the recruiter there will be no response. 

FYI, the above mentioned 10 profiles have been selected in other organisations for better positions and better packages. It's clearly evident on the floor that there is an agreement between the manager and the respective team member. The team member will refer people and the respective manager will select that profile. Once the team member gets the referral bonus it will be shared by the team member(who referred to the profile) and the manager who recruited."

6057,Salesforce,Going downhill...,2019-06-04,2.0,BDR,"Great benefits, good IN PERSON training, good core values, the company has a good reputation.","Losing sight of the core values the company was founded on. Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 

8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). 

If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. 

Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. 

SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration...  (from BDR POV)

Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities,  this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. 

BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!)

As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense."

If you like the Salesforce products then this is a place closest to the source where all the magic happens. Great culture (transparent, open, collaborative) and loads of highly knowledgeable experts around you. A lot of autonomy is granted as long as you deliver.",It is a big company with many people. Sometimes hard to find your way through massive amount of information and people around you.
6071,Salesforce,Never been treated with such disrespect,2019-05-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I loved the office in the tower. The verdant shrubbery, vibrant colour, frequent events and culinary freebies made it an eclectic space to work in. Unfortunately the 7 functioning floors were overcapacity by 200 people which made things a little tight and meant there was little space to eat and sometimes even work!

The benefits are amazing. Loads of discounts, vitality health, company Amex and comprehensive expensing system. It really felt like a privilege to be there.

The internal tools and external products are very robust. It seemed as though everyone was very tidy, intelligent and mostly friendly. The companies and teams are quite siloed though so it’s rare that you’d interact with many people. There are so many people that you rarely bump into the same person twice in the same week.

there are apps and people for everything. The onboarding is quite slick if a little cultish. There’s a big emphasis on happiness and inclusion.","Unfortunately for a company claiming to have an keen eye on equality and trust, it lets a few things slip through the net: I was called aside following an evening out with colleagues whilst off campus. A department head had reported me after being open about my sexuality in a private conversation. I’m not sure why they felt that was necessary; I wasn’t given any specifics, only that it made them uncomfortable although they didn’t mention this during the conversation! Anyway a few days later I was summoned to HR and I was handed my notice. No warning. No chance to defend myself.

It’s a pity because the pay was really good. The internal recruiter who hired me was lovely. The work didn’t seem challenging enough yet however and there was too much process and planning in my opinion. I guess you just have to be careful whom you confide in when you work at a big co. At least my new job allows me to bring my dog to work."

The 3-4% annual merit raises aren’t good enough. Existing employee salaries are sub-par. No RSUs or stocks given to employees anymore. Incentivization by pay is a distant dream. Management and upper management take the meat of the money - typical of any company getting avaricious. Heavy attrition in critical functions is chipping away at all levels. Politics and power grab is the main game and not quality of work. Nepotism, favoritism is definitely on the rise. Transparency is questionable."

6093,Salesforce,Lackluster in spite of hype,2019-05-18,2.0,Solutions Engineer,"Excellent location, good benefits, smart colleagues, engaging customers, and some of the best products in the business. When things “work”, your individual contribution can make an actual difference. Account executives view us as equals and work well with us as a team dedicated to customer success.","As solution engineers we should get the best seat in the house, as we create real customer success. Unfortunately, certain elements in solution engineering management are capable of completely destroying this experience by instead focusing on drama, endless chatter, inflating their egos, and enjoying a good amount of backstabbing, bickering, and passive aggressive behavior. 

The Ohana, and the often touted values of trust and equality, will only apply if you have drank the right amount of kool-aid, and agree with all views and patterns of behavior that said elements mandate. If you deviate, prepare to be questioned every step of the way with every decision taken, and berated publicly on subjects that other colleagues that follow inline get to navigate with ease. Tensions rise because of this lack of transparency.

Policies are not applied equally across teams. As an example, another review here on mentioned working from home. Good luck doing that depending on where your reporting line lies. Trust is apparently just another playing card in the talk track deck.

At any moment in time, you have many more non customer related initiatives than you have ones dedicated to customer success. Higher ups have a habit of creating new aimless enablements and exercises that are purely there to justify their place in the hierarchy. Redundant new roles created for similar functions to appease certain individuals. At times, I believe I report to at least 5 individuals.

Laughable recent promotions abound, very lack luster people and management skills are all too evident in some recently promoted individuals. This has been noticed not only by individual contributors, but also by other managers as well. Also evident is the lacking of any backbone, if sales leadership claps, all are expected to dance in unison, no standing up for your team, or actually managing them or helping them out. Instead you get lack of ownership and and a “handle it yourself” attitude. Get ready to play political musical chairs all the time.

With all that to navigate, good luck trying to complete your ""real"" work in actual work hours, as along side all the above, you'll need to dedicate considerable time to toot your own horn just so that you get some recognition (whether you deserve it or not). Expect working weekends to be the norm. A fact all too known by solution engineers internally. And with that and the never ending customer related work load, good luck finding time to volunteer as part of your 1-1-1 which you signed up for in the beginning."

I'm proud of my time there.","The relentless focus on 25-30% YoY growth requires that Salesforce maintain a culture of bravado, bluster, and hype - and, too be fair, much of it well deserved.  But, in recent years, that same bluster permeates internally creating a more political (and I found threatening) culture. The Solution Engineer role became almost entirely Sales, and very little about technology.  'Art of the possible' is a common refrain.  'Imagineering' is another go-to buzz word. Or, more directly, 'Don't talk about products; paint a vision' is a constant theme."

- Product suit is amazing (even better the vision and marketing salesforce creates around them) Salesforce is really smart expanding the portfolio with additional  product that add value into the stack and allow AEs to position further value depending the industry you are focus on (Marketing , service , commerce , mulesoft ...) (B2B B2C)

- Really smart guys supporting the daily operations and business. You will have all the support from different areas of the organisation.

- 95 up to 100 sales guys in tech would pay to have the opportunity to work in the number 1 Saas company worldwide. Nice to have in your c 

- Salesforce gives you the chance to work on amazing projects you would have the chance being in a different company.","Some disadvantages are coming from the advantages indeed:

- It’s really difficult to make good money. Target are increasing and OTE are reflected based on global plans , so it depends a lot on how lucky you are you will be able to reach your targets.

- You will have to manage the relationship not just  with your direct reporting, but wih different stakeholders who will have different interests. As an example, different AEs from different vertical products interested in selling into the same account, different RVPs to manage with. Alignment is one of the most important words in the company. Some days you will finalise your day thinking about how 90% of your calls were to manage talks with colleagues and not customers/ partners. 

- Depending on the area you are focus in, territory can be really big or small. This comes with the maturity of the product in the market. Per example , Core products AEs are really focus in small territories, however new products in the Org (Mulesoft, Commerce ,...) counts with small teams yet. These AEs are focus in strategic deals and normally cannot support all the opportunities properly. At the end, quotas are increasing because of new products in the portfolio , but you cannot have the same level of support like in mature ones. So I would say it depends how lucky you are with an specific account your co prime could make a big piece of the quota.

- I don’t personally believe you have to be the best sales person in the world to sell in Salesforce. Marketing investment and resources are super huge, some customers buy the vision and what they see in events many times , plus there is plenty of really experienced partners in the region. I would say your results at the end of the year will depend 30% of your work and 70% how lucky you are with your territory , maturity of your account and the work of your co-primes

- If you like the start uptype of experience , this is not a place where you will be comfortable for a long time (I must confess  smaller regions like Iberia are closer to a start up type of company thought ) However, sometimes you will have the feeling  you will spend more time reporting, reading Quips, covering different events, than thinking strategically how to gain relationships, trust and projects. 

- This company can help you win good money, but reducing your health due to stress and long time at work.
Work life balance is challenging. There is not an ending point , you will have to be really good Managing this point to have everyone happy : you (and your health , your closer family (that will have to be open on you travelling and spending long hours at work, and the company) This point is being really important.
Some people are leaving , or thinking about doing it, because of this last reason.

Retaining employees is key for the company. Many important people use to leave (mostly coming from the acquisitions) because they don’t get use to the way the company operates. 

A lot of people are ex oracles, this can creates a local culture where not anyone might be confortable with."

The work is very bland and the product itself is legacy and uninteresting. There's no room for creativity and innovation at all. I don't understand how Salesforce is at the cutting edge of technology when the product itself is easily reproduced.

Company utilizes Google GSuite which doesn't work too smoothly with Apple or Microsoft products and hardware. You can get your work done, but if you are used to select your own tools or if you come from a Microsoft dominated environment you better be prepared for this as the impact to your productivity may be big in the beginning. 

The biggest problem to me has been that the Senior Management is not always on a level that I would expect them to be. There is a lot of variance in how they set the expectations, support their subordinates and especially how they present themselves as leaders. Maybe it is bad luck or maybe I'm not the right fit for the company, but this has also made me consider my options with other employers."

You feel pride working at Salesforce.  For the most part leadership is talented.","The media has an image that Salesforce is the number 1 place to work.  This is not the case for sales.  Many of the sales reps are unhappy with many things but stay because of how well the company performs/innovates.  Base salaries are extremely low.  There are very few people that are hitting their annual numbers and the overall compensation plus base is just not there.  So much of it is based on territory but leaders will say to their graves that all territories are even.  We would have much more appreciated it being called out vs. lying to our faces that they are all spread equally.  

Overall there is a lot of negativity here and much of this stems from the unhappy customers.  Salesforce customers, especially in the SMB space don’t have the money to spend to implement Salesforce so their orgs are bad and adoption is extremely low.  Account executives are responsible for selling - but also dealing with all unhappy customers, cancellations, technical support questions, etc. It doesn’t help that the renewals and billing teams are both outsourced to foreign counties and are extremely hard to work with (both internally and externally).  You might close a huge deal but you’ll then have to deal with the repercussions of all the above."

6164,Salesforce,Continues to decline,2019-04-17,2.0,Consultant,"The ability to come into the office or work remote, although I have noticed a decline in internal careers listed that are remote.
The ability to volunteer using VTO, but agree with others. In some teams it is not volunteer work, you are required to put it in your V2MOM and complete it on some teams. The ability to do interesting work, connect with other talented individuals, and the training/learning opportunities.","On a recent survey, two of the lowest scoring questions revolve around people politicking and backstabbing to get things done and the lowest score company wide was promotions are handled in a fair and transparent way. The promotion question has been a bottom 5 scoring question for 2 years now. I have witnessed people promoted either for unfair reasons or because threatening to leave. They pass off a promotion as someone being promoted when in all actuality they applied to an internal job posting and were hired, that’s not really a promotion. The answer to fixing this is not more documentation on careers.
They put on a front that they value trust and transparency. They want you to be able to have difficult conversations with your manager without fear of retaliation, but I have witnessed people who speak up and are retaliated against with maybe a Performance Improvement Plan or a demotion. I sometimes feel as if managers and leaders here are talking the talk but not walking the walk when it comes to truly living by the Ohana values.
There is a feeling on some teams that it is easier and less stressful not using your PTO vs using it. Tough finding and training multiple backups to handle their job and yours while out.
Recently a decline in billable work that has them reassigning people to new careers. It is tough seeing work sent to vendors in India when people at Salesforce are struggling to get billable work.
Bonus for some 100% based on billable work which you have no control over. Person A could have 4 accounts and 40+ billable hours, resulting in a very healthy bonus; while Person B might have 1 account and is receiving 10 hours of work, receiving a much smaller bonus. The division of labor is not fair and should be distributed more evenly.
Seems a bit unfair when Salesforce gives an executive a $200,000 car and $86,000 watch as a bonus for exceptional work, when you have witnessed others do exceptional work on a smaller scale (not necessarily bringing in $8 million in Sales) and all they get is a Chatter shoutout from their manager or their name mentioned on a PowerPoint slide.
I agree with another review here...it is tough dealing with a travel ban, not being able to travel to visit coworkers during a Christmas party, but the top people were all in Hawaii that year. I remember that."

Benefits are truly amazing. £300 a month to spend on wellness is excellent.,"The pace. They seriously need to consider how they expect employees to keep going at the crazy pace. Stress and burnout at this company is concerning. Politics! Keeping 10-15 people aligned on your plan every time is exhausting. Not have the autonomy to work in the way you know you can is frustrating and due to the pace, you really only ever offer around 70%.  Yet, the pace is mystifying knowing that there are so many people to do every little element of a job. Sometimes you are left wondering what you role actually is. I think some people make a career out of attending in-house ""events"".

Managers encourage AEs to bleed customers for every penny that they have and to be extremely agressive while doing so. 

Also, management is not present at all, unless it's the last of the month or quarter end . Conservatively, I would say that Small business Sales managers are in the office less than 15% of the time and take the approach that they are not ""baby-sitters"" and dont do anything outside of pipeline management. There is zero guidance to new employees and 1:1s with all employees are cancelled and not rescheduled at least 50% of the time.  Management will often hide out in a booked room all day, outside of the office, to avoid being on the sales floor and having to deal with Account Executives that need guidance, advice or help. They leave the other employees to pick up the slack of management that would prefer not come in at all, hide out in an office, or ""work"" from home."

It’s deeply saddening that the actual experience working in Technology and Products is one of constant battles between the cross-functional groups.,"Tension is normal and healthy between different disciplines but here the interactions across PM, UX, and Engineering are aggressive and lack empathy for each other. The focus is on each of the 3 separate orgs - you are on the ‘UX team’, ‘Eng team’, or ‘PM team’ instead of defining culture around the cross- functional team working on a product. This often results in aggressive behavior where each discipline intimidates the other to do what they want or pass blame when something goes wrong. The exec leaders of these orgs verbally battle it out with each other in very public reviews that are streamed across their entire orgs and this sets the example that trickles down throughout the teams."

Visionary CEO Marc Benioff, created an idealistic culture where employees are paid to volunteer 50 hours a year, and the company matches their charitable donations up to $10K a year. At the company's San Francisco headquarters, employees have daily access to the best view on the West Coast, the 61st floor of Salesforce Tower. The workforce is generally smart, professional, and ethical. There are plenty of resources. Managers are on the whole receptive to new projects.","Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result. The famed ""Ohana"" (Hawaiian for family) doesn't penetrate the 300-yard stare of hardened coworkers who don't say hello in elevators."

We being the most innovative company and how we care for the customers is very alluring. Heard great things about the culture before I joined. Our values and 1-1-1 philanthropy model gives a sense of what is priority for the firm - People. Great work-life balance if you are in the right teams. But not when you are 12.5 hrs ahead and working under managers from India. Also, open V2mom(Year goals) at the entire org level gives purpose for your career development plans.","There has been no attention paid to the mid level management that was hired. Especially in the IT Project team. 
People leave managers, not companies. I feel I work under a manager who is straight out of the Dilbert comic strip. Numerous attempts have been made to fix my working relationship with this manager, with no results. I strongly believe that there is severe incompetence for the role and position that this manager was hired for. Gaslighting, micromanagement, plagiarising ideas, absolute disregard for an employee’s personal time. Add to this the constant reminder of the said person’s insecurities being thrown around in the garb of constantly mentioning their decade-odd years of work experience. These are just some, among the many, problematic aspects that have caused demotivation. 

However. I would also like to clarify that the person in question is not bad or immoral. They only happen to be a bad fit in a managerial position. This company might be ranked as the best place to work at, but from an employee’s point of view, our life revolves around the people we work with/under, daily. It is unfortunate that it has as not fared well for me. It is quite drudgeoning to constantly hear the phrases “what!!!!!”,  “that is not how it works” or “i don’t understand” up until today."

It has good benefits, especially the wellness reimbursement and the ESPP (Salesforce stock is pretty good), and it's difficult to get fired (this may vary by department).","Management is full of hyprocrisy. Salesforce's core values include things like transparency and equality, both of which have been completely ignored on our team (and apparently also on other teams after reading other reviews here). There is a complete lack of communication from the top down, which makes our team unable to perform our work well. Furthermore, there is little feedback on how we can get promotions or raises. There is a culture of not giving feedback and you need to ""read between the lines"" in order to know what feedback there is (this is what was told to me by management). On our team, promotions are given to the men more often than the women, and men with the same title and less experience as women have higher salaries.

Also, the skill of managing people isn't seen as part of the requirements of being a people manager. A lot of people who are great individual contributors get promoted to Manager and aren't very good at their new job of dealing with their direct reports, but upper management doesn't care.

If you rock at sales and love academia, then dot org is the place to be!  So much growth since I started with dot org three years ago, and lots of new people coming on board with the high growth!","New AEs or people considering coming to dot org – there is a caveat and buyer beware! It’s starting to feel like a sink-or-swim culture with so many new people coming onboard.  I’ve been asked to work with numerous new AEs as they stepped into their role since fall/December of 2018.  It’s become very clear that we are not taking the right steps to onboard them.  New AEs are overwhelmed with the boundless options and tools we give them.  Not to mention, for December hires, their RVPs were busy closing FY ’19 business, so our most vulnerable new hires were left to fend for themselves.  Hopefully, they’ll get RVP support once FY ’20 kicks off.  Bottom line:  our intentions are good, but our execution fails them.

It’s interesting that we constantly, almost self-righteously, talk about “the pace of Salesforce” as if it’s a badge of honor that only a few can achieve.  Most new AEs coming into higher ed want to achieve and catch onto this pace right away.  However, unfortunately we’re sabotaging their success by everything we throw at them (and again, often without RVP support).  

The enablement and RVP teams need to do better jobs of sequencing and blocking off the new hire content.  Instead, we are throwing everything plus the kitchen sink at them – all at once – and expecting them to make sense of it all.  No wonder I get panic-stricken phone calls and text messages at all hours of the day/night from rookies.  Many RVPs are telling down their throats for answers, yet we haven’t paced their learning. In our current state of onboarding, I don’t know if even I could make it through this process given the “throw-it-all-at-them” approach we now take."

6293,Salesforce,"Great company, great workplace, great opportunities",2019-02-27,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Great culture, Competitive salary, Able to have a life balance, Huge possibilities and opportunities of growth","Some pressure on the results, Complex product to understand and master"
6294,Salesforce,Slowly becoming one of the worst places I've ever worked,2019-02-27,1.0,Director,"The salary is good, at least in my role. As many have mentioned, Salesforce is still seen as a destination company and a market leader - so experience here looks good on a resume. I've met some great people here who have stimulated and challenged me - also made some great friends personally.","I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best.

First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here.

Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on.

Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups  who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger.

Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people.  At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth.

As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help."

Recently after a decade they realised that they need to provide some flexibility to the employees.
Many internal complains were raised against the micromanagement but nothing really happened. 
2 managers in team when there is not even 2 hours of work in a day for even 1 manager. This leads to a lot of micromanagement as they don not have work to keep them busy.
managers in the team do not respect individual time. They force meeting which don't even make any sense for most of the team.
Communication classes which were conducted internally was a waste of time, money and resources for the company. The external instructor being a friend of the manager used to discuss individual's goals and attend performance review meetings. He knew more about the team than the team knew (who resigned, who is getting promotion etc). Seriously, no respect for ethics."

6299,Salesforce,A wonderful company that is starting to not be so wonderful,2019-02-23,2.0,Vice President Sales,"Salesforce is a destination company and there are few places where you will find so many truly interesting and gifted people in one firm.  There is a real effort to continue to promote the company's values, including trust and equality.  Support for philanthropy is significant (although I would agree with the reviewer who noted that ""volunteer"" activities are often anything but voluntary but rather expected/required.   (Not to say that giving back is anything other than positive, but it's just worth noting that most company activities include it as part of the agenda.)

The customers are interesting and the tech is pretty solid.   The benefits are what you would expect from a firm that wants to hire top talent, in other words, extensive and high quality.

The company continues to grow at quite a fast rate, and that is an imperative.   The acquisitions are part of that and it's quite clear that they are necessary since there is only so much organic growth coming out of the core businesses.   If you are in a ""good"" territory / team / department, this may in fact be a dreamjob.  There are quite a lots of employees who are able to devote many hours (days) to volunteer causes, company social functions, training opportunities and so on.    This is particularly the case if you are employed in one of the hub offices.","The rapid growth and the pressure around quarterly metrics  is starting to come at the expense of cohesion and quality.  The annual reorganization of the business is quite disruptive and is particularly problematic in business areas where the sales cycles are longer, like the more heavily regulated verticals or larger enterprise environments where aligning stakeholders and building vision takes time.   You can work your &#$# off here and have all that worked handed off to someone else in a new fiscal.   Happens a lot.

Above the mid management/senior director level, the political environment resembles the Hunger Games.  The lack of capable management and the lack of transparency around career progression / promotion are a drag on the business and a significant business risk.   The departures of more tenured people should be very concerning to leadership; just look at the difference in the reviews of new (<1 year) employees and those with 5 or more years of experience.  It's not a positive marker.    There is a reason that the employee survey now asks about the ""psychological safety"" of our workplace.  Leadership should be commended for recognizing that this is a problem, but now needs to actually do something to fix it. Just adding a feedback app and calendar reminders to use it are probably not going to get the job done.

Once you are hired, progression within the company can be difficult.  There is a policy that all internal transfers should be lateral in terms of grade and compensation, even if an external candidate with the same credentials would be offered significantly more compensation and a bigger title.  There is a sense that the only way to get a promotion is often to threaten to (or actually) resign and unfortunately, plenty of evidence that this is an effective strategy."

The people are thorough, detailed, collaborative and concerned about the customer as job one.  Second to none is their process and the team's ability to learn from an event in order to prevent it from happening again.","For those of us who were former Demandware - or arrived while it was Demandware, we were hosed - SRE Leadership was promoted, salary increased, golden handcuffs, stock options (RSUs) by the boat loads, but for those of us individual contributors, NOTHING, zip, NOTHING.  Just a salary with a small bonus.  So, see ya!  Off your experience goes to another employer who cares about their contributors."

Success of the customer is out at the forefront.  I have seen this on the Success Mgmt and Sales side and anyone reading this should consider Salesforce as the real deal. 

Trust is the most important factor here and mostly this is evident throughout.  

Teaming and “Swarming” on an issue still makes for a great environment.  Rarely will you find someone not willing to give you time or jump in for the team.  

If you want in know your worth. Have solid use cases that show how you provided value to the customer not just leaders who asked you what to do.  

The most important part is improving our customers experience.","Strat is a high stakes game and not for the faint at heart.  Expect to deal with challenges and adversity.  This is almost not a con as I would expect anyone coming into this role to know how to deal with this and succeed.

Be prepared to enter into a highly political environment in which you will be judged unfavorably on every initiative you try to take since Salesforce has its own culture, norms and behavior.  +1 on the review on lack of transparency and lack of ability to define employee growth or new opportunities despite exceeding targets.

The support that the company offers its employees in times of need is exceptional, and the care and understanding of middle management is genuine. I care for all of my team members well being, and support them personally and professionally as much as possible. So do my colleagues.","Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry. We once had a travel freeze but the company still sent the top 100+ employees to a big shindig in Hawaii - and they broadcast it and insisted that everyone across the company ""tune in"" to it remotely.

As the size increases so does the amount of corporate stupidity and absurdity.  The culture is a healthy check on this, but the tension is more obvious with every year.  
In advisory, current utilization targets are not realistic and are driving bad behavior.

Salesforce prides itself on #Ohana which means family. It is core value/belief of company and makes it an incredible company to work for; Unless you are in Sales","3 things have changed for me as having been with company for long time and I consider them all Cons

1. Salesforce prides itself on #ohana which is family. Salesforce #ohana is vibrabnt and alive and incredible. Unless you are in Sales in which case its non existent. It is run old school the Oracle way.

2.  Customers suffer the most as they did when Sales Leadership ran Oracle.  Salesforce is ruthless in scraping every penny from the client, making MSA difficult by not giving an inch on anything. Management wants the number period, if it helps the customer thats a bonus. 

3. Execs get paid AE's do not. 

There are essentially 4 - 5 levels of Sales Management before you get to Keith Block. On the Ground Floor 7 AE's may each carry a number such as $2,000,000 US.

There RVP number is not $14,000,000 but about $10 or $11,000,0000.

This continues up the management change so at the highest level they will carry a quota that will significantly less the what the AE's carry.  End result is Significant amount of reps will be below 50% attainment and my guess is a few percent will knock it out and may 10 to 15%  actually hit their number.  Opportunity to make real money like in the old days is very slim.

Lot of Starving AE's which the company does not seem to mind as they make it very clear there are 10 people behind you waiting for your job."

You also actually feel like management care for you. I had a huge commission issued where they underpaid me by 75%, and had to fight for it for a few months. Ultimately, upper management came through, which is amazing.","Very toxic culture. The issue with Salesforce is that there are so many people lined up for working there, that they simply do not care about the long-term well-being of their employees. Salesforce is a machine, you will be put in it, use you for everything your worth, and they will spit you out and move on to the next one. Most people would say that this is what sales is like, but no, Salesforce is a beast of its own when it comes to pushing people to their limit. Furthermore, the pay really isn't that great for a sales job in tech. Maybe it was good 5 years ago? Not now, though."

6438,Salesforce,"High standards, terrible execution",2018-12-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salesforce is a great company with a great culture. The top leaders are all awesome and inspiring. I consider myself lucky to have worked in a company with very smart, talented and driven people.","The issues at Salesforce exist at the department / team level, which are led by terrible managers. This is obviously not the case with all departments - but my rating reflects my horrible experience with my department that has been embroiled in chaos for more than a year, with no end in sight. This department is central enough that the dysfunction here, will eventually result in a bad decisions for all other teams that interact with it.

The leader of this department has created an unhealthy work culture, where people do things because of fear. The leader openly chides senior leadership in public for small infractions, and does not accept dissent. They have openly punished individuals for speaking up. The working style has become uninspiring because pomp and show are prioritized over true value creation - this is demonstrated by the fact that the top achievements of the department as highlighted by the leader themselves are theoretical frameworks, and not actual proven methodologies. There are many smart people on the team, but the leader has narrowed in to their insecurities and manipulates them to make sure they only do and say things the leader wants. Otherwise, they are very efficient on getting rid of people who do not “please” the leader one way or another. 

HR is kind but plays the therapist role rather than a facilitator. At least 25 people in our department have talked with HR. All we’ve heard is “Awww” and “it’ll get better, we will coach them” for the last 6 months. Can’t say we haven’t tried. We can’t all switch teams and ultimately it is the company’s responsibility to weed out bad leaders. It is not just people suffering (though of course Salesforce will say people are important) but business is suffering because we have a whole department that is wasting money, talent and resources - and no amount of escalation has yielded anything."

You have unlimited resources, exposure, and are surrounded by the best of the best.   The products lead the market, and 90% of the population here is an ""A"" player, confident and driven to succeed.  The company is poised to dominate the CRM and Marketing industries for the next decade at least.  In short, this is a fantastic opportunity to be a part of.","The culture is that of a big company, and success here is what you make of it.  Nothing will be spoonfed, and it is up to the individual to sink or swim.  Training is barebones(so seek out resources, and self motivate yourself to learn!), and many sales environments are hyper competitive.  The organization is so big that there are redundant processes and internal politics, meaning that success here requires excellent externally facing and internally facing skills(or perhaps an opportunity to develop both for those starting their careers).  For a company of this size, I don't think it is possible to avoid the aforementioned cons; that said, new employees who have only worked down or mid-market will need to adjust to a big company work environment, and won't receive much in the way of guidance as to how best to accomplish this."

6455,Salesforce,Good with some bad,2018-12-18,4.0,Success Agent Tier II,"Salesforce is the best place to work in Indy if you're in tech. The company offers quite a few perks, from free barista-served coffee to lavish holiday parties at which you might see flame throwers or magicians (depending on theme).  PTO is good, not great, for newer employees (3 weeks), though another week and a half or so is given for volunteer work (VTO).

 The pay is good, with a 10% annual bonus (assuming your performance reviews are perfect). 

I always felt free to be myself  and never felt that I had to change my behavior to fit in.

Casual day is every day. There is no outdated mentality at Salesforce wherein employees can only be considered respectable if they are wearing a suit.","Marketing Cloud, at least, is still going through transition pains years after acquisition. Many processes have not worked out kinks yet, and it felt like San Francisco dictated to our office without taking into consideration our unique needs.

During my time in Marketing Cloud Support, we were extremely under-staffed, with a discouragement of using overtime and yet we had to call every customer, every day, and provide them with a two-hour window during which we could call. I have been told that since I left rules have become even stricter. With tight SLAs, little overtime available, and a severe lack of staff, employees were extremely stressed and turnover became a real problem. We did not feel that the company cared whether the requirements of the job were impossible to perform in an 8-hour day. The team that existed when I left earlier this year looks nothing like the current team because of people feeling they had to leave to get out of the situation.

Team leads and managers in Indianapolis were as supportive as they could be given the situation and pressure on them as well. My team often felt that we had no agency in this issue, as leaders in Indianapolis could do nothing against the executives in San Francisco making decisions for us."

- OOM ( haven't tried though).","This was suppose to be my dream company but I think I joined wrong group - Mulesoft. Everyone is so rude. Micromanagement at it's peak. Existing Mulesoft employees don't want to include new joinee in their circle or want to work with them. Doing any work seems like its my personal interest to work and existing employees  are there to create obstacle and see how I go past them - so they can judge.
Very less experience managers. And they are promoting 3-4 years experience people to manage/lead 8-10 years experience employees, just because their 3 years experience is in Mulesoft. And they will treat you like a freshman our of collage. Your industry experience doesn't matter. They don't even want to know how it works outside and or change a bit. 

I still can't believe I am writing a bad review for Salesforce. (I'd really love to change it in future, if things change. I am banking on OOM)"

6502,Salesforce,Director,2018-12-01,2.0,Director,"Great C Suite - visionary, transparent, inspiring.
Excellent market position - executing against a well defined strategy
Great products (apparently)
Good pay and benefits
Strong regional (APAC) leadership at EVP and SVP level.","My function was held together with sticky-tape - incredibly inefficient and lack of standardisation or consistency across some pretty basic reporting functions; disjointed, messy and frankly incredibly administration heavy - unnecessarily so.

Too many inexperienced or first time managers without sufficient people experience or knowledge of their business; this creates a highly political environment and unnecessary tension

EQUALITY is one of the core values - even basic benefits such as annual leave entitlement are not standardised across geographies - go figure....

The employer/employee marketing is literally rammed down your throat all day every day - eventually people believe it - whether they are conscious of this or not I have no idea - but it really isn't that great a place to work - you literally sell your soul, and the message from the top is 'Company First, Team Second, Self Last' - you need to be prepared to live to this or you will not survive.

Work life balance is non-existent.

Management preach the right things but do not actually put in place measures to make these become realisable.  A huge amount of managing up.

Poor support from the Employee Success team aligned to my business.

Too many layers - far too many.  Heavy politics at all levels.  

A senior executive told me there is 'Ohana', 'Brohana', Nohana' and 'Hohana' - go figure - thats from a SENIOR exec!"

6509,Salesforce,Joined through employee referral as a remote worker,2018-11-29,5.0,Principal Architect,Their Ohana culture is REAL - the company functions as a family built on relationships.

We support non-profit organizations and the list of good will we do goes on and on.  We help our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way - making a positive impact on their business.  We truly are setting the bar for how all Companies should impact positive change in our world.

Generous time off to volunteer - which I haven't had time for
Generous donation matching - which I always take advantage of for my favorite causes
Superb brand for your resume - recruiters will come after you almost daily","Ohana, what Ohana? 

Management (at least in sales) only manages by the numbers, with no EQ to speak of, shuns 2-way dialogue, and pushes everything on the front line. They don't prioritize their requests and overwhelm their teams, who are trying to close business and/or appease unhappy customers. Meanwhile, there's zero knowledge management to speak of -- we are literally incessantly filling out shared docs with the same information multiple times outside of the CRM. and everyone on the account team loses the plot. Who would have thunk?

Salesforce is cost cutting in an effort to reach profitability. Goodbye parties, offsites, and non customer-facing travel. Benefits aren't cheap -- I'm paying well over $400/mo. for mine. 

It's been observed that they are systematically pushing workers 40+ out of the business to hire less experienced / new grads for less -- a ""best practice"" of private equity companies that seems to be catching on like wildfire in tech.

Last but not least, at a company that espouses the values that it does, I am surprised that so many offsite events and outings include a ridiculous amount of drinking. Not ONCE has our team done a group volunteering outing or something to serve our community (and I'm at HQ in San Francisco). Instead, every time I go out with my sales colleagues it turns into some weird game of chicken of who can drink the most and still function the next day. Honestly, it's pathetic. These aren't even 20 or early 30-somethings."

Leadership - incredible.","The vast majority of AE's were hired as hourly employees (you get a base salary but it's calculated hourly).   Nearly every AE was recruited & led to believe that ""although your base salary appears low - you will make that up in overtime."" AE's work 50+ hours.  This isn't an expectation - it's simply about owning your responsibilities required to do a good job for our customers.  

In the past, logging honest hours hasn't been an issue - AE's logged hours according to the work put in. This year however, it is ""48 hours or less...if you are logging more than 50 hours, you're not efficient"" .... This is concerning b/c it represents a subtle undertone of apathy to AE's.  We were recruited under the notion we would be allowed to log the hours we worked.   If the company is moving away from paying hourly, then the salaries should adjust accordingly - b/c this was the #1 negotiation tactic used by Salesforce recruiters to lowball base salaries.  But again, the bigger concern here is how it makes AE's feel.  We assume Salesforce looks out for our best interest, especially those putting in the extra hours to get the job done.  It's one of the reasons Salesforce has been successful - we have a culture of execution."

I've told my story unbiased to several other managers and co-workers, and they ALL agree that I was really given a raw deal.  I was never given any solid opportunities to sharpen my Marketing Cloud skill-set, and the opportunities I was given (working on Accelerators) I excelled at.  Every feedback received from customers (via Accelerators) and co-workers alike was nothing less than extraordinary.  However, none of this mattered for some reason.  I've kept a document that noted every piece of feedback received just in case I had to have something to back my story up with.  I feel, along with others, that my manager had a personal vendetta against me and was working to get me dismissed.  I was never given opportunities to work on real Marketing Cloud projects therefore, couldn't really get some good feedback going from that perspective.  I was given the bare minimum to work with and often, I was left without work to do.  In the end, I got tired of this treatment and began looking for other opportunities that really valued what I brought to the table.

If you don't have a great manager, then there's no opportunity for advancement.  No real skill set sharpening opportunities either.  Get a good manager."

Only those who are level 7 and above are eligible to receive equity grants. A large cohort of employees under level 7 are EAs, who are mostly female. Meaning that women are still not being treated equitably when it comes to overall pay. Sure, they can purchase stock through the ESPP, but that means they have to still pay out of pocket for something that other employees are given. Many leading companies in SV grant equity to all employees, regardless of level. For a company that touts equality and equal pay for all, why are women still unable to benefit from the success of the company, especially when they play a key role in the success?"

The matrix meats the hunger games...nothing is as it seems and everyone is out for you. From development to a closing role, no increase in base. “We should be lucky to be getting what we get” - actual words from an internal recruiter. Internal employees are the least paid and get less 1:1 time bc we already “know what we are doing.” If a recruiter isn’t being paid, our ramp time is smaller, wouldn’t it make sense to give us a pay increase as we climb the rungs of the company AND fight our way amongst top talent to do so? I’ve seen too many friends and colleagues be told no or strung along for too long. For a transparent company, it’s not always so transparent. Every year after fiscal end there are massive changes that are made and then take months to implement (comp structures, territories, complete .org restructures). 
The acquisitions, while they are great choices and make our platform whole, have been a point of struggle bc acquiring a company that has operated one way for so long and folding it in to one of the biggest technology companies globally isn’t an easy feat and there are a lot of areas that seem to be overlooked. Selling a sales tool or a marketing tool is going to warrant a different approach and strategy then perhaps a commerce platform. Comp plans and quotas should consider the different deal cycles,

Many employees have long tenures, and usually will not leave as they love the supportive environment that Salesforce creates for their employees through excellent benefits and opportunities for growth. It's refreshing to work for a company that truly puts weight behind words at the top levels. 

Unlimited PTO is great, and the flexibility to work from home is fantastic, most if not all tech companies should have these perks to keep up with the job market though.","That being said, the vision and values don't necessarily always translate down to middle management levels. Many orgs (specifically marketing, but I've heard sales as well) are full of politics, mud slinging and power grabs. Senior leadership seems to acknowledge this recently, however there are no consequences for the people that perpetuate this type of environment. Toxic employees who produce results in their job are protected, even when multiple complaints are surfaced through the appropriate channels."

Love the fact that we are now leading with a culture that I see other brands are taking now, from our 1-1-1 model to no PTO policy to the amazing health/well-being offerings that I see daily in my corporate communications.

Your peers are amazing, talented and more than willing to help out.  It a nice inner-network that you can build upon and start to develop long-standing relationships for years to come.

Office environments are really nice and WFH opportunities are life-changing.  Just be prepared to know what that means - some people need people around them at all times and some excel in a virtual environment.

The clients are always happy to see a Salesforce employee (very different from my experience with the other ""big 3""), but I also know that the ""army"" does still tend to show up at executive meetings that is not necessary.

Pay and benefits are good and hard to match with our competitors.","""Go faster and better...and when you get there, go even faster and do more  than you did last time"" seems to be the endless cycle of trying to hit our numbers as an organization and I am seeing a lot of my colleagues burn out.  This is across sales, engineering, product as well as marketing.  So for many in different areas, your work/life balance may be different than say those in other departments (be aware of this when/if you are interviewing).

There is a real issue that I know is being looked at now (end of 2018) around helping all employees with their career pathing (which is non-existent in my team) and is starting to lead to team members looking at other opportunities (inside and outside) in order to grow.  You hear things like ""own your career"" but honestly, this is such a jab at people who are really trying to embody this and not getting what they need (whether performance feedback, career plan, opportunities to grow) from management.  I am not sure how much longer this can go on until management starts to focus on this more and not just a passing comment like above.  Its scary when you have new employees come into the brand and ask me ""so how do you move up at Salesforce?""  The organization does not have an answer for this, but I know is trying to solve for this.

To professionals who are looking to get foot in the door - our recruitment process is not the best.  Have sent several personal friends into the interview process and hard to hear the negativity with their experience from such a good company.  Decisions are made by hiring manager and feedback from teams that you would interview for, but there are small pockets of ""personal friends"" of managers who will get beneficial treatment that I do not like to see (its obvious)...but I would say that if you are trying to get into Salesforce, think about other roles that you can look at just to get into the organization.  Sometimes having a second choice will ultimately present you as a more diverse expert and one that you can easily switch internally to that job you originally wanted."

Although the apartments are all nice, the locations varied widely. I could walk to work easily, but I know people who had to bus 30-40 minutes to get to work.
Teamwise, I know some interns who weren't as lucky as me and ended up in teams who barely interacted outside of work (i.e. no eating together during lunch). What team you end up on all seems to boil down to luck (you interview  directly for a team vs having a team matching process)."

Employee benefits are wonderful and it's very clear Salesforce puts employees first. There's even food in ever break room so no one ever has to sit at work hungry. 
All employees are given VTO, which is time off to volunteer for whatever charitable cause they choose. Salesforce also matches charitable donations up to a certain amount.

Biggest mistake by getting employees and management from Call centre culture.
2. Spoiled the work culture.
Most of them doesn’t have knowledge or attitude to work in company like Salesforce. They are fit for BPO only.
Salesforce values now changed from Trust to No-Trust.
Now the culture is Politics, backstabbing, data manipulation.
There was saying Getting into Salesforce is harder than getting into Harvard university.
This doesn’t apply for Hyd CSG.
Criteria for hyd CSG:-
1. Referred by Management 
2. Wife can refer husband and vice-versa.
True ohana can be seen here.
Husband and wife working in same team, shift, and manager.
Though we have policy around it, who cares need to focus on Ohana.
If not in same team it’s very easy to work in same shift.
Doesn’t make sense reaching out to ES as they are the one who gives offer letters.
Promotion criteria:- management favourite.
Need to know how to play politics. 
Backstabbing and how to get numbers.
Management is afraid to take actions against non performers and people with wrong attitudes which actually spoiled the entire culture.

There is a culture of abuse at every level. The only people who get promoted don't think for themselves and are 'yes men and women.' Expenses are ridiculously controlled. People commonly steal credit for other people's work with no repercussions. There is no movement between departments and job roles. The company hoards talent and underutilizes them.

6683,Salesforce,6 Months In . . .,2018-10-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I work with some of the smartest people I've ever met. The overall attitude is one of work hard/play hard but not soul crushing. Management in my chain at least does a really good job of making sure not to overload anyone with to much work and makes it a point to get feedback about work/life balance every other week at the end of sprints. Not to repeat to much other information but benefits overall are very good and compensation seems to be top of market.,"Getting up to speed takes time. Internally teams operate very differently and everyone has their own process to intake work which makes for a frustrating experience trying to interact with other teams. I will say with a company with such great overall culture, internally there is definitely a lack of willingness to help other teams.

Adam Blitzer was a great leader before and after he sold Pardot to Salesforce. The commissions paid monthly were good, employee discounts with the likes of Apple, movie vouchers, free drinks, fruit and snacks and healthcare benefits for you and your family especially in those unexpected incidents is just outstanding. The leadership that came from Atlanta was very charismatic. I recall times when the VO Sales would jump on a call with a prospect at the 11th hour remotely at the oddest time to help regional teams. Who does that? It’s things this you will always remember. In terms of people, when you find a core group of individuals whom you trust and can lean of for advise and support, it goes a really long way in otherwise a very demanding role","Don’t get all too bubbly with what you see in public about this company with their philanthropic model of giving back and rising stocks because behind closed doors it has to be one of the worst experiences as a sales professional. 1. I don’t think SF thought about the Exact Target and Pardot acquisitions because it created a lot of issues such as internal conflict between Exact Target and Pardot reps over the right solution for an interested customer, 2. Salesforce Account Execs having to put quota relief size over the right solution and with Pardot the smaller investment price tag over its Exact Target meant you would lose out pretty much all of the time. 3. The quotas in the upper customer segments were not aligned to the sales cycles and instead geared towards the SMB segments. 4. Little empathy from the local leadership who were well aware of these challenges and instead ignore the issue as the revenue seemed to be the only concern. There is a reason why there is a high churn  it nobody there seems to care. Was once commented that the sales recruitment process is like an “assembly-based manufacturing plant” in that reps go out as much as they go in and that at the end of the day “nobody cares”"

When an associate isn't a good fit for a role or team based on how biased they feel in a group of ""bros"" (manager included), there needs to be a better avenue for letting said associate explore other opportunities within the organization instead of immediately being fired without a good reason."
6766,Salesforce,Do not join the Salesforce Support  or CSG team,2018-09-04,3.0,CRM Support Success Agent Tier-2,"- Great pay.
- Excellent benefits.","1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool.

2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift.

NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work.

3.  They do not have enough  ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect  Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you.

4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent.

5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to  reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 

6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life.

7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. 

I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings  who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"".  They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee).
So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone.

8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy.  Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India.

Comp and Benefits are ok / comparable with others in the Cloud Industry","Salesforce software not as great as the company leadership thinks it is and recent product integrations have made some of the product suite confusing and unnecessarily complicated  - IMV there is significant potential for an innovative start-up to steal large chunks of their customer base;

Recent revenue growth appears to be mostly based on milking existing customers - not a lot of market share left to acquire - future growth will need to come from moving into new lines of business through more acquisitions. This in turn will lead to continued and increasing integration challenges and internal company friction;

Biggest internal issue I see is that the 'Ohana' culture is leading to employees being too comfortable in their way of doing things and not striving enough for improvement. Combined with this, many managers have lulled themselves into following simplistic metrics and KPIs without understanding the underlying basis for the measurements, nor whether or not they are actually fit for purpose. Arising from this cultural laziness, leadership simply do not have the courage to challenge the status quo and drive the changes needed to improve the company's performance.

The technology teams also need to do a better job dealing with the technical debt accumulated from acquiring companies whose technology stack was thrown together with little or no design review"

I’d honestly love know who they are interviewing and how Salesforce is winning “best company to work for” because it’s definitely not the sales team. Quotas are completely impossible to hit. I had a 1.1 million dollar quota for a territory that made $200,000 TOTAL the year before. You tell me how that adds up?! On top of that, I was putting in 11-12 hour work days (which is encouraged, might I add) and only making 3% commission on every deal I closed even though I grew my little territory over 80%. You make no money here, you are not compensated fairly and when brought up to management they sweep it under the rug and deflect. Management and leadership plays favorites and gives larger,
More tech savvy territories to AEs who are not skilled but rather, who they party with. Yet we all have the same quotas (unless you actually have a lower quota bc you’re a favorite too)."

Frequent sponsored lunches.
Regarding others reviews’ mentions of automation, they are addressing that. They’ve hired some people to work on that primarily.","On-boarding is lengthy and deadlines for training are a bit tight, reducing how much you’ll retain.
Duplicate topics and content in the new-hire training (trailhead).
System sprawl. Many different systems, apps, are in use, probably at least partly due to acquisitions.

6886,Salesforce,6 Months Review,2018-07-30,5.0,Senior Director Sales Strategy & Business Operations,Amazing culture. Incredible innovation due to our growth strategy. Top leader in the industry.,Sometimes lack of resources and basic infrastructure / processes.
6887,Salesforce,Heroku,2018-07-30,5.0,Principal Member of Technical Staff,"Heroku has had its ups and downs over the last few years as it has become more integrated with the larger Salesforce org, but it still feels staffed by the best minds in the business, and I love the product that we make. Salesforce itself has all the pros and cons of a large org, complete with hawaiian culture kool-aid and large-org inertia, but on the whole it feels like Benioff puts his money where his mouth is on societal issues, in a way that few corporate titans do. They're generous when it comes to family and benefits and have a corporate culture of giving.

Inside Heroku, we are still a little bit inside our purple-tinted bubble. On balance it feels like the engineers, junior to senior, are a standard deviation or two above the median. The problems we solve are difficult and satisfying. The business is large and the opportunity remains even larger. It feels miraculous that we operate a product at such crazy scale with so few people, and speaks to our expertise in building scalable, automated things.","These are more Heroku issues than Salesforce issues.

We were (and still are) strapped for headcount over many years. This leads to serious team health issues and burnout. Exec is keenly aware of the issue and taking steps to fix it, but it should never have gotten this bad.

At the moment, our product org is also sorely understaffed following turnover and departures, which means that many engineering teams don't have anyone to help them make sound product choices. We get by, but the product roles are critical, and the product managers we have are spread way too thin. As above, our exec team is aware of the problem and trying to hire as fast as they can.

These are short- to medium-term issues. I believe they'll get worked out and we'll have smoother sailing in a few months.

Longer term, my larger concern is complacency. I don't know if Heroku/Salesforce has the gumption to make the big bets to really grow our business and remain relevant for the next epoch. For the last decade we've made it drastically simpler to run compute workloads in the cloud, and it's built a large and successful business.

Good Salary and benefits","This is one of the most ridiculous team that you can see. This is one team that acts completely against the company’s core values. Leadership team is new and they want to impress the team in US and so they drive useless initiatives just for the sake of it without thinking about the current problems that the team is facing. Numbers driven mindset who doesn’t want to hear the problems at all. Call for a meeting and only they will talk. No time for them to listen to the problem on the ground. They think they are absolutely right and they can drive things like how they have done that from their past companies. All actions are numbers driven and more consultant company type execution (authoritative) so as to get the results. They need to understand it's not Wipro, Infosys, HCL or even Deloitte. 
Nobody can speak up freely. If someone talks then they will hold the vengence against them and show that during promotions/salary hikes. Half frontline managers coming from similar experience will go behind the VP/Directors to get their needs fulfilled. Couple of the managers will jump on to other team’s business, pretend as if they are all over the place but in reality trying to show-off. They have hardly 6-7 years overall experience and show-off as if they are 15+ years experienced. Regardless the upper management wants only that type of front line managers who would just nod their heads, sweet talks and tell yes to all they say. The upper management will even promote such inexperienced people who doesn't really deserve or doesn't even fit to be in the team. Bad working attitude and thinks he is the superstar of the whole support team. 
They will call floor meeting and say promotions is only merit based but have special reservation only for people. All the merit system is all brainwash and every time they change their own words, no honor in that. If you want promotion/hike then you need to run behind them like a dog and loose your self-respect. 
Hardly there are few managers who have concern for the teams and have the guts to stand up against these immature leaders. For those one or two managers they would have tough time thereafter and eventually they will also change or quit. All talks that they talk about Company culture are only virtual. These managers with service industry mindset driving this like a call centre and don’t care of people or their feelings. 
If you are just looking for some good money and care less of your self-respect then go ahead and join. Ask for the shift and if its night shift then don’t join. Night shift has the worse management team, politics and groupism at all levels. 
In short, good company being spoiled by some upper management from these tier2/3 companies who has no understanding of Salesforce business nor has interest to do some good except for themselves."

Excellent support, true respect for the individual and a well thought out point of view.  Salesforce is generally viewed as a strategic partner by our customers.  Huge growth",With growth comes challenges - Core teams can be somewhat myopic at times when looking outside the more typical applications and customer pain.  The path to competence can be painful - not because the documentation isn't there - but because there is so much to learn and more is available daily.  I can see that real competence will develop closer to a year (or more) out.  You have to have the intestinal fortitude to get through that.

6994,Salesforce,Salesforce: A Dream Company & Demo Engineering: A Dream Team!,2018-06-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salesforce is truly a great place to work and cares a lot about the welfare of its employees. I am currently working at Salesforce in a team of amazingly talented individuals and I am very happy in my current role. 
However, I am writing this review to shed light on my previous team which has had a big role in my success today but which unfortunately is getting a lot of flak here all of a sudden: The Demo Engineering team in India. This is the team which has seen a lot of successful transitions into different roles/career options within the organization and I want to use this platform to share my experience during my tenure as a Demo Engineer for the benefit of this community.
-	Salesforce lives by its values of trust and transparency. As a Demo Engineer, I always knew what the other Demo Engineers(DEs) across the globe are working on through our company-wide communication channel called Chatter. It is a great platform to collaborate on projects together irrespective of which part of the globe one belonged to. On the flip-side, people lose bragging rights to how insanely talented they are if that’s not evident from your activities and achievements on Chatter! Consequently(and fortunately) buttering your way to the top doesn’t work as the leadership at every level right up to the top can actually see everyone’s performance and make decisions on promotions and perks accordingly.
-	Salesforce is truly an 'equal-opportunity provider'. As a senior DE in India, I was responsible for screening candidates technically and the tenet for that had always been 'talent-first'. Never had I ever witnessed situations where candidates were discriminated against based on culture, religion, ethnicity, gender, race or anything else for that matter! It’s no wonder that if you walk into the Demo Engineering bay in Salesforce India, you can see people from almost all parts of India, speaking different languages, following diverse religions, following different customs and ways of life working together. Also, it’s one of the few teams which has a healthy male:female ratio. People who are used to forming groups and working in silos might find it difficult in this team.
-	Life of a DE involves thriving on a very challenging work environment where the ability to learn and adapt to new technologies and product features is a crucial skill. Fortunately we had a lot of knowledge sharing sessions within the team and across teams so that our learning and product awareness never went out-of-style. While I agree it can be intimidating to people who prefer the learn-once-work-on-it-till-you-retire style, for most of us DEs, it used to the driving factor which kept us grounded and hungry for more.
-	The best part of being a DE isn’t just the challenging work but also the many opportunities that one gets to grow as an individual and potentially as a future leader. We had many initiatives running in the team in the form of 'Champion Roles'. We could be a champion for communication skills for the team or one could take up the role of championing CSR activities for the team. We had started with a few champion roles back in the day but now I see that they have grown and there is even a Wellness Champion who is in charge of ensuring overall wellness of the team and conducting wellness activities every week! These roles and responsibilities could be perceived as burdens/additional work/torture or as a means of preparing oneself for bigger responsibilities in life and in career. The outlook of how one perceives these opportunities matter.
-	Being a global team, it’s needless to say that effective communication is supremely important. While we can endlessly debate on how English is not our native language and hence we should not be expected to be fluent in English; last time I checked, Java or Python or C++ weren’t anyone’s native language but some of us still manage to talk to computers in those languages efficiently! Fortunately Salesforce DE leadership takes it on itself to up-skill the team on communication skills by external instructor led training classes. True, there are assignments to go with it but then we can either crib about how assignments make our life tough and how the DE India leadership is cruel or feel happy to be able to skill up at company’s cost and make the most out of this opportunity. I preferred the latter and am reaping the benefits of those classes till this day.
-	The official time to report for work in DE India is 9am(there is a business need and reason behind it) but in reality most of the team is in only by 9:30am. While we are quick to point out how our western counterparts leave work early, we fail to consider that they start work way before us in the mornings. 
-	Work from homes & leaves are granted on a per-case basis and I never had to fight for them. In fact, I have witnessed events where the leadership have sent people home and asked them to go on vacations when they have been working too long without taking leaves. 
I feel fortunate to have started my career as a DE, hopefully others will too :)",It's a dream company to work in. No cons that I can think of!

7000,Salesforce,Account Executive,2018-06-25,1.0,Account Manager,Good staff benefits and days off for volunteer work.,Unrealistic sales targets and only 30% of very experienced Account Executives actually make commission. High turnover of sales people due to this. Very junior inside sales team (BDRs) to help you prospect and drive customer facing activities.

4. All managers they will bring their brothers and relatives as employees even though they do not know ABC of Salesforce.
5. Managers will conduct the daily meeting with zero outcome and useless talks."
7004,Salesforce,Doing Well by Doing Good,2018-06-23,5.0,Lead Technical Writer,"Woven into the culture of Salesforce is both the strong desire to make the world a better place and the enabling of each employee to do exactly that. Volunteer time isn't a once-a-year event; it's seven full days of paid volunteer time every fiscal year.

Colleagues (at least within my rather large extended team) are incredibly helpful. At least part of the reason is that we're encouraged to work cross-group, avoiding the ""silo"" effect.

Salesforce invests heavily in maintaining its distinct culture as it grows rapidly.","Not working at the corporate headquarters has the same disadvantages as at any other company, although multiple channels of communication and a strong commitment to transparency definitely help.

V2MOM process results in clear communication of expectations from management, as well as a chance to collaborate with your manager on your own career growth. Good comp, and the company is doing very well so RSU/ESPP is currently quite lucrative.","Software stack is a bit long in tooth; that's what happens when a company is successful for a long time! You will have smart and capable co-workers, but to be honest the standards are a bit lower than the very top tech companies (FANG et al), and so is the comp (its good, but some places pay even better). Stock plan isn't as generous as some other companies- no annual refresh; if you do a top-notch job you might get some refreshers every 2 years or so but it's not a given."

-They will tell people to bring expensive gifts and don't return the money.
- Director firstly takes people who are not good in english and then insults them in public 
- Time schedule is 9-6 where reaching on 9 is compulsory but they try to make you work at late night/ Salesforce gives time to work for NGO  but director plans it in a way that its on weekend to ruin your weekend.
- HR (Hyderabad and Bangalore) is his friend so no complain can goes beyond these people.
- They harassed people way too much (insulting in front of everyone, pressurized for exams, Community work, attending trainings, making PPT for director/managers work, etc all together.
- Director has divided his task to all team members and watches videos in office
- Director and manager with his HR friends are always out for lunch (which I feel was our team's budget) and take us out once or twice to a really cheap place, infact we are not allowed to go out for lunch because according to director it is waste of time.
- If you are away from your desk for more than 15 min, you will get messages and calls asking where are you and come back soon.
-Get leaves approved by director is such a pain, he converts your sick leave into annual.
- Recently they started dutching money everyweekend and take people for pubbing where they drink alot and half of the team doesn't drink, so they drink from employees money
-If you think you can get transfer within salesforce to another team, it will take you minimum 2 years and only if you can flatter the Director by giving details of employees which he can use against each of the member of the team when he wants to, come by 9 to office, do his PPT, keep notes of everybody's time, and all demoralizing stuff only then transfer can start.
There are so many things, in short Director is psycho and wants to control everything, he shows things differently to Tod(manipulates content)."

Absolutely amazing experience from the interview process, hiring, trainings/enablements and the list goes on. Salesforce is a place where they, hands-down, take care of their employees and customers. I'm shocked at how well they go above and beyond for their employees and feel grateful to be at such a great company!  Coming from smaller start-up types of companies, I was worried that moving to a huge company would be difficult and I'd feel like a robot BUT Salesforce has a similar feel to a start-up, placing you in smaller teams of people that you work alongside.","Being a remote employee I wish we had dedicated monthly times to take trips to work/meet with your team!

3. Very flexible working style and support work-life balance.

4. Competitive pay with amazing benefits and perks. My favorites are wellness and education reimbursement.

5. Work quality is good, got to work on some really cool products. 

6. They encourage you to control your own career in fact you can transfer to other teams for an opportunity if you fit the bill.

7. The V2MOM process is their USP, I was surprised to see the leadership is living and breathing it and use it to bring alignment across teams.

8. They encourage employee well being, provide food, liberal leave policy includes paternal leave policy.","1. Poor onboarding of new employees. Esp. if you are part of a team that doesn't have a presence in Hyderabad or your Boss sits in a different office.

2. The recruitment team is not friendly/professional during the hiring process. The hiring process took almost 10 weeks and  I had to call at least 10 - 15 times to remind them to release the offer (even the hiring manager confirmed I have been hired)

3.  Information overflow (very poor signal to noise ratio). Sometimes you will be amazed at so many emails/chatter flying around you and you don't know what to do abou it.

4. The Employee Success Team (HR) needs to pull their socks up. As a new employee, I had faced several problems in the early days.  I asked for help, but they were never there. It felt they just don't care."

I was there for 3 Fiscal Years and had my territory reduced by 50% and my quota rise by 50% every year. The 3rd time my patch became too small to hit the high quota. Sales mgmt would rather have 10 reps make 60% than 6 reps make 100%. Work-Life balance is tough too. Pressure for growth  is massive on RVPs so it rolls down hill.

A lot of comparison between the team members which demoralise you every day.
No technical manager/leader/boss in India.
Flattery always works like a charm with the leaders.
Team do not follow ""no gift policy"". Leaders of this team love to take expensive gifts from the team members. You can enjoy lunch for hours and hours if you are with mangers of this team.
Very strict rules for office timing (9:30 you reach office or you better be prepared for the day). Though this rule is not applicable for leaders of this team.
Mangers/Leaders put lot of pressure to get 5 out of 5 star from the clients you are working with.
You will learn the high politics in very early age of career"
7083,Salesforce,Ohana... with limitations,2018-05-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Very fast paced company. A lot is happening. Positive spirit. Customer-oriented (at least more than other software vendors).,"Above and beyond the other ratings here, there's one thing to know for your first year at Salesforce: sick leave is not covered!
If you get sick during your first year, you're simply not paid. Usually, you get covered by an insurance. But the Salesforce insurance starts after... 3 months the first year.
As an example, if you have a domestic accident and have to recover for 1 month, you won't get paid for that month unless you've been at Salesforce for 12 months or more.

Not a show stopper, but really disappointing: I wish I knew before joining. Not really in the ""Ohana"" spirit in my opinion..."

Lots of decent perks, good pay (I'm not in the bay area, so can't speak for there), and reasonable workloads.","Working on the core Salesforce product can be a huge pain and giant time sink.  They've let it go way too long to address the numerous issues that make developing on it a pain.  The company also has a bad habit of Not Invented Here Syndrome, so instead of using something like React for our UI we're writing our own component framework.

- Coworkers are among the most friendly, genuine, inclusive people I've met in my life
- Comfortable job: you can be complacent and clock in / out for a very long time without any repercussions","- Work environment is highly politicized in projects, promotions, and basically anything you do
- Not everyone is pulling their own weight
- Very little accountability in the organization. The company did away with formal performance reviews a few years ago. There is a culture of praise here, so constructive feedback is rarely given
- Roles and teams are incredibly silo'd now. This is not the place to be if you're looking to grow and develop your career in a multitude of different ways
- Easy to get lost in the sea of things: the company has grown way too large in recent years 
- Growth and progression are slow. Career development is non-existent if you remain in your current position. Since there are so many employees now, each job that an employee has is incredibly specific, so if you want a change of pace, you'd have to change out of your role entirely

Also, for what it's worth, I strongly believe that Salesforce actively reaches out to news outlets and pays to get on those ""Best Employer"" lists that come out yearly. I wouldn't be surprised if they had people in HR write numerous positive reviews to artificially inflate the Glassdoor scores."

High energy environment.","""Ohana"" is a myth when it comes to management: My manager wasn't there to mentor, or support me. I questioned the rationale of a SVP's sales strategy and requests of me though I performed them nonetheless. In the end, I was proven correct. The client refused to entertain the SVP's strategy and ultimately the SVP was reassigned. And despite the overwhelming backing of a nearly all of the stakeholders I supported, management sided with the SVP.
Toxic sales culture and unrealistic quotas and little possibility of attainment: My quota went up over 350% in year 2 with fewer products to sell, less delivery capability, and virtually the same group of clients. Only 1 member of the team exceeded quota. Despite more than doubling my performance YoY, being one of the highest producers on my team and in the top for my region, that wasn't good enough.
Client travel was eliminated due to expense constraints, yet we were expected to build the pipeline and identify new sales opportunities as if we are selling simple commodity products.
No work-life balance, it is a fallacy: I was berated and backstabbed for being on PTO, even though I spent hours each vacation day trying to stay on top of things. It wasn't enough. Evenings and weekends are spent on administrative tasks, which need to get done, but are over-scrutinized. Perfection is the only acceptable performance when it comes to administrative tasks.
Mentoring/Performance reviews: Beware the ""whisper"" network. Lots of backstabbing, but few will go on the record and provide constructive feedback. I had lots of positive reviews and no negative reviews in the ""Feedback"" system. Numerous @mentions which praised the performance of me and my colleagues.

7110,Salesforce,Hybrid Engineering is causing chaos,2018-05-11,3.0,Software Engineer,Great company culture. Good work life balance. Smart developers with good problem solving skills. Great career growth opportunities. Planning of work is better than most other companies that I have come across.,"Hybrid Engineering has pros and cons. However, in Indy, the strategy for hybrid transition is causing a significant loss in engineering productivity.

First,
 Pros: 
1.) Hybrid engineering has brought more focus on using contemporary tools for automated testing. 
2.) This helps in improving system reliability and make developers better at their jobs since testing is not considered an afterthought anymore. 
3.) Huge investment in automated testing upfront is a good overall strategy that will help in system scalability and reduce buggy software releases.

Cons:
1.) The idea for depending more on automated testing than on manual testing has translated into demanding all manual / semi manual qa testers to learn how to code.
2.) This is the strategy that has not panned out at all. While, the self help tools like online courses, mentoring resources and in-team guidance have been a proactive ongoing effort, this approach is taking massive hits on productivity for developers as well as for testers all around.
3.) You can find developers on any given day spending quite a bit of time (hours at times) going over basic step by step process  (over and over again) with the testers to resolve minority non-mission critical bugs.
4.) Testers, especially who are not from a programming background / havent coded in a while, are overwhelmed and  stressed out about the tickets they have to complete each sprint.
5.) For a company that champions engineering productivity and no interruption time for developers, developers are spending less time on quality features/innovative/disruptive work and more time getting bogged down by the process+manual testing+ incremental work . Dont get me wrong, the notion of ohana is embedded deep in the organization and engineers are glad to help their peers anytime. However,  this is a massive hit on productivity."

7116,Salesforce,Incredible place to work,2018-05-07,4.0,Senior Software Developer,"There's a lot of  reasons to work for Salesforce. The people and culture are amazing, everyone is motivated and competent at what they do. The pay and benefits are also top notch and very competitive.","As a developer, the career ladder is rather unattractive. It doesn't really feel like there's much that distinguishes people with the various titles, and in many cases it seems titles just reflect time with the company as oppose to meeting the ""requirements"" outlined in the descriptions of said titles. That said, there's not much emphasis placed on titles and I've never noticed any lack of respect between those in different places in the career ladder."

If you happen to become apart of one of these products and teams, it's extremely difficult to get out of and Salesforce takes years to fire individuals that desperately need to be removed from the company. Management says that their hands are tied with Employee Success and Employee Success drags their feet, causing teams and clients to suffer dramatically. The Marketing cloud is notorious for this behavior and has an internal reputation from Salesforce Core to not hire individuals that come from the Marketing Cloud due to the individuals that do not represent the company and the Marketing Cloud well."

Know that before signing up."
7125,Salesforce,I'm Honored to Be Part of This Company,2018-05-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's true, I feel honored to be a part of Salesforce. Who wouldn't want to be part of the #1 place to work? The things you hear in the media about Salesforce's culture are true. Working for a company that names Trust and Equality as 2 of their core values is a truly great experience.  They treat their employees very well, and give back to the communities they are in.  A great experience so far! Hope I have the honor for many years to come.","As a member of a smaller satellite office, you feel a little left out of the Ohana culture that you hear about at HQ and some of the larger hubs."
7126,Salesforce,Constantly Winning 'Best Place to Work' Awards for a Reason,2018-05-04,5.0,Systems Engineer,"Salesforce is overwhelmingly preoccupied with the company's Ohana culture (Hawaiian for 'family'). A big part of that is making everyone feel welcome, respected, and valued. A cynical friend pointed out this serves the company's self-interest, because happy employees are more productive and less likely to want to leave the company. That may be true, but it's a good situation when the extent of your cynicism is that your employers might only be keeping you happy because it's good for business.

The perks would shock anyone who's not familiar with the stories about what Silicon Valley tech companies offer their employees. Google and Facebook have often gotten press for things they offer to their employees. Salesforce's main HQ is in there competing with them for talent and so we offer many of the same or similar things. Salesforce brings many of those perks to our other offices as well.

Personally, the biggest selling point for me is Salesforce's commitment to the communities we are in. I have a lot of pride for the things we do in the community, and that Salesforce not only condones but actively supports and encourages volunteering in pretty much any cause that resonates with you.","There's a lot of unspoken social pressure to join in the culture. Like a lot of computer people I'm very introverted naturally, so sometimes it can be exhausting.

There's a lot of events. Between holidays, company-sponsored volunteer opportunities, employee resource groups, celebrating every milestone, or any thinly veiled excuse for people to socialize and have catered food and swag galore, there are an overwhelming number of distractions available that can sometimes make it hard to focus. There's definitely a need for some self-discipline involved in not saying yes to *everything* so you can get some work done."

Salary is good, but the rest of the benefits are weak versus other big software companies.
On-boarding for new hires (if no direct experience in selling CRM/Salesforce) is very challenging, steep learning curve."

The company tries to encourage gender equality and diversify the workforce. There's a lot of talk about Ohana (Hawaiian for family). 
Great benefits.","So, a lot of the gender equality and Ohana talk I mentioned earlier is just talk. It's marketing so that people want to work here. I haven't seen or felt any difference in Gender Bias. My skip level has taken internal training yet hasn't made any progress towards adjusting his attitude towards women.

Promotions are highly political and not clear.
They rarely promote from within and happy to place a friend on a top position.
Standard salary early rise is 3%.

There is a Term Ohana seems like HYD management cannot even adapt to it, and its a SHAME they they lie saying we follow OHANA.

Being a parent company management is absolutely scared of Management from centers outside of india.

Favoritism and cliques are just another part of day-to-day life here and it makes it hard to not be concerned about how these factors may impact your hard work as well as your ability to be fairly promoted.

Also the fact that the entire branding of the company has basically appropriated Hawaiian culture is beyond problematic.

7192,Salesforce,Excellent company with visionary executive leaders but lack of RSU refresh is substandard in the industry.,2018-03-31,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Executive leadership is amazing. Pursuit of improving the community is real. Smart employees. Fast growing company. Opportunities to continue to learn. Good base salary.,Too many VPs are more interested is proving they are smarter than each other in their pursuit of the next promotion prevents best solution and breeds blame shifting. Lack of annual RSU refresh is not competitive with other companies.
7193,Salesforce,Senior Quality Assurance Manager,2018-03-31,5.0,,Fast moving customer centered company. Structured for the Rapid development process that drives for continuous deployment. Great benefits with a growing stock grant program,The possibility of job burnout is high with long hours and high stress. There is a lot of writing for MBR and QBR documents. Difficulty in getting to the next level
7194,Salesforce,Too much work,2018-03-30,4.0,Product Manager,Awesome company. Lots of smart people.,Wayy political. Expects you to work super hard. No clear career path.

7201,Salesforce,Best company I’ve worked for!,2018-03-28,5.0,Senior Solution Engineer,"- As a Solution Engineer, pay is excellent.  Bonuses/commissions are for the most part guaranteed especially starting with FY19.  Seniors and below get overtime!
- 401k match up to $5k
- Charity Donation match up to $5k
- Fairly priced health insurance with premium options included for dental and eye 
- 13 holidays a year (includes 4 floating)!
- 7 days of Volunteer Time Off
- 100 a month for health and fitness subsidy
- lots of free swag and giveaway gifts

Salesforce is a great corporate citizen with their 1-1-1 pledge.  They really do care about helping the community and equality for all.  I’m truly proud to work for a great company.

Being an SE out of San Francisco, we get the perks of having HQ with the amazing building amenities, cafes, snacks, fitness classes, access to product teams and leadership, technology kiosks, and conferences and marketing events such as Dreamforce, TrailheaDX, summits, and kickoffs.  Although it may vary by team when being out of HQ, we still get the flexibility to work remotely which is nice since the SE role can be very demanding.  

The role continues to challenge me and provide tremendous growth opportunities.  In this role I get opportunities to continue to learn new products almost every six months and get certified, improve my public speaking skills, and network with executives from all the customers I work with.  I get the perks of traveling (and also get paid for it since I’m hourly) which is different than consulting travel because it’s 2-3 trips a month usually for 1-3 days and mostly localized to the west coast.","- As an SE, we’re often times spread very thin.  In addition to pre-sales, we provide booth duty (marketing) and enablement (post sales) support.  This leaves us no time to get the real work done, so we use nights and weekends to build and solution.
- Marketing is usually 6 months - 1 year ahead of the products themselves.
- Our customers love Salesforce but I spend most of my time education customers because they are confused on the products we offer.  Putting Einstein and Lightning in front of every product confuses the crap out of everyone including internal employees 
- 3 weeks vacation for non exempt employees could be better
- I often find that in order to use my VTO, I’m working overtime, because my work still needs to get done even if I’m doing volunteer work 
- Way too many all hands meetings. 
- Administrative overhead in general is extremely time consuming:  time and expense reporting, activities entry, DCs, and administrative quip docs.
- Turnover with our AE counterparts can impede on our ability to sell"

The place is under constant change and sometimes feels like there is no rhyme or reason and ignorance of the obvious; Although the company is 19 years old there still lacks a lot of process and procedure. It often feels like our CEO and some of our senior leadership they are more interested in politics than what is best for our company.

7294,Salesforce,Security team is just about micro management and politics,2018-02-20,1.0,Security Analyst,"Follow these instructions If you are looking to work in any security team in hyderabad: Ask the interviewer who your manager will be.
1. If the manager is a local person then run away from the job as fast as you can. 
2. If managers are Indian but not local then you can think of joining
3. If managers are from US or another country, then this perfect you should accept the offer
4. Is your job offer in STAR/Soc team then run away run away. This team has already been destroyed by local management","The security team in hyderabad is opposite of everything good you read or hear. All of the values cultures and nice things you read are not applied for this team.  Extreme levels of micro management and politics are here. 
1. salesforce does not record login logout timings but for this team the management wants every bit of employee movement monitored and recorded. you will have to login to system as soon as you come and logout before going. This is only so that management can keep track of your timings. 
2. If you leave office 15 minutes early on any day then next day management will show you your logout time and ask you about it for explanation
3. if you are 15 minutes late to office you will have to inform managers. once you have informed and if your manager is not in office after you reach, you have to inform again that you have reached now
5. local management wanted to install cctv camera to monitor staff but thankfully it didnt happen
6. the whole team is living in FEAR.
7. management will always remind you that you were nobody and now you have got very big salary packages so you must live like slaves
8. the company likes to spend a lot on employee benefits but managers of this team feel they are paying from their own pocket for every benefit so the team can never enjoy the benefits. only benefits you can get are what the company gives by default but you cant get any department budget for anything
9. do you want anything specific for your office use? You cant get it approved. local managers will never approve it. Because they think it is not justified. for any request you make even if it is work related, managers will think it cant be justified (for even small things). They are so scared of approving anything from the department budget that even if you want a needle it will be denied.
10. local managers have a secret v2mom- save the company's money
11. dont expect any type of training to be given to you. Managers cant even think of spending money on your training. also managers have no idea of the different security training or certification available. so if you ask for it you will get a 15 minute explanation on why you should not do it. 
12. local managers are completely non-technical. they have no idea what security is. they will review your work and highlight problems in it even without knowledge.
Most important of all: This Team in security has become an indian BPO. You will have to work like bpo employee. Reason why this happened- local managers hired for this team are from bpo companies

Now comes the politics-
1. Trust is a big value in salesforce but not in this team.
2. you cant trust your colleagues and team mates because managers have inserted their moles into the team to spy
3. local management rejected all good and highly skilled candidates in interviews. those candidates had passed all technical rounds but when it came to local management round, they got rejected
4. reason to do so was because local management wanted their own people in the team who could support their politics
5. talk to any of your friend working in bpo and ask them about politics and culture in their company. what you hear will be the exact same thing you see in this team.
6. you cant complaint at all. if you complain about anything to upper management, local managers come to know who complained and next day itself they will start giving you lessons.
7. in any meeting every employee will be constantly be monitored and stared by managers. they try to find out who is thinking what. if you dont like anything in a meeting then you will have to keep your face and expressions normal because otherwise managers  will notice you dont like something and will scold you for that. you will always have to be happy with their decisions. if your face is angry then immediately managers will know you are the bad one and they will guess it is you who complained about them if there was any recent complaint."

Bonus, stock options (both RSUs and ESPP), generous 401k policy, plenty of PTO, 3 months of paternal leave (even more for mothers), sit/stand desks, free snacks / drinks, free food pretty often
- Work/life balance is not perfect but a big step above other companies I have worked for. Your free time is for the most part respected (emergencies non-withstanding) and in my experience no one feels judged for using their PTO or VTO. 
- Many companies talk the talk in terms of diversity, but Salesforce walks the walk. They famously fought discriminatory laws in Indianapolis and unilaterally gave raises to ensure female employees were paid at the same rate as their male counterparts (without forcing pay cuts on anyone). They also strive to have a diverse board of directors, though I think this still needs work.
- All full-time employees receive 7 paid days off (in addition to normal PTO) to pursue volunteer opportunities - and, again, this is actively encouraged.
- Most managers do not have a ton of direct reports, meaning you can build a good relationship with your manager.
- Career changes are not only permitted but encouraged. Some areas of the company have annual job fairs for lateral moves if you are not happy. In my case, my manager started to talk with me about where I want my career to go before I had even started to consider it. 
- Right now, great job security as the company is growing like crazy - which is great if you're used to consulting work.","- Most of the Pros are company-wide things, but your experience may vary depending on where you work. It is a large company and different areas do things differently.
- A ton of middle management and time spent in meetings. 
- While it is great to be a part of a global company, there are challenges involved in working at a remote location (i.e. not in San Francisco). We are often not a priority when SF is involved, so factoring in the time difference, you can be waiting day(s) to get issues resolved.
- As with many companies of this size, a lot of ""hurry up and wait."" Get your work done according to a deadline, but watch it sit due to bureaucracy or changing priorities.
- Salesforce isn't immune to a lot of the issues that plague software engineers everywhere. Requirements changing after work has already started, stakeholders not appreciating the complexities of the work, etc."

- Politics

- My experience as a whole and expectations has been sadly the biggest disappointment of my career. Maybe because I didn’t realize this company is all smoke and mirrors.

- Management can make or break the experience. In my case, my manager single handily destroyed my actual dream job and crushed my career dreams at Salesforce that I was so passionate about. 

- The endless micro-management and lack of TRUST

- My contributions to the team and to our customers is overlooked and undervalued.  It does not matter how much you contribute or knowledgeable of the platform to make customers happy you are, it will not be valued unless you suck up to management. 

- The middle management I have interacted with is useless. They only show up to collect a paycheck.

- Feed back app is used to gauge employee and manager. Although if you give management actual feedback via app or survey with anything negative, you will receive retaliation.

7354,Salesforce,Designers can do more meaningful work elsewhere,2018-01-25,2.0,Product Designer,"Core benefits are good. Healthcare options seem competitive and are always looking to make better. The people you meet won’t all be so difficult. You’ll get the opportunity to volunteer and do some real good for someone else. 

I noticed if you have a family or are looking to start one, that the work life balance is probably your best benefit. However, such a good balance can often times appear to make individuals seem lazy and have little to no motivation to work quickly. That in turn has a trickle down effect to the rest of the teams who want to work quickly and build product.","I joined a smaller company Salesforce owned that was eventually swallowed whole by the larger Salesforce company, and we were fully integrated into one of the major clouds. Things were very pleasant and work was interesting before the roll over into Salesforce. However, once my team joined the larger company, is when things took a turn unfortunately.  

I believe things took a turn because Salesforce is built on top down management. The bigger the title the bigger the voice you’ll have. People use their title as weight when making decisions. The overall design culture is perceived as a second thought to a lot of teams. Due in part that your engineers can and will make decisions for you based on seniority. Not all, but most teams have a hard time getting their engineers to innovate and work with them. This behavior also comes from the previously mentioned work life balance. Anything that looks like it may take an extra hour, will fall off your design quickly. 

Be carful of Kool-aid drinking. They use the term “Ohana”, family in Hawaiian culture (which is also cultural appropriation) to describe their own internal company culture. The management team uses this type of thinking to determine if your a team player or not. The type of “family” culture they perpetuate creates a lot of passive aggressive behavior. Add the behavioral issues onto the top down management, and you have a recipe for ladder climbing, favoritism, yes men, and brown nosing. The executive running the design on my cloud showed incredible bias and fueled this behavior. As well as some very questionable hiring and promotional practices. I felt their behavior was highly unethical, and they felt no remorse for their actions.

The product you build at Salesforce will only ship 3 times a year. That’s if it ships at all. The pace is incredibly slow moving. I can not stress that enough. Changing an icon can literally take 9 months. This can make it hard to retain the talent that comes from a start up environment. Which Salesforce is in desperate need of. 

The salary is adequate at best for most designers. I found out later that I actually made much more coming from a different company and rolling into Salesforce. RSU’s are some of the lowest you’ll be awarded in the tech industry for a company this size. Most director level people get any meaningful stock refresher. Like I mentioned, top down management. I negotiated cash over RSU’s (which made my offer compelling). 

While a lot of what I wrote can seems very negative, not everyone I had the chance to work with made me feel this way. I did have the opportunity to meet “some” talented designers and engineers. I had the opportunity to volunteer and help others. The work I was doing at the time had impact up to certain point and I did learn a thing or two while at Salesforce.


TL;DR:
Top down management creates passive aggressive behavior.
Slow moving development time, Salesforce only ships 3 times a year. 
Design is a second thought for most teams (but not all). 
Base salary is average, not competitive. 
RSU’s for a company this size are some of the worst in the industry."

General managerial inconsistency and poor and undefined career development
Subjective management with unclear expectations and lack of constructive feedback
Lack of knowledge and account/opportunity strategy from superiors  Unavailability as a resource – poor coaching and lack of involvement with accounts / opportunities 
Complete lack of trust and transparency with direct line management   Inability to coach, mentor and guide effectively – no structure for 1:1 meetings and lack of agenda - Continuous belittlement and criticism despite efforts to improve – general disengagement, lack of proactive coaching resulting in negative retrospective feedback
Lack of fair judgment and unprofessional communication in open forums- topics to be discussed in 1:1 posted openly with a belittling nature 
Unfair and unequal treatment amongst Salesforce employees, specifically at AE level
Internal political nightmare with unjustified promotions
Unequal territories with no realistic probability of quota attainment unless provided multiple territories with high AOV band
Lack of true sentiment for customer success – Many oversold accounts, unhappy customers and forced purchases encompassing a bullying demeanor Lack of true equality in the workplace – Majority of the Southern California hub is Caucasian, where there is a true lack of diversity, where it appears that minorities are hired to meet quotas 
Distraught office culture full of fear and lack of “Ohana” despite how Salesforce portrays itself 
Low compensation compared to fair market value for AE per segment
False claims of “equality” (approximately 65% White, 79% Male at Salesforce) Continuous micro-management with call center mentality for tenured Account Executives

On a final note, there are some extremely judgmental  managers, one specifically who came from the Chicago office. Constant complaining,  throwing people under the bus and tattle tale mentality making it a completely uncomfortable work environment and actually having people who would rather quit than put up with ""it""."

*pay is a joke compared to other large SaaS and tech companies. Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017.  Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic.

*terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress....

Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually  joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day,  they’re your superior.  

Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted  into these roles.

Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value.

If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review.

I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast. If you’re a developer/coder then Salesforce might be a legit landing spot, otherwise look elsewhere."

Other than that I can't think of any anymore,"I don't even know where to begin. Salesforce's 'AMAZING' company culture has proven to be one of the world's greatest LIES. To managers who don't show any interest in motivating their employees and solely act in their own self interest all the time with such blatant transparency that it completely de motivates everyone.

All the departments work at odds to one another and with zero accountability. Billing doesn't care about sales or the customers, international offices fight U.S offices for customers and vice versa and the customer is given the short end of the stick.

Mainly there is such favoritism that goes on where employees are given territories that create so much of their own acv that it goes beyond any sort of fairness. Employees will make 10 times their colleagues that bust their butt and promoted over others that actually have proven to be more strategic, because they were playing a political game the whole time and given a money patch / accounts by management.

Management then DOES NOT CARE about the affect this has on employee or team morale. They get it. They're salesforce. and if one person becomes a little too in need of emotional support or guidance, or goes through a slightly hard time with the constant unfairness - they just throw on a performance plan and push them out the door.

The performance plans are not designed to help people succeed, they are designed to ensure that someone they don't like (regardless of performance) fails. I have watched people crush all their numbers when put on a performance plan - just to see the managers manipulate or create some subtext which show that the employee did in fact NOT hit their goals.

There are a ton of other companies who have way better benefits (fully paid healthcare, catered meals, gyms and free trainers, free muni/bart, etc.). It seems like the only new benefits or upgrades to benefits deal with giving birth or adopting and giving time/resources to new parents. I think it's great they are doing it, but there are a lot of employees who will never use these and don't seem to get anything new or updated."

There are a lot of solution engineers at the company,  and there is now a pretty big logjam for promotions.

Salary and benefits are competitive 
Marc Benioff is an inspirational leader
Commitment to volunteerism is great
Nice facilities","Satellite office has high turnover for Account Executives and RVPs which damages relationships with customers.    

Sales Management is based out of HQ and is out of touch with territory.   They don’t listen to input from local employees.    Company wastes a lot of money flying people from HQ when local teams are perfectly capable of running Sales Cycles without micro management.    

Seasoned sales professionals with 20+ yrs of experience are being told what to do in their territories which DO NOT even remotely resemble HQ territory.    Market is softer in satellite locations yet zero acknowledgement from management, they just churn more reps.   

Sales management creates busy work to generate pipe instead of acknowledging regional market forces and developing strategies for impactful go-to-market.

Core account teams only seem to understand CRM and Service resulting in missed opportunity to sell extended portfolio.     Some are so ignorant on the technology stack they make incorrect recommendations to customers which damages our credibility in the accounts.   

Overlay teams are deliberately excluded, even told by core not to contact customers, which causes significant internal conflict.   Overlays seem to be second class citizens despite Benioff’s vision to expand beyond CRM/Service, and of course -Ohana .    Ohana is for core sales and HQ, not satellite workers.  

Reporting organizational dysfunction to management results in an HR ticket and a dismissal of your concerns.   HR will interview the offenders who will collaborate against the feedback and then you become the problem.   Even if you report a “customer complaint” about sales practices, HR gives lip service about how they aren’t focused on this area.    So much for code of conduct- it’s not worth the  bother to report anything."

- Exposure to tons of different clients/businesses in all kinds of different areas","If you're a Software Engineer looking to learn new technologies, create innovative technical solutions, or grow your career, I cannot stress to you enough to RUN AWAY from any opportunities at Salesforce Indy.

The company culture would have you believe that Security/Trust trumps everything. Development machines are tightly locked down, and access to new technologies requires a multi-level approval process that can take months. While Security teams claim to ""partner"" with engineering teams, they impose security restrictions without any input from engineering and require layers of ""evidence"" as to why a restriction should be lifted (we're talking simple things like installing Docker). I was once told that ""Powershell is banned, access to it is completely forbidden"".

Furthermore, the company claims to be Agile and is anything but. This is typical for large companies with internal software teams, but frankly I expected more from a company like Salesforce. User stores and bugs are tied back to epics that are ""committed"" to specific releases. They require stories that tie back outlining the project from start to finish, and individual stories are broken down further into ""tasks"" that really just lead to a tedious ""check the box"" workflow for most projects. If for some reason the project doesn't make it in the committed epic, prepare to be asked by multiple layers of management as to why it was dropped/delayed.

If you're a developer looking for a 9-5 gig with the best benefits in town and an easy-going atmosphere, this might be for you. If you're a developer that wants to work with newer technologies and create truly innovative solutions to existing problems, look elsewhere. This job will not help you develop a better skillset, it will not help you work with newer tech, and it certainly won't allow you to come anywhere close to creating innovative solutions."

Some small amount of benign questioning will be ""allowed"". If you really challenge the unproductive practices, a swarm of managers and their managers and their managers will put you on ""employee success"" plan. This goes on your HR records. Once it does, you cannot transfer, get promoted, get a letter to attend Business School or get a good reference to go to another company. A multitude of other good things you might have done and your hard work will go down the drain. It makes people suicidal. This culture does not understand  that this job is food on our table. Second, many former Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Microsoft and 5 Agency employees are welcome if they just about have a pulse. Hence, high ranking executives will come one or two days to work; will not have full comprehension of client's current/future stages; treat all engineers as inferior; and publicly chide team members.

Lots of support from marketing and good brand 
There are lots of good sales resources to help you sell - best marketing organization I have ever gotten to partner with...
Sales Engineer staff is generally solid","Mid Market AE’s get 8 total install accounts, only 2-3 of which will actually buy anything, particularly on the west coast  (very small amount of accounts compared to Mid Market territories at other companies).  I’ve seen lots of highly successful AEs come to Salesforce and leave after less then a year after being dealt TERRIBLE territories mostly due to lots of upset oversold customers with lots of shelfware.  Also, lots of poor implementations due to prior AEs not insisting on customers bringing in business partners when they should have because they just wanted to close deals....Many customers who look good on paper aren’t buying anything for these reasons....in many cases hard work has nothing to do with hitting your number - if you don’t have good/satisfied install accounts in your territory (total toss up btw) there is no path to success whatsoever as decent net new logo deals are few and far between (in Mid Market) - the expectation at Salesforce is that you won’t hit your number - you’ve been warned...

Culture is another toss up depending on the RVP - they preach “Ohana” but in lots of  cases it should be “nohana” - be VERY careful if you are looking at a job in one of the the coprime aka overlay AE divisions as
it can be very toxic if your product set isn’t service cloud....be sure to really feel out your managers leadership style before you take one of these roles because there really are some brutally awful RVPs.  If the RVP you are interviewing with is brand new to Salesforce CAUTION

As a company-wide level they promote equal pay, diversity, and equality. The compensation and benefits are outstanding. There is real attention to equality in pay, and I'm really happy to be working for a company that encourages volunteer time.

I highly recommend Salesforce as a company, except for the one group I have deep experience with.","I am only familiar with the Heroku product group, so this may not be a widespread problem, but within the Heroku organization there is very little diversity, and it's getting worse as more of the remaining few non-white-male people leave.

In less than two years, I've seen a pattern of putting women in positions where they have little support to be successful. Almost the entire management chain is male, and there has been no effective leadership in addressing this.

Things change, and this review will become stale, so here is a list of things you might ask about if you interview for a position on the Heroku product:

Ask for the diversity numbers of the team you're interviewing with.
Ask for the diversity numbers for managers across the organization.
Ask your interviewers what their experiences have been on their team with people in under-represented classes.
Ask whether their management is taking any concrete actions to address any lack of diversity."

Perks - Health fund, international visa sponsorship, employee stock program, events
Leadership - Strong
Upward mobility - Plenty of room for promotions which happen regularly in sales
Cross-divisional movement - Sales staff can move into Solution Engineering, Marketing, etc. if they can't handle the grind 
Training - World class training programs and enablement team
Product - Truly the best technology that really works as long as customers take the time, deploy the resources and spend the money to implement it correctly. 
Partner eco-system - Very strong relationships and great collaboration
Office - Location is great in Darling Harbour and they have recently outfitted multiple new floors with our significant growth. Truly an amazing new office space.
Pay - uncapped commission with lots of earning potential
Travel - A lot of opportunity to travel and get in front of customers. Pretty liberal with expense policies. 
Tenure - Lots of people are very bought into this company and its culture. Good to see such a large amount of people with tenure over 3+ years. 
Volunteering - 7 Days per year to volunteer highly encouraged which is great! 
Events - Company throws the best parties and seems to spare no expense. Fun culture (If you are performing)","Monthly targets which can be stressful unless you are overachieving.
Success can be highly determined by your territory and segment. 
With significant growth comes significant headcount increases  which means smaller territories regardless of quotas being raised. 
Salaries seem lower than industry average, although there is no cap on commission so you have the opportunity to make a ton of money if you are in the right patch. 
With all large corporates come lots of politics. Play the game and build your brand early otherwise you will be limited in your opportunities. 
Entering into unchartered waters for many leaders in the business with this massive growth phase hitting $10B+ and seem to be emphasising how important it is to mirror large companies such as Oracle if we want to get to $20B+.

Work is often not distributed fairly. If you are a top performer you will end up with a lot more work with no appreciation. 
Manager doesn't necessarily see how much everyone is doing even it is reported in the system or doesn't have a solution on how to balance it. Poor performers can get their ways around by just talking and can still get promoted."

Of course, it is a fast paced environment which changes quickly and that can be demanding, but it's rewarded greatly and wellness and well-being is a very important component, next to our whole FUN value.

- Acquired a bunch of companies, especially during 2015 - 2016 which made career advancement tough. 
- Constant changes and initiatives being rolled out that makes it challenging to adjust quickly

The following below is a reflection of the team:
- Onboarding experience wasn't that great. I had to figure out how to maneuver around the system by myself often
- There wasn't really a culture on the team. A lot of people kept to themselves which made it hard to build rapport. Integrating members from acquisitions also was a bit awkward as there wasn't any announcement / formal introductions. 
- Difficult to advance and grow within the organization as the company was growing so quickly. 
- The work you put in in terms of recruiting, events, VTO, etc.. can sometimes be overlooked  since the org was so big. You may get lost in the shuffle

-Best practices","My experience at Salesforce is something that still haunts me to this day. It’s been a couple years, so it’s a little easier to talk about, but I try to put it behind me as much as I can.  I may have been too naive in that I thought people genuinely try to treat others with common decency, but it forever changed my trust towards others in the work place. To this day, I still can’t piece together why I was treated the way I was, but I am able to look back and see how I was blackmailed, bullied, and harassed. I will give some background and the events that occurred that ultimately resulted in my departure from Salesforce on my own will. I had been referred by a friend for a role that I was extremely interested in and everything worked out ,which lead to an offer. I continuously brought a positive attitude and made a genuine effort to ramp up quickly and do as much as I could. By midyear, I had a great review resulting in a high bonus percentage and even continued on to earn a spot bonus for my efforts in the following months...then things started changing. I started noticing that one of the directors (whom I’ll refer to as Director#1 from here on) became very short and blunt. I had originally concluded that this was due to a recent move that resulted in a longer commute, but I don’t think that was the case. Shortly after, I found out that the very person who referred me was suddenly now on the same team that I was; odd, but again, I didn’t think anything malicious by this new change. A couple months later, out of nowhere, Director#1 tells me that I am not a good fit and that I am to look for another team or another job as soon as possible.  I was instructed that if I did not do this, I was to be put on a PIP (performance improvemt plan) which would ultimately result in me being fired and that “the Bay Area is small, so I wouldn’t burn any bridges”. I literally thought this was a joke, but after I was then told to go home for the day to think about it, I became incredibly confused. What did I do wrong? What did I not do? After this, the environment was so toxic that it made it hard for me to wake up every morning to come to work having experienced what I experienced having to see this person every day.  Then, one morning, I am pulled into a meeting with my manager who informs me that I had misused company funds and I was highly advised to resign immediately. Luckily, I had saved an email with my managers approval, which basically negated the claim that I misused company funds. I could not believe this was pulled on me; I became visibly upset but also felt incredibly betrayed. By the grace of God, I was able to receive an offer shortly after from a job I had been interviewing for and left. Before my last day, however, I was able to speak with others around the office and was surprised to hear that this treatment wasn’t something new; it was apparently actions that weren’t out of the norm when talking about Director#1. What a terrible experience that I wish upon nobody."

* Focus on equality and giving back.  This was cutting edge and I love how many companies are now adopting this and putting it up front in their message.  
* V2MOM - I've never seen anything like it in my working career of over 20 years and I highly recommend all companies adopt it.  Having visibility into Benioff's V2MOM down thru his direct reports, and aligning the entire company is crazy great.
* My peers are terrific people and I know I can count on them.","I feel the need to share this because I don't believe I was given an honest picture of Salesforce when I was interviewed for my role:

* It is a fast paced, frenetic, competitive workplace.  If you're good with that and you are hungry to be #1, this is your company.
* You need to stay high energy and never take your eye off the ball.  Early on, you need to ""establish your brand"" or you will disappear in the malaise of communication and collaboration."

Sexuality and Gender derogatory comments are accepted and tolerated.,Middle line Management discriminates against women.  Set male counter parts up for success with better accounts and slam dunk opportunities.  Derogatory comments against sexuality and being women is tolerated.  Good Faith complaints do not hold water.   Only a very few percentage of sales account eexecutives actually make their quota and are making accelerators.  Quotas and territories are not consistent and products and messaging in Marketing Cloud have failed year over year.   Employee Success/HR protects Management team.

 - Very little internal personal or professional development. 
 - Each Sales team does their own things (Forecasts/meetings, etc), with very little synergy or combined learning. Which has fostered a very ugly competitive and back-handed culture - with lack of trust a  core problem throughout the UK, especially when dealing with US colleagues.

Culture at Salesforce is truly (and positively) unique in my experience. For the most part leadership and engineering works as a team and are cooperative, friendly, supportive.","After a couple of years you are functionally punished for staying at Salesforce in terms of compensation - it would be easier to make more in the same role elsewhere.

Recent management changes in the Security group have been very negative. Huge amounts of high-ranking leadership brought in from outside the company have had large negative effects on morale and culture within Security.

Most importantly - in the past Security leadership very obviously and effectively lived the value of 'Ohana' that is constantly focused on at Salesforce. It was clear leadership cared about people on the team. That does not seem to be the case anymore.

This has caused many long-time leaders and engineers to leave and that causes more culture shift/drain and the cycle continues.

This problem isn't limited to one group. Unfortunately, there are pockets of the company that don't live up to the positive culture mentioned. These pockets seem to be growing as Salesforce acquires more companies with other cultures and brings in senior leadership from other cultures."

Depends on how you want to look at it, as the feedback was about 50/50.  RVP's change every year and sometimes in the middle of the year, but again take it either way. You may be the one getting promoted to the new RVP position."
7775,Salesforce,Salesforce - A company where everyone wants everyone to succeed,2017-07-18,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Senior leader in HQ once said, many companies have an onboarding process that likens a rock tumbler. Salesforce's onboarding likens a car wash. Gentle and gets the same result. This has been my experience so far as a new hire. People around are always looking out for you to make sure you can cope. There's a level of trust and faith that you'll ramp up to be productive in the company. I'll list just a few reasons why Salesforce is the number one place to work.

Culture- many of us would agree that it's challenging to explain what working in salesforce is like to those who are not inside, simply because it's rare to find a culture as unique as Salesforce'. When you're in the company, you get a sense of positivity day in and day out, everyone wants to get to know you as a person, it's not just work, it's the person behind the work. You will also feel that every single person in the company sincerely wants you to succeed. From the enablement team equipping you with tools and resources to succeed, to Employee Success (more commonly known outside as HR) taking care of your wellbeing, to your sales leaders leading from the front to win with you, the company's values of trust and growth resonates deeply in the employees. Salesforce is particular about who gets hired in the company. It's not so much of your competency (though it's important), as it is of your character and how you work with people. If you like to outsmart others and constantly seek personal glory, you're not going to have a good time.

Leadership - I believe a huge part of the success culture in salesforce stems from the leadership team. Of course, salesforce hires great managers who can already lead and motivate team, but there's a proper coaching system which enables each employee to align with the direction of our leaders vision quickly, and also improve performance. Think professional athlete teams.

Continuous training and learning - we get a ton of training and resources on industry trends, salesforce products, professional skills like giving effective feedback etc. There's a proper system in place for those who want to develop their competencies or gain more knowledge. Even staff who are here for many years benefit from the training and development programs.

The fun 'stuff' - you get wellness reimbursements (some get gym memberships, some get supplements, you can use it for most physical activities). There're also many team activities and celebrations which makes work a whole lot more fun. We also have 7 days volunteering time off where you can do it with the team or on your own.

More effort should be put into making Salesforce a great place to work than there is making Salesforce *look like* a great place to work. Glossy brochures don't make up for the fact that you can't view payslips online.

But the single worst part of working for Salesforce is the lack of an engaged HR department. So-called ""Employee Success"" are distant, hard to reach and ultimately unhelpful.

This satellite office is almost never visited by upper management (directors and above) and they have absolutely zero clue about the day-to-day operations.

The culture of volunteerism and giving back is in the fabric of the company and is something that is almost mandated that people do in their communities in ways that they think is best and fulfills their passion to give back.
Salesforce's stand on many macro issues from LGBT rights in Indianapolis, Georgia and North Carolina to equal pay for women are highly laudable and amazing to feel you are a part of in some small way.
Some of the leaders at Salesforce from Marc Benioff to many of his deputies are truly inspirational people and there is a sense that you are at times in a once in a lifetime role which does feel special","Diversity
Being a white male is a much better chance of moving up and certainly moving up at a more rapid pace or getting to any VP+ role. The ranks of non caucasians across the board in senior roles is small and you can see that the diversity racial numbers are largely inflated by lower level employees. Certainly there has been strides in recent years for diversity and upward mobility for women but by and large this is just white women. Ultimately the saddest part to it is that while Salesforce hired a non white person to lead diversity, his role has largely been symbolic and for external macro political reasons. As tangible cases of diversity issues have arisen on an individual employee basis, invariably it has been the side of the tenured white Salesforce leader who has won the day.
Being an employee of color is frustrating at Salesforce because over time things do become patronizing as you are told if you do A, B or C you will increase your chances of getting a reward or a promotion. Yet clearly others do none of the above and those same rewards come their way. Writing this may sound like sour grapes but ultimately the numbers don't lie with employee diversity numbers across the board in middle to senior roles as well as tenure to promotion ratios for whites vs. non whites.
Salesforce is not alone in tech let alone the wider corporate culture with this issue. However it is a company that prides itself on being progressive here and it really is not when it comes to employees within the company. Diversity is not a PR headline as we so often seek, it is actually people's lives."

Also, the product set is solid and is really having a large impact at the customers.","Ultimately, as a sales professional, it is about how much money you make, and I have not made much since I have been with Salesforce. You get paid based on net new ACV. However, if you are managing accounts that don't increase their footprint, you don't get a dime in commissions. Also, you get paid on ACV, not TCV. So if you have a client sign a deal for $1M a year for 3 years, you only get credit for the $1M.  Depending on the team you are on, some of the quotas are completely unrealistic. For me to make my quota this fiscal year, I need to grow my territory by over 600%. That is just to make my quota.  The other frustrating part is that a peer on another team sitting next to me could have a $1M quota, and mine could be 3-5X and we could be calling on the same size Enterprise accounts."

There is a good work-life balance. Where I ding them  on the overall  score is based on the Salt Lake City office.",Salesforce tends to acquire with little emphasis on actually integrating behind the scenes outside of the products - something exacerbated by them acquiring Demandware when the dust of  Demandware acquiring  Tomax hadn't yet settled. The Salt Lake City office has a very different vibe than other Demandware or Salesforce locations. There are some passive aggressive personalities in it due to some painfully obvious coddling by prior (and some present) management.  Many hold job titles that are not at parity with industry guidelines and somehow think that they are 'special' when they wouldn't survive a month in that role elsewhere. People tend to withhold information whether it's dodging questions they know the answers to or refusing to document things because they view themselves as more valuable with secrets locked in their heads. For the technical professional who wants to come in and get things accomplished the SLC office culture will wear on you.

7889,Salesforce,"A lot to like, and a lot not to like",2017-05-22,3.0,"Senior Director, Product Marketing","Salesforce really is on the upswing -- it has numerous systematic advantages over older competitors like Oracle and SAP. ""Born cloud"" really does matter, and it shows in the growth of the business. With success comes excellent, top of market compensation, top-notch offices, great systems and support to do your job well.","Salesforce is surprisingly political, especially when you consider how the brand is fun and there's a genuine ""do good"" ethos of philanthropy at the company. Salesforce attracts high performers, which is great in many ways but also leads to a very ""type A"" aggressive, win-at-all-cost environment. Add on top of that the fact that Marc likes to make multiple bets and encourage internal competition (it's why there are two customer service products that sometimes directly compete, two salesforce automation products, etc.). So you end up with a workplace culture that, while exceedingly positive and gracious on the surface, is actually quite cut-throat and reliant on personal connections over merit.

I saw multiple examples of mid-level managers making decisions based on what would most impress the boss over what was best for the company, let alone the customer. There's an obsession with BSOs (Big Shiny Objects) that cost a fortune and have little impact on the business but can be touted internally in presentations to leadership."

Pros

Materialistic: Good salary and benefits (they reimburse gym,spa,sports and/or dance class fees per month up to 5K not just for yourself but cover your family members too! Reimburse 3.5L per year of tuition in case you want to pursue continued education outside! LOTS of holidays! Free amazing unlimited food and drinks 24X7X365. Also did I mention they provide an iPhone and MacBook to EVERY employee along with unlimited 4G internet connection?! The office has a mindfulness room to practice meditation, space for nursing mothers, board games, Pingpong tables, air hockey tables among other things

Culture: Colleagues are warm and friendly. I have barely finished a week here and I already have friends and plans made for a movie, team lunch and weekend! Everyone is helpful, non judgemental and open. As I work in a global team with my colleagues across the world, the diversity is mind blowing. One of my colleagues is an actor in movies, the other one has travelled to 29 countries, my super boss was a part of a very famous American TV show in her young days!! There is lot of stress on wellness and being fit with bike month, running challenges as well as on giving back to the society with fun team volunteering events right from Day1. As a leading technology company, the systems are integrated with a SSO and user friendly 

Career and Development: They stress on developing careers right from Day1. There are many trainings conducted, articles on their blogs and trails(online learning). Also the networking opportunities are immense. It's great to work with the smartest people with diverse backgrounds and learn from each other. 

Also they have a fun themed office space with cute mascots printed on walls, furniture and just about everywhere! The events I have been told are larger than life and the office space is exactly the same across the globe to make employees feel good!

- Building tallest new building on west coast 
- Training

- Good office location","Management - Many Managers, Few Leaders 
- Moral is low. Few are making quota. Micro management is pervasive. Management wants to own all the deals and tell AE's what to do and how to do it. There is no trust in the AE's ability to drive a deal to close. Management attempts to drive rep behavior by fear and focusing too much on the volume of activity. There is a lack of focus on being out in territory vs volume of remote calls / meetings. Management needs to do a better job of using the app to reference next steps and activity. AE's are asked to repeat what is already in the app and often a waste of time and meetings. 

Quota Attainment and Resources 
- Very few people are hitting quota and throwing more bodies at the problem is not solving it. We are short of SE's and SE management. We have way too many co-primes units and need to dissolve the service cloud co-prime role. GB and Select comp plan is not aligned to a ""monthly cadence"" and only can make , few people are achieving quota and management is terrible. Management constantly complaining to reps about activity, expense reports or closed business. Monthly cadence for sales isn't aligned to the comp plan for GB and Select roles. A lot of politics. 

Limited Work Life Balance and Always on Call 
- We are not doctors or solving the world's most important problems. We are sales reps for a tech company. We should not be on call every night, weekend and on PTO.   Reps are NOT encourage to take time away to re-energized and refocus. When reps try to take time off, they are getting daily emails from management.  

Managers Get Unlimited PTO  / Reps Get Very Limited PTO
- Managers not get unlimited PTO due to a policy change in April 2017 where Director level and above (management) get unlimited PTO, Meanwhile AE reps are limited to about 2 weeks of PTO and still filling out weekly time sheets! Everyone should be on the same policy - unlimited PTO.  

Credit on Deals 
- Another example of the politics and toxic culture is having another AE  get credit and commission credit for a large deal they did not do any work on. This impacts the moral, work environment, and obviously commission. Management often overlooks doing the right thing and being inflexible."

7939,Salesforce,Culture Whack-a-Mole,2017-04-24,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great pay, great offices, great benefits, free and healthy beverages and snacks, and fully staffed coffee bars.  The 1-1-1 model of giving back and the company culture are just great. There are worse places to work for sure.","The Kool-Aid is powerful here and for good reason. Salesforce is a highly visible and very successful company led by a charismatic CEO coupled with an amazing culture. The yearly Dreamforce conference is a thing of wonder. Salesforce consistently ranks at the top of best places to work surveys and for good reason. There are HUGE plus points to being here.

However, there is some serious rot inside of the system around 1) the Ohana (family) culture, 2) inept middle management and a lack of transparency, and 3) equality (aka diversity and inclusion).  I’m writing this now before I become too comfortable and too vested to speak up.

There have been many situations where Ohana is the opposite of what I’ve seen in many situations during my short time at Salesforce. Some people and teams are petty and hard to work with.

The Ohana culture comes from the top, and that’s a great thing. Marc Benioff has made some clear and newsworthy moves, which are great. However, the Ohana culture is hit or miss. 

There are stories of people one level below Benioff treating other employees quite badly. Also, the company is growing so fast that people who ought not be managers are managers. The ranks are populated it with awful mid-level managers that seem to have no idea how to work with people and lack essential management knowledge and skills. The company is so fast-paced that it’s not possible to take the time needed to learn them either. It’s happened to me, and I’ve heard other first-hand accounts of people in the organization that deal with their co-workers with aggressiveness and passive-aggressiveness, politics, gossip, and a good amount of foot dragging or back-stabbing.

To his credit, when stories of bad behavior and mismanagement get to the top, Benioff shuts it down quickly. I’ve seen it, and the change that comes is swift. But it’s usually just a patch.  However, the problem comes from exactly that. The company is growing at such a fast rate that he can’t catch all the rot in the system and make sure it’s fixed. Benioff and his team simply can’t see all of the problems that pop up in varying levels of the company. My feeling is also people don’t want to share the bad stuff with him. 

It’s cultural-rot whack a mole. There is a new internal feedback app, but it feels like a bandaid when what’s really needed is surgery and physical therapy.

The culture discourages full transparency. If you complain you’re running a real risk of being ignored or scolded. I’ve seen that happen. After all, it’s one of the best places to work, right? Who are you to complain?! You better suck it up because tons of people really want to be here.

There isn’t any outright corporate warfare between employees and teams because that would be seen as too aggressive. That would be healthier and easier to resolve. What it means is there are a lot of sly maneuvers, working in silos, budget and headcount fights, and teams and co-workers that keep essential information from each other.

I don’t have much faith that their equality team and initiatives can really affect change. Some people on that team don’t have a track record of diversity and inclusion. How can you lead the charge on equality when it’s not an issue you’re vested in? You can’t claim equality is important when you don’t take the time to stop, listen, learn, and act.

The focus is on PR and there is an unrealistic focus on scale. Scale will follow when people can make intentional moves to bring people in. Those people will then refer their contacts. People will see diverse candidates joining and will want to follow. If equality were quick and easy all of these companies would be showing incredible numbers. Instead, there is a lot of talk and waste. Middle managers talk about equality and diversity while still packing their teams with people that look just like them. People flying here and there blowing the budget on expensive programs instead of being allies to people at the company right here and now that need support.

The same goes for public-facing events. With all of the talk of no budget or headcount on a lot of teams. Why blow money on a fancy awards ceremony when the program isn't even one year old? (Google ""Salesforce Equality Awards"" and you'll find it.) You get great PR, get to expense a trip, get pictures with some influential people, pat yourselves on the back about how progressive you are, have a fancy and expensive party, and reward privileged people with an award. What you’re really doing blowing money that could be used to make a real difference by hiring people who’d shift the needle. Put that money to teams where they can aggressively pursue and hire diverse candidates and pay them a competitive wage. Build an incentive into the system: refer diverse candidates and get a bonus if they’re hired. Hold managers accountable when they pass over qualified diverse candidates.

Right now, what I'm seeing is lots of great PR, feel good moments, and no real moves shift the numbers.

Other points:

HR is pretty awful. Getting through a recruiting cycle takes forever in many cases: tons of candidates and lots of work for the recruiting team coupled with hiring managers and teams that don’t make moving the candidate through the pipeline a real priority. As a result, you have candidates languishing for weeks.

How they handle issues around budget and headcount is awful. Lots of last minute decision making and lots of demands without the matching budget so a lot of stress.

How they deal with contractors is the antithesis of the Ohana culture. They should really rethink and fix how they work with them."

I recently watched them promote a smart guy who helped create a new financial services product while at the same time passing up a smart woman who successfully created a new health product for them. They were both really qualified hard working and achieved results in tough circumstances. For many of us that watched it take place, it sent the message that the company was not really committed to equality or at least not as much as the CEO. Actions speak louder than words."

- Company events","The Ohana culture is wonderful but unfortunately it's not practiced by many leaders. They don't reward good leadership and embodying the culture. I had heard it was the influx of the Oracle culture - and the sad part is we talked a lot about how important the culture was but we didn't hold senior leadership for it...so there was a lot of bad behavior (yelling, bullying, not allowing work/life balance, etc) . Felt a lot like it was all for PR and branding but not really what was valued or practiced. 

There also is a lot of breaking points due to scaling growth - systems and technology in many functions are a joke. Many groups have had to create very manual processes b/c the systems are unreliable or not kept up to standard to scale."

8095,Salesforce,Salesforce Marketing Could is poorly managed and chaotic,2017-02-13,2.0,Agency Temp,"I worked remotely for the marketing cloud division out of Indianapolis.  The company treated me well, both in terms of compensation and the flexibility they allowed me to exercise when working from home.","Broken promises: I was assured when I came on-board that the job was a contract-to-hire, but after the initial contract period was over, I was extended on the same contract and told that no full-time would be available.  I was also told upon my initial visit to the office that I'd be visiting the office in-person several times a year, but after 7 months, there is no repeat visit on the horizon, so I feel very disconnected from the team.

The only thing we actually do is build a web app that helps people send out marketing e-mails.  I was excited about being part of something big that sets the industry standard, but I eventually figured out that couldn't care less for the company's product.

My manager was changed halfway through my contract to a person who is a great coder but who has virtually no management experience, and she had two modes: ignore me completely and tell me everything is great, or micromanage my work with a critical eye and tell me I am going too slow and I don't deserve to bill for a full week.  It didn't seem like she was capable of paying attention in a way that was really supportive.

The last complaint I have is that priority decisions were made in a very top-down way without an intelligent eye on the effectiveness of work that's being done.  Lots of automation coverage was built around medium to low priority test cases that were decided arbitrarily, while outstanding known defects and other important things were ignored."

I was recently part of a seminar to learn Lightning hosted by a team that actually built it and it is just one of the many I have attended.

The vision of our CEO has called upon AL of us to volunteer. I was never too big on it before I joined Salesforce, but over here after my first activity, I have been hooked on it. All thanks to Salesforce!

The upper management never really makes you feel left out of any decision process that is regarding you. I have had almost weekly chats with my manager regarding the work and life in general and it is good to know that the management has your back.

Lack of integration between products makes product development frustrating because we constantly fight fires while trying to improve the product. One or the other has to give all the time.
Every employee event feels a little weird with Hawaiian music, Buddhist prayers and cartoon mascots. The outside reputation of Salesforce being a cult are far overstated, but it does feel like the culture overall is a bit hodgepodge and unfocused.
While promotions are frequent, it's a very flat organization, so there isn't a ton of room for upward mobility. Most people just get a ""Senior"" or ""Director"" slapped to their title, and then if you want more, it's either lateral or out. The problem is that lateral moves are kind of limited without learning an entirely new job function."

8210,Salesforce,G & A Positions are terrible,2016-12-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salesforce has great benefits and they treat their sales, marketing and product development teams as well as any company could treat their employees. Very generous benefits package including great health insurance, company paid for vision insurance, a decent PTO policy, and much more.","Salesforce falls short in how they treat their G&A teams. Succeeding in G&A is not based on skills, qualifications, or ability. As a qualifier, I am not saying this out of spite for being passed over for a promotion or a raise, as I have not even tried for those opportunities yet, this is based on the observations I have of other people in the workforce. 

First issue, G&A treats those in the main offices much better than they do some of the smaller offices. There truly is a disparate treatment between those in main hubs and those in smaller offices. If you are not located in a main hub, regardless of if the position needs to be at one of the hubs, you have a nearly 0% chance of being given the same opportunities as those in the main hubs. They will not look at what you have accomplished nor will they recognize the value you provide to the company.  They will promote from the main hubs or place people in positions that are in the main hubs without even considering other employees across the country. 

The other key to being given opportunities in the G&A functions is to campaign for the position. Even if you are not the most qualified, if you can make people think you are, Salesforce G&A leadership will not even do interviews to determine who is best for the job.  They will wave their little magical wand and poof, the person who has less skills and abilities, but who knew who to align themselves with and convince they are better than everyone else will get moved into positions of authority. 

If you are a person who does not mind being dishonest, immoral, and you are willing to put down and crush those around you, apply for a G&A function in one of the main Salesforce offices around the country, you will move up quickly and never have to worry about actually knowing your stuff before you are promoted. You may not even need to wait for a position to open up, they may just create a brand new position for you.

If you are a great worker who does not like to step all over other people to move up or if you are not in one of the main offices this is not the place for you. They will not even listen to your qualifications skills or abilities when positions open up."

Really, with the exception of maybe Google, this is the only place to be in tech, in terms of making an impact on the way the world does business.  Also, the (genuine) philanthropic focus remains strong and helps in fostering a very strong team culture.","Further up the EMEA org the Ohana culture does seem to be getting ""thinner"" and is more of a word than a genuine way of working.  Especially in the enterprise sales organisation there can be some ""prima-donna"" behaviour - seems there are some top sales people in leadership positions based on their sales skills rather than their leadership skills."
8222,Salesforce,Marketing Cloud Sales AE,2016-12-14,3.0,Senior Account Executive,"Marketing Cloud offers a ton of great solutions. They are (mostly) fully integrated, which many competitors can't say, and the individual solutions are leaders in their respective areas. The former ExactTarget culture still exists to an extent but is fading over time. Marketing is a growing area in most companies, so there is plenty of room for growth. Being a part of Salesforce is a benefit from a company values perspective. The 1-1-1 model makes me proud to work for an organization that gives back.","New AE product enablement is embarrassingly bad. The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers. True leaders in management are few and far between. For example, struggling AEs are mostly on their own to figure it out, which is resulting in higher AE turnover."

Internal Politics - lots of gossiping and internal politics happening, almost feels like a high school or university culture
Lack of culture - CEO seems to instill a great culture, but it is not like this when you join the team. people are always working and not too much time to mentor you or help out a new hire.
Low Compensation - compensation is not as competitive as they make it seem (expect to work a lot more than 40 hours/week). Better territories = better compensation, and reps don't seem to have control over which territory they receive, with some being very good while others are very slow
Poor data - from being here just for a few weeks I've noticed the data they have is very poor, which is probably why it makes it hard for managers to create fair territories"

8234,Salesforce,The Top Enterprise Software Shop,2016-12-11,5.0,Data Scientist,"Salesforce has an uncanny knack at making good moves (more often than not) and staying out ahead of bigger and more established tech companies.  It grows fast enough that there are always possibilities for advancement or change within the company.  It attracts some of the best folks now in various tech related fields.  It has great benefits, including a near-monopoly on all high quality office space in San Francisco.  It is one of the few places I've been that actively tries to stave off burnout or attrition.   There are loads of social events and extra-curriculars.  Salesforce tends to hire sociable people, and hanging out together (even for the older crowd) is pretty common.","The tech stack is getting pretty old at this point.  Don't plan on advancing your knowledge in new languages and platforms if you're working on core.  Front end folks have our new UI platform to work with, but it has a load of sharp edges.  There's a lot of indoctrination and cultural training, but it generally has the end goal of getting people to be good to each other and to work together well."

You'll never get bored of your work since the company is developing rapidly and touches so many different business processes. Hence as an employee you can have a direct impact on our customers success.,"The organization is growing rapidly, hence new members of staff from different companies with different organizational structures and cultures are joining. Management needs to ensure that Salesforce's original culture is preserved. This counts for senior level employees with directs as well as for young professionals.

A significant number of customers, as well as employees of Salesforce, do not share Marc's, and by extension Bay area's, far-left vision of the world.  Employees have to keep their mouths shut and opinions to themselves to avoid problems.  This year's election put it out in front.  Chatter (company's internal ""facebook"") was filled with support for Hillary.  Had someone built Trump groups etc., Bay Area folks would have demanded their safe spaces.  Personally, I'm not against the Marc's positions and I didn't vote for Trump,  but I don't care for the way it impacts employees and some customers.

They cater breakfast in Monday-Thursday and lunch on Monday. The area to bring clients at is GREAT! Clients dig it.,"This was the worst job I've ever had. Management talks down to you like I haven't been doing this for 10 years (and my boss has less experience with half the success).... And I was #1 on my team and #11 in the country. 

They claim compensation is great but when based in Atlanta you get the most bottom of the barrel accounts and this means everything (you have to deal with it). I've never worked so hard for a $2K deal... in. my. life. In my previous life, I never glimpsed at anything under $100K. That was for newer reps. If you sell a $100K deal, you will be at the top for the month and everyone freaks out. So what this means.... what they say you will get paid is a FAR stretch from reality. I was above my number and didn't make what they claimed because when I got my sales compensation package there are all these other factors. Therefore, I made SIGNIFICANTLY less here than my last job. The base was higher but that was it.

I'm a hunter and have always been one. Here, it does NOT make sense to focus on hunting because you get new accounts every year and for a prospect to switch CRM's this decision isn't made overnight. Don't let the recruiter tell you otherwise. Trust me.

Every current client that I did get, I had to do damage control from previous reps trying to squeeze every dollar out of them. The previous sales reps had their own agenda and it really hurt our clients. Because you get new accounts each year, the previous reps didn't care about the future. They did whatever it took to get $ and then dumped the client. I spent the first 6 months trying to get our clients not to leave us.

The office is LOUD because the desk are on top of each other with no sound barriers and all the conference rooms are booked. Clients made many comments about the background noise and it's embarrassing."

I was lucky to work with some great people who were genuine and dedicated to their roles and the direction of the company. Scott Dorsey is an inspiring leader who started the great culture that matched Benioff and Parker's aloha culture. Philanthropy was heavily supported by Benioff and truly created a giving atmosphere that was brought back into the office. The direction that Salesforce is headed in is on key and changes, adaptively, as it should toward the need and ever changing and always connected customer.","The buy out  into salesforce lowered the glass ceiling for the Indianapolis office. Expectations were often but not always unrealistic, as decisions are made at a high level without the input of the right people to define a direction that allows success for everyone. Unfortunately, I also experienced some sexual harassment that management responded to by suggesting changes in how I should respond, not the behavior at hand.  Being in a male dominated field, I've worked with men all of my life and can deal with some very dirty general comments and jokes (trust me I've heard it all), but when not taken seriously because someone would rather flirt, it bothers me. I left for a few reasons, one important one, was lack of advancement."

The company is proud to be volunteering and it is not only appreciated if you do, but also encouraged. SF promotes equality (hired last Month a chief equality manager), got the best reference cases from customers themselves and is very good for the healthcare of the employees. It is a company that cares for her employees and her customers plus got very innovative solutions.  The onboarding was amazing and the company does make you feel proud that you work there.","Equality: There is a good focus on equality which is good as it is needed. In my eyes there is a lack of female managers or managers that understand how to use the strengths of having woman in the sales team. Overall, all managers have a checkbox they need to complete by hiring or interviewing woman, I think in the end they will be better in also give specific trainings to managers on how to actually manage a woman better.

Remote worker: The biggest downfall of SF. A remote worker means they expect you to be in the office on a weekly base, rather more than less. Being used to work with Lync or Skype, there is a lack of the internal technology (acceptance) to make remote workers more involved remote instead of face to face. Everyone is using google hangouts or GTM. Internal presentations and meetings in my eyes should be 80% of the time remote."

Lots of social events, happy hours and offsite meetings.  I've experienced that volunteering isn't ""encouraged"" unless it's WITH the group (no personal causes) and if you want to support a personal cause, it had better be on the weekend (when you want to spend time with family) rather than during working hours.  Cornhole must be played at every event. And people pour themselves into the job, 24/7.  No turning off or tuning out - no matter what is ""touted"" from corporate.

Salesforce also has a great volunteering program. Everything is team based.","Salesforce is a combination of Game of Thrones and House of Cards in a corporate environment. The politics in this company are extremely embraced by it's culture. Everyone has an opinion of you and everyone else. Work feels like an actual theatrical performance- making sure your interpersonal interactions are precisely how they need to be. Everyone has an opinion on something and if people don't take a liking to you right away- prepare to be isolated. Managers are so far up their own butts that they play even more into the politics game. At Salesforce it's next to impossible to be yourself- specially if you are a little bit different. People are willing to sabotage if it means that they themselves can progress. 

It's not a healthy environment to work in. Specially when people are still in a high school state of mind.  You better be ready to play the game if you are ever going to advance in this company."

There's a real sense that we're making a difference both in our industry and through our philanthropy. The company is relentlessly focused on growth and anyone who has worked at place with 25% growth year after year after year, knows that there are growing pains.

Bulleted Pros:
Innovative company where ideas are given credence
1-1-1 model is real and matters to most people
Very smart, self-starting, motivated coworkers","Most of the cons can be summed up by growing pains. The rate of growth at times creates confusion and certainly poses organizational and system challenges. Salesforce is future focused and perhaps doesn't always take the time to look back to evaluate past performance, instead preferring to move on to the next big thing. The result is that sub-optimal processes don't always get corrected.

As the company has grown, a lack of focus on small details results in some areas of the business suffering until something serious occurs that draws attention to it. 

Salesforce is unabashedly a Customer Company. When given the choice to pivot to Customers, Shareholders, or Employees, the company will always choose Customers.

That toxic co-worker who complains regularly about your manager, or company, they don't last long here.

You will know quickly whether you belong in sales because this place is intense. If you can make it then you will earn a life changing amount of money, given opportunities for professional development, and your career will open up vastly.

Everything in the media about our culture, innovation, etc, it's all true. And it makes this a truly incredible place to work.

I'm very proud of working at Salesforce because it's a company that stands behind it's values every step of the way.","There are a LOT of products to understand. The days of it being a simple CRM are far behind it and while you don't have to be an expert in every area, there are experts available most of the time, you do need to know enough to be dangerous. And that takes time. While you're learning the products the ramp is closing so if you have accounts that need TLC you can get in the weeds quickly."

Lots of perks, especially in US and for office based employees.

If you can find the time, the VTO model can be rewarding for all concerned. 

Broad customer appeal, ongoing innovation.

Some employees absolutely love the place and the culture - almost cult like belief which can be both a wonderful place of happiness and also slightly concerning!","Too many processes, not communicated consistently across the business - result most people are very busy - but not very productive!  

Looking to shoe horn acquired businesses into what are already broken core processes - consequence of which is frustration all round.  

Too much focus on trailhead and mandatory virtual learning, information overload and simply not enough hours in the day to get the job done.   Compared to other enterprise software companies fewer class room based opportunities for learning.

Painful on-boarding process, sink or swim.

Surprising lack of resources.  For many not a sustainable place to work."

The CEO is motivating, engaged, does the right things and has a big heart.","The company moves fast and it re-orgs all the time.   If you don't like constant manager and job changes, Salesforce isn't a good fit.  Even with all the great things about Salesforce, it's behaving more like the other big companies.  For example, after re-orgs the ""HR"" team will do job audits to ""align"" individual's job codes to fit the new org. regardless of it having a devastating impact to an individual's comp. (20-25% or more cut) and even if the job responsibilities are exactly the same.  This kind of rigid conformity by front line HR workers is demotivating in a fast changing environment."
8429,Salesforce,Business Development Representative,2016-09-28,4.0,,"In Indy, the people, environment, and culture are what really sets Salesforce Marketing Cloud apart from other places I have worked. The people that are hired in Indianapolis, are a different breed than most-in a good way. I am in sales, and we are a sales family, rather than everyone being selfish and only out for themselves.",Other Salesforce hubs don't seem to be cut from the same cloth when it comes to the different parts of sales. Indy is also the main Marketing Cloud hub so we have to work with the other sales teams within Salesforce who sell the other products that we offer. Some would rather get their money than do what is best for the customer. It's difficult to work across the different hubs sometimes because of this.

- excellent technical team","- In some cases management has little interest in the careers of those below them
- There doesn't seem to be much interest in hiring less experienced people (including co-ops)
- Acquisitions need to be integrated in a faster manner, and don't let them think they will keep their own branding and processes for long

I got lucky and have an awesome manager. I also enjoy working remotely. Being able to contribute to Dreamforce is a plus. They definitely make an effort to be transparent and communicative here. If you have a cool idea, Salesforce is a place where you can often make it a reality.","Why is drinking such a big part of the company culture? It saddens me that even a below-21 intern feels he/she can't participate fully in the ""culture"" because drinking is such a ""big part"" of it, as seen in a recent Glassdoor review. I don't drink for health reasons, and I often feel like work events (holiday parties, team celebrations, Dreamforce) are less rewarding for me because the non-alcoholic choices are an afterthought. Can I have a $20 gift card instead?! I've seen a lot of employees misbehaving and embarrass themselves through alcohol. Time to cut back. Alcohol is not the same thing as a company culture. Second, I have no illusions that working remotely is a perfect situation. I know I miss out on a lot in the office and I am ok with it. That said, I think the company could do more to make Salesforce better for non-SF members of the Ohana. I also think there should be better career paths for those who are not managers. Because I'm remote, I have been told I don't have much room to move up since I can't manage remotely (even though my manager manages me remotely... and that seems to work fine). The company expects so much of us during Dreamforce (12+ hour days for a week), but we never see any time off as a result of that."

Frustrating to lose accounts you invest in, and need to drive bigger deals in reduced territory."
8437,Salesforce,Account Executive,2016-09-26,1.0,,Salesforce provides a ton of sales enablement material to learn all about digital marketing technology and you work with smart companies.,It's gotten way too big and Salesforce puffs out it's big chest and considers it a privilege if companies become clients.  Way too much boasting  You're a cog in a wheel and will report to several different people there.  New territories are given out without any input from AEs.  You're successful if you have a good territory and it depends if Salesforce has pissed off that company in the past.  If so - good luck!

A year ago I was proud and excited to be a part of the company. The Lightning release was a shining moment for how the company's culture can facilitate great things. However, there have been a number of changes over the last year that have slowly eroded the magic - starting with some of the new leadership. Our group has become more fragmented and less collaborative. There's more fear of making mistakes and the general sense of trust and support for our work from our leadership has gone way down. The transparency and access we had upwards is becoming more hazy largely because of layers being added. My autonomy and empowerment to make decisions is slipping away. Politics were always there, but now they're something you have to consider daily. You used to be judged based on the work you created and what you shipped, it doesn't feel that way anymore. Some of my favorite people have already moved on. Perhaps it's just the nature of a company growing this fast. There's not a clear avenue for safely giving upwards feedback for our group. My hope is that someone up top takes notice and makes corrections."

Every single month feels like it's end of quarter, and end of quarters feel like end of year. End of year is just insane. The pressure every single month is tough to deal with and especially in ESMB, quotas are just not realistic. Big deals tough to come by.

You'd expect a sales role at Salesforce to have plenty of inbound leads or plenty of add on business for existing customers - really not the case. Ton of outbound, cold calling, hunting role (but in your limited account base of course). 

Be ready to have literally everything questioned and expected to tell your manager absolutely everything going on in any deal at all times. You'll be questioned on everything you do. 

The culture in the NYC office is nothing like the other offices. When there are events or happy hours, everyone is too busy or exhausted to even go. Very much a heads down and focus kind of atmosphere.

The Ohana (broadly interpreted as family) culture is a real living culture, that imbues most people's behaviours.  People help each other, and are not focused on trying to get one over on each other.  The company is very much in growth mode, which makes for optimism and a sense of purpose.","The company is at something of a crossroads, wedded to some of the disadvantages of its start-up mentality: thinking can be short-term, with decisions accordingly myopic, and there is too great a value placed on the diving-catch.  Too many fire-drills and a small number of capricious senior leaders who have been around for 10 - 15 years behaving in the same way.  It is tiresome, disruptive and frankly counter-cultural but their tenure appears to make them untouchable."

It is an amazing place to work, especially as the company changes & grows at such a fast pace.","As the company is quite young, there are not necessarily processes in place which can sometimes make things challenging, especially when it come to career development however, the lack of process gives employees the opportunity to build their own processes and own their own career."

Overall you'll learn a lot just by spending 2 years here. I spent 6 and it was the best 6 years of my career!,They will make you work for the promotions. Example: you do 200% of your sales target and you're next in line for a promotion. Management will tap 3 people. You have now earned the right to interview for a promotion. You will be given a case study to present to senior directors. You will get beaten up in this meeting far beyond what any customer would put you through. At the end 1 of the 3 people will be selected to move up. The other 2 go back and wait until they are tapped again for a promotion. I watched a few friends depart due to not getting their promotion.
8512,Salesforce,Acquisition has been rough on veteran SteelBrickers,2016-08-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The foundation of why SteelBrick was a great place to work still exists in small amounts; great employees, caring and friendly environment, opportunities to move your career forward, etc.
 
- Salesforce has brought on some nice benefits like Volunteer Time Off (VTO), and access to more resources about the SFDC ecosystem that we already lived in as a separate company. So it's been great for employees who were already passionate about this space. 

-Working at Salesforce now has opened doors to try out new roles in other teams and transfer internally.

-Non-sales SteelBrick employees work out of a nice building in SF with great perks; free catered lunches, on-site gym, yoga classes, meditation, etc. Sales team works out of HQ SF office and enjoys being closer to core AE's.","- The Salesforce acquisition changed a lot of things about the culture, positions, teams, and leadership of SteelBrick for the worse (as expected with any acquisition, but still tough to manage). 

- The acquisition happened so fast (announcement to close ~1 month), that it barely gave employees time to process. The business had to be wrapped up and packaged for SFDC so quickly that employees were basically handed their offer letters and told 'sign now and we'll figure out logistics about how your position will change later'.

-The lack of communication during the acquisition, on boarding, and transition process created a divide between leadership and employees, causing distrust in leadership. Employees were commonly given answers about the future of their positions with 'we're not sure yet, we're working on it, and we'll let you know when we figure things out'.

- SteelBrick leadership focused primarily on their money-making teams (sales and dev) as their priority to ensure a smooth transition. The other teams we're offered positions with Salesforce, but haven't been given the opportunity to get the same improvements. The leadership team is only willing to fight for the teams that make more money for them.

- The further we get into Salesforce, the more we've lost our personal identity and culture. There's not as many fun events or opportunities for employees to come together and enjoy some time off. Everyone's too overworked and underpaid to want to stay around the office longer then they have to."

Emphasizing their values, it was evident that they placed a high importance on their people. The people at SalesforceIQ are some of the brightest, hard working and friendliest people you can work with. In a fast pace environment, interns are given the same responsibilities as full time employees - making you feel part of the team and contributing to the product. As an intern, not only do you get great experiences with other interns, but executives make time to interact with you and make sure you are invested in your few months as part of the company. This past summer was an internship I will never forget.","It is really hard to think of any negative experiences I have had at SalesforceIQ.

8536,Salesforce,Great Summer Internship,2016-08-16,5.0,Software Engineer Intern,"Specific To Interns: 

Interns are given a lot of resources to both learn and have fun. There are about 1-3 speaker series every week for interns as well as other tech talks which are open to all employees. There were also so many fun events to help interns explore San Francisco such as a cable car tour, a small cruise ride, or street food tours. 

Overall Company:

The company culture is fantastic. Salesforce is huge on doing social good and do a lot to help employees have a positive impact as well. For example, there is generous donation matching, hours of VTO (time off for volunteering,) and awards for employees who volunteer more. For example, the company has an internal Facebook-like system where posts are public to everyone and most communication / business is done on it.

Every 4 months, there's an internal career fair where you can learn about other teams' projects and transfer to another team if you'd like.","It's a larger company so work tends to move more slowly. However, your actual team is usually small."

8542,Salesforce,Product Marketing Intern,2016-08-12,5.0,,"Management is amazing, Great benefits,",This isn't really a negative but be prepared to work hard and learn a lot. You are surrounded by some of the top students across the nation along with some of the smartest managers. It's a competitive company to get into. If you expect the best of yourself then you're in the right place.
8543,Salesforce,Software Engineering Internship,2016-08-12,5.0,Software Engineer Intern,"An amazing summer full of learning, fun, and hard work. The FutureForce team does an amazing job filling the summer with fun experiences (party on a boat, renting out all of SOMA Streatfood Park, a baseball game, and so much more) as well as learning experiences. We had lunch and learns from executives like the CFO, CEO of Heroku, and tons of thought leaders. What's really great about all of these experiences though is that it's clear the fun and learning is not just an opportunity for interns but for full time employees too. Throughout the summer, there was an all Tech and Product summer picnic at the zoo with included animal adventures and an amazing barbecue, a Summer of 99 party, and tons of lunch and learns with internal and external people presenting research. 

On my team I was able to contribute to features and bugs and was challenged and stretched but supported the whole time. I was able to demo to high level executives and definitely contribute real value. 

Another really unique aspect of Salesforce is their commitment to Ohana, or family. All of the employees, customers, and partners are treated with the highest level of respect. I especially appreciated the commitment to increasing diversity in the tech industry. One way Salesforce aims to do this is through the employee resource groups, like FemmeForce, BOLD, OutForce, and LatinoForce. Another way Salesforce aims to help the community is through volunteering. Every employee gets 56 hours to volunteer and we as interns were able to spend up to 56 hours volunteering as well! I was able to volunteer at an urban farm, a beach cleanup, and much more!",There really aren't any downsides. All of my expectations leading up to the internship were exceeded.

The amount of pressure lower level managers apply to their teams is not effective, this causes the team members to spend more time justifying their jobs which in turn takes away from their ability to identify and close opportunities. 

Too many co-primes/overlays working with each team, this is inefficient and causes redundancy."

Someone who hit over 100% on numbers each money.... Money wasn't the driver but career... And there is non,Where to start.. The management alone is shocking. No leaders at all. Idea of leading a team is trying to trip then up and bully tactics. Egos come to play and there is allot of clicks in this business. If you not in the click you won't get promoted. What I really mean is if you don't do as they say and jump when they want.... You won't go anywhere. It's a real shame as the company based in the US where there is culture and values is not the same in the Dublin office. Management are doing you no justice as several people won't even apply for jobs as the word on the street in Dublin is there is one manager now promoted to a higher position who no one wants to work FOR. What happened to working with a company to succeed. But seems she is also untouchable as her click is supporting her. Real shame as in Dublin word spreads. Dublin office and managers in there are too far from the real culture of the company and the US Aren't getting the real story.

8593,Salesforce,Insane Growth,2016-07-25,4.0,Software Engineer,"The insane growth in Pardot is pretty incredible. The company provides inside details on revenue specifics which gives you confidence in its decision. Despite hiring so many people, they still invest quite a bit of the budget into its employees. Did someone say perks? Yeah, they're still there and even better than before.","The growth has made Pardot lose that tight culture it once had. Previously, everyone would say ""hi"" to everyone and make a chance to learn everyone's names. Now, there's a ridiculous amount of people and cliques have formed. You can't really fault the company for this, that's on the employees.

From an engineering perspective, Pardot is inherently stuck on this giant monolithic legacy code base. When you hire 5 new engineers each week, there are the same exact questions because no one can even google the answer given how old the majority of the tech stack is.

There have been efforts to split this out into micro services but decisions are often made by engineering managers and tech leads who have been dispositioned into enterprise related solutions that are often dated for the modern web and just not fun to work with. You can't blame them too much for this, product managers are breathing down their necks constantly.
More often than not, these early decisions aren't well thought out and lead to projects getting scrapped 6 months later or resulting in a significant re-design.

Annoyingly too that is that Pardot has a concept of ""hack days"" to work on whatever you want. This used to be an engineering fun event and solutions that made a better coding experience would often win. Since the T&P (Technology and Product) lingo started evolving, the only thing that wins is something that can sell something."

Great onboarding

Great office

Good culture (mostly see cons)

Good compensation

Good leader in Mark B

I really like Salesforce but with any company get a crap manager and your life becomes hell even if you are hitting the number. People leave mangers and not companies. 

Dreamforce is crazy but fun.

I met some great people in the business. 

Growing like crazy. 

You can still cut a deal which was good.

Good paid time off to do charity work. 

Good commission if you are in the right part of the business","As with many US based firms many of the mangers I had were based in the US. Most have zero idea on life in EMEA both business and culturally as they never got on a plane and been bothered to come here. This made them some of the most ignorant and useless people managers I have had the misfortune to work for and sadly nothing the UK management team could change or influence. 

If you join one of the companies which SFDC has taken over then good luck. It can take years for systems to join up and merged and this can lead to a huge duplication of effort and time.

I did see some people make some good money here but lots running around chasing completely unattainable sales targets year after year. They seemed caught up in the hype rather than making money.

Despite telling everyone that there are lots of career opportunities in the UK I did not see many at all. Again your career will be down to knowing the chosen three of four people within the business who can help you to get there. It seems like a long and tiresome process.

Many of the management have come from the same background and company and this management style does show sadly. A few but not all where rude and unaaproachable despite constantly telling the company of their open door policy. 

Mark B is a charasmiatic leader and I wonder who would fill his large shoes once he departs."

8598,Salesforce,Incredible Intern Experience,2016-07-20,5.0,Technical Intern,The intern program at SalesforceIQ is extremely well designed. You are immediately treated like another member of the team and are assigned real tasks that are part of the actual product.

The pay for EA's at SF is on point with other competitive markets.,"Trying to transition to a different role from executive assistant is pretty impossible unless you know the right people. The process for internal candidates is less than desireable and the recruiters that manage EA's are not effective.

In fact, compensation is not commensurate with responsibilities or with peers in the same position with the same experience. It's all about personality. Suck up and be liked and you may just get paid fairly.

No work/life balance. Even hourly employees who are not permitted to record more than 40 hours
per week are expected to be on-call and responsive 24/7, on PTO, holidays, etc.

Too much time talking about the culture and not enough time maintaining it and actually taking pulse of employee morale (spoiler alert: the culture is awful - not that execs would know that since they're not involved in day-to-day office experience. I'm sure everything seems great when you're making 7 figures.) 

No defined career path or visibility into other areas of the company - you're hired to do the job you applied for so don't expect anything else for the rest of your life apparently. if you want a promotion find another company to work for.

VPs want to make everyone feel as though they are disposable and that their employment is on a day-to-day basis.

Almost negligible engineering presence. Very little to share and learn for engineering and software development. All kind of games being played as small number of staff wants to push into management. There's a huge hierarchy and it may be good on a global scale. But doesn't quite makes sense to have that in Dublin office. Some people are stuck in monotonous work and see move to management their only way out and act in poor spirit.

If you are looking for good work and team, don't bother. Join a startup instead. Current state of Dublin office is worse than that. If it wasn't for larger organisation holding it to a structure, the place had been much more chaotic"

Also, if you are customer focused some of the protocol within the organization makes it extremely difficult to build a long term relationship and do what is right for the customer.

User interface is implemented with a proprietary framework (Aura) that is universally criticized by its users as inferior to Aspect and other industry standards, but is ferociously defended by company insiders. Similarly, storage is done via a proprietary layer atop a small number of massive Oracle databases. This means that one database outage affects a large number of customers. The Oracle centric mindset of the ""old boys"" has been incredibly resistant to change. Unit testing is slowly gaining acceptance, but is still by far the exception to the rule. The monolithic nature of the code base means that tests may take several days to catch regressions.

8657,Salesforce,"If your company is getting acquired by Salesforce, be careful",2016-06-22,2.0,,"- 5 months after my company was acquired by Salesforce, I was ultimately transferred to a manager who was very kind and understanding. Despite having my team thrown upon him, he tried the best that he could without knowing anything about us. He did not micro-manage and I thoroughly enjoyed working for him. I appreciated everything he did for me, but ultimately, he did not have enough power to change the situation.
- I loved the people I worked with at my original acquired company and still got to work with them closely after the acquisition.
- Good snacks and wellness benefits.","- If you come from an acquisition, Salesforce isn’t going to pay you as well as they pay their internal employees. Even if you are doing the same exact job as someone inside Salesforce, you will probably be making significantly less than what a core employee will be making. It was extremely frustrating and completely demeaning to hear all the hype and news about how Salesforce employees are so happy with their compensation and how Salesforce is making strides towards equal pay. Apparently, acquired company employees are not part of that equation and we do not hold as much value and shouldn’t be treated as equals…ridiculous. I asked for a compensation change in order to match or even come close to the pay of my peers within the Salesforce organization but was told that Salesforce does not have enough internal data to justify a compensation change. Essentially, there was no proof at Salesforce that I was worth a compensation change. This blew my mind because when you first hire someone, you have no proof internally that they are worth the salary that you are going to pay them. What you do instead is evaluate their past experiences and then you determine what is fair pay based on their experiences, skills, and the job that they are doing. You have no internal data or proof in that situation. If you acquire a company, yes, you have no Salesforce data to prove that an employee is worth a certain salary but you acquired a product that you clearly thought had value and the people who helped to create that product are not worth a compensation change because you don't have enough data? I had been working for the acquired company for almost a year, but all of that was meaningless because if you're acquired, it seems like you're not truly a ""Salesforce employee"" and being paid fairly is not something that applies to you.
- Our entire acquisition process was a complete mess. My team and I essentially had to operate “as normal” which was completely impossible given that all of our management and the rest of the company were trying to figure out the acquisition themselves. We were lost in the transition, did not have managers for quite some time, and were essentially left to fend for ourselves for the better part of 4 months. It didn’t seem like the M&A team knew what to do with us and had forgotten we existed. 
- During the acquisition process, we were told that there would be tons of opportunities within the Salesforce organization but once we were in the Salesforce organization, in reality, there were no opportunities. We contacted departments and teams we were interested in and were repeatedly told that they were not hiring or that you needed XYZ experiences that none of us had. We had no choice in what department or role we were assigned. A role was thrown on us, whether we liked it or not, with no other presented opportunities.
- My team and I were expected to hit ridiculous numbers as soon as we were acquired despite the fact that we were not fully integrated, did not receive the goal numbers until halfway through a quarter, and still had to facilitate the entire merging of all our systems with Salesforce's systems. We received very little support from the core Salesforce organization and were treated as if we were incompetent because we could not hit these numbers. It seemed like my team and I were being set up for failure so that the core team had a reason to get rid of us once we did not hit a specific goal."

8668,Salesforce,Genuinely Care About Employees!,2016-06-14,5.0,,"I've been at Salesforce for several years now after coming from one of the big 4 consulting firms, and it's been night and day! Although I was a top performer at my previous company, it was clear that I was disposable to them regardless and they would rather hire someone with less experience than try to retain me (my requests were not related to salary, but changes to projects and overall happiness). I provided a lot of feedback on how to improve processes and promote collaborative culture as other coworkers were feeling similarly, but nothing was done.

At Salesforce, I completely feel as if I'm heard by management. I've transferred to several different teams with ease (in fact, after one year at the company they encourage it and create programs to shadow other roles). My managers are genuinely interested in progressing my career and enabling me to succeed and I've enjoyed working with all the teams I've been on.

I've had a lot of flexibility to ensure I still have a nice work/life balance and that I actually get to use all the perks available! I personally use all of the $100 gym membership stipend (you can use it for massages too if you don't work out!) and the generous VTO balance (56 hours to volunteer at my local animal shelter, yes please!).","There's a learning curve to trying to not become too corporate, but at the same time 19,000+ employees globally. Occasionally I feel that we are very top heavy management wise."
8669,Salesforce,Not for everyone,2016-06-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salesforce has awesome benefits, values, compensation, and career opportunity.  Their focus on equality and giving back are an example for all.","While SF tries to maintain the Ohana culture, the reality is it's still a very large company.  Hard to not feel like a ""number"".  Also, while they provide a large amount of PTO (even unlimited for management), it's next to impossible to take even a day completely off.  People are working constantly."

Your best bet is to work on the product."
8671,Salesforce,Extreme work politics!,2016-06-12,2.0,,Good brand name on resume. Get the experience and move out.,"1. Too much politics! You will spend more time dodging criticisms and blames, rather than doing actual work.
2. Unless you can speak ""Tamil"" or ""Telugu"", or are awesome at work politics, you shouldn't join this company's IT department. Hard work is not rewarded.
3. Absolutely not worth being here if you are a contractor, unless you don't mind being treated like a slave."

Free snacks in the office for non-remote employees.","I wouldn't tell even my worst enemy to go to work for Salesforce after the experience I have had. It's a huge company that cares very little for lower-level employees. Don't expect to transfer departments or move to a better job no matter how hard you work. You will be subject to the whims of upper management.. The company has also recently changed its volunteer time off policy to turn it into a weird sort of competition, so there's no longer a guarantee that you will receive a grant to donate to the charity of your choice if you complete your volunteer hours for the year. Everything about this company is horrible and the direction it is headed is wrong in so many ways."

8700,Salesforce,Enjoying my time at SFDC,2016-05-24,4.0,Procurement,"Coming from a very large and mature Tech company (also an industry leader), Salesforce was a breath of fresh air.  The culture within my group is one of ownership and exposure.  I have worked with more execs in my one here at Salesforce, than I had in my 5 years at my previous company.  Salesforce is also very engaging with volunteer opportunities, speakers and other hosted events that expose you to new ideas and perspectives both internally and externally.  Lastly, pay and benefits are very fair.",Things can be more political than they initially seemed.  Opportunity to make an upward move are not clearly communicated.

Its a good place to work if you just want a ""job"". Its a good job with good benefits.","I came from a startup that was purchased. While the acquisition was exciting, my responsibilities and decision making capacity went elsewhere. Budgets were slashed, and employees were let go as the company was rolled up. My role became pigeon holed in much simpler and narrower responsibilities. I went from having one manager to have 5+ to convince for infrastructure projects. As a result, the politics were incredible. More time was spent on the politics of convincing others to make changes than innovation. We were a profitable startup, which was then managed by a less profitable business unit which caused a lot of investment politics."

The company has some great benefits for families, volunteers, and service.","For the few people who are great, there are a tremendous amount of people who do ""just enough"" to not get fired. With a company that prides itself on ""employee happiness"" and not having lawsuits, it's not in their best interest to fire people. What you get left with is a dead sea effect (or people airing out their laundry).  Lastly, because it is mostly a sales company that sells software (not a software company) Many of the decisions are made in products favor without equal voice to engineering. Direct managers are punished for their employees leaving, even if it is the fault of the organization as a whole.  

Furthermore, since this company has so many acquisitions, you have the ""Nest"" Effect. Some organizations are terribly mismanaged and painful to those having to do all the work."
8717,Salesforce,Great place to learn and grow!,2016-05-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Lots of growth and learning; incredible CEO and visionary; fun culture; great pay and earning potential,"Political, which is a given with the growth; middle management do not receive training in managing people and are often on power trips (likely based on insecurity); territories are far from equal and the company will double up territories for those they want to promote to make them look good and justify the promotion; too many people eg overlays, excessive levels of management trying to justify why they are employed and create a lot of extra work for AE's;  takes away from selling and caring for the customers.  Too much 'AE Enablement'...AE's are now Customer Success, Technical Support, Operations, Sales Engineers as instead of hiring resources, everyone wants to train AE's to do their job...not a good use of high paid employees and takes away from productivity and revenue driving activities.

As AE's you are pretty much seen as a number and stat to 'stay in the box' without a lot of autonomy on how to spend your day.  Lots of burnout if you get sucked into the monthly 'life or death' culture to meet quota or be ashamed."

I started in January 2016 and was inundated with the training and the tools to be successful.  People here truly care about the company, the products, and the success of every individual.  Pardot is the Salesforce Marketing Automation solution.  As a co-prime selling this product, I feel that the core team is extremely supportive and proactive in selling the solution.  And the rewards!!!  When you do well here - the SPIFF's are unreal.

We are consistently growing at Salesforce, at about 30% year-over-year and there's a ton of opportunity to continue to grow and develop my career here.  The company has a huge heart and giving back is baked into the company DNA.  We have the 1:1:1 philanthropy model and our employees receive 7 paid volunteer days annually which we are encouraged to use.  Mindfulness and wellness are always promoted within the organization.  The kitchen here is fully stocked with yummy, healthy snacks, beverages and great coffee.  The collaboration is phenomenal here and I have found that if you ask for help or advice people are always very warm and willing to give their assistance.  The company has won every award under the sun for both their business solutions and employee engagement and being an employee here you can really understand why.  #DreamJob is for real.","The company certainly isn't perfect, it's a rapid growth company and we move very fast.

- Salesforce is a great company to work for.  MarcB is a CEO with a heart and vision.  Him taking on global economic issues and putting the corporate stand behind movements like LGBT is remarkable and very rare in CEOs.  He is the modern CEO
- Products are best in the market.  CRM, ExactTarget are definitely the best in the market so you are not selling something that people don't already love or want.","- FinSrv vertical is struggling.  Big bang accounts are rare and easy lay up accounts are given to Oracle friends, boys click.  
- FinSrv Accounts pie is cut too many ways
- Pay out is every 2+ years if that
- Worst is the new Oracle culture. Mgmt is all about badging and silly stickers and certifications you need to get to be able to tell the customer story when they should be helping with relationships & focusing on the problems at hand
- global AEs are just in title, they don't actually get paid on global revenue - so watch out for that when you review your comp.

From here my comments apply to the  Marketing Cloud:
No work/life balance, seriously..This is a huge one. 
In paper the (limited) time off/volunteer benefits sound good but the reality is very different. In order to take any time off (at least in the In the Marketing Cloud group) you need to find someone to cover while you are gone. Since everybody is spread so thin it is going to be almost impossible to find a colleague that can cover. Can't find someone to cover? Sorry that's too bad, time off denied.
1 month advance notice to take 2 or more days off!, 2 weeks advance notice to take a 1 (yes a single) day off! Are you kidding me! Forget about being able to have any spontaneity/freedom to plan a long weekend to decompress when needed.. Off course people are going to burn off.
You may pick some valuable knowledge/skills working here but the price is too high for people with a life outside work."

Employees are being spoiled by Salesforce and in turn are given way more employee perks (housing/travel stipend, regular events, ect), and are in an environment where employees have amazing opportunities for growth in their careers and abilities.

The engineering culture is open and employees are often encouraged to teach others their expertise. The team is impressive and talented, and for the most part, the only people that have ever left the company have only done so to go start their own companies.","The team is growing fast, and who knows what will happen to the culture with such a massive growth.

- Growth - being at a company that grows at our pace is immensely exciting. It creates a wealth of long term opportunity.

Get to work with some amazing peers.,"It's with a heavy heart and reluctance that I share my review.  Salesforce is an amazing company, however, within the department I work there is an overriding culture of insidious bullying, throwing people under the bus, lack of support, openness, coaching and development.  Promotions are based not on your ability but for political reasons and whether your face fits, especially if you are able to 'toe the party line' and do not step out of line with the department head.  This environment has been created and sustained over the last few years based on fear; if you are good at your job and have a point of view, no matter how professionally you express it you know your time is limited.  The final result?  A department which is wouldn't look out of place in North Korea, you would state black is white just to keep your job.  It really is that bad.  The worst of it is that this is known about at a very senior level and for some time and yet nothing is done to remove the perpetrator from the organisation.  For fear of retribution I dare not share any further details, suffice to say that it's non-sales, and it's a department which should be the gold standard for promoting the Aloha culture.  I'll leave it at that."

Every opportunity for growth that I could imagine is given.
Our leadership really cares; it's not just a tagline at Salesforce, and I mean 'cares' in the broadest sense of the word. Marc's leadership on organizing against the various discriminatory legislation in the US is a great external example. Know that this extends to our internal structure as well and is the bedrock of our corporate culture. I'm gushing, I know, but it's truly how I feel.",Know that there is a high pace to the work at Salesforce. We work in an area of the industry with tremendous growth and continued growth potential.

On the inside, it's really cool.  I've had a chance to work with a lot of customers, build cool apps with them, and work with some brilliant people.  Not HQ--this is a non-hub remote location, doing Sales Engineering.

If you do great work and do some gentle self-promotion (posting your work and helping others) then you get recognition and rewards for that.

You really can't ask for more than that.","It's rather frantic.  If you like knowing what you'll be doing a few weeks from now, that doesn't happen here.

8842,Salesforce,"Amazing company, but it has real challenges",2016-03-11,4.0,Director,"The perks are there, but the culture is what matters. There's a sense of purpose about why Salesforce exists and how every employee can contribute to that purpose. 

* People are smart - if you are open, you will learn a lot
* The work is challenging - this not a place for slackers
* Plenty of non-human resources - you'll more tools to do your job than at most companies. 
* Can be a very collaborative work environment","* Salesforce is developing a hubris, similar to what I saw at Microsoft and other large companies. It smacks of ""but we're salesforce, we're hot s***"" - We're not listening as well as we should. There's a distinction between confidence and arrogance that is being missed.

* Sometimes senior employees, those with 6 or 7 or more years with salesforce often exhibit the most narrow thinking about how to approach problems. There's a tendency to rely on what's worked before and apply the standard old salesforce playbook to new problems and challenges. This reinforces narrow thinking and devalues the experience of newcomers.

*The headcount growth has negatively impacted the social and emotional intelligence of the organization. New hires sometime struggle to integrate into the culture and develop the healthy and authentic  relationships that facilitate higher performance. They flounder and leave too soon.

* There's a growing cognitive dissonance between the 'practice mindfulness' and 'work/life balance' that is preached and the pressure to do the work and volunteer more (56 hours a year). It generates cynicism. 

* The cost of living in the SF Bay Area is ridiculous"

Focus on giving back (1:1:1) is pervasive throughout the company.,"Infrastructure engineering is very top heavy.  It's become an org of overpriced ex Microsoft executives that have not delivered anything of value to the company and the group.  There is complete lack of innovation in management style or technology. They have brought with them the management style of the 90's, which didn't really work to well for MSFT.  The feeling in the group is contempt for Salesforce and the people committed to Salesforce.  People work in fear, which is not the culture it was before they joined.  It's sad to see the disregard that they have towards building an org on the values of Salesforce.  Bad  behavior and horrible treatment of individuals has been overlooked time and time again by HR and management."

Everything about the company is world class. The benefits, the opportunities, the projects, the technology, and even the compensation for most roles. Some of the sales reps get a raw deal with territories, but if you're one of the lucky ones, you can really do well.

Salesforce continues to lead the pack in innovative social policies. They were one of the first major companies to initiate a comprehensive review of female compensation, which is very much appreciated. Some women at the company received substantial raises, which one one hand is great, but on the other hand raises some uncomfortable questions.","This is a tough one, because I love this company in so many ways. I'm not a bitter ex-employee; on the contrary, I'm extremely happy here and I want to have a long career with Salesforce.  That's what breaks my heart about how little commitment to diversity the company has.

To illustrate the point, I am black, and I cannot reveal my gender and office location, because doing so would reveal my identity. That's how few black employees we have at the company. 

Now, it's easy to fall back on the usual tech industry explanation of there being a ""pipeline issue"" that ties to minority education in STEM. There's absolutely truth to that, as you can't recruit what's not there. 

But here's the thing: when you fill your ranks with the same type of people in order to maintain some sort of ""company culture"", you create an environment in which the employees don't have enough exposure to people not like them to think of them as co-workers. The proof? If even your fictional website, PowerPoint and product demo characters are all white, there's a deeper problem than a simple ""pipeline issue"". It means non-white people are not part of your worldview.  

The implications of that are dire."

Salesforce has a wonderful culture of giving back time and money to the community. There is no doubt that people abuse this benefit, but for the majority of people who actually use the volunteer time off to volunteer, this benefit can't be beat!

All vending in all offices is free and unlimited. I didn't partake often, but for those days when I really needed something in the mid-afternoon or just had to have something sweet, it was a very awesome perk. The beer tap and winerator were nice perks, too.","It can be very difficult to get out of a specific role or department if you're not in the HQ offices. 

Promotions and raises are based on favoritism: whoever management likes best gets promoted and gets the biggest raises. If senior management doesn't have first hand knowledge of an employee because the employee is in a different office, it is not at all likely that the employee will be promoted or get a raise. 

Benefits could be better. The free vending is nice and the beer and wine is great, but rather than spending money on all of those perks, better benefits would be appreciated."

*Business acumen & makeup of sales talent is excellent on the whole
*Salesforce is a very powerful logo on any resume
*The company is a cross-selling machine. Understanding the breadth of solutions available to sell - and doing it - is a tremendous opportunity for development
*Fantastic future outlook for the business. Take advantage of the ESPP program!","*Highest performers in the commercial space seem to be most adept at structuring contracts - not necessarily at creating business impact for customers. This feels like a symptom of the Oracle influx in recent years
*The mega-growth is great, but the growth necessitates faster promotions and shrinking territories. This creates a unique burden on often inexperienced management to evaluate sales talent subjectively. Subjective decisions on promotions and territory carving - even when correct - often creates discontent among individual contributors who believe they've been evaluated unfairly.
*Promotions happen quickly, and therefore require individual contributors and even first line managers to spend more time managing internal politics than delivering value to customers.
*Commercial customers often have 2-3 different AE's (account managers) per year, which can make it difficult to establish a relationship. The result is that even great customers view Salesforce as a vendor instead of a partner in their growth.
*Selling into the enterprise space is exciting at Salesforce, but sales talent turnover is staggering."

The people that you encounter seem to take a genuine interest and have made time to help.  They are a growth company and very successful in that space and that helps with morale -- people like being with a winner.

The benefits, I found, are very good.  It's great where you know that stuff is taken care of and you can focus on getting the customers to where they want to go.  There are even extras that show the company is actually concerned about their employees well-being, not just normal medical health.","The company is going through some intense growth right now and, as a result, you can tell that some are overwhelmed.  There are many processes in place, but even they are showing some stress from the rate.

Work IN the city - no commute! 

Incredibly passionate CEO who in the 5 years I've been at Salesforce where I've watched us grow from 5K to 20K employees, he STILL replies to personal emails from employees. He's amazing. His enthusiasm  is infectious. And his philanthropic passion is admirable. 

Flexible work environment - easy to WFH if necessary without feeling like you're missing out. 

Camaraderie among team and company - on a global scale. 

Travel - just recently I was asked to go to Japan. Incredible experience immersing myself into our office there and really getting to know the culture and people who up until then, was all conducted remotely. Total game changer when given the opportunity to sit down face to face!!","Staying informed among the management chain changes. Lots of movement - all good things but definitely not doing a great job communicating those changes to employees first. I'm fortunate because I work in a department privy to that info, but to speak on  behalf of other departments not close to HR, I know they feel lost and surprised too often. Many times creating unnecessary scares causing folks to prematurely jump ship - most boomerang back but k feel if we could get in front of this, we could reduce the boomerang rate. 

Additionally, RSU and overall stock grants to a limited number of employees. At my former employer, I was given RSUs off the bat but not here at SFDC and I've been here almost 5 years and in a fairly senior role. Not sure why that's the case. Colleagues feel the same and those good friends of mine who got stock are shocked I have none. Seems like a basic perk but it's not given to everyone :("

The salary is excellent, benefits unparalleled, and the culture is one of generosity and giving back (volunteer hours are highly encouraged and employees can take time off work, with pay, to give back to their communities locally and globally).","The pace is very fast.  There is a lot of travel and sometimes little guidance, Salesforce hires smart people and expects them to dive in the deep end and not only to swim..but to win the race and to coach the rest of the pack while doing it.  I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a con personally though - I like the moving fast, and learning and innovating on a daily basis."

Every month feels like it's end of quarter or end of year and managers care more about following the sales playbook versus helping you close the deal.

Well respected in the community
SOME absolutely amazing people (diminishing as we speak)","When I first joined this company 2 years ago, it was full of passionate people who cared about the company, the products, and most importantly, each other.  Employee success was paramount to company success, and we had a leadership team that recognized that.

Now, with the infiltration of Salesforce (which, don't get me wrong, Salesforce is great in its own way, but that greatness has not manifested in Indianapolis - it's been mostly destructive), the Marketing Cloud leadership team is much more concerned with making people like Marc Benioff and Alex Dayyon happy rather than creating a culture of happy employees.  In a recent ""V2MOM"" session, leadership blatantly voted ""employee success"" as the LEAST important value among 6-7 value options.  Don't you get it?  Happy and successful employees lead to good product, good service, and thriving business!!

As I look around, I see a bunch of people sitting there just doing bare minimum to collect a paycheck, others frantically trying to cling to the last bit of Orange culture they can find, and a select few who thrive in this new environment of ""nothing matters but the bottom line"".  I'm sure that the short term business outlook will be great, as Salesforce manages to squeeze the last bit of quality work out of employees, but if this keeps up, there's no long term to speak of."

Salesforce by far has the greatest culture. There is a lot of energy and passion you can feel in the air. The company treats people right. There is no emphasis on constant evaluation like you see at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. The result is that the employees are self-motivated to be productive and innovative and collaborative. Benefits are excellent, including receiving pay for volunteer work you do for nonprofits. They match donations you make, even those to your local church or synagogue.","- The CEO and company are very outspoken in support of progressive causes.

The workplace is very fun and exciting. It is a fast paced environment where everything changes.","The training program for many positions is limited, which creates a more on-the-job-learning environment.

Learned quite a bit and would recommend the company to other executives.","As the company grows it is challenged with losing its ""soul"". Company ""edicts"" don't seem to be shared or implemented by all sections of the company. Still quite a bit of ""politics"" between groups  and individuals which can get in the way of even greater ideas and success. Salesforce risks becoming ""ORACLE-ized"" with the influx of so many ORACLE veterans.  Daisey-chain decision making is deeply rooted and changing it will be difficult."

Because of this you have a lot of political jockeying at the top, with little regard for the individuals suffering from low touch leadership. A symptom of this behavior is the fact that the company is extremely top heavy, with half of the ""directors"" in the company having few to no direct reports under them. Additionally, good luck actually getting an effective interview at Salesforce, as the recruiting is the worst I've ever seen.

Having worked at Oracle prior I was pleasantly surprised at the level of employee engagement and openness to the company vision and strategy. Mostly Tier 1 people that you work with in Tier 1 facilities and tools. A great place to expand your network and learn how a well run company is run.,Hi growth may mean you will get paired down to a very small sales territory or a very specific job in another function. Make sure you know what your responsibilities and span of control will be going in.

The biggest pros about Salesforce is that you get to work on great software and have a work-life balance along with it.,No real cons.

AE's are treated as commodity, and goals and expectations are constantly being updated with new demands making it difficult to stay focused on brining in new ACV.  Top brass constantly preaches how we're a customer company and how we love our customers, yet we offer no support, training or resources unless they pay through the nose.  Free resources are not good enough to get clients going, and company doesn't really care if they renew or not."
9205,Salesforce,Technical Program Manager (Developer Relations),2015-09-11,3.0,Technical Program Manager | Developer Evangelist Team,"* Worked at Developers Relations Team 
* I loved this company, I still love its innovation, I respect and admire but inside world is little different 

- Cutting edge technologies, culture of innovation push company moving forward in fast pace
- You learn how to market products much more than any other peers in market
- Exciting and positive outlook about company, that keep you motivated
- Great give back culture, not question on CEO Leadership and philanthropic nature that is ingrained in company","- Its not engineering company, let me clear, this is Sales/Market, they do it very well and they are great at it and they know it very well. 

- Half finished products, over marketed to kill competitors 

- Work at google/facebook, you realize the products they realize are how developers first, and how salesforce products are 'Sales' first 

- Work Life Balance - You better be ready to for it, you get burned out so easily, because of repeated release you are always in deadline and pressure to finish. Upper management in Evangelist Team should be engineers 

Dreamforce  : Life is hell for employees, ready to work late hours, when I say, its mean 1 am in night and back again by 8am  (Though excitement of carnival keep your motivated)

- Salary low comparison to other competitors, you make more as Salesforce lead in other companies than salesforce itself

- Stop politics in upper management, learn from Facebook/Google

- Slow growth in Developer Relations/ Evangelist Team, you work hard, hard and hard and smart speakers takes the credit, you will be give 'bare minimum credit' of what you innovated or created from scratch 

- It is not an engineering company, you won't see real engineers in Facebook/Google for the most, they are innovative but deadline is more important that robust technologies, so clearly yes its not proper engineering company

- Ask this question, how much Salesforce is used inside (Technical Evangelist) team, they know the platform is limited, but go in dreamforce, you see whole different story

- Working both outside and inside Salesforce, I see major flaws in marketing of products and they way they actually are, clients are super pissed because of repeated and constant updates and low backward compatibility, they purchase and are stuck"
9206,Salesforce,Great company and only getting better.,2015-09-11,5.0,Project Manager,"Great place to work.  Work life balance is wonderful.  Although I think this depends on your manager and the teams you are apart of.  However, as a standard, this place sets a great example.  I'm fortunate to work with my team.",Fast pace and at times people do not have a realistic understanding of timing for projects.  Which makes you feel like you aren't able to shine at times because it is never delivered fast enough.  This isn't always the case but mostly with T&P teams.
9207,Salesforce,AE,2015-09-11,3.0,Account Executive,Great great technology and product to sell.  The development team here are off the charts good.  The Sales Engineers are world class.  I love Marc's mission cry and every time I hear Patrick or Keith speak I'm in a fit of joy to go out and help new customers.  High octane and high IQ environment.  Some greats here for sure.,"The leadership here needs to provide management training to VPs.  While the training AE's get is 2nd to none, the direct management and coaching falls extremely short.  For example, 6 months in, I have yet to have any kind of a review or coaching.   

There's also a common thread of jaded sales reps here.  For example, ""I took x account almost to the finish line, the fiscal year ended, and someone else got credit for the deal.""  This is a systemic problem because I have noticed those reps no longer enter information into Salesforce..what's the point if you'll lose the client next year.  

Team building - really another surprising gap here. I'm sure San Francisco HQ doesn't have this problem.   

Too new to be offended but the above is real.   We get the ""best company to work for"" but really its the ""best product to sell.""  Which isn't bad but not great."

Work life balance is good. If you wanna sit and grow at a steady pace then it's great. Don't expect too many merit based incentives. 

Some free lunches. Easy to switch teams parallely. Vertical movement is easier for management. Horizontal movement is extremely scrutinized (they would rather hire inexperienced interns than in-house and train someone for a position)

Company stocks are great. Bonuses are ok. Company has still a lot of room to grow which is great for its workers.","If you are the kind of person who thrives on appearance and taking credit for others work OR if you're a manager. Then this is the place for you. Work is not connected to pay. The impression of work is. 

Manager are pretty much guaranteed promotions every year if they don't distribute their budget on promoting their hires. I've known developer who've left because of this and also conscientious managers who were tired of playing the devil.

9265,Salesforce,Beware of micro-managers and ass-kissing execs,2015-08-05,2.0,,"Decent pay, good benefits, flexible telecommuting policy, nice co-workers","Transitioning from start-up to big corporation, execs are young and eager to please parent company in Cali by kissing up while transferring the stress to employees. Zero tolerance for mistakes but not giving any warning sign until the last minute before they fire you. Due to poor location excellent employees are few and far between, so mediocre but ass-kissing people get to stay. Managers are all great players of politics. Employees don't dare to speak their mind just to keep their jobs in the ""best"" company of the area.  Mid-level people managers have no clue in managing so resort to micromanagement. Typical ""boys club"" culture with no advancement opportunity for female. Only those who play well with their managers and drink the Salesforce cool-aid will thrive. The V2MOM is a joke as performance review has nothing to do with it, meaning delivering results doesn't mean you are good enough. Fear of mistakes and risk averse mindset is suffocating the humanity and innovation this company once had."

9268,Salesforce,"Chill place but no ""engineering excellence""",2015-07-31,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The best thing about working here is that it's relatively relaxing as the company is doing well. The company is generous about your hours and let's you do things like volunteer your time.,"That being said, seriously, most people that work here are hacks and idiots. It's 2015 and they're building software like it's still 1998. Don't expect to come here and learn anything other than how to pass the hot potato. You'll spend 95% of your time doing ""keep the lights on"" work, fixing messes that were created 5+ years ago but people were to dumb to notice. Those people who made those messes are no in key, influential positions within the company, where their questionable decision making has maximum impact to shoot themselves in the foot."

9271,Salesforce,Straight out of college,2015-07-31,5.0,"Associate Member of Technical Staff, Quality Engineer","I had competitive offers from multiple companies, but I decided to go with Salesforce for a few reasons. What stuck out during the hiring process was:
1) I was a real person to Salesforce, and I really mattered. At another company in the Bay Area (which is widely considered to be *the* most prestigious company to work for... no specifics, but it's a search engine that starts with a G), I had an interviewer call me 1 hour late for an interview and 15 minutes late for the rescheduled interview, on top of telling me that their interview process was 6-8 weeks long and was totally inflexible. At Salesforce, on the other hand, every interview started right on the dot of the scheduled time and the hiring process was just under 3 weeks from beginning to end. I had to have special accommodations and stay an extra night after the interview due to a disability that makes it difficult to travel late at night, and they extended my hotel booking without any question. 
2) All the employees are passionate about their work. This is because of a system called Open Opportunity Market where you are allowed to leave your team and join any other team with an open spot during releases. Basically, everyone does the job that they want and nobody is stuck in a role they hate.
3) Everyone is super friendly. My interviewers all asked me if I was comfortable, if I needed a break/anything to drink/a snack. 

Now that I'm here, I'm happy with the decision I made. I think my favorite thing about the company is that they are very open to change. Management really, really listens to what everyone wants, whether it's a change in development process or better snacks in the kitchen. The work/life balance is great - you can work remotely as often as you'd like and you can come in/leave whenever as long as you're productive. There's catered lunches all the time and a full-service coffee shop in the office. The parties are great (I was second row to see Metallica at a company party 2 weeks after I joined!) and the people are awesome.","The development process can be cumbersome. The build breaks very often, and grabbing one bad changelist that breaks an essential component of the build can totally nuke your productivity for a whole day. 
Onboarding time takes 3-6 months since there are so many moving parts and a lot of different languages involved in development.
No parking at the offices in HQ since they're all in downtown San Francisco."

There was tremendous opportunity and rewards as it grew.","It got big - even bigger now.

9279,Salesforce,Best company I've worked for to date.  Highly recommend joining the Salesforce team,2015-07-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Huge emphasis on the importance of charitable giving and being environmentally sustainable (backed by 6 paid volunteer days per employee annually, $5000 annual employee match for charitable giving, frequent internal charitable events)

-Prioritizes engaging employees by aligning personal career goals with each employee's duties and encouraging movement between functions and departments throughout the company

-Incredibly intelligent workforce: Salesforce is able to use its strong brandname to hire only the top talent and as a result has an environment where you are constantly challenged and learning, which continuously develops your own skill set.  (Less than 1% of applicants receive employment offers)

-Strong community environment: Salesforce has been able to build a corporate family unlike any company I've been a part of before.  People honestly care for each other and will go out of their way to look out for past and present employees.  Salesforce focuses on working as a team rather than separate individuals which develops a sense of inclusion.

-Incredible parties: Salesforce certainly caters to a more extroverted, lively and connected personality by having frequent social and networking events throughout the year

-$100/mth employee fitness benefit and health benefits that are largely absorbed by the company.  Free yoga classes and espresso bars are also offered in some offices

-Offices are generally situated in the heart of cities rather than in suburbs","-Headcount growing perhaps too quickly which could transform the community feel to a more corporate environment

-Does not offer full meals (light snacks and beverages are provided)

-Signals of a more corporate future ahead evidenced by a shift away from local vendors to their global competitors"
9280,Salesforce,Quality assurance specialist,2015-07-23,2.0,Quality Assurance Specialist,Scheduling around work is great. Once you are in your position for awhile you kind of get to do what you want.

They (their executives) openly lied to me during the interview process to lure me into the role and and the end the accounts/territory I received was a total disappointment, and if that was not enough: I was given a territory totally different from the local territory we discussed and they ended up sending me to sell to states in a completely different region of the US in a different time zone.

I have insight into product direction and how things are going financially, I have impact on who we hire and who I work with, and I get to see immediate value from the work I put in. Salesforce gives me all the tools and resources that I need to do my job, and any time I've needed help from HR or IT, the big company pros are there. Salesforce want's me to spend my entire career here, and what I initially thought would just be a few years looks like it could be a lot longer.","It is a big company, and knowledge transfer is always tricky.

Honestly, I have been working technology for over a decade now and my time at salesforce has been really positive. There are tonnes of technology jobs on offer around Dublin but from speaking with friends in other companies - salesforce offer one of the best opportunities to grow your career and bank balance. 

Don't get me wrong - I have seen some people take on the role of SMB and within 6 months it's obvious that they just aren't a good fit for technology solution selling. 
I personally have had to work my behind off and thankfully this year I'll be getting promoted to MM and I really look forward to the challenge ahead of me. 

If your considering a job with salesforce ask yourself 

1. Do I want to work for the worlds most innovative tech company?
2. Does it matter if management really encourage me to give back to the local community and do some rewarding charity work? (It's real and trust me - you'll be overwhelmed by how good it feels)
3. Is career development really that important?
4 Could i spend €5K per year educating myself?
5. Would I enjoy working for a company that has a work hard/ play hard buzz?

If yes is the answer then I really don't know of a better gig than salesforce.... 

FYI - the reason I'm using this forum right now is because my manager just did me a huge favour regarding my current promotion and this is my way of balancing the Karma!!

Good perks","Working in the Dublin office of Salesforce is a risky career choice. I lasted jusy over eight months. After five weeks of onboarding/training which went very well, I was assigned to a territory which was cold, underworked and full of manufacturing companies, no interest in Salesforce. It took me about 2 months longer than expected for me to warm up the territory and get some results. 

This wasn't enough for my manager. I put my trust in him but over a period of months he manipulated and undermined me until I was forced to resign. He didn't support me in any way, criticised me unnecessarily and used veiled threats to force me out. I attended team meetings where the same manager was openly sexist, slanderous about previous employees he had fired and even made jokes about an employee who suffered from cancer. 

Favouritism is common. A female member of my team got the best accounts and much more support than other team members to boost my manager's ego. She succeeded even though she worked far less than the rest of us.

9348,Salesforce,8 years in and I love this place,2015-06-17,5.0,Regional Sales Manager,"This review will probably come off biased as I've spent the last 8 years at SF and have grown my career with the company. I also met my wife at SF and we now have a lovely 2 year old daughter so suffice to say the decision to work here has proved a good one personally as well as professionally. I started fresh out of university with no idea what CRM or cloud computing was in a biz dev role, progressed into sales and am now a sales manager. Here are the top reasons I love SF:

- upward mobility: the company is growing 30% YoY and with growth comes opportunity. I've held 6 positions in 8 years working here.

- people & culture: I'm humbled on a daily basis by the people I work with. SF employees are smart, ambitious, fun and tend to genuinely care about the communities we work in and the world around us. There are exceptions to every rule, of course, but by and large we're a hard-working, fun-loving, high-achieving group that is just as collaborative as we are competitive. 

- pay: money talks! Compensation and benefits are top notch. For those in sales, the base pay will seem low but in 8 years I've never made less than 30% more than my OTE (base + commission).

- trust: the vast majority of the people I've reported to have instilled a lot of trust in me to get my job done without interfering or micro-managing my day-to-day.","Pace: SF moves fast. Change is constant. You need to be comfortable being uncomfortable. This is not for everyone. If you're looking to rest on your laurels in a comfy position, you need not apply.  

Fiscal Year: this is a petty gripe but a valid one. The SF fiscal year ends January 31st, which means Christmas/New Year timeframe is one of the our busiest times of year. Taking vacation in December/January is highly discouraged given it's the busy season, not ideal if you're accustomed to taking time off for the holidays. 

Cross-Functional Collaboration: compared with most companies I've seen, we do a great job of collaborating across departments/functions to get the job done. Some would say we're world class in this department, but as a SF veteran my expectations are high and I think we can do better. At times certain departments feel misaligned and for us to continue growing we need to move as one tightly aligned organization."

They respect their employees.","It's gotten huge, a lot of folks do come from Oracle and you feel more and more like a little cog in a huge machine."
9353,Salesforce,Good stepping stone towards your real #dreamjob,2015-06-14,3.0,Sales Representative,"Salesforce has several things going for it if viewed from the outside.
- They have a truly exceptional product which makes it easy to sell and believe in
- They offer an ESPP program which, considering the company's growth rate, is a very lucrative benefit for employees taking advantage of it
- Their benefits are above average; Health insurance, dental, vision, discounts from other companies (hotels, gyms, consumer goods, services), paid volunteer time off
- Plenty of training and self growth opportunities
- Supportive managers (with exception and to the best of their ability)
- CEO everything he makes himself out to be and more.  Truly the only reason Salesforce had a fighting chance in the beginning.","Now that we have gone over some of the marginal benefits of working for Salesforce, lets spend some time reviewing the truly disappointing aspects that seem to be ignored when the poll for ""Best company to work for"" is taken:

1. Quotas are not based on past territory performance averages but are instead standardized across the board.  Compounding on this is the fact that territory assignments are completely based on need not performance.  This means that someone with Alabama as their territory must meet the same quota as someone with California or New York as their territory.  This creates resentment among reps and leads to many people leaving for better offers.  

2. Outdated school of thought around increasing revenue growth and productivity.  This may be obvious to some, but hiring people like Keith Block, who helped grow and create the very companies we at Salesforce are trying to bring change to, could only cause issues.  The most significant of which is their belief that increasing the number of activities increases their revenue growth by the same percentage increase.  This doesn't work. All it does is make employees resent management.  Keith, if you read this, look up ""Marginal Product of Labor"" and think about your current growth initiatives of mandating unachievable minimum activity levels for your employees.

3. Salesforce is currently paying their new hires more than their tenured sales dev reps.  Think about that.  How does a company claim to care about their employees yet pays well below the industry average and doesn't roll out pay increases to all employees in a department.  Benioff likes to talk about gender pay equality, but I know for a fact there are experienced women making less then inexperienced men in the same position.  This goes the same for the reverse.  What makes this even more upsetting is that they did not inform anyone of this.  The reps found out on their own.  Again, decreasing trust in management.

4. Stagnent internal growth.  They promise promotions in 12 months or less but in reality, they have created such a toxic work environment people are looking for ways out of sales dev slowing this process to 15 months or more.

5. Politics, politics, politics. For a company that claims to have that ""Start-Up"" feel, they seem to suffer from all the major issues you find at larger companies.  Management is run completely top down with zero confidence in others leading to low level managers being the bearers of bad news rather than mentors.

6. Below average compensation.  I won't say much more on this, but the starting salary here means you're living paycheck to paycheck in San Francisco.  

I could go on, but I think these give you an idea of the way the company is headed.  In case you were wondering, this decline in work environment began right around the same time Keith Block was brought on.  Interesting coincidence some would say.

All of this essentially leads to Salesforce creating one of the most sought after employees in the industry while simultaneously pushing them to the point that they would rather change companies than stay at the ""Best place to work"" in the Bay."

9387,Salesforce,Keep innovating....,2015-05-22,5.0,Senior Member of Technical Staff,"1. Salesforce R&D has one of the best talent in software industry. 

2. Despite being the best in what they do, people are accessible, down to earth and very polite. You can pretty much talk to engineers/managers at any level at any time.

3. I can't speak for the whole R&D, but I have never felt any politics in engineering teams yet. Most importantly, I have never heard anyone talking ill about someone behind their back. The environement is very positive and people love what they are doing.

4. You are given sufficient time to understand your project, see the big picture and get training.

5. Work life balance is great, I never had to work overtime or weekends, expect for the planned releases, for which you get comp day off.","Salesforce has over 15k employees, about 90% of them are sales guys, which I can not speak for. For R&D:
1. Hiring standards has been deteriorating day by day. We used to be really great at it, but now we are hiring people blindly. If we are to maintain the quality, we need to standardize the process, and learn from top tech companies(as we claim to be one). We pay pretty well compared to top tech firms in bay area, and I am sure with right interview process and effort from recruiters(hire more recruiters and tell them to reach out to everyone), we should we able to hire great engineers.

2. We have too many titles in R&D, this is great to keep employees motivated and promote them and I get that. BUT, you got to respect the title. I have seen people with very less experience and contributions, becoming Principle Engineers. I bet, these so called Principle Engineers, wont be able to pass entry level engineer's interview at a good tech company. PLEASE FIX THIS.

3. Another thing which is hurting the quality of engineering organization is letting QAs move to development without any interviews. I agree with the idea of allowing people to move between roles and do different things, but we must maintain the same interview standards while doing so. We all know that hiring standards for dev and QA are far apart, then letting QAs move to dev so easily has become a shortcut and no one is getting benefitted by this other than the individual. This hurts both dev team (as now they have to explain every line of code to QA) and it also hurts QA team as they will always have to hire new QAs (since the existing ones become dev)

4. I am not sure if this is salesforce or recruiters, but they dont give you good equity if you dont negotiate hard. The equity I have seen so far is around 50% of what a tech company in bay area (at our level) offers.

5. We have a great work culture at company, which is getting polluted by more and more higher management coming from Microsoft and Oracle. I always wonder, why we never get higher management from companies we admire (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn....). Now, these new managers are polluting the culture by thier micromanagement philosophy of earliest companies. For  instance, now managers are asking receipt for $7 lunch arranged for a team meeting. This is not salesforce."

The role is challenging since you get questions from everybody at the client ecosystem, from junior developers to CIO and BA's to Business leaders. You constantly move from technically complex issues to IT Strategy, adoption, and other matters. Pretty demanding. If you get an out of town customer, then you will be traveling as well (generally at least 50% - can be more).

I even won awards for innovation and developing new ways to work.  At one point it ""was"" a great place to work. In late 2013, I got a new manager. She made lots of comments about wanting people on her team who were ""young and hungry"".  I turned 58 last year and assume I just got too old for her and the company. She eliminated my job, told me it wasn't personal, gave me a 6 week severance package and sent me on my way. Now, after 15 months of unemployment, I've lost my house, am living in my car and desperately trying to find a job.  I had a great career that was ruined by this manager. HR let it happen knowing what a good employee I was.  They just wanted to make my manager happy. For all their claims of being socially conscious and their philanthropic work, they certainly didn't care about me. 

The company is very calculated in their claims about promoting women. Right before I left, they had terminated at least 12 female VP's. Some were replaced with men."

I used to dream of a job where I would be happy ""doing my thing"" at least 50% of the time.  I never dreamed I could enjoy work this much - it's hard to call it work.  For those skeptics, I've been around the block with some top tier Chicagoland companies - they don't even compare to the culture, daily responsibilities. career mobility, and pay that you get here.  You are absolutely surrounded by brilliant people that want nothing more than to help you learn and be successful. Team members are amazing to work with.  Everyone works together.","You create your own way at Salesforce. You must be confident in your strengths and self aware of your weaknesses.  They will not create that path for you, you have to do it.  For some that is great, for others they need that plan laid out.  Management can only help you so much in that.  For a company growing this fast there are positions created everyday.  You must have patience and savvy to find the next right role for yourself.  Management will guide you, but you own your career.  There isn't a defined path.  You aren't always going to know all the options available.  

It's a very fast paced environment.  For everyone to work together they must communicate well.  This means seeking to understand, asking the right questions, and being flexible.  In sales this requires confidence and humility, not arrogance.  Egos can get in the way if they aren't controlled.  This takes a team."

Salesforce does a phenomenal job at caring for their customers, as well as their employees. There is so much room for growth and Salesforce empowers you to make this your career rather than a stepping stone. The best career decision I've ever made was coming onboard to Salesforce.","When you are a new hire, it feels like information overload. The learning curve is very sharp so you need to make sure you are constantly asking questions and gathering as much information as you can.

The hiring process is very engaged, thorough & challenging, even if you are referred, which lends to the talent that you work alongside. The job has grown my professional skill set ten fold, especially in my business & selling acumen. From a selling perspective I would describe the pay and OTE to be undersold and over delivered vs. other sales jobs that sell you on high OTE's that almost always fall short.

You want access to all your recent pay stubs? Instant list of all your maternity leave guidelines? All info is easy to access when it comes to HR. Salesforce is flexible when you need a few hours off for a doctor's appointment or something. If you have a role where you get to travel, you get to stay in nice hotels and have a cushy budget for meals.","Main cons are that it's a huge corporation and things get done sloowwwwly compared to startups and smaller companies. No matter what your role, it seems there's someone else doing the exact same thing in a different part of the company who is completely siloed from you, and it all gets very confusing. Projects take a long time to complete because a million people need to approve. Many people just don't reply to emails or show up to meetings because they're ""too busy."" Still, I think it's a 4-star workplace because you can easily do good work and get paid well without stressing yourself out too much.

That just creates unnecessary chaos. They have all the resources they need, but yet every day every single employee is constantly scrambling. There is something inherently wrong here.

9478,Salesforce,Avoid the Site Reliability team,2015-04-08,1.0,Site Reliability Engineer,"* Decent Salary
* Health insurance
* Nice equipment
* Good outings","These cons are related to the Site Reliability structure. Some other structures may have similar issues.

To begin with there is actually no SRE job per se, It's actually a NOC position. Originally Salesforce had a NOC to handle incidents etc but under new management the goal of the team changed. The new goal was to automate their way out of trouble. Unfortunately this got as far as changing the name of the team to Site Reliability but not much else. When I interviewed (a lengthy process indeed) I was under the impression that the majority of the work would be engineering and analysis with firefighting and root cause analysis thrown in. This piqued my interest but when I actually joined the actual job was very different. 

Picture this: You are one of a team of 4 or 5 ""SRE"" (I emphasize the quotes) and each of you handle a different role each day (10 hour days x 4 days a week....weekend work also which sucks the life out of you). The first role which is the worst is the console operator. You are made to watch a console with many different alerts coming in from thousands of systems. It's your job to watch this for 10 hours, click and confirm each alert[hundreds in a day) and create tickets and escalate as necessary. If you miss an alert which escalates to an issue be prepared to be chewed out by your manager and anyone else who wants to blame you. Nevermind the fact that you were staring at several hundred alerts for the past 5 hours and just slightly tired!

The second role does the same as above but stares at email and the chatrooms for any engineers who want to execute a chance (SRE don't execute changes, they're the gatekeepers). Super boring!

The third/fourth/fifth roles handles escalations from the others although if it involves networks or databases they go straight to different teams. The most complex issue you would probably investigate is a server falling over. There is little time for actual software engineering as much of the time you will be closing the many many many many silly tickets that were opened. If you do get to carry out some scripting, be prepared to get pulled off to cover for incidents (of which there are plenty), time off or go through hoops to get your change implemented. If you get to do this role then you will probably spend most of your time looking at jobsites.

Plus Salesforce is so big someone is probably working on your idea. Want to fix monitoring? There's a team for that (M&M). Want to build automation? There's a team for that (DCA). Want to build tools for your team? There's a team for that (SRE Tools). All that is left is incident management which itself deserves an entire post.

I realized my mistake in joining the team after 2 months. It took me a long time to get out as I had lost valuable skills while there. If you want to join Salesforce then I would recommend the Operations Engineering division."

One particular manager was notoriously difficult to work with and had a reputation for bullying, playing favouritism, and making most people feel uncomfortable by employing a management style of intimidation.  Despite multiple HR violations against him for his aggressive behaviour, nothing was ever done to rectify it.  

You're not encouraged to work as a team, but instead, encouraged to develop ways of getting ahead of others through sometimes unethical means.  Middle management will overlook any unethical, throwing-under-the-bus behaviours if it means you help them hit their numbers and make them look good.

Some managers understand this and work with you to maximize your results until the next year when things can be re-balanced, others are quick to terminate.

As a result of this territory lottery, success and failure can come quickly.  I've seen folks promoted on a single deal in which they made over 70% of their annual number but otherwise similar results."

Constant bombardment of incidents with a mountain of beaurocratic tasks to wrap up incidents. Promises of higher level experience never materialise. Having to compete with fellow staff to get leave. Management blame staff for refusal to keep up with workload even though refuse to hire more as well refuse to allow use of higher level skills to automate tasks. Management expect staff to be personal secretary and dig up information for their own reports. Management constantly shouting and over all culture of bullying.

It's really been a nightmare.,"I've worked in the Salesforce ecosystem for over 10 years and I'm probably going to leave.  I've been working at the company less than two months--albeit as a contract employee (although my title is technically ""Agency Temp--so sad, and the reason this even matters is one of the security questions when you call Global Services (the help desk) which I had to do 9 times in my first two days because of PC problems (and I'm not kidding.) is ""What is your title?"" I'm not really a person keen on titles but ""Agency Temp"" doesn't describe my expertise or skill set and it certainly made me feel like a second class citizen.  Maybe it's because I'm not a big company person.  I also heard ""contractors don't get desks""  Nice.  That's not legal.  So buyer beware.  My agency on-boarding was also horrific.  My commute into the city is terrible. I love SFDC and have made my living around it.  I don't want to sour on it and think I can make a bigger impact at a client.  I am also surrounded by two extremes--other Agency Temps and super stars who have been there for years who stick together. In addition, my boss is remote, extremely busy and they ""sold to me"" is the dog they start everyone on which has stalled for a year and half."

It has both young and old but both are equally energized. The customer base is solid and the company has critical mass to become a major force in cloud computing given the Salesforce1 Platform and extended clouds.

Corporate values are as solid as they get, and they enforce the values, which is a very needed change from my last employer. It is one thing to talk, it is another to walk. A big draw for me was the 1:1:1 charitable focus. When a company commits stock to their foundation from day one, it speaks volumes to the values.

Also, the company has a firm commitment to personal growth, that is enforced. Nice to see the teeth in the process. But they give you all the tools you need to be successful.",No real challenges so far other than things move fast and you have to keep pace.  Not really a bad thing?

They poke their nose in matters where they are not supposed to. Obvious they dont have lot of work to do and just jump in every meeting and talk nonsense.Consulting for salesforce has been painful. They have irrelevant personal conversations in the meetings which annoys  consultants from other firms. Still they are behaving like a start up company and never being matured. The height of immaturity is when they make fun of other company's boss and consultants right in front of them."
9549,Salesforce,"Unless you are Sales, stay away.",2015-02-11,1.0,Platform Analyst/Systems Administrative,"The barista is a total sweetheart.

Their offices are nice too... but putting lipstick on a pig doesn't make it pretty.","For being a tech company, this place could not keep anyone in IT for longer than 2 years, it seemed.  Salesforce has a ridiculous hierarchy that is rather militant in the way it handles internal communications (""My door is always open; however, you better not come to me before person a, b, c, and d"").  There is 0 transparency although they preach this in every pointless meeting they make you sit through.  

This company caters heavily to the Sales side of business, and no where else.  If you are IT in any sense of that side of business, then you can expect to be held to your best performing day for your entire career no matter how much of an outlier that day was, if you prove to be competent with what you do you can expect to be overloaded with work enough for those who are not, and then held to their expectations on top of your own.  Oh, and those people will get promoted before you, because you are too ""valuable"" to move from your spot.  And you can never expect to hear what you do right; every 1:1 you have with management is everything that you could possibly be doing better, always.  No thanks, no 'atta-boys, nothing.

You think you have co-workers in other departments?  The people you assist are your companies User's that you support?  Maybe these co-workers/users are your future friends/buddies?  No.  You have customers.  And you treat them as such at all times.

Your co-workers for the first few months of being hired are pretty great typically, until the vibe of this company is finally realized; which leads them into the cutthroat, every (wo)man for his/herself environment that management breeds.  

As a cherry on the top; Salesforce has this underlying community called femmeforce.  Now this could be innocent, and it could potentially do a lot of great things; however this is not what it is being used for and many of the current management are women who are extremely active in this community for the wrong reasons.  In our office 90% of the people who are leaving/being bullied out are male, and 70-80% of the new hires are women.  The obvious preferential treatment, and the lack of others who care enough to do anything about it is ulimately why I left this company.  I performed in the top 5 of a 40+ member team consistently across all stats; closures, professionalism, ""customer"" satisfaction, SLA; however, I was still offered an ultimatum: a severance package that is really hard to look away from, or the promise of an official write up that would not go the way I wanted, just because I was male working under a radical feminist.  That is not a joke, and not an exaggeration."

9552,Salesforce,"Was a great company to work for, not anymore!",2015-02-07,3.0,Manager,Salesforce was an amazing company with great culture and work environment.  It maintained its culture even during the years of exponential growth (2009-12).  The talent at this company is phenomenal. Opportunities to contribute and grow were great.,"A bunch of Oracle execs were hired over the last 3 years, and they have been busy replicating the Oracle culture here.  The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015.  Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this.  To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering?  QE heads are now reporting to development managers.  The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams.  So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere.  Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters.  QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE!

Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company.  R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time.  The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster.  The next attempt is starting in 2015.  Although there is not a lot of hope for it, many of the ""leaders"" driving this will surely make hay via promotions and stock grants."

9577,Salesforce,The Star Rating Says it All,2015-01-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. The company does offer some great opportunity for upward movement, which is great for those who are looking to begin or enhance their careers. 
2. The benefits are pretty good. 
3. Within the workplace there are a lot of amenities that other employers do not, i.e. food, drinks (non-alcoholic), and the occasional catered event is nice too. But on the other hand, this is all fluff.","Unfortunately there are a lot more Cons then there are Pros, which is a reflection of the location I was at: 

1. The Management in Technical Support could use some Management training. Call Center management is well known for creating drama, poor morale, and inconsistency within the workplace.
2. The Managers create a toxic environment by not caring about employee welfare and falsifying information to employees. The company prides itself in transparency, but it doesn't seem that, that is the case.  
3. If your not based in the headquarters office, it is extremely difficult to move into a new position, especially when your Managers has little to no interest in helping you grow professionally. 
4. Employees are not held to the same standard as their peers. If your Manager likes you, you can get away with whatever you want. If he/she doesn't like you, you should plan on finding a new job as they will lie to upper management.
5. Upon starting a position with Salesforce, do not expect training because you're not going to get it. They would rather have you slave away fixing their previous mistakes, rather than properly train you to be efficient and knowledgeable about the product. The ramping up process is an absolute joke and an insult!
6. There is not one Manager who can do your job. None of the Manager's know the Salesforce platform or have any technical aptitude. 
7. It is easy to get burnt out. For example 10 of the 12 months of my employment has consisted of 50 hour work weeks, full of insane workloads and the pressure to maintain specific metrics. They will squeeze every last bit of sanity and work out of you and all you get in return is the Managers cooking breakfast for you, which is an insult. Not only can they not manage, but they're also terrible cooks as well. 
8. There is a lot of self-serving people in Technical Support and on Account Management teams. Rather than being one united team, people only look out for themselves and will quickly step on your toes if it suits them. 
9. Your peers may appear to be on your side and want to make positive change with you. But they will be quick to stab you in the back if it means they will get in trouble.. Major lack of ""testinal fortitude"".
10.The morale in the office is equivalent to a prison. 
11. As a Manager you should leave personal opinions and judgments at the door. 
12. You can be extremely lazy, but have a good attitude and you will be treated like a top tier employee. If your a top performer but have the occasional bad day due to the high work volume and terrible workplace environment, your career will not flourish. 
13. Managers are never available. And when they are, if you have questions or concerns, it is a huge convenience for them.
14. The platform UI is straight out of 2005. Who uses i-Frames anymore? 
15. There's a lack of tools and resources available to do our jobs and Management will tell you the resources are coming, but they never do. Of if you do get them, it is too little, too late.
16. The company has lost its vision.. Being innovative doesn't involve buying other platforms/software and integrating it into your own. It is creating the product on your own."

The people that I work with are all A-players and the upper management is all willing to make time to talk to anyone. Salesforce is also a very fun company to work for because people have passion surrounding their work, but know when it's time to cool off. Lastly, our products are world-class, and I love being able to evangelize them both during work and after hours.","There are a lot of issues surrounding internal promotions, there's no way to sugarcoat it. People need to re-interview for every position and they are compared to their peers as well as external candidates, which ends up making people claw their way to promotions. I understand that it's the best for the business to hire the best for each role, but this does hurt morale and I think that overall becomes a negative impact on the business."

Company does give back to the community but ironically, squashes their own people while serving the needy.  Starting salary for Commercial AE was 100K.  Overtime (that everyone lies about) is the only guarantee for additional income and that's only available since the class action lawsuit forced all Corporate Sales to become hourly employees--that happened in 2011.","Others have said it and I wholeheartedly agree.  This was the worst professional experience of my career.  Learned a lot about how truly horrible a company can treat their employees.    Really hard to get a job here unless you know someone and I did--what I didn't know was how much I was lied to with the promise of making a living.  The only people who are happy here are the young kids who are striving to achieve success early on in their careers and those who have been at the company for years who are favored and given the good patches to actually make their goal.  Such an insidious culture with back stabbing, soul less individuals that starts with the top management and continues through middle management.  They are the worst.  The Junior VPs who have been there for years, so made it early on but they are worse than the Executive VPs because they really have no talent and have no clue how to manage good people.   Turnover rate is ridiculous and the actual number of people who make their goal is so incredibly low.  The cube culture  ensures that your cold calling (which is mostly what it has become) is heard by your boss so he, and the tenured people around you, can berate you for not moving the deal along.   And don't even think about working from home--get there at 7am or you are looked at as a loser for not being committed to the cause.   Selfish, manic, loud, seductive people do well here for a while or at least until they slip up and end up with the Dakota patch. Or quit because they can not take it anymore.    Drunken culture too which is encouraged by the annual Christmas party which costs millions--it's lavish and luxe--and shameful and gluttonous.   I had 3 friends quit for the exact same reasons I did and we look back at the experience unfortunately in the nightmares that still occur for the ""month's end"" because we are not closing squat."

-Prospecting, account  management, sales methodology, product training; they have a focus to provide best of class training

PRODUCTS
-Market leader in sales, service and marketing platforms 
-The market is maturing, but Salesforce stays ahead of the curve with continuous product improvements and acquisitions 

COMPENSATION
-Can be a very rewarding career

UPPER MANAGEMENT
-Visionaries, coaches, mentors.","ORACLE 2.0
-This terminology has been tossed around a lot thorough out these reviews. I view the Oracle effect on Salesforce through the following:

1) Middle Management 
-This is probably the worst part of Salesforce. These ""managers"" have been placed into these positions as the company grew too quickly. Salesforce will take Account Executives and place them into management positions without previous coaching/mentor experience 
-As a result, many (not all) of these managers will bastardize AEs. They are very quick to through AEs under the bus to save their image.
-These managers have no skills at coaching, helping, or mentoring. 
-I have personally been involved in one-on-one meetings where I have experienced a manager insulting myself and my work. I have witnessed AEs quit after one-on-one meetings as their manager pushed them beyond limits. 
-I have also witnessed managers insult clients. If the client ""pushes a deal"" outside of the month it is forecasted, managers will become overly aggressive with the client to pull it back. Sometimes this tactic works, but it upsets the client and destroys future relationships.
-Middle management will pick their favourite AEs and provide everything possible to ensure their success. 1.5, 2, 3x territories. Providing the best territories to their favourites. 
-I left Salesforce as my manager was insulting, rude, aggressive, upsetting to clients, and deceiving. They were not a coach, mentor, or visionary. 

2) Territory Management
-As stated in the Middle Management section, some AEs will get 1.5, 2, or 3x the territories 
-Management will tell you that each territory is cut evenly (laughable). So if an individual has 2x territories, they should have enough business to close 2x monthly quota
-Even though these lucky AEs have double the territories, your monthly quota is equal to theirs 
-If these lucky individuals sell 50% of plan in each territory (making up 100%) and you hit 98% of your plan, middle management will act like these individuals are the next Glengarry Glen Ross. Middle Management won't even give you a pat on the back.
-It is unfortunate to witness some individuals burn out quickly because they have to work 10x harder in a single territory as others have 2 or 3x territories with the same quota. 

3) Transformation of the AE Role
-When I first started, AEs were viewed as ""consultants"" with your clients. Your objective was to thoroughly work with your clients to uncover opportunities, manage the projects, and develop thorough business cases. Most importantly, we were to know our clients' business inside and out.
-The AE role has now changed into a business development rep. 
-Middle management will have you call blitz your clients (which they clients get annoyed with), try to identify an opportunity, then pass it to a co-prime (Pardot, Data.com, Service Cloud, Desk). 
-The AE no longer works throughout the sales cycle. Management seeks to make the AE role into a transactional based environment 
-This is upsetting to anyone who enjoys relationship selling. 
-Many clients are becoming annoyed with the various AEs and Co-Primes continually connecting with them. 

4) Quick Wins Now vs. Strategic Larger Deals
-Management is so focused on monthly quotas that they will push AEs and clients into decisions before the sales cycle is complete
-This could negate larger strategic deals as the client gets a ""band-aid"" fix."

The best kind of culture. A culture that you might expect to find on the west coast, but unique in its own right. As an example, although you have to work hard, you will never be worked to death. People talk about an effective work/life balance. Pardot employs it in a way I've never seen before. I believe it allows them to achieve a level of productivity equivalent to one generated from an 80 hour work week. Also, there is always tons of food available, so watch your figure!","Although engineering uses tons of open source software and tools, I wish Pardot & Salesforce ingrained it in the culture even more. Releasing official projects as open source could be done and encouraged more often."

The culture is young and hip, not corporate at all.",Quotas are unattainable.  They are peanut butter spread with complete disregard as to what the opportunity is in the territory.  The culture is not corporate at all-if you expect management to behave like adults then you need to look elsewhere.  It is getting to be more like Oracle every day.  No one cares about the customer or the employee.

9657,Salesforce,Excitement and opportunities for those who are driven and lean toward positivity,2014-11-04,5.0,LMTS,"Overall, the company culture seems very open and encourages honest self-reflection, but there's definitely a bias toward people who are naturally positive and seek opportunities. If you're a team-focused, positive, cheerful, driven person, this is a company where you can make huge strides in a very short amount of time.","First, it's NOT a startup, and while the company seems to have a great future ahead, it's not a fast-growth place where you're going to get catered meals, massages, and toys to play with every day. This shouldn't be a problem, but since the HQ is in San Francisco, people are reminded of all the perks and opportunities that abound just around the corner (or in Silicon Valley). Also, while the company is a great place to work, it tends to favor extraverts and people who desire to move up or who want to do lots of things outside their current job role. Being surrounded by ""movers"" like this can be exhausting if you're one who wants to be ""comfortable"" and seeks to achieve work-life balance."

9662,Salesforce,Best Sales Training I have ever had,2014-10-29,3.0,Account Executive,"The company takes training extremely seriously and within the first 3-6 months you will be given an absolute crash course in Sales Training and modern SaaS selling techniques. 

Most of the people are fantastic, the benefits are great. If you get the right territory you will make a lot more money than your peers.

Things are constantly changing and there are always opportunities to move around in the organization.

Salesforce is definitely the best product in the industry for CRM.","The Culture in the Chicago office took a nose dive this year. With fast growth a lot of the wrong people were promoted to leadership positions and have sucked some of the life out of the organization. (On the plus side things move fast so they probably wont be in those roles for too much longer).

Their is also a clear political path to success, be liked by the group that is running the show and you will be rewarded with a greater share of the potential sources of commission compared to your peers (There is a loosely defined territory policy which can either be a huge benefit or detriment to your career). The downside is that it appears most of the ""have's"" already have been selected."
9663,Salesforce,High earnings potential with the sacrifice of life balance.,2014-10-28,4.0,Strategic Account Executive,"High Energy and Growth. I joined when they had 7000 employees and left 2 years later when they had 12,000. I love their 1::1:1 program which Marc B is completely committed to and uses every chance he gets to promote. The company is well respected and constantly developing or buying new products. If you get the right accounts and manager support you can make a ton of $$$. I personally know a handful of people who made 7 figures.",Your success in sales is highly dependent on your patch(account base) which is hard to predict coming in the front door. The intensity of the company is great but the work/life balance if off as the demands of the job creep into all aspects of your life. Sales quotas go up every year and territories decrease which can be hard to keep up with.  The product offering is getting more and more complicated and hard to keep up with. Management changes all the time as I had four managers in a span of 18 months. Their product offering while extensive does not do well in certain verticals so make sure your accounts are in those good verticals. The core CRM product is too complicated and not intuitive as they make it seem.

9666,Salesforce,Great company to work for,2014-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"At Salesforce you get to work with great people in fast pace, but laid back environment. In R&D we typically have tight deadlines but estimated effort and time required to accomplish and expectations are usually reasonable. Sometimes extra hours are required to meet deadlines, but employees are generally well compensated for it.
The benefits are great, and get to work with new technologies.","Being such a big company you typically only work on small portion of the bigger picture at a time, but this isn't necessarily a con. It's just the nature of being a large company."
9667,Salesforce,Software Development,2014-10-27,5.0,Software Engineer,Coworkers are really nice. Job itself is challenging but lots of fun. The technology we use here is very advanced.,San francisco is super expensive a city to live in.

9669,Salesforce,The path to promotion is self promotion.,2014-10-25,3.0,Sales Engineer,"Besides the obvious (pay and benefits) Salesforce is actually a pretty fun place to work.  I can only speak for the sales side and working out of the SF office, I don't know much about the other orgs. 

Overall they do a great job hiring intelligent social people who will have fun while still working hard.  

The product is the best on the market and the technology for the most part blows competition out of the water.  

For me the best part about working at Salesforce has been the people / co-workers.","Salesforce has an interesting way of recognizing and measuring success, which is mostly driven by tooting your own horn.  The practice of ""building you brand"" is more important to your career than doing intelligent and meaningful work.  

The company is driven by sales and this causes unrealistic expectations on both the sales side as well as product rollout.  

Many (but not all) of the low to mid level managers are either unqualified or strive too hard to please superiors.

The company is more focused on showing and telling about how great it is than actually being great."
9670,Salesforce,Not one boring day in 8 years,2014-10-23,4.0,Senior Manager,"The innovative company. Great people, great offerings.",Sometimes combines disadvantages of a start-up with the disadvantages of a huge corporation. Slowly loosing the initial vibe and culture.

9672,Salesforce,Awesome product and peers -- horrible managers,2014-10-21,2.0,Senior Manager,"The product is wonderful and Salesforce uses it heavily internally.  you're fully immersed in the Salesforce ecosystem and it's easy to understand why customers love the product so much.  There is great drive to get things done and deliver.  Salesforce scales in some really interesting ways and there is no shortage of challenges to dig into and learn from.  With all the growth, it is constantly abuzz with activity and it can be exciting.","People management is very bad...
There is massive title inflation.  0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors.  There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments.  VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies.  VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment.  This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce.   Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making.  Reorganizations are painfully frequent which also promotes insecurity & stress."
9673,Salesforce,"Freedom, choice, innovation",2014-10-18,4.0,Associate Member of Technical Staff (Software Development Engineer),"Salesforce is your friend when you work here.  I've had two managers so far and both are there only to help me out and help me grow.  It's very open in many ways, such as
- It's easy to get a hold of other teams and communicate.
- Your teammates will be open to your crazy ideas.
- Freedom to work on your own projects and switch teams","Getting started is still rough.  Weeks of training, setting up your computer, waiting for other people to give you access to resources you need, and finding out information about anything is tough.  We use chatter and google docs to keep track of random information like where to get a company phone or what API to use for integration with such and such.  But both resources are a conglomeration of obsolete and inapplicable information.

While we do pride ourselves on having an open culture, it isn't necessarily a very exciting, friendly or personal culture.  You're generally free to do what you like, but many (maybe most) teams don't go to lunch together and aren't friends with each other.  They just have small talk and do what it takes to get the job done well.  Since your team is who you're with all day and who you talk to most of the time, it's kind of important.  I wish it was the other way around, where my team was wanted to talk too much and spend more time hanging out than I did.  The employees are kind of old here, so it's just not what I'm used to I suppose.

Also, spoiled as I already am here, I will always be jealous of companies that have free cafeterias because I can't cook."

I feel like I'm back at Oracle now - not fun.  This was not the case when I joined Salesforce 3 years ago.  Many Oracle managers have not embraced the Salesforce culture, and have increased demands on sales performance, micro-managing, excess administrivia.  The workload has increased with staffing not keeping pace.  Over-sized workload is contributing to employee burn-out and compromising performance.  And it's getting worse.

You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform.  Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one.  Regardless of your territory, you will have the exact same quota as those with larger ones.  Its a numbers game to management.  Your manager will want 2-3 of his or her AEs to do really well while everyone else struggles.  

You will have a monthly quota, your manager will be tasked with grinding you every month for every last dollar possible you can bring in.

A few years of success at Salesforce.com will add lots of credibility to your resume. After a few years you will be highly marketable to Salesforce partners, other SaaS companies and --if you develop Salesforce technical skills-- any company that uses Salesforce as a customer.","Since early 2013 there has been a massive influx of new hires --including middle and upper management-- from Oracle. This large scale migration of folks from Oracle to Salesforce means that there are teams within Salesforce where the vast majority of the management structure consist of people hired from Oracle since early 2013. In my case, ALL of the managers (director and VP level) on my team came from Oracle within the past two years. These managers hired a slew of folks into our team from Oracle. At one point, 70% of the new hires on my team came from Oracle. None of these new hires were vetted for cultural fit (because they were hired by managers who didn't understand or value the culture) and none of them competed for their jobs at Salesforce. (Ie, only one candidate was considered for each position.)

When you land on a team like this one, you don't really work at Salesforce... you work at some weird bastardization of Salesforce and Oracle. You are selling Salesforce products, but you are living in the Oracle corporate culture, which sucks.

The Oracle execs running these teams have not embraced the Salesforce culture and they strongly favor hiring unqualified Oracle refugees over hiring better qualified candidates coming from any other company. The degree of favoritism towards Oracle candidates is offensive.

Be very careful before you even pursue a position at Salesforce. Outside of San Francisco, the corporate culture is NOTHING like the experience that Fortune magazine describes in their ""best companies to work for"" article about Salesforce."

In other words, you're not expected or encouraged to perform your job to the best of your ability; rather, you're expected and encouraged to be constantly campaigning for your next position by contributing to only high-profile projects that get the attention of the higher-ups...and then tooting your own horn at every opportunity. Thus, you have a lot of people jockeying to be part of the ""prestige"" projects while the nitty-gritty yet necessary work gets ignored. And as with politics, there's very little trust and rapport among employees. I always theorized that many salesforce employees suspect that their titles and salaries are disproportionately elevated in relation to their skills and experience and therefore engage in a lot of ""smoke and mirror"" tactics to keep from being exposed: taking credit when they shouldn't, not taking responsibility when they should, and throwing anyone and everyone under the bus at the slightest provocation. In recent months, there's been an ongoing campaign to ""trim the ranks,"" so they've been covertly laying people off under the guise of ""eliminating positions."" Not surprisingly, they've also been losing a lot of their most valued employees, who witnessed their colleagues mysteriously disappearing and, sensing an unstable and inhospitable work environment, decided to leave on their own accord. I also hear that morale is at an all-time low. Shocker."

If you make quota you will do well.,"Unfortunately as the company has grown exponentially, it has gotten that big company mentality and politics.  From a sales standpoint, goals have become unreasonable and territories have shrunk ridiculously.  Ask what percentage of the reps are making quota.  I suspect company wide it is less than 25% but management would never say.  Very hard to make money these days at SFDC.  Voluntary turnover in 2013 was insane (sales reps).

Everyone is gun-ho about the culture and it really rubs off.  Just a spectacular feeling to be wanted, appreciated and trained with such care and concern. It is very obvious there is a specific ""type"" that is hired and it's great to fit in with lots of like-minded, caring and technically capable and earnest people. LOTS of work to do, but worth working hard at it!","The merge of Salesforce and ET has made accessing some systems extremely difficult at times with more the one help desk to turn to and a lot of misunderstand of responsibility.

We're each encouraged to speak up when we see something that could be made better and treated as if our opinions matter. We're given respect and treated like experts and professionals from day one. Though the Services department is fairly large, we're treated like individuals and known by the various department heads. Management sticks up for the employees when we get a bad client.

We're always reminded that we are in control of our careers and that there are plenty of opportunities for growth and advancement, even if we choose to stay in the position we currently have rather than moving up to the next level. Our managers are there to help us in our careers and to act as advocates for us. We're encouraged to become experts in some aspect of our jobs.

We have great benefits, great pay, multiple insurance plans, matching 401k, employee stock purchasing programs, volunteer time off (6 days per year), and hassle-free time off requests. I genuinely feel like the company cares about us and promotes a healthy work-life balance. I really enjoy working here, and though I'm constantly approached with offers and recruitments from other companies, I like it here too much to change.","While the company, as a whole, promotes a healthy work-life balance, the Services department is slowly losing that push.

I understand that as a consulting department, we need to make money and hit revenue goals, but don't do that at the expense of your employees' happiness. There will of course be the occasional emergency sprint that needs longer hours, but the exception is slowly turning into the norm. And when that is the case, we need to re-evaluate how we're selling and planning out projects. As mentioned, a constant push to work longer and more hours without compensation (pay, extra time off, etc) is just asking for us to get grow resentful. Sorry, ""winning"" a $200 gift card to a restaurant for being the drone who worked the most unpaid, extra hours isn't compensation. This is the number one complain among fellow employees in the Services.

There are some mixed messages about billable hours. Project managers often ask that we don't bill more than 40 hours per week, even though most of us are working more than 40. And over the last year, the message from department heads have been inconsistent and blurry about how we should bill out our time. Everyone I talk to has a different idea, and this inconsistency seems pretty stressful for everyone.

I'm not a fan of mandatory programs that are ""for your own good."" We recently started a mandatory mentorship program where everyone was a assigned a mentor and required to meet with them on a regular basis.

ExactTarget offers talent management and development programs, training plans for new and existing employees, PTO, and has leadership that promotes innovation. 
My one complaint would be the lack of women in leadership, particularly on the exec team.  Perhaps with the leadership of veteran ET exec and new CEO, Scott McCorkle, ExactTarget will work to develop and maintain women in valuable leadership roles."
9759,Salesforce,Tenacious Company,2014-07-26,4.0,Account Executive,Great compensation if do well. Amazing products.,Monthly sales forecasting adopted by the company is not suitable for enterprise sales.
9760,Salesforce,Great time but quickly becoming Oracle. Fine if you like Oracle.,2014-07-25,5.0,Sales,Great culture. I thought work life balance was fine. It is definitely a Sales driven culture with monthly closes and shrinking territories.,Hiring lots of senior leaders from Oracle these days. I've never worked for Oracle so I don't know if that's a good thing or bad but I know a lot of unhappy people there these days.

Challenging, fast paced environment, and company growth provides amazing opportunities to excel for those who have the drive and ambition. Prime downtown SF locations. Working with incredibly smart and talented people forces you to up your game. Easy to be on the ""kool-aid"" with the products. They're awesome and I've personally seen how they can transform a business for success. Compensation/benefits are pretty awesome.","Politics and egos are rampant and get in the way of getting things done and feeling a sense of accomplishment. Constantly changing priorities combined with ever growing silo'd thinking/execution can impact job satisfaction. Extremely poor management practices due to new/inexperienced managers, managers with egos who don't understand how to lead a ""team"" to success, and downright unethical behavior with HR turning a blind eye. If you're lucky to get a good manager - someone who advocates for you, highlights your work, and ensures their success through the success of their team - hold on for dear life!"
9762,Salesforce,Best Company I've Ever Worked For,2014-07-25,5.0,Anonymous,"Salesforce ExactTarget is amazing.  I can definitely see why we are consistently ranked as one of the Top Places to Work.  At the end of the day, it's the people of ExactTarget that have made me find this company to be so special.  We have created and maintained this internal culture, which we simply define as ""Orange.""  As a result,  I have the opportunity to work with some of the most innovative, kind, smart, and hardworking people I've ever met.  From leadership down, we all try to follow strong ethical values for our customers, for the community, for ourselves.
One of my favorite things is how they always seem to be giving back.  I feel like I'm a valued employee because ExactTarget thanks their employees.  Not just verbally, once a year at the holiday party cramped into a break room - but with quantifiable actions, benefits, and rewards.  

•	Growth opportunities that include yearly reviews with internal promotions encouraged
•	Career development courses, tuition reimbursement (up to $5000/year after 1 year at ET), mentorship opportunities, and a dedicated Talent Management team to support you
•	Networking opportunities (ie ExactWIN - our Women's Inspirational Network, ExactFun - They plan over 40+ social events like going to the Indian's game with the family, drinks and apps at Howl at the Moon, our annual holiday party at Crane Bay etc)
•	Volunteering opportunities encouraged by the company (6 Volunteering Days off/year, ExactImpact and ExactFoundation - organizations that participates in local service and grant opportunities with organizations like Gleaners, Habitat for Humanity, as well as local schools and hospitals.)
•	Reasonable time off.  PTO: 15 days  Holidays: 13 days
•	Strong benefits package including health, dental, vision, and 401k
•	Equity for Full Time Hires
•	Wellness Bucks: $100/month for gym memberships, personal trainers, sports lessons, and/or massages
•	Free 24/7 Gym membership, Bikeshare membership, onsite classes with options for yoga classes/cross-fit/kickboxing
•	Cell phone ($150/mo) and internet compensation ($50/mo) at managerial discretion
•	Flex time and telecommuting options
•	Lots of free things:  free snacks, free good coffee, free drinks, free ""swag- bags, shirts, general stuff"", often free leftover catered lunches in the breakrooms and a free mobile app that tells you what we have, occasionally free sporting events (Colts, Pacers) and musical concerts giveaways
•	Casual and open work environment","You have to be open to change, which can be hard for some.  Our environment evolves rapidly and it's not necessarily for the faint of heart.  If you are looking to clock in and out, or looking to do the same thing every day, I would not think this would be the ideal environment for you."
9763,Salesforce,"Great so far, and it's only just begun",2014-07-25,5.0,,"I've been here for some time now and while every company will hit bumps in the road, I think it's more so about how the organization chooses to handle those bumps than anything else. ExactTarget has proven that through complicated integration of systems, growing at a very fast rate, and transitioning leadership it can prevail with only optimism. The culture remains very much intact, evident in the environment in Indianapolis as well as the new employees coming onboard. The benefits continue to improve with VTO days, a great ESPP, and more to come in the New Year. Overall, it's nice to be part of a company that is so excited about it's future and does all it can to engage it's employees in that excitement.","Very fast paced environment and business needs seem to change at the drop of a hat- you need to  understand how to be flexible, which is a challenge to many."

We use them!"" and the other half people are like ""Oh, you're in sales?""

The company is hiring like crazy. But the problem is there are more cooks in the kitchen. So things are getting messed up. Reminds me of a giant like Microsoft slipping at getting things out. More doesn't always mean better."

9778,Salesforce,"Beware, all smoke and mirrors. A mirage of a company that trumpets innovation and company ethics but merely lip-service",2014-07-12,1.0,Customer Support Analyst,"Very few redeeming qualities. Literally you're taking a spin of the roulette when being hired as 9/10 of the managers of this site are incompetent buffoons with self-inflated egos. The Hillsboro office is a mere transfer of former yahoo customer service employees and STREAM employees, so expect nothing but metrics to guide your way. Inane goals and constant asking to work overtime. Will promise career growth, but beware! They only mean 'growth' in the sense that they want to keep you trapped in customer service, no matter your intelligence or background. 

Pro: free coffee, yet most companies offer something similar, especially tech companies.","Far too many to list. Middle management aside from two people are mindless drones who don't care about your well-being and reduce you to a metric. Impersonal bad stereotypes of the types who live out in Hillsboro. Constant pressure to drive down the backlog so we can fire outside vendors from assisting the company with the work. 

Mindless training that is both insulting and redundant for people who have worked longer than 4 months with cases. Bloviated executives who think they're rewriting the internet but in reality take 'trends' like wearable technology that tracks fitness and builds some silly api for salesforce to make your fitness goals a company competition. Acts like they invented the cloud, which btw has been in existence as long as the internet has existed. Cloud= cluster of servers that off load the processing of a computer. 

Software is stuck in the early 2000s in terms of design aesthetics and UI. For a billion dollar company they are getting away with murder with how clunky and inefficient the system works, but they would rather hire an army of customer reps than hire some competent programmers to improve the system.

Unethical policies regarding promising Indian immigrants the golden ticket of a green card, yet in reality just use them as work/coding horses to pump out mediocre programs. Fail to see any real innovation within the company, but loves to ride off the innovation of other companies and then celebrate it as their own success story.

I think this company relies upon the ignorance of businesses to buy into systems simply cause they're easy to access, not at all easy to use. Yes a cloud based, internet system is easier to login, but salesforce is an unequivocal mess of a company, both from a software standpoint and internally. They make lots of money, yes by that metric they're successful, but should not even be considered in the top 100 of tech companies worldwide because they lack any TRUE VISION."

If you can carve out a niche you can survive for a while but eventually you will need to conform.

There's a real absence of leadership and management talent there.

The atmosphere has been incredibly negative and political for the past 3 years, so if you're interested in another role you'll need to leave the company (you'll be given that advice if you express interest to your manager). 

The department is purposely trying to become an ad agency, except the department leads don't want to partner with other teams and are openly adversarial when they're not in front of execs. The department leads set a bad example by frequently talking trash about colleagues outside the creative team and that doesn't help anyone.

9785,Salesforce,"Still a lot of opportunity to learn, connect, and chart your own course, but Big Company culture is encroaching.",2014-07-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've spent over 8 years with Salesforce in various management and individual contributor roles, all customer or partner facing. Some of the pros:
- vibrant, fast paced culture 
- smart, fun, aggressive colleagues
- management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them
- by and large, customers and partners are very positive about the technology
- good benefits and perqs
- hip urban culture at HQ
- a chart-your-own-course mentality that rewards those who aggressively seek out the job they want and pursue it, or sometimes even create it","After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. 

Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management,  and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion. 

The few at the top will get very, very rich. The rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why they've given up health and family"

They sponsor numerous employee events and are heavily involved in volunteering and non-profits.,"Every-day, the company moves away from it's small, entrepreneurial spirit and towards the a structure similar to Oracle.  It's not too bad, and some things are necessary to continue such enormous growth but it would be nice to see them blaze their own trail instead of completely following Oracle's blue-print"

- TPS reports = badging, v2mom, and work.com 
- No career advancement or mobility

SE Specific Feedback
- Comp plan is homogeneous. No way to exceed quota and q4 loaded.
- SE Management - Just downright not quality people. God help you if you go over anyone's head or question the company line. Might as well give your two weeks notice. Everyone manages up trying to show some value for which they have none
- Sales Engineering means making Prezi's, videos, and bringing sexy back, not actually being technically competent
- Training equals going through marketing decks with your peers and a toastmasters score sheet

Bottom Line 
- The folks being hired now would have never even been looked at 3 years ago. 
- It took the company over six months to fire a guy who had never logged into salesforce and 30 days to fire another guy who had been there for 6 years who voiced his opinion
- EVERY single person who would be worth keeping is looking to leave
- Great place to work if you are a sheep who is blind"

The CEO of the company Marc Benioff is a visionary. This is one of the dream company to work for, and you will come to know that right from start of your interview procedure. It is a company where you can learn a lot of stuff about cloud computing. The tools which they use are all latest in the market which makes life more simple. There applications like chatter , salesforce for outlook , connect for outlook are boon to the technology which makes the client's life more simple. This a company where you will get lot of exposure and interaction with quite good number of skilled people. The compensation would be very good and one would have very healthy work life balance and lot of perks, recognition. The company has developed a new technology which is called as force.com which is amazing and have taken our technology to the next level. After you join the company you will get lots of amazing gadgets like iphone , ipad , mac machine etc. You would love it .","One of the sad part was that our concerns which we use to highlight was never use to reach to our higher managers 
Favor-ism was one of the thing which I witnessed because of which other folks used to slog 
Job stability is a  concern because due to there changes in the higher management they can ask you leave at anytime

Benefits are good and work/life balance is manageable for a company with such incredible growth. Locations in downtown SF are fabulous!","Politics within the creative team are the worst I've seen anywhere and are getting worse over time. it's purely a leadership problem and the negativity comes from the top where there are a couple mean-spirited individuals who actively seek to undermine leaders from other teams, including people who are new to the company. This has been going on for a couple years and no one has done anything to address it. HR and executive leadership have turned a blind eye!

Also, if you need to get anything done with the creative team, you'll be asked to support 1-5 new employees for their team, which costs more and delivers less than hiring an agency to help as needed.  It's all about grabbing power there and it's ruining the culture, forcing great talent to leave, and short-changing real growth opportunities.   

Real growth could also be driven by a better go to market strategy. The go-to-market strategy is weak but made worse by the fact that the campaigns team isn't even led by a marketer or someone who knows how to run campaigns effectively."

Quotas are unrealistic and those who are actually achieving their numbers have 4x the territory than those who aren't. Management plays favorites. It went from a positive environment to an extremely negative one where one isn't motivated to perform well. It feels like Salesforce is trying to manage people out and I don't expect the Pardot sales team to be around in a few years.

-Depending on your department, can be great
-Lots of career opportunities, if you're in the right situation.","-There is a manager for everything, frequently was reporting to 3+ managers at a time, who would not communicate amongst themselves
- Of the above mentioned managers, 3/4 are totally unqualified to manage anything other than numbers or a report.
-Really cheesy management with constant 'corporate speak' pep talks and meetings where employee feedback is requested, but rarely acted on or even passed up.
-Culture has rapidly disappeared in favor of growth over the last 2 years.
-Employee feedback is often ignored, it seems that employees often have the forethought to point out problems with new methods/systems, with management being happy to 'wait and see'.
-Completely different standards/work conditions for the same department across multiple sites. It's always fun to see your peers in another office getting benefits you don't get because their management cares.
-The best in their role are all leaving or have left due to a constant focus shift from employees to metrics and numbers.
-Avoid Technical support, it combines every issue mentioned above, and it's only something that looks nice on a resume."

Enormous turnover leads to lots of opportunities for advancement if you can outshine flashy external hires from consulting backgrounds.","Inflated titles and absent support staff leads to many ""managers"" and ""directors"" who are purely individual contributers.  All managers and directors have individual contributor duties.  

For people managers, headcount are constantly changing--just because you have a team of 6 this year doesn't prevent half of them from being taken away next year.   

Management structures change multiple times per year, and even change above the CIO.  

The internal systems are falling apart and leaders all the way up are much more focused on politics and image.  They completely neglect anything objectively meaningful or helpful. 

The environment has gotten so toxic in the last couple years that leaders semi-openly talk about trying to get out of here. 

The CIO doesn't lead the organization at all, and everyone goes to either the ""chief of staff"" or the head of the PMO instead.  The chief of staff is not qualified / competent to run a single department, let alone being a de facto head of IT. 

IT is forced to pay for all related costs out of the IT G&A budget with no charge-backs.  This inflates our budget and hides that we're actually significantly underfunded, especially considering the technical debt.  (we've almost figured out wifi in the last year, but we still need wired hubs in the conference rooms) 

Much worse than the state of IT is the state of Finance.  Every month we're asked to change behavior because something in accounting /finance changed, or something was miscoded or reclassified and no one knew until after the books closed.  People and processes change so often that there is no chance of hitting your budget honestly, or even understanding where it came from. 

We are told that it's worse to be under budget than overbought, because if we're under in any quarter, we potentially lose that budget going forward.  You can imagine the consequences of that policy. 

The financial systems are a joke. We don't know how to support finance and consequently, they can't support us.  What we report is massaged by accounting manually in Excel to a degree that we cannot effectively speak to our own numbers.  As a result everyone involved is frustrated, failing, and looking for an out.  

No one in leadership is willing to acknowledge the fundamental problems as the culture requires us to be ever-positve in public and to ""just make it work"", then report success.  I believe this is because (1) CEO is a salesman first, leader second, and doesn't want to hear it, and (2) because everyone up the chain would rather claim success and move to a different company, than stay and actually try to fix anything."

Some of the (many) benefits I enjoy:

* Flexible work locations (work from home, from the office, any combination of both);
* 48 hours of paid Volunteer time in the community, with grants awarded when this milestone is met;
* Charity matching grants, allowing me to double any charitable donations via the salesforce Foundation;
* Best in class health, dental, paid training, vacation time, etc;
* Extremely talented coworkers;
* Ability to define your day-to-day responsibilities, projects, long term focus;
* Ability to move between departments, or make non-linear career moves;
* Working for a company that is constantly redefining the segment / products we sell keeps work exciting, and allows easy transitions to new roles;
* Hard work is publicly rewarded, promotions come whenever you've proven it's time for one;
* Involved and approachable leaders - Our hierarchy may appear layered, but we're encouraged to treat the organization as flat as possible.","Existing at the bleeding edge of a segment that is constantly being redefined involves constant course correction and strategy shakeups. If consistency is your bread and butter, this company may not be for you.

Explosive growth also means that we're constantly playing catch-up with headcount, therefore capacity is routinely stretched. Add mid-year strategy shakeups, and it becomes hard to build process frameworks or policies, or to spend time analyzing past successes and failures.

(Note - There has been an impressive uptick in capacity planning over the past few years, and this is starting bear fruit, so this latter point is impacting us less as time goes on)"

9910,Salesforce,"Great place to work as a software developer, and you'll need to be proactive about your career",2014-03-25,5.0,Lead Member of Technical Staff Software Engineer,"This company is growing and has rightfully earned many accolades. The benefits are fantastic, and you'll earn a lot of money if you're smart, motivated, and get things done.

One key piece of advice that I have is to be proactive about your career. It can be tempting to code all day long, but you'll need to take a step back every now and then to chart your course over the next several releases to get ahead and stay in control of your career. If you don't, then others may put you into a direction that you might not like. Take charge and make your case to others, and resources will flow to you if others agree with your vision. That actually ties in well with my next point.

Every year, each of us must create a ""V2MOM,"" which is Marc Benioff's method of distilling down what you want to do over the next year from both a high level and from a detailed level. You start off with a single vision, list your values, determine the methods that will realize your vision, identify the obstacles that may prevent you from realizing your vision, and create metrics that can measure how you know when you've realized your vision. Many people secretly blow it off and just copy their managers' V2MOMs, but if used properly, it really can make a difference in your own career. As one of the leaders had said, you get from it what you put into it. If you really embrace and use the V2MOM, you'll go far both at work and in life. The culture increasingly uses the V2MOM in its decision making and resource allocations. But don't worry; it's not a cult or anything remotely like that.

Salesforce.com invests heavily in its employees. From the high-end office space to comfortable interiors, generous benefits, and firm commitment to meeting and exceeding workplace fairness, policy, and procedure rules and laws, anyone can be free to be themselves at Salesforce.com and do the best work of their lives. I know I am :). I'm an openly gay male, and that has never been held against me (as far as I'm aware, at least).","I hear that politics and such exist at the higher levels, but that's fortunately not visible much at the individual contributor level. If you have a good manager, you don't hear of such things, and you get to just focus on your work and career. So perhaps this is really a 'pro' than a 'con.'

Priorities can and do shift regularly. It's really a part of the nature of software development. Top-down changes of directions can and do occur, though most have been huge successes. If you want a place where you go off into a corner and code on one thing for months or years, then Salesforce.com is not the place for you. Everything is collaborative, and you must be able to work well in a team. If you don't, then you'll hopefully learn quickly :-).

Work-life balance can be difficult to achieve if you are eager to help everyone who comes your way with questions. It's really a matter of self-discipline to achieve a work-life balance, and it's almost all within your control."

If you manage your time and have a general interest in the technology there are tons of things to do. I've dabbled in product sessions, support workshop hours, custom app dev, etc. All while doing my day job.  

Because Indy is small most of the talented people in the area end up at ET. A lot of talent resides in the town, and the C level team strives to keep the company local.","Only Product jobs are in Indy.
Comp is only great if you live in the Midwest, if you're hired to work in a remote office be prepared to work with clients of similar skills sets that will make a lot more than you. 
Benefits are not equal per locale, some offices get parking, food, gyms, subway passes, etc. 
Simply because that's the bare min to acquire people in that locale, too bad for you if you don't live there.

PTO is really poor compared to our parent company SalesForce
Benefits are not up to par with our parent company SalesForce, try to find ET benefits and then find SF benefits. You'll notice ET's benefits are impossible to find and SF brags about theirs. That should be your sign.
If you're assigned to SOW in Services or Support, there is little to no incentive to move you into something challenging. Most changes are done because of attrition as the organization are pretty flat outside of product. 

Salary bands don't exist, or if they do they are very lax.
It's common someone on your team negotiated really hard and someone just took a college entry job. HR still doesn't have a classification for all skill sets in the field.

- Total compensation package less  attractive than @ first sight  
- Sales Territory subject to change any time, any way. 
- Heavily Political
- Poor Management
- Little diversity  (in terms of skills, background and genre)

Management is surprisingly immature for a 10.000 people company, nobody really cares about you,  numbers is all that matters. As such the aim of management is only hitting the number, no matter what. Meaning: no resource development, little training, harsh treatment when something goes wrong, no coaching,  no understanding whatsoever. Numbers arrive, you're a star. They don't, you're an a***ole.
The internal mantra is SFDC wants to innovate, unlike Oracle these days. Yet 50% of the people come from Oracle and they keep coming.
Be very careful about what you are told at the interview. The territory assigned wil almost surely change after a few  months, for the good (unlikely) or the bad (very much likely).
Base pay is high (variable is becoming more and more difficult to hit and beat) but benefits are quite limited with respect to other IT companies. If evaluated in overall package the comparison is less favourable than originally thought bringing it to on par with other major IT employer.
Also, the environment is pretty political: hiring is based on who you know, internally and externally, not on what you do and what you can achieve and not always the two aspects lead to the same point. As such relations are valued more than skills. Kind of : so is life but if you expect something different...."

Decent benefits
Lots of left over food from catered lunches for meetings.","As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things.

Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message  ....

It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. 

If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour.

As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. 

Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke.

There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system.

Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. 

The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work.

ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more. 

After the Salesforce acquisition morale and productivity have been at an all time low while frustrations and turn over have been on the other side of the scale."

* Acquisitions left and right are not very motivating for the employees as they are now just becoming integration agents rather than innovating anything that they can be proud of.
* Don't believe the Gartner report or Forbes Most Innovative company award. Innovation is at it lowest point in the company ever. Most people in R&D are completely disassociated with the product they are building. Forget about innovation, they don't even understand the customer needs well enough.
* Salesforce is now like a giant Sloth. Things that used to get done in a week now take over a year. Rapid hiring to improve the speed has helped in the past but hiring more people, especially in R&D isn't valuable anymore.
* Most old-timers in R&D have left including both executives and engineers. New executives hired in R&D are kinda old-school Oracle/EMC guys who don't even know what Salesforce used to be. Culture has changed beyond repair. Result: No innovation, not much accountability, politics, bunch of process that no one needs but no one dares to change.
* Ancient technologies, monolithic giant code base that no one really understands now. No unit testing, everything is tested through functional blackbox testing; you can change something that can result in something completely unrelated broken; Developer productivity is at the lowest that I have ever seen in my career. Think about it this way - You code for a day and fix test failures for next 5 days. Not rewarding at all.
* Big initiatives always keep coming in a top-down way. More than half of them end up nowhere."
10013,Salesforce,Chaos,2013-12-19,2.0,Director,Great compensation.  Very smart people.,"Salesforce operates on the verge of Chaos.  They act like a $3M company when its really a $3B company.  Very little thought of planning goes in to anything.  This drives a culture of groups just doing ""something"". This drives tons of inefficiency and work done for nothing.

The company is extremely hierarchical.  Asking questions or participating in the process is frowned upon.  The top dogs of a group make a decision and its just go do it.  There is no seat at the table for discussion."

If you’re just starting out, this is a great place to gain some relevant experience and build your resume.

When it comes to benefits, there are stocked pantries on every floor.  Those working in Indy have access to the ET Gym, ET Fun events (golf outings, paintball, happy hours, etc.) and more.  Wellness Bucks - employees are reimbursed up to $105 per quarter for gym memberships, yoga classes, crossfit classes, etc.  

Through the Salesforce acquisition, ET employees receive 6 free volunteer PTO days per year and even have the opportunity to participate in the Salesforce Employee Stock Purchase Program.

Until recently, it was fair to say that ExactTarget had one of the best executive leadership teams in all of SaaS.","Over the last year it’s been sad to see how drastically the company has changed.  The “orange” culture is fading rapidly and key employees who cashed-out on stock options are jumping ship for better opportunities.  Prominent executives recently left the company and top talent is leaving in droves. A massive restructuring is in order and I suspect that others will follow suit once the fiscal year ends and annual bonuses are paid out to employees.

If you work out of the Indy office, you can sense the heightened frustration from those around you.  Employees are overworked, underpaid, and have huge unrealistic quotas hung over their heads (with shrinking sales territories).  What used to be a company driven by young, ambitious, entrepreneurial talent, is slowly turning into a company motivated by corporate greed and pleasing Wall Street. 

Two years ago, things were very different but now it is much harder to get promoted, receive a pay raise, or advance your career vertically.  ET is very demanding and is notorious for promoting the same people (Director level and above) over and over again.  Rarely will you see someone without an MBA or Director-level title, get promoted (unless they brown-nose like crazy)."

> Bonus structure (like nowhere I've ever worked before) you're pretty much guaranteed your 10% annual bonus once you don't mess up or end up on a performance improvement plan. Easy like Sunday morning. 

> Nice periphery benefits - health insurance, pension contribution, phone, education allowance if you wish to return to job related study

> A few snacks in the office","> Marketing Cloud - the product is a disaster. They've simply gone on a shopping spree as a company purchasing Radian6, Buddy Media, Social.com and now Exact Target but still move at a snails pace to make any sort of integration or connection between the platforms. Even having one logon for all systems would be a major step forward!

> Company is not 'born social' and fails miserably at creating any sort of fun, energetic or dynamic culture / environment that give Social companies the edge at attracting or retaining talent. The culture is beyond stale with literally no collaboration between colleagues/teams and zero effort from management to improve this. 

> Customers are never happy, but I don't blame them (perhaps with the exception of Social.com). They struggle with the products and are often mis-sold solutions, or rather sold solutions based on a vision of a product that actually doesn't exist. There is only so much 'we are working on that for the future' a customer can hear before they up and leave to a competitor that actually delivers.

> If you're someone who likes to work completely alone then this is your gig, but if you appreciate engaging with others and team work, heck, if you even appreciate people lifting their heads to say hello in the morning, then this is not the place to be for you."
10021,Salesforce,Going downhill fast. Really hard on us ExactTarget employees.,2013-12-12,1.0,,I like the orange culture although its taken a hit because so many people in my department have left in the past 6 months. They hook you up with new technology every couple of years and I just got a new Dell laptop. Also snacks & drinks in the break room. Occasional Happy Hours with team members.,"Been here a little over 2 years. It is good to see other current ExactTarget employees venting about similar frustrations I am having with its current state of affairs. This year has been very difficult, lots of uncertainty and a lot of turmoil at ExactTarget Indy HQ, so much so I have had many coworkers leave and take other jobs recently. Great teams are being dismantled due to the SalesForce takeover. The people who are still here are having to take on the work of the former employees along with their normal duties which makes for consistent 60+ hour work weeks. The cracks in the merger are really starting to show making for a tense and unfulfilling work environment. Sadly, I use to really love it here, truly heartbreaking to see this happen to a once great company. 

HR and management are unbelievably concerned with their public image and I would not doubt if most of these 5 star ratings on here were actually written by them. Lets be real here, no job is 5 stars, every job has its frustrations and downfalls. Anyone rating a corporate company 5 stars is delusional. 

I also notice a lot of the jobs that are being hired for currently are jobs people have recently left, which is deceiving because HR recruiters will really try to sell you on ET/SalesForce growth, which is a half-truth. Maintaining is more like it until they see how profitable the merger is, if it doesn’t meet expectations it won’t be pretty."

This happens year round with charity, athletic and other events - the gifts keep on coming.","None - salesforce.com has it's good and bad just like any other company and is not perfect; however, the good far outweigh the bad as salesforce.com tries to improve year after year.

This is the best possible mechanism for retaining people that count.  If you're good, you will be recognized.

10064,Salesforce,"Been here 4 years, this past year has been overwhelmingly uncertain and difficult.",2013-11-08,2.0,Lead Gen,I really enjoy my coworkers and being Orange. I like the downtown office locations and the free food and drinks. The culture has kept me here but the pressures are mounting and the uncertainty of the company make it hard to stay. Pay has been pretty good. ExactTarget Connections is always fun but is ton of work.,"Work life balance has gotten really out of whack the past year and a half. I do more and more but then get more and more to do. It seems like if I don't check my email at 10 at night I am considered a slacker, very hard to have a life outside of ExactTarget and nearly impossible to keep up with management constantly changing directions. 

I am the only minority on my floor, ExactTarget is overwhelmingly Caucasian probably 98% in the US offices, which is kind of depressing. Also it's very difficult to get promoted as a female above a director level, nearly impossible so I am considering switching companies to either Angies List or Interactive Intelligence as I hear they are better about promoting diversity."

I am sure it looks like Siebel on the outside to some people (just another CRM software company). But it's a company on a mission.

10067,Salesforce,#dreamjob?? Maybe for some.,2013-11-05,2.0,Account Executive,"Salesforce is great company to work for if you fall into one of these two buckets:

1) A few years removed from college and you're looking to cut your teeth in software sales. 

2) You have been working for SFDC for 5+ years.","If you're an accomplished sales rep at another company and looking for a move, here are some things to note about SFDC. These apply if you're looking for an ESB, SMB, MM or Commercial Account Executive role at SFDC: 

1) Base salary is about 20-30% lower than most companies

2) They will tell you that on target earnings (OTE) are attainable if you ""create your own success."" Translation: We expect ""butts-in-seats"" by 7 AM, and cold calls / BASHO emails being sent all day.  

3) Less than 2% of all new AE's reps hit OTE in their first two years (basically, expect to make a base salary). Ask this question during your interview. 

3) Your every move is monitored through a dashboard, and people with the most cold calls, call connects, meetings scheduled, etc. win small SPIFFs (Think ""Boiler Room"")"
10068,Salesforce,I use to really love my job now I am just nervous about my future with ExactTarget.,2013-11-04,1.0,Senior Corporate Sales Representative,"Unfortunately, most of the good parts have gone with the acquisition, nothing lasts forever, I guess. There's still free pop and snacks in the break room, for now.","I use to really love my sales job here at ExactTarget but I am afraid to say those days are long gone. This use to be the place the be in Indianapolis for corporate sales but it really isn’t what it use to be, perks have been cut, pay has been cut ever since SalesForce took the reigns. I was hopeful with the acquisition but it hasn't been what I had hoped at all. There's been several people who have been let go from sales and for the first time in nearly 4 years of working here I am nervous about potentially losing my job. It's really sad as a year ago I could have seen being here for a large part of my career but I guess thats tech, ever changing, and volatile. I would be cautious about taking a sales job with ExactTarget right now, they keep hiring but its because people keep leaving for better opportunities, lots of uncertainty going on, the good people are getting out and I will be leaving as soon as I find a new opportunity."
10069,Salesforce,Incredible Career Growth Opportunities,2013-11-04,5.0,Marketing,"The people here are awesome.  The culture, known as ""Orange"", is unique and exceptional.

I have worked for start ups that grew too quickly and felt like the company was ahead of itself.  ExactTarget seems to be in control every step of the way.  We need to ensure this continues."
10071,Salesforce,Couldn't ask for a better place to work.,2013-11-03,5.0,Client Services,Truly one of the greatest places I've ever worked. You can talk about the perks of the company until you're blue in the face but nothing compares to the quality of the people here. That's really what makes it somewhere that you look forward to coming in to on Monday morning.,"Tough to say much here. Like any company that's been acquired, it may prove tough to keep the same office culture, but the people here seem committed to doing everything in their power to make it happen."
10072,Salesforce,"If there was somewhere else better...I'd be there...  But yep, it has it's problems...",2013-11-01,4.0,Sales,"The best product by far...bar none.  The best visionaries, technical ops (the guys that keep the platform up and running), and internal platform engineers on the planet - these are the guys that deserve all the glory.  What is done behind the scenes to keep the app going is nothing short of amazing - several million concurrent users while constantly adding functionality and innovating...and no down time?  Come on.  It's ridiculous.

The tenured and long-timers that are still around are incredible.  They're not only the best in the company, they're the best in the industry.  Prove yourself to them and they will take care of you.

If YOU have the drive and the ability, you can build a career path in the company...and if YOU make a case and have something behind it, it's one of the few companies in the world that will allow you to do so.  Salesforce will not give you a map when you're hired that shows you a career path...but if you succeed in the role you're giving and prove yourself and earn trust, they'll actually allow you to create your own.

The culture of the company is like nothing else in the world.  Yes...you are expected to work more than anywhere else in the world...but if you like philanthropy, no questions asked...go do it - on company time.

The best in the business keep coming on board.  

Marc is the best CEO in the business - different for sure - but the best.

For a few years I thought the company had plateaued...several different times (at $750M...at $1B..at $2B...)...but I really do see this company making it to $10B in rev and beyond.  Without a doubt.

So if you're considering joining Salesforce but are worried about growth, don't be.  That should be the last of your concerns.","""Fillers"".  I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly.  While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart.  And they don't do s*&^.  They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies.  They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon.

Tomorrow.  You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow.  Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you.  It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped.  Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be.  

Marketeering.  This is a new issue at Salesforce...  It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures.  Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it.

Equity.  I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people.  Seekingalpha?  They couldn't be more wrong.  Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond  entry level, it would be nice to see something.  It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What?  You're an RVP of WHAT?  And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade.

Commit.  This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales.  Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently.

Territory.  Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose.  It was picked over 5 years ago.  You'll more than likely get something you don't want.  End of discussion.  While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not.  Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can.

I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company.  They ARE.  There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave...  and you better keep your mouth shut.  It sucks.  Because at one time they were amazing.  Now, just awful."

I applied, and before it hit the hiring manager's mailbox, it hit my manager's mailbox first. How does that make any sense? The form I filled out said I would not have to contact my manager unless I was seriously being considered for the position. After my manager found out, he did whatever he could to make my job difficult and I eventually left on my own terms.

Salaries are OK if you can get your manager to vouch for you. Many times folks are lowballed and get stuck at lower salaries for their level and they don't even know it. Happened to me and it happened to a few people I knew. It can be easy to negotiate upwards in these cases as long as you can show strong performance and navigate the company politically. As long as your directors are your best friends you will make great money.

Promotions on the other hand are another beast. Some people I knew got promoted for no reason (other than being an SVP's best friend). As a high performer, it makes it very difficult because you work hard only to have other people get promoted because they can talk better than you, or go to more happy hours than you."

2. Good culture inherited from CEO Marc unless your team is not good.
3. Enthusiastic place, positive energy around. People of bit more dynamic personality","1. You have to bear hell of politics
2. It was different when I started but now many of managers lie about promotions, bonus and green card process I think they purposefully delay so that they can retain employees. If they know you can not switch then they will give not give raise or agreed bonus as well. It happened with me.
3. Its not a technology company. There are multiple CTOs, my group CTO does not even know current technologies, they try to solve big data problems using PL/SQL and will force you to do the same even if you know Hadoop technologies or other upcoming technologies.
4. The promotion is based on number of check-ins you can make and managers openly tell that. Its absolutely not related whether you checked in test or some stupid UI / xml fix or a routine to mine billions of events to generate recommendations. How dumb management can be in technical aspect? 
5. Most of the product managers and product directors are jokers, they decide future product direction and design with no technical background. They talk about topic extraction using UI and static categories.
6. Its all gonna go downhill with a burst of existing big customers leaving because product is good but page load performance sucks big time or if good technology company comes as a competitor. Its just a matter of time when it is going downhill."

They value work/life balance and they do their best to avoid pointing fingers when things go wrong; they just want to get it right.","Struggling with some outdated architecture and suffering through growing pains. Not necessarily a bad thing but it makes day to day work frustrating. They also don't support bring your own device and are in fact going the opposite direction, which seems short sighted."

The products are solid, reliable, stable, full-featured.  A good working environment overall-coworkers are bright, driven, friendly and competitive without being duplicitous.","Base salary is lower than competitors, company has become extremely political and rule-bound. Very little room for advancement."
10205,Salesforce,The money making boat has sailed,2013-03-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"They have a great location at One Market St. across from the Ferry Building. Most people are getting moved to 50 Fremont though which is not as nice.
There is an ESPP program that can be very rewarding depending on when you got in, and the facilities themselves are nice.
Great collaboration with internal utilization of ""Chatter""","While at SFDC I joined just in time to get RSUs, however, I cashed it all out when it hit $150+ and there really isn't money to be made via stock anymore. At my level they didn't do any refreshes of stock, so once you get it, that's it. At higher levels (SVP+) you could make some money, but it's like that at every other tech company in the valley.

I don't have much faith in their product growth either. They have penetrated most of the market and there aren't many new logos coming down the pipeline. Most sales are with existing customers with newly acquired products.

Speaking of acquisitions, the M&A strategy of buying everything in sight doesn't seem to be working that well, especially with the new senior convertible notes they are issuing. It is difficult to understand what the product roadmap is going to be like if they keep acquiring random products. Maybe Marc has some tricks up his sleeve, but it's not very clear right now.

I agree with some prior comments about having to conform. When I joined several years ago, it was easy to speak your mind and get things changed, but nowadays it's all about conformity and agreeing with people.

The performance process is not that good either. They go through a V2MOM process (you can find out more on the web about it) and it literally takes me an entire day to fill it out. They have changed things a bit with ""Work.com,"" but it's just that, work.

IT Helpdesk is also not very good in my opinion. There is no walk-up station to get things fixed, you have to call a phone number or open a ticket, then wait until an analyst gets back to you. My first week took a couple dozen helpdesk tickets to get up to speed. There was one day my computer was on the fritz and it took literally an entire workday to get it resolved because there was no walk up station."

Pension is excellect and they make a good contribution. Salesforce look after their staff with excellent health insurance and travel insurance.  Carear wise they develop their staff skills, however this doesn't relate to a development path.","It has become more important to be seen to do something than actually do it and becoming increasingly political. Salesforce isnt known to promote from within. Respected staff  are overlooked for promotion in favour of more recent political plants about 10% of the sales team earn near their ote, the rest make do on their basic.

Free snacks","Equity and real money goes to the top in a vastly disproportionate way.  Executives have disdain for equity sharing.

Use M&A to mask no real internal product innovation in years.

Each new generation of ""leadership"" is more manic and buzz-word fixated and insecure than the previous.

Endless conversations about process, no productive output.

No accountability for decision making.  Decisions throughout the company are made privately and then imposed.

Corporate holiday party spending is obscene.

Everyone is a ""leader"" spending their time talking about process, very few are actually doing anything.

Product has serious security flaws.

Have not seen CEO on the floor in years

New hires get dumber and dumber, are more and more scared of rocking the boat.  

Messengers are punished.  Culture incents people to remain silent and go along with the head person's opinions.

Basic cultural inability to use fact-based analysis to objectively evaluate performance or productivity.

Managers use gossip to inform performance reviews.

Management style throughout the company is very kabuki-ish.  Obsessed with classist fear of being seen as touching technology.

Employees spend more than 50% of their time socially managing their popularity collecting badges, recognitions and rewards in their gamified performance management system rather than doing their day job.

Culture punishes people who say, ""No"", no matter the cost to the organization.

Rewards go to the pacifiers, not the performers."

10218,Salesforce,Good place to work at,2013-02-19,4.0,QA Engineer,"My first few months with Salesforce is good.  I've worked in the field for 10 years and been at companies ranging form large corporations to a small startup.  I read some of the one star reviews and think people might have different experiences on different teams or people just have different expectations.  As for my own experience, compared to the companies I worked for in the past,  Salesforce is a good company to work for.  It offers above market salaries but also asks you to work hard for it.  No doubt the amount of things to learn at the beginning is overwhelming.  Luckily new employees are offered plenty of formal training classes.  Everyone on the team is ready to help, too, because they got tons to do and really want you to be able to contribute.  The company is growing fast so politics might get worse.  But don't kid yourself. Wherever there are people, there is politics.  I once worked at a 50 employee startup and had to deal with the constant BS going on in the office.   Find a good manager who can shield you from a lot of this if you are a technical minded person.  And the company allows you to jump between opportunities if you don't really like your current team and/or manager and they can't hold you back.  My previous job was at a large software company,  where an internal transfer took at least a few months...an offer letter can take up to 6 months for it to go up the management chain and get a headcount...the quality of software was a mess because the management only cares about metrics and spreadsheets and no idea what they were building.  So far I haven't seen the same problems at Salesforce.   The scrum teams are very small and agile.  They do expect you to do real work very quick but working 10-12 hour shifts is not typical.","Lots to learn in the first 3-6 months, very hectic.  The company is growing very fast, some growing pains."

Besides that they are fun, easy to use and pretty much everything else Salesforce claims them to be.  It is refreshing to be part of a company who makes such products.","The work environment, depending on your location.  Headquarters, in San Francisco, is the example for the company and I can't believe any one would not want to work there.  Unfortunately, other locations do not share the same culture.  At times, you can feel like you work for 2 (or more) different companies.  Politics can also get in the way of what should be important.  While Salesforce has some incredibly talented people, I was always amazed at how things other than talent seemed to be how people got ahead in their careers.

This company is out to change the world of enterprise software, and has been doing so since 1999.",Distributed campus (downtown SF) make it difficult to network with peers.
10275,Salesforce,The perception is not the reality,2012-10-17,2.0,Sales Representative,"Recognizable company for resume purposes
Free snacks","Salesforce boasts a great exterior perception, but the real deal is less than glamorous. The sad thing is once you’re hired, if you do want to go elsewhere, other employers wonder what’s wrong with you because of the positive perception Salesforce has. I’ve listed several reasons why I have not recommended Salesforce to my network below.

Corporate monster: The company tries to stifle employee concerns with surface-level actions like weekly team-lead meetings regarding employee worries, but nothing changes. All that happens is generic and blanket corporate messages funneled back to concerned employees. It takes years to adjust concerns about quota (ie: why is my Oklahoma quota the same as a Bay Area quota? Which, by the way, is still not resolved).

Non-promotions: The company touts “rapid promotion” within the sales path, but the honest truth is that the first three to five years (ie: SR, EBR, and ESB AE) are just doormat positions with little additional salary that take longer than promised to get through.

Resentment: Additionally, it is a widely known fact internally that the company hires overqualified individuals at a lower level title than they deserve. This creates a consistent stream of resentment throughout the organization.

General work/life balance: For SRs (Sales Reps), our stack ranking is a joke. It leads people to act so immorally and just creates more junk for other people to deal with and waste time on. Since we are stack ranked, everyone is afraid to take a vacation since that means their numbers will be behind others that take no vacation. The department tried to alter the policy saying that reps that take at least 4 days off PTO will not have to worry about that month effecting their promotion, but does not adjust their actual quota for the month (meaning your paycheck still suffers). Lovely.

Go to Box or Netsuite, or another great startup-like company that will value you. I’ve recommended other companies over the one I’m currently working for time and again. That alone should speak volumes."

If you can get into Enterprise sales with the right RVP, you will be golden. Get into Enterprise that is where its at here at SFDC.","Political, corporate, RVP's can make or break you, accounts get re-shuffled every now and then, territories shrink, you are only as good as your accounts. There are Re-Org's where, leadership, accounts, support, and resources ALL change. 

For Example: SMB, MM, and Commercial Account groups- unless you are on the high-end (New people and leadership there too) you are subject to  a ""Sweat-Shop"" style of work, It never stops there...for even the most senior sales people. They push you down, to a lower level them where you are, and make you earn getting back to where you were. A lot of smoke and mirrors, there was a Re-Org and I know if at least 10 people who left SFDC because of it. They are hiring and growing way to fast. Becoming just like the company that they make fun of all the time ""Oracle"". 

It's become a political and very corporate ""Suit Type's"" environment. It's a good old boy's club in NYC, and the talent is not that great. (All the talent is in Field Sales, and a few in Commercial here and there) 
Management is really corporate, and not that talented, picks who makes it and who dosent. IE: Backgrounds from Paychex and ADP, other payment companies, I mean, come on. All follow each-other, super cut-throat, and competitive, and not in a good way."

10351,Salesforce,A safe harbor for prima-donnas. Quality of software work is very low.,2012-05-18,1.0,Lead Member of Technical Staff,"Pay is great.  But the stock options and bonuses serve as a gilded whip to hold over employee's heads.  If you put aside your better technical judgements as an engineer you'll get along fine here.  If you're able to juggle being harassed by a co-worker every five minutes on IM, e-mail or phone and can still get productive work done, you may like it here.

You'll learn about about Agile development and how it can really work - in spite of the fact that group managers ignore the great recommendations of the agile training team.

During your first few weeks, do some careful analysis on the source code you'll be working with.  There's a sense at the company's that it's somehow infallible and should not be questioned.  If you disagree with that view on solid technical grounds, you'll be able to quickly determine whether or not you want to stay on. So, that transparency is a good thing.

The software release process and software upgrade process is good. So, you'll learn a lot about that.

Training is pretty good, but corporate policy has many self-conflicting points.","Don't expect to impact the software products in a meaningful way while you are there.  What you see when you get hired in terms of software coding practices is what you'll be expected to follow.  And, unfortunately, there's lots of room for improvement.

If you interview here, ask specific technical questions about software best practices and you're likely to get a clever ""non-answer.""  A lot of nice talk about what could be done, but nothing specific that translates into actual work quality.  While the Salesforce agile approach has all the ingredients a successful team can rely on, the use of those practices is whimsical.

The management puts its confidence into junior employees who don't know a thing about building quality software.  The middle management is useless on projects.  The senior engineers are targets that get poked at ruthlessly.  The website products are passable in quality, but the other products like mobile are lame. Lots of false starts and recalled releases from what I saw/heard from those teams.  The product vision for the company is unrealistic and egotistical.  Management professes that it wants their applications to have an ""addictive"" quality, but they don't even know how to approach that problem.  

I am glad I'm not there."
