Scheels does contribute to your HSA if you have one. 
You can work overtime and there's no questions asked. 
They are very flexible with schedules.","They expect employee's at least 15 minutes early to every shift. 
Management doesn't really listen to support when you tell them we need xyz to get this product on the floor.  My personal con is the store is closed on Easter, but there's no holiday pay. Any write up you receive will stay on your record permanently.  Also there is a gender pay gap."
1,Scheels,Issues everywhere,2022-04-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Discount is the only good thing,"You will be micromanaged, management doesn't care about any issues in the store, and you will constantly be staying up to an hour late every shift.

Lots of product","If your white ( particularly white and male ) you would do well here. 
They have no interest in diversity and inclusion or hiring anyone but white people. Are we surprised considering this is a Christian company that openly gave money to Trump campaigns? No. It all makes sense. 
They have extremely out of date sales systems AS400 if ya know what I mean. 

They say their competition is Dicks sporting goods but if they keep running the company the way they are, using out of date sales systems, no sensoring items at all in the store, and continue to have no interest in diversity and inclusion, they will be no competition for anyone eventually. They openly supported trump but do not openly support anything with lgbtq, or diversity. So it’s another company made by white men run by white men and throw in some religion ( all they play is disgusting old Christian music in the stores) and this is the company you get, it appeals to only the privileged. Even working there I did not hear of anyone actually enjoying working there. I know I did not and I felt very out of place is a female and part of the LGBTQ community. I could keep going on about my disappointment in this company but hopefully time will tell for everyone to see the true colors of the company. 
I’d work for Dicks any day because they truly care about employees, pay well, and are very invested in diversity and inclusion."

50,Scheels,Best Retail Part-Time Job,2022-01-25,5.0,Retail Sales Representative,"The hours are flexible and open to negotiation, with most of the managers being helpful and providing constructive criticism. They are open to talk to, and in retail where customers are often harsh to the employees, the managers will have your back unless you somehow have screwed up. 
The pay is also good if you are working with commission and you are provided other outlets to make non-taxed money. 
For a college student or a full-timer who needs extra money on the side, this place is the best retail job.
All in all, the environment is also welcoming and pleasant to work in. The only reason someone would not like working here is because it is retail so you have to deal with some rude and insane customers.

Also, you get an insane discount, which is enough to consider working here.","These cons are strictly part-time, and not full-time.

You are required to go to weekly/bi-weekly 1 hour trainings to learn about the product you are selling and selling routines/practices. This may be a con for some people, and most may not enjoy it. However, I actually find this very helpful and would have put this in the pros, but I know some may not like this.

The only con that would make someone not want to work here is that you are required to work your two weekends in the month. Of course, you can always ask someone to work it for you, or if it is impossible for you, I think they are open to workarounds."

This company is also very greedy about credit cards and you feel extremely pressured into pressuring people into signing up for the scheels visa. 
Long shifts every other weekend—sometimes 10-8 with only a 30 minute break. 
A lot of favoritism goes on here. If you want to advance positions, good luck—you better be a favorite.

Also the discount was amazing. The constant feeling of being welcomed.,"I was a full time (still am) student working a part time job on the fashion side. When I first started, I was told that things were going to be really flexible with my schedule and I had to agree to work one day of every weekend. I said ok thats doable. Well when I started, I was put on the schedule 3-4 times during the week on top of 3 days during the weekend (Friday, Saturday & Sunday) I was not able to do that, mainly because I am a full time student and studies come first. I expressed my concerns to management and to my ASL (assistant store leader) and she didn't even work with me. Telling me the same thing over and over again, we need to cover the store and you're going to have to figure this out or just leave. I literally had to give up special events because I had to work every single weekend and didn't have any time off.  I worked there for a little over 60 days and I loved it at first but as time went on, it just went down hill from there. I would really consider looking into things before you decide to work there. It will take a lot of time out of you, just an FYI"
410,Scheels,Cashier,2018-01-23,5.0,Cashier,"Great discount, great customer service experience. Friendly staff. Company has great moral and values.",Sometimes the environment can form into cliques between the different departments
411,Scheels,Why I Would Not Work at Scheels,2018-01-22,1.0,Sales Associate/Cashier,The Employee discount is great and the reason I waited to quit.,"Where do I even start with Scheels? To begin, my hiring process was ridiculous, and I should have known from the start this might not be the best job opportunity. It took almost three months and four interviews for them to hire me as a cashier. I had to call several times and stop in just to know where we were in the process. A professional store will let you know within two weeks if you are hired and what you should expect. I had originally applied to be either a café worker or a dressing room attendant. I did not apply to be a cashier, I had no interest in being a cashier. I took the offer because HR promised me I would be cross trained, and my cashier position would be temporary. This was a false claim, I was never a café worker and I don’t believe they ever really intended to give me the job I applied for. 
The hierarchy of their store is confusing and difficult to work with. There are multiple assistant store managers that all run the store, so when you have a specific problem its easy to get passed around without a clear chain of command. This also ensures that if you manage to get on the bad side of one ASL you will likely eventually be on bad terms with everyone. 
The schedule claims to be extremely flexible and to an extent it is. You do however, must know your entire schedule a month in advance, because that is how their calendar works. If for some reason you need to drop a shift, good luck. It is almost impossible to get anyone to cover for you for any reason. I would consider Scheels a very strict working environment, with not the best management. It works great for some people but not for me. You should be weary of a company that is, “always hiring.” Their turn over rate is so high that during my year and a half as a cashier, I never really got to know my coworkers. I saw most of them quit by the time I did. In the year and a half, I worked for Scheels I had troubles with their schedule and being scheduled when I said I was unavailable. I had problems with their direct deposit. There were a couple times when I just didn’t get paid and I had to wait several days for things to be worked out.  I felt like management didn’t really like me and it was a pretty stressful working environment."

456,Scheels,"Good Discounts, but you can't afford anything because the pay is terrible",2017-05-18,1.0,Specialty Shop Manager,Generally great co-workers.  Generous discounts.,"The companies mindset is stuck in the 1950's, and so is the pay rate.  Employees are ordering, merchandising, and expected to sell.  Commissions on what your shop sells worked out to about 23 cents/hour, and add that to the terrible base rate around $8/hour.  On a good day you could earn $20 in regular commissions.  Do the math, and full time employees with good sales are well below the poverty line."

Those who choose to leave often are going for a more fluid environment / more hip. This is a 115 year old company that has a culture that won't be going anywhere - so while it's easy to say adapt to change - there are somethings that can't, and won't change that will turn away individuals. Me? I'm tired of wearing a tie and shaving every day because the policy says so, I would probably do it every day but not having that option makes it a HR logistical nightmare."

471,Scheels,specialty shop manager,2017-02-03,2.0,Sales Associate,"The discount and retirement is excellent.  Working around people that are upbeat, professional, and trying to expand their place.  Get management experience before you work there not after.  You have much greater chance to advance with verified supervision experience.  Best PART TIME job or COLLEGE job to get for student.  For a career it can be a right fit.  Assistant managers advance within 3-3.5 years usually.   So if you haven't in that time continue as a part time employee so you can make maximize yourself.  Part timers working 20-30 hrs can make 50-65% what full time associates make.","The first year or two is like a game.  It is fun for people who like to sell and help people. Over time management will totally mess with your mind.   They ask you what you think.  Then you say your opinion.  Then they say but don't you think we should. Prepare to have about 6 supervisors simultaneously have different expectations about what you do, how you do it and the expected time.  When you are helping customers, they will ask you to get your freight out.  When you start putting your freight out, they will ask you why you are not helping customers. If you like to connect the dots and grow a place a consistent 2% a year and be a good lackey this is your dream gig.  If you get stuck with a real mean power hungry supervisor, there is no way to escape the torment other than to quit.  The Scheels family model is good but they thrive on controlling as many people they can by their twisted way to make you a  subservient yes man or woman lap dog.  You will be called a manager but you are a clerk.  They don't even let so called shop managers have outside e-mails.  They will have you place calls to vendors to check on open purchase orders. They forbid employees to have outside e-mails.  This place will suck your soul dry in the end and probably make you lose your spouse.  Great job for a person fresh out of college who needs real world skills."

492,Scheels,Sales Associate,2016-08-09,5.0,Sales Associate,"+ The people: Your co-workers become some of your closest friends. They are genuine people, and they want to help all of the customers with any needs that they may have. 

+ The ethics: Not many companies give customers the ability to return anything at anytime. For instance, if a customer bought a pair of socks a year ago and forgot about them and lost the receipt for them, he/she could still return them for whatever price they're listed at on the company database. That's pretty awesome. The company wants to do the right thing all the time, and that alone is a reason to work there. 

+ The competition: Scheels thrives off of healthy competition. Between daily sales goals and monthly inventory objectives, there are plenty of chances to make some extra cash. 

+ The loyalty: If you are loyal to the company, they are loyal to you. The benefits are fantastic if you stay with the company for at least a few years.","- The hours: It's a given, but retail hours can be daunting. Late nights, holidays, and weekends can make scheduling your personal life a little difficult. However, Scheels still has several extra holidays that they allow their employees to stay home on. For instance, the company is shut down on Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and Easter Sunday. It's pretty cool to have a retail company respect family time."

Most people who work there stay a few years to use it as a stepping stone to much better pay. They really brag about their ESOP program, but it take 20+ years for it to amount to anything.

-Super awesome employees. Most are very passionate and friendly and really know their departments.
-ESOP is amazing if you can stand to work there long enough to retire.","-Management is challenging due to the sheer number of employees and managers. Different managers seem to have different standards which can make for an overall difficult experience on the sales floor.
-Company does not seem to value individuality at all. While this can be said for many places, especially those with a dress code, the strictness of this particular one really surprised me. No beards, no visible tattoos or piercings, no unique hair colors which is all very strict, especially for an outdoors store. 
-Company is EXTREMELY conservative and lets it be known. Choice in music sometimes seems to drive away more liberally minded customers. 
-Sales associates are required to plug the Scheels visa in every sale for it to be legitimate. This turns many customers off and the incentive for getting a sign up is only $5 cash. May seem like a good deal, but many places offer a significantly better incentive
-Employee purchases and pro-deals are very limited. There is a monthly dollar limit as well as department restrictions for pro deals.  
-The only full time sales positions offered are for shop managers who are allowed to sell on the floor and make commission (a first for me at ANY company) on top of shop commission AND hourly. As a result many shops are in a state of organized chaos.
-Some managers seem to play a very obvious favorites game.
-The company makes you attend a two hour meeting EVERY Tuesday night regardless of weather you had worked that day. This means that some people have to commute to work to get paid very little for one to two hours.
-EXTREMELY low chances of advancement.

Although, getting married to someone from within SCHEELS seems to help with promotions, too.

The crazy amount of spouses, kids, girlfriends and boyfriends all magically ending up as ASLs is nothing short of a miracle. It must be an interesting job application process.

Promotions are based off of how well you get along with management, not the best person suited for a leadership role.

Typical terrible retail hours, holidays, nights, and weekends. There are many unrealistic expectation for both FT and PT employees.

600,Scheels,After 15 years I was let go after a work injury saying it affected my demeanor,2013-07-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"For a first job I do not think it could be beat.  New FT sales hires are trained extensively in most aspects of the business world, given a lot of autonomy and responsibility and good supervision, and any job in sales will give you a skill set that will help you the rest of your life.  Store leadership cares about employees and retention and are flexible in scheduling, both FT and PT.  Above average performers are quickly identified and coached towards advancement, although the funnel narrows quickly above entry-level, so it is tough competition for advancement.  The company is growing and there is always an opportunity for proven employees to move to new markets.  More corporate level buying positions are being added every year, and are a great for the right 'company person.'  Scheels buying power and brand offerings are tough to beat, so it is a great feeling to sell the best stuff.  The store emphasis on customer service is real and tough to match in any retail environment.  ESOP growth is out of this world and you are vested after 5 years.","It's retail, and that means evenings, weekends, and holidays.  Turnover is also high, but lower than the average retailer for FT'ers.  I think the company hangs onto sub-par people too long and that affects the whole crew.  Store management teams are large, so as in any work environment you have people of varying skill and ability there.  401(k) does exist, but is not matching, so what's the point?  Any advancement requires you to really buy into the Scheels systems, and any corporate advancement requires you to live in Fargo, ND, and travel 80+ nights a year, and really be 'on the team.'  Your co-workers end up being your only friends.  Company board of directors are mostly 'old school' store managers who do a good job of adapting to the changing retail environment and guiding the company in a successful direction, and can produce numbers in their own stores, but are not effective managers.  CEO and President are son and father, and are not very nice people.  Retired store managers still receive significant bonuses from stores they led or managers they trained, which seems like a huge drain on profits.  No vision plan, and health/dental are on the high side of price, regardless of what they say."

Retail hours aren't for everyone, and the shifts often run longer than 8hrs (management is required to work an open to close weekend once a month, and even part timers usually have to do at least one open to close).

Emphasis on talking to every customer can end up annoying customers because they get bombarded by employees. Have to work most weekends. Must attend store meetings every Wednesday night at 9 P.M. You must make your sales goal (or get fired). Can't make purchases with employee discount unless product has been in store for a month or more. They keep doing better as a company, so they keep pushing their employees for more and more sales--can make sales people feel disingenuous. If you work in softlines (clothing), you will generally make the least amount of money compared to salespeople in shoes, midlines (equiptment), and hardlines (guns etc.) because the items you sell don't cost as much."

They also give you a ton of training, and you meet with your team leader frequently to discuss positives, things to work on, etc.","Base pay could be a LOT better, very heavily focused on sales goals, part-timers don't get much. It's a lot of work at the start because you have to get super familiar which all of the merchandise in your area."

618,Scheels,Great part time opportunity with terrific employee discounts but.....,2012-04-27,2.0,,"Part timers are treated like gold.  Sales staff on the floor get wages plus commission and have annual chances to win great trips and cruises.  The flip-side is that no such incentive is offered to the support staff such as clerical or freight and receiving.  ESOP is terrific if you can stand to work there long enough.    After 25-30 years with the company, you could retire with $500,000. Opportunities are available to anyone with sales floor experience who wants to enter the management training program.  Scheels arguably provides the best Customer Service around too.","Micro-managing can be intense and counter productive.  The management training places so much emphasis on learning how to dodge the financial and wage concerns of the employees.  Even during annual assessments, you're not allowed to discuss it.  They tell us our families should come first, but expect to learn that they talk the talk but don't walk the walk.   Upper management lives in mansions, while many of the full time employees take second jobs just to make ends meet."
