Some good benefits
RSUs average","There is no real review process and nothing is written, maybe deliberately, so that you can't complain or respond (not that it would make any difference). This is in line with the absence of modern internal tools and processes, which is beyond belief for a company that sells itself as the workflow leader.
Reviews are based on ""opinions"" rather than results.; this leads to the promotion of the ""in"" crowd, regardless of performance.
The review process is called ""360"" but in reality is unilateral, from the top down."

Leadership pivots constantly - there seems to be no ability to put a PIN in it so you can get the job done and it affects your ability to be successful in your role. We are told 'this is what innovation looks like' as if that makes our stress level acceptable. It's not innovation, it's lack of leadership and the result of constant pivoting affects working relationships with partners and the customer experience.
DE&I remains a challenge, we talk the talk, but I am hearing we don't always walk the talk... equity matters."

I even reached out to the recruiter to ask what was up, 'this is not the job you described', his response was the policy doc for transfering teams.

There is no data. SeriouslyAnd if there was, noone would share it anyway.

The most basic everyday operation tasks are bogged down by very angry and defensive middle managers, who are also fighting for their survival.

Landgrabbing is insane . 
Stay out of the way of empire builders.
Staff who have worked here for a while are afraid of metrics and accurate reporting as it will shine a light on underperforming assets etc. So they kill reporting at all times. Data driven or logic driven ideas are killed by managers worried by a zeitgeist before their four years shares vest. 
I wish I never took this job but I can't afford to leave."

I really enjoy working at SN, people are nice, the work is interesting and challenging. I've had very busy weeks but also some very light weeks. It seems WLB varies teams to teams but from my experience it has been good, and usually take more than 4 weeks for vacations per year. Company always has been remote friendly but since the pandemic it has been remote first. With that comes the good and the bad. If you like WFH, then this is great!

ServiceNow has tremendous future opportunities and if the execution keep on being successful, the quick growth will continue.","We have a big campus in India, although I always had good experiences working with colleagues over there, if a project needs fast paced collaboration you are needed to have meetings really early morning or late evening (California - India time difference)
Avoid being on those projects if that's not your cup of tea!

On the Engineering side, I've only worked on Platform teams but talking with folks from application teams it seems like working on the platform is more interesting/challenging. If you're looking for that, I'd go for Platform."

The company is very organized and has an employee portal that you use to go through the process of being onboarded. My manager also organized a spreadsheet and coordinated meetings with other teams to onboard me as well as other new hires onto the team itself. My manager also established weekly 1:1 meetings from the start. Having 1:1's with your manager is highly encouraged here. 

The company has published a ton of internal content and has been effective in establishing processes around things which I greatly appreciate.

Benefits are great and they have a virtual assistant to help with getting you set up with health insurance. This was so amazingly helpful.","It takes a bit of time to figure out where to locate specific company-wide documents and information but it's all about getting comfortable using their system and portal. Anything new is going to take time getting use to. It can feel a bit overwhelming at first but you learn as you go. 

Working remote can feel a bit isolating. Although my manager does a great job with having a steady cadence of team meetings, I don't connect too much with my teammates. I wish it was more encouraged to check in on your teammates and how they're doing."

Managers spend every waking minute trying to impress their leadership instead of supporting their team. 

Consistent processes are nowhere to be found. We don't even know how to use our own technology efficiently. And it looks like it's from 1995."

352,ServiceNow,Even the best technology does not substitute for genuine people interaction,2021-12-14,2.0,Confidential,"I’ll give ‘em this – they have the technology thing down. One of the best experiences I have ever had as a new hire. Unfortunately, this was only one of a few positives I have to say. With what I had heard about the company and the promise it offered, I had hoped my experience would have been longer term. Instead, I departed from the organization (and no, I was not fired) only having added to my list of the things NOT to do as a colleague and or manager. 
I give credit where credit is due and to round off my list of positives: the pay was excellent, and they said the right things from the onset. If you experienced a first day only, you would have been impressed. Where other organizations haven’t a clue as to how to get their new employees on-boarded this company has it down. I quickly became aware of the fact that the company wants to be diverse, inclusive and have everyone bring their “authentic” self to work. They also are super proud of their product, and their customers, and all of the employees that make the “magic” happen. But it is quickly apparent that their ability to execute on anything remotely close to what they describe as a purpose driven culture leaves much to be desired.","On the surface this is “the place to work” but when you get to the core it is far from magical. Leaders act as though they walk on water. Team members are anything but welcoming. Bringing your authentic self really translates into you have liberty to do anything you want with little or no ramifications. I personally had to find my own way. No one wants to do anything that isn’t in their own personal interest and when you step up and be “that person” you are instantly chastised- something that no one else initially wanted to do becomes a free for all for others to criticize. As a matter of fact, it seems like everyone avoids getting work done just based on the sole reason that every non-mission critical task gets opened up to vetting beyond nauseum. You could have someone from a completely different business function telling you how to do something that you have done your entire career, but no one has your back to end the nonsense. You are expected to ride out the politics without a clear path to success – in anything. 
To say that leadership is innate may be true and if so, they are not finding leaders with this innate capability. In my experience here leaders/managers live by a “do as I say, not as I do” motto. I am in the mid to late stages of my career and have held many leadership positions, and I am blown away at how uninspired the leaders at this company make me feel. I was in a meeting one time with a leader showcasing some up & coming bells and whistles that were to be rolled out. I asked the question how did they plan to inform colleagues about this? His response: This is a self-service culture. That’s the beauty of what we implement, it needs little or no introduction. And I’ll give him this… there isn’t anything that is full service at this organization especially in the leadership department. Leaders manage to computer generated “nudges” and have little or no interest in what motivates their team members. For a company that is in touch with the uniqueness of their workforce they should be intimately aware that everyone is wired differently and thus a little effort to get to know their staff would go a long way. No one gave a lick about me as a person. So believe it or not I’ll end this- here. If you want a job where you have almost every freedom you could possibly think of and decent pay- I would say hop on board. If you want a career experience that is going to make you feel a sense of accomplishment and feel respected for what you bring to the table, RUN AWAY as fast as you can."

535,ServiceNow,Great place to learn,2021-09-17,5.0,Principal Curriculum Developer,"The learning opportunities are phenomenal. If you tend to get bored with a job after a while.... this will never happen. There is always something new to learn, and there are opportunities for movement within the company. They were very open to remote workers, long before COVID hit. The stock incentives and employee referral programs were nice too.","Due to the spectacular growth of the company, sometimes staffing levels didn't keep up with the incoming work."

Shocking to see those practices being shielded rather than pruned out."
537,ServiceNow,I like where I work,2021-09-16,4.0,Senior Program Manager,Culture here is second to none.,The promotional path is not fair.
538,ServiceNow,Generous pay and great Environment - but sometimes stressful,2021-09-16,5.0,Technical Support Intern,"Interns and Graduates are payed generously, significantly more than what other companies are willing to pay. The weekend pay and overtime pay is particularly generous 
You're not expected to know more than you would expect a graduate to know, tests aren't filled with task that you will never need to carry out when you get the job 
You're trained from the ground up and are assigned mentors who can help you in a pinch
You get to get hands on very early and do actual work instead of being made to do menial task that won't develop any of your skills
The offices are great, they're snacks available for everyone, quiet areas to destress, games room to socialise and play in during breaks, clean office spaces that aren't cramped and overcrowded and decent office furniture. 
The company culture is great, there's loads of opportunities to mingle and socialise with your team and everyone is friendly and willing to lend a helping hand
The Job can be very fulfilling and it's easy to get absorbed in it - so time really flies if you're into problem solving and investigating issues
There's loads of benefits and company programs going on, so you get a lot of free stuff and compensation for stuff you wanted to buy
You're given your own Laptop and other equipment that you can use to work from home if you earn enough trust or if you're unable to make it to the office
You get to work with employees from many different companies and ServiceNow is well known and respected in its industry. This means it looks great on you CV and there are companies who will favour you if you've worked with their platform","It's hard and takes a long time to go through the process of annotating and preparing your work for take over when you want to go on holiday 
The job can sometimes be very demanding and stressful, so you need to learn to manage your time well, prioritise workloads well and try to find to destress so it doesn't burn you out. You may end up not being able to get work out of you mind after work and on weekends if you don't learn ways to balance your life outside of work and work
The enthusiasm for the company and it's products can sometimes seem a bit cultish and weird in events and in internal social media. It was somewhat awkward to witness/participate in events as a result, but they were still fun
The customer facing side of the job sometimes really sucks. Sometimes customers are very frustrating to work with or very rude and unreasonable, and some of the processes you need to use during interaction spawns these issues or exacerbate them
Working and communicating with certain other teams in the organisation can be difficult and tedious. ServiceNow is an international organisation, so you can't walk up to and directly communicate with some of the people you need to work with (since they won't be in the same office or continent) - and that brings about the issue of dealing with people being difficult with you online in a way the would not be in person - however, this is an issue common with such an organisation"

Leadership turns a blind eye any time problems are raised

Managers do not support the culture, pushing their own, old boys’ school “culture” as being more important instead. People who are meant to be managers and leaders are simply fragile bullies, and the organization rewards that.

ServiceNow takes seriously their commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. The DIBs group has the ear of upper management and has regular contact with all of us.
ServiceNow spoils me on working conditions, though I admit my bar is lower than most. I don't have to go out next to 2000-degree bars of steel on a dirt floor or maintain cranes 6 stories above ground, or breathe fumes from pickling acid or galvanizing lines.

First-time CMO, Alan Marks, struggles to unify the marketing org. He continues to make constant reorgs and direction changes and brings in new leadership to “fix” the problems. I witnessed lots of good people just unexpectedly get fired, making everyone nervous and living in fear they are next. Groups are working in silos and struggle to do any meaningful work due to bureaucracy and role duplication. The work quality bar is low, favoring speed. That is because everyone spends all the time in meetings and dealing with politics and not working. The company lacks basic processes that you would expect at a company this size (there is seriously no standardized hiring process). There is lots of hype around ServiceNow being a top company, but I have found the culture to be extremely political and toxic. Senior leadership operates in the command and conquer model with very little empowerment to its people. 

I also witnessed lots of people leave other top companies to join ServiceNow only to be crushed and deflated within the first few months. Senior leadership sugar coats the problems by describing it as a “hyper-growth” company because the problems are cemented into the company culture."

Incredibly fast paced environment...which is good until it's bad (hello burnout).","The people team is pretty much a dumpster fire right now. During my tenure the existing CHRO left and a new one was hired...and then fired 2 months later (which of course caused a downstream exodus of leaders). While I'm glad they realized it wasn't a fit immediately, ServiceNow didn't have internal HR until 3 years ago so people systems are SEVERELY lacking with literally no leadership in sight. 

I've also truly truly truly never experienced so much workplace politics. I had to tip toe, bend over backwards, and even schedule separate meetings with two people who refused to get along. It was exhausting keeping up with who was fighting with who every week. This may not be the case in other departments but wow it was out of control within the People Team. 

The dept also skews older which isn't necessarily a bad thing in general (and I've been on other teams like this), except at SN I experienced age bias for being younger. It sucked and really made me feel like me and my ideas weren't valued. If the conditions on the People Team were different, I would have LOVED to stay with ServiceNow for several more years but ultimately decided that my mental health was more important than a paycheck."

All my colleagues working in other departments love their jobs and enjoy doing meaningful work.,"This review is specific to HR (Global Talent). I’ve been working in the department for 3 years and it’s had its ups and downs. The most recent down swing has been terrible. There has been a mass exodus among HR leadership, and with it, any semblance of empathy for a department that’s been beaten down. The interim leadership has brought in fresh blood from organizations like Walmart which have brought along their toxic culture from those organizations (I.e. kick down and kiss up, a culture of fear and threats) that has driven down our employee engagement scores to the lowest in the company (by a large margin). In the most general sense, it is a terrible place to work within a company that is a great place to work."

845,ServiceNow,Mixed Bag,2021-05-06,2.0,Data Engineer,ServiceNow is a fast-paced growing company that more people are hearing about. Great salary along with generous RSUs. The CEO has a lot of energy and a great vision for the company.,"My time at ServiceNow had its ups and downs. ServiceNow operates like a really big start-up company. Since it is a big company, your experience will depend a lot on your manager and team. Its grown really fast to the point where the internal systems/processes haven't really had a chance to catch up. This makes the work days longer for employees. For example, the on-boarding process was pretty messy. I received my laptop a few days late and it also took several months to get access to systems I needed to use for my job. 

I worked in the IT group, and a lot of my co-workers were spread out globally in off-shore locations. It was normal to work around the clock and have multiple meetings at night since development was happening in off-shore. I would estimate that I probably had around 2-3 meetings every night during the week and stayed up late to help out with projects/tasks. Working here can be pretty demanding because of the high expectations and 12-15 hours required to collaborate with off-shore to get your projects done. I also noticed that a lot of people in my group were contractors, so they didn't have a lot of knowledge on the business and needed to have their hand held a lot of the times. I would say it was pretty normal to work or get urgent slack messages over the weekend to fix something in the system as well. There were also a lot of times where I had to fix code that was done by the off-shore team because they were causing issues in production and it was already late on their side. I think a lot of other groups might be better when it comes to balance, but a lot of people I talked to in other groups also felt that their work-load was way too demanding. I think it is just a combination of things moving really fast, without a sense of direction by middle management.

Overall, I learned a lot and gained good experience here, but decided to leave for a better paying opportunity with better WLB because of the demanding hours/workload, having to collaborate with off-shore, and having to work over the weekend here. I would say this is a good place if you are just out of college or new into the industry, but overall wouldn't recommend if you value your work/life balance."

2. Learning opportunities
3. Org restructuring in order to accomplish the company vision and goals
4. Standing within and amongst industry peers","1. CEO leadership , enthusiasm and clear direction for where company needs to go does not trickle down to the managerial level. some Managers unable to create a vision and direction for team, cant think strategically
2. many managers lack functional expertise and people management skills. Unclear why ICs are promoted to managers ,have direct reports if the only value they add is to pass through instructions and be reactive to leadership demands. Disillusionment and demoralizing behaviour from managers contributing to toxicity - being informed that its easier to get a promotion under a different GM speaks volumes. Its a lie when they say your career growth is in your own hands. Getting promoted is solely at the discretion of your manager and other factors outside of your control. Not objective. If the manager has poor influence and visibility within the org then that impacts an IC from being recognized for promotion. Combine this with manager having poor functional expertise and being generally clueless fosters lack of trust. EVS surveys are not anonymous and having discussion with manager is useless as retaliation is real, intent is thrown out the window when having 1:1 discussions to work through things.
3. you have to learn the game of politics and play the game as many aspects of your career growth, especially for new or mid career, is not objective and depends on many other factors. If you are in a org that doesnt have visibility or where manager has no respect then good luck. Likelihood one can devolve, self doubt and develop mental health issues is very possible. 
3. The toxicity has resulted in people competing with each other to gain visibility instead of collaborating toward a common goal."

Previous leadership is good.","Too much politics in IDC. Lack of good leadership. Judgemental.

Leadership has no visibility into your work. Managers have no tracking or technical visibility.

Hard working people are not recognized. People with good network have growth.
You will get lost if you don't have network. 

Promotions are complete bias and not based on your performance.

Applicable for both development and QA.

No salary growth. Stocks are saving heavy attrition.

No Learning Opportunities . Only Politics and Show Offs."

1252,ServiceNow,"Great people, less technologies",2020-09-24,4.0,Staff Software Engineer,"Great WLB, great people, good methodologies","Lots of bureaucracies, the new-age 'paper work', on call duties"
1253,ServiceNow,One of the best employers in the world!,2020-09-24,5.0,Senior Staff Engineer,"Lots of companies pay lip service to the cliche, ""Employees are our greatest asset"". 
ServiceNow *acts* on it; from top management down, they really show that they care. For instance:
- Little ""care"" packages couriered to every employee's home for holidays.
- A Covid grant for people to spend on things to make lockdown easier.
- During Covid, they saw the stats that people were taking less leave, and they were concerned that the line between work and personal life was getting blurred. So they officially closed the office for a day, and *forbade* people from working. (Needless to say, it was a free paid vacation day.)
- Management is really open minded. They freely admitted that they'd run the productivity stats, and found that people were *more* productive working from home during Covid. So they're much more open now to people working from home on a long term basis (no promises on this point, BTW - it'll depend on your role, obviously).
- Guaranteed no-lose employee share participation programs.
- Key employees get generous share grants that act as nice golden handcuffs.

The culture of the company is also amazing. Every new person I meet, from any branch in the world, is just *nice*. They appear to have a No Jerks Allowed hiring policy.

All told, in my ~25 year career, ServiceNow is the best company I've ever worked for.","For better or for worse, ServiceNow is a large corporation, and the wheels of bureaucracy can turn really slowly. My hiring process took over a month, for instance. Every stage of the software development process has to go through committees and a formal approval process. Also they're really slow to adopt new technology - we're on a version of Java that's 7-8 years old. If you're used to working in startups, this can be a bit of a culture shock. On the other hand, as a large corporate it is also very stable, and they have the peace of mind to be super generous with employees, investing in their training, and giving lots of other really great benefits.

Another small thing: the top management is based in California, and they've been drinking a lot of BLM and other politically Left Kool-Aid. It's annoying, but mostly harmless, so you can just leave them to do their virtue signalling while you get on with your job."

If you think about ServiceNow as the major cloud platform player it is, the culture is what you would expect. As a veteran of both start ups and tech bellweathers, the culture here matches the worst examples of political fiefdoms, where knowledge is treated as capital so skunkworks projects and political power plays abound. The second issue - the most successful people here are transparent rear-end kissers. In the choice between doing good and looking good, you have to have an understanding of what your manager thinks good is and emulate it. It is a constant source of bad decisions and groupthink. Some of us who focus on execution have terrible hours and poor work-life balance, while others hide and rest / vest. Lastly, immature processes abound - way too many for a company that is far beyond its startup roots, yet many of the same executives from those days are still there.

2) the company and executive team have a clear vision and are driving the company to be extremely successful
3) the products are very powerful and innovative","1) the company continues to be plagued by poor hiring decisions in middle-management, where inexperienced managers are driving lower level employees away
2) the culture overall has improved over the last 5+ years, however, it is still a pretty toxic environment where most people feel the need to prove themselves in order to gain any sort of recognition/validation
3) executive decisions on the priorities of the products have changed course over the last year, which is understandable, but has caused incubation products to be killed and the hard work of many to go out the window.
4) if you come in at a low salary, good luck ever getting paid what you actually deserve in the market. they use excuses that HR can only give you a certain % increase, which would make sense, except why isn't there pay equality in the first place when you first make the hire?
5) the benefits have improved over the last 3 years since getting a new HR leader, however, it's still not close to what other similar companies are offering, and employees often feel that hard work will still go unnoticed because it is up to the specific department to promote these benefits and ensure employees are aware of them, are taking enough PTO, are getting all the perks they deserve, etc.
6) some leaders are only looking out for themselves. I have come across many Director-VP level folks that will take the credit for the successes of their department, but will never take the fall for any of the mistakes. Additionally, not giving enough recognition to the hard work of their team."

1344,ServiceNow,A company that truly cares about their employees,2020-06-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is the best company I’ve worked at so far in my career! I’ve touched startups, agencies, and mid sized companies which all have it’s pros and cons so I was a little bit nervous to jump into corporate world. Sure it comes with the standard office politics, no where is perfect but there’s nothing here I can’t handle, I’ve dealt with worse problems- way worse at other companies. 

- There is virtually no ego here. You know those meetings where there’s that person/few people who feels extremely strongly about their opinion and won’t back down at all? Like their answer is the only right answer? Well the people here don’t have that mentality, sure we still have arguments but it’s always from the mentality of we’re a team, let’s make the product the best it can be for our customers rather than stroking our own egos. This is such a breath of fresh air. 
- Which leads to the next benefit, no finger pointing. Throughout my career I have faced countless departments and teams not owning up to their mistakes and would rather throw someone else under the bus. That does not fly here. We do not dwell on mistakes, we accept it and try to find a solution as quickly as possible. Because guess what, the milk has already spilled so no use finger pointing. How can we help each other do better? I love that we act as strong as our weakest link so it’s in our best interest to support those who need help. To help each other learn and grow. 
- I feel like our leadership actually cares about us. It’s very genuine and sincere and you can see it from how they carry themselves. How at each all-hands, they mention that rather than only focusing on numbers. Because guess what, they know that taking care of employees lead to better work. I don’t know why that’s such a hard concept for companies to grasp, treat your employees well and they’ll want to stay. We were one of the first companies to go full remote on a global scale because of the 2020 Covid19 pandemic. And then weeks later, everybody else followed suit. I love that they address head on the issues happening in the world like George Floyd and Black Lives Matter movement. This is a company that truly cares and makes a genuine effort rather than virtue signaling on social media. 
- Amazing people 
- Top of the line benefits and perks
- I can go on and on but I think you get the point. There’s a reason we’ve been recognized for so many things. Also we were ranked 3rd for happiest employees in the US!","- Typical corporate stuff like a lot of teams so hard to know which resource to go to sometimes
- They seem pretty strict on years of experience corresponding to IC level. Like you’re not going to find a 25 year old in a Senior position here. 
- The internship program is only open to those enrolled in school. I’m not a fan of this methodology because it doesn’t help those less fortunate who couldn’t afford college or who wants to make a career switch. We should make tech jobs more accessible"
1345,ServiceNow,Never felt like I belong more,2020-06-10,5.0,Senior Talent Acquisition Partner,"Fantastic company that genuinely cares about us as employees. I've felt it since I joined but even more so during this crisis where they have thought about how it may be impacting employees, offering extra benefits, support and unrivalled communication from the US leadership.

2. Musical Chairs : Constant unnecessary organizational changes to cater to ""extremely"" insecure and political leaders at the top trying to maintain their power balance and trying to give their equally insecure and incompetent inner circle plum positions of power and manipulation.
3. Toxic Work Environment for Women : Women Managers are especially badly treated with no growth prospects and promises made that are not  kept...just take a look at the number of women over manager level in the product organization (way way lower than standard benchmarks).  I have personally seen multiple cases of women getting bullied at work and not having the courage to speak out due to fear of retaliation and getting fired or demoted at a whim.
4. Inefficient Sales - this team knows how to effectively sell IT solutions but is faltering very badly when it comes to selling other new products, makes you question SNOW's strategy of selling into new segments and verticals ...if I had to come up with two words for it - EPIC FAIL!

-Training: On top of your required 80% billable hours per year, they will assign you an absurd amount of training throughout the year and expect you to complete it, even if you're resourced at 40 hours per week with client work. They do not care about Work/Life balance.

Marketing leadership is near the worst I've seen. The CMO is insecure in his own abilities, and therefore leads through bullying and fear tactics. The other C-suite members largely disregard Marketing's input, due to a lack of confidence in leadership. Most of the power now sits with the Chief Communications Officer.

 Engineers with server side skills will have no opportunity to build on that skill unless you are in the platform team.

Each month, I feel I’ve grown professionally. Think about how many places can create that type of growth-enabling environment...not many.

ServiceNow is a place where your skills, competency, and adaptability will be tested. Some will fail. Some rocket to profound success. 

This is a varsity team in a world-class league. My colleagues are brilliant and highly competent. To be successful, you have to earn your way to a starting , 1st string role. Those who cannot perform or are unwilling to progress towards it, have a difficult time in this environment. Those who can perform OR are willing to take control of their development will find great comfort in the culture the ServiceNow leadership has cultivated- a culture of critical thinking, deductive reasoning, and winning.

I’m humbled each day. Although I don’t consider myself  “world-class,” I know that in time, being in this environment, I will get there eventually. And for that, I give this company five stars.

Other pros:
-Long but reasonable hours. Office at HQ is pretty empty at 6. Sometimes after work hours are needed.
-Great comp

1436,ServiceNow,"Innovative products, ineffective leadership.",2019-12-14,2.0,Sales Executive,"ServiceNow's platform and applications are great and support almost any kind of use case, processes and workflows. ServiceNow is the best product on the market right now, by far. This provides employees (and customers) a huge intellectual interest and excitement to sell (and purchase), effectiveness to deliver and opportunities to land and expand the technology in many industries. Most of the people on the ground are smart, courageous, creative, helpful and friendly with each others.","ServiceNow applied the traditional and outdated 20 years old standard recipe for running a license sale company looking for (huge) growth and diversification. This makes ServiceNow very efficient to guarantee good earnings to the board and investors but also very expensive and complex.

The company built a matrix organization by recruiting expensive middle management with no other given role but acting like excel sheets and report to other ""excel sheets"" managers. Some of them are great leaders taking the ""human"" part of the job very seriously. Most of them, especially in the Sales organization, are successful reps with bad management abilities placed here by VP's who don't know how to recruit leaders other than looking at their past numbers.

To mitigate that, people on the ground are overwhelmed on a daily basis by illusory and insincere messages, emails and mandatory activities falling from the top injuncting employees to be super happy.

If you are planning to be a Sales Rep at ServiceNow, bear in mind that the majority of them are delivering three digits YoY growth on their territories and still struggle to make their quota. ServiceNow is doing minimum 100% of growth every year while +60% of the Reps are not at plan.

Pricing is complex but you can deal with it. What is more problematic is that new products are sometimes very badly priced (2x, 3x or more compared to the competition price) which makes ServiceNow loosing deals and the sales product middle management hasn't the bravour to escalade that to the board."

The people who have been promoted to management (especially in Sales Operations) are under qualified, immature, and incompetent.  The only reason why ServiceNow likes to hire from within is that the pre-IPO “management” are afraid of people from the outside who actually have relevant experience.  They simply don’t want to be exposed for the clowns that they are.   If you choose to work here, be prepared for constant backstabbing and high school antics.  Seriously folks, get a grip.  You’re not saving lives.

There is little to no guidance about doing your job, and the expectation is you’ll just “figure it out” once you’re handed your Active Directory credentials.  Management will boast about the great work/life balance they have; meanwhile you’re working 15 hour days and killing your set for nothing.  The “changes” to the culture are so surface level it’s comical.  Plastering slogans all over walls and having pictures of people with piercings and tattoos on the website doesn’t mean the company has a great culture, or even a good one.  

Bottom line - if you’re not pre-IPO, willing to degrade yourself to get ahead, or just desperate for a paycheck, ServiceNow is not the place for you."

Culture is nothing like what the ServiceNow corporate message tries to convey
Cronyism
Management has favourite employees that will always get promotions
Hire and fire mentality 
Abhorrently poor middle management that act only as mouthpieces for senior leadership and have no opinions of their own

1456,ServiceNow,"Bad Managers, Culture of Fear, Very Depressing",2019-11-12,1.0,Business Operations,Commute is to office is good,"Lots of bad managers here - lack of trust, suspicion, micro-managing.  If a Director of VP doesn’t personally like you then you will be put on notice and reported to HR for the most outrageous and stupid reasons such as “the way you look” during a meeting or “not taking notes during a meeting”.  Managers abusing authority and trying to fire people for the most frivolous reasons like not having enough details on a timeline.  Manager secretly recording conversations using smart watch during 1:1 without permission.  Didn’t want to confront manager about it due to fear and retaliation.  ServiceNow hires just as fast as they fire people.  Instead of motivating, coaching people and developing the employees, the bad managers will try to nitpick, abuse authority, micro-manage, de-motivate you, constantly threatening that “your job is at risk” and they will do whatever they can to make your life a living hell.  You will never get any work done at ServiceNow because the bad managers are constantly traumatizing you and abusing authority.  In addition, ServiceNow will strategically try to do whatever they can to fire you before your RSU vesting period.  Other people have commented about this and it is true.  When I first joined, I noticed a wave of people leaving the company, which was a red flag and indicator that the Director was firing people and hiring “his kind” so he can have command and control and instill fear among his newly direct subordinates from the same culture as him.  Favoritism and cronyism is rampant and very apparent the first few weeks I joined.  Work culture is very depressing.  Lots of alcoholics at ServiceNow who stash hard liquor in their offices and cubes.  You come into their office and there are rows of liquor bottles on the table next to their computer.  Is life that bad at ServiceNow that you have to bring in your own hard liquor to make the pain and abuse go away?  The answer is yes.  Beer bash day is fine, but HR needs to clean up and make it policy that only company bought beer is allowed and people need to stop bringing their own liquor bottles and displaying it to everyone at the office.  The culture is abusive, fearful, and not a safe environment.  As everyone should know, HR is not to be trusted as they are there to protect the company from lawsuits."

Only sending his favorites onsite just to roam around other destinations instead of doing any actual work.

Director favorites enjoying a lot of flexibility which are not applicable for others especially new joiners. They can come at any time (mostly post lunch), unlimited wfh, standups from home but for others if you are late for standups for even a min then you are ruining team culture. Micromanagement at its peak for new joiners.
You can't complain of bad behavior/provoking attitude by his favorites who are not behaving like they own the company. I haven't seen any company where director spends more than 50% of his time gossiping in his room about stock and real estate.

You can't survive in this team by doing only work or maintaining professional relationship. You need to constantly praise the director and do boot licking to be able to survive in his team.  Hats off to this company for still keeping him. Any other company he would have been fired by now like he got fired in his previous organization."

First of all no good work comes to Hyderabad. You only have to application development on their platform. Or solve customer issues. 

Staff Engineers don't do any work, they just show up, manage and help manager for interviews. Do you believe that Staff Engineers don't write any code. But always show up other work as theirs. There is no value to the people who know servicenow and do all work.

Hike and stocks is not in par with Staff and other people. No respect or decent hike for long time serving people.

Managers just depend on Staff and don't care about team. They leave the team to them to manage. Now your hike and everything is depends on your relationship with Staff Engineers. They manage teams and decide who has to stay or leave. They decide who will be hired. 

I enquired in other teams before moving out , but friends told it is worst in their teams.

Careful of fake reviews from HR and managers.

2) Growing like crazy, so much opportunity to learn and advance in every part of the org 
3) There is a pride in our product that is rare (and deserved). 
4) We are truly are hungry and humble (one of our values). The entitlement you see at other Tech companies is non-existent, and people are hungry to keep raising the bar and do it QUICK (I left a similar sized tech company with WAY more red tape and bureaucracy, I'm amazed at how fast you can do things here ). 5) Great work/life balance! 
6) John Donahoe and the world-class leadership team have transformed this company over the last few years
7) They care about diversity, inclusion and equality. We're still building this capability but the company/leaders truly believe in this and are taking positive steps.","A lot of people who've been here 3-5+ years struggle with the rapid change we're in now. They want to do it ""the way it's always been done"" and many have never worked for a world-class org and don't know how to scale. So there's some growing pains between employees who are legacy and newly hired in the last ~2 years.

Don't come here if you need a nap pod. Or expect free gelato on every floor. The snack rooms are well stocked with good food, but we do pay for lunch in the tasty and affordable cafe. The benefits are almost as good as industry, 401k is still lower, but everything else pretty much on-par.

Most of the company is fantastic, but within one org in particular, priorities may shift at any given moment.  Your team may be working toward one objective, then your team is asked to drop everything to rush out a new project.

There is new leadership in charge of Accounting/Payroll/SEC/Revenue and that leadership views people as ""wasted spend""; they laid off the entire Amsterdam team and expect the HQ team to absorb all that work, it was communicated that you should expect long hours, and if you werent ok with that, you should leave; they pay far below market on base salaries and the pay discrepancy between people is unbelievable. They are slowly outsourcing all of accounting to India and I would expect the rest of finance to follow...this is not a ship to join unless you like working long hours and like working for narcissists and apathetic leaders."

1576,ServiceNow,High Growth & Strong Leadership,2019-03-08,5.0,Marketing Director,"In the 2+ years I’ve been with ServiceNow, I’ve seen tremendous evolution and growth.   In particular, the leadership they’ve brought on is phenomenal.  The values they’ve instilled, and the culture they’re building, are authentic and inspirational.  I see them “walking the talk” every day, and it’s flowing throughout the organization.  There will always be pockets of mixed personalities and challenges across teams, but compared to other companies I’ve been a part of in the Bay Area, ServiceNow is amazing.
Growth is truly an understatement.  We’re on an incredible trajectory, and we’re not slowing down.  If you’re good at what you do, there is so much potential across the organization to move up, move around, and continue learning.  
World class innovation and people.  Working on the best technology and making an impact on the way people work is pretty cool.  Combine that with incredible talent at this company, and it’s a place where you’re always learning and growing in your field.","If you’re not a performer, and don’t have the drive to work hard, this is not the place for you.  It is not a place where you go to be complacent, take long lunches, and have an easy ride.  There are nutty days and often long hours, but on the plus side there is a lot of flexibility, and there’s definitely reward for the effort.
Because of the pace of growth, it can be a challenge to get things done.  As new teams and roles are formed, there’s an element of “who’s on first?” at times.  Process and structure take time, and we’re not there in all areas.  Again, some personalities will thrive in this environment, but it’s not for everyone."

Seeing people get out of the ADR role seems like they're opening up their career to more possibilities.","Never have I seen an office filled with more incompetent leadership. I think only 1 has any real sales experience. Some of senior ADR manager grew up cheating the system for meetings, so now they teach of all of their ADR's how to game the system. You can't blame the new people but I feel bad for this being our first or 2nd work place experience.

Advice for any new hirer: Make ""Phone calls"" and spam emails then log these into the horrible, home-grown CRM in order to hit your activity requirement. Then do what everyone else does and towards the end of the month -HOUND your field reps to give you free ""meetings"" you can log-into SURF. This is how everyone hits quota. There is no such thing as quality here, it is only quantity. We're talking about a company that makes $2.6 billion in Revenue. If you throw in garbage into the CRM, no one cares, especially the managers. As long as you hit your number, the managers hit their number, we're all happy!"

1580,ServiceNow,Highly political and Toxic Environment,2019-02-24,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,None that I can think of,"Highly political and toxic environment with lot of back stabbing and finger pointing. Cronyism is widespread.  Managers have lot of power without any checks and balances. 360 feedback is a scam as managers use it to manage folks with negative feedback out. ICs are essentially at the mercy of their manager.

Overtime the best leaders have left and now you are left with incompetent managers who have zero EQ, questionable integrity, fragile egos and focused on empire building. They see engineers as resources aka slaves that can be easily replaced. This is especially true in Kirkland office and in cloud infrastructure development org. The management here is truly messed up that someone who is demoted for failure to deliver will again be given the same responsibilities. And this is not because the person has shown improvement but because his replacement also messed up.

Joining cloud infrastructure development org as Software Engineer would mean that you are working on ServiceNow platform and won't have much flexibility to innovate or try something new. The managers there have no development background and are scared of trying anything new that carries some amount of risk. They would rather be safe and let the platform team deal with all challenges. As an IC you are not going to learn anything new that would help you grow unless your goal is to become a certified ServiceNow developer."

People are solid, professional and generally collegial","Usual downsides associated with a fast growth company--lots of change, process maturity and support structures are several step behind where they should be. In particular, if you are a manager and need to recruit staff, you're on your own. The driver culture of SN means that there is lots of people doing stuff without much coordination or forethought. Also, internal competition at the senior levels of the company is intense. it's not as collegial. There are many good leaders, but as with any company, quality is variable depending on where you sit. The marketing department, for instance, has a terrible culture with lots of micro management."

Whatever told during interview like building cloud OS is all lie and after you join the team you will built small applications which noone will use (Developers have to literally beg other teams to use their product else their bonus is gone). Everything about patents, innovations are all lies. Most of the developers time goes on useless meetings. 

More than 50% of the team left (thats why so much hiring is going on) and leftover are the ones having good relationship with manager who are getting huge hikes and promotions for doing nothing and roaming abroad with family at company expenses. Not to forget if you don't have good relation with the director with the cap then be ready to hear so much abuse and insulting comments from him that you will feel like leaving this company immediately.

So if you are good at licking and politics then join this team. This is the worst team in the entire Servicenow."

Amazing platform that is the foundation for all the great solutions we sell

Unbelievable customer base that helped us become the worlds most innovative company.","Again, ServiceNow is an organization filled to the brim with driven, intelligent, scrappy and down to earth individuals.  in areas where some of us may lack the tools needed to complete tasks, you can trust that one of your colleagues with that specific understanding will go out of their way to help drive the task to successful completion.   I can confidently say this is never in the spirit of laziness, but more the ethos and drive of ServiceNow.   An ethos, that each of us continue to grow and push ServiceNow, and its people forward toward amazing customer driven experiences.  An example of this would be the evolution of ServiceNow's yearly customer driven event - Knowledge.   Knowledge is an unique & powerful gathering supported by the entire ServiceNow team.  Always done without ego and sometimes without sleep.  Having watch it evolve over the years I am always amazed how much we punch above our weight to put it on, however each Knowledge result is truly amazing.   This encapsulates the drive and spirit of who ServiceNow is. 

So as we continue to bleed some of these great people, I am always curious how we acquired the clown that is our current CMO  - and why this guy still here?  He is the extreme opposite of the fabric of the ServiceNow ethos mentioned above.
 One of the most insincere, one dimensional individuals who has the knack of misdirected focus.  A wonderful micromanager, who avoids authentically getting in the trenches with ""common"" ServiceNow folk at any level.    The same Princess of Marketing, that during the chaos of Knowledge requires the hottest freshest Starbucks latte or nothing.   Sending one of the key events people to walk over mile to get a fresher latte because ""it was too cold"" and the coffee in the war room was not good enough.  Ridiculous demands with ultimately resulted assigning an individual minder to cater to his majesty for the rest of Knowledge.  The same Marketing Princess who glosses over his Symantec days and oversells his Salesforce experience to poorly repackage numerous SF marketing strategies for ServiceNows marketing initiatives.  In his words ""Why reinvent the wheel, when we know it works - Right?""  Perhaps.  Nevertheless with someone so enamored by their own pedigree, I would expect more originality and ideas as fresh as that Starbucks latte.  
Apparently, Dan is on a new purpose journey in discovering a better self, however many on the team have yet to see any changes.   I am sure he is a great marketer of himself to John, Frank and the SN board, however for those individuals below him (figuratively & literally), we are looking for a Marketing Leader that is true to ServiceNow. Someone that rolls up her or his sleeves, gratefully grabs that cold coffee and offers an innovative marketing vision without micromanaging a group of tremendously talented individuals."

1723,ServiceNow,H1B Quality Engineers are exploited at ServiceNow,2018-02-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A wonderful place to work and learn. The SNOW platform in itself is the mother of all the IT platforms combined in one huge package. A slap to the competition. Some agile teams are doing incredible work. Bravo ! Some recent most M&A will surely prove beneficial in the field of AI and Machine Learning. However ServiceNow is not a place where u can expect promotions or career growth as per the latest TownHall Meeting.,"Not Sure if we need H1B workers to do QE roles. That is utter mis-use of H1B. The product is surely innovative but not something that would require H1B workers for testing/QA. Many of these are promoted to the next level as Lead and Managers. Other QE Engineers who really deserve promotions and way too senior are given lay-offs or given back-burner jobs. Some of them even end up watching you-tube videos and go out for long afternoon walks. Also the QE leadership exploits H1B women (young talented good looking Indian girls) professionals by hiring them as interns and then asking them to look around in different department for FT roles. On several occasions H1B Male QE interns are not converted to FT or are moved to different departments for doing ordinary testing. There are few QE Managers (from different cultural background that behave like James bond) who hire only H1B Female QE and prefer only Females over Males for high visibility roles. There is lot of abuse going on in the name of ""Diversity"" and ""women in technology"". Sadly the HR is just a puppet and watching the show. H1B employee will never bring any such issues as he,she has all the strings attached else their green-card is jammed. There is surely exploitation of labor and mis-use of H1B at ServiceNow. Hope that these H1B ladies are not being exploited in any other ways .."

The new VP of Global Talent, Pat Wador, also seems to be on the right track but time will tell if she can truly bring about the much needed change she has planned for 2018 and beyond. Benefits package is not bad but has room for improvement to be competitive with some of the best companies in the industry.","People are treated as things, metrics, goals, dates, SLA's to be measured. Employees are not cultivated or mentored. There are no programs to ensure employee success and the management team is so pre-occupied with making arbitrary deadlines that they are not really bothered with investing in their people. They lose great talent all the time and they don't even realize what a loss it is to the company to lose its best people. The company needs to reinforce a culture of zero-tolerance for discrimination against women and let everyone understand that being dismissive toward female colleagues and their opinions, making offhanded and demeaning remarks about them in public or behind their backs, systematically over-scrutinizing their work in comparison to their male counterparts, constantly interrupting them in meetings, etc., are still examples of a kind of soft discrimination that should have not be allowed at ServiceNow."

1733,ServiceNow,Account Development Representative,2018-02-01,1.0,Account Development Representative,The only pro that came out of working for ServiceNow is that it gave me a clear understanding of what I don’t want in a company.,"The company is full of directors who only care about their own number and reputation. This comes at the expense of those who work under them. 

Beyond that quotas are decided based on botched numbers marketing gathers. There were multiple times where team managers have fought for a quota relief because the numbers were not attainable.

Additionally the promotion track is not built out. It’s based off of a grade school popularity contest with little having to do with hitting targets/praise received. For example, those who of the same tenure and skill have not been offered the same opportunities. When there is a job open for promotion people are selected to interview instead of it being offered and shared with everyone.

The worst thing about this company is the structural organization of the sales department. There are multiple roles that are unnecessary, specifically one that is filled by a big wig who essentially makes a ton by just building his own brand. Even if it means building his brand by helping other companies sales teams.

In addition to this the Account Executives you work with lack respect for you as a colleague and even at a humane level. All they care about is the bonus they collect. Don’t get me wrong some care, but majority don’t. They also join in on the grade school popularity contest and pick favorites. 

Most people are miserable in this role, but only stay in hopes of making big money one day. Once they get there they’ll feed back into it all as an Account Executive. It’s a cycle and they do a good job of keeping it going.

Also this company has so many big clients but they don’t care about them, they care about individual checks and the stock growth."

1. Want a long term career where you move up through the ranks based on merit.

2. Expect a payrise within 3-4 years of tenure. 

3. Expect clarity on metrics that clearly outline what you need to do, to be successful and subsequently promoted.

The team has a select and small group of so called star performers who by virtue of their relationship with senior management receive benefits and regular promotions.   It's sad to see the grafters including myself being regularly overlooked.  This is the bulk opinion of a lot of peers.  Management do nothing to encourage the more senior guys to assist the new hires during their onboarding.   It's very much a them and us culture.

The location is great and there are some really talented and smart people working here. Budgets are sizable and hiring hasn't stopped in the last few years. The facilities are modern and they allow you to bring your dog to work. Most people have a bias for action and want to collaborate and problem solve to get things done.,"Ever since we got a new CMO about a year ago things have been getting progressively worse in marketing. The amount of nit-picking is absurd and you are left wondering who has their eye on the strategic initiatives that will really help move the needle for marketing.  It is very easy to burn out and give up due to the amount of micromanagement and constant pressure to do things as quickly as possible with zero regard to work/life balance.

1764,ServiceNow,Sr. Product Marketing Manager,2017-12-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great latitude on your approach to work. Very collaborative environment. ServiceNow culture encourages collaboration and breaking down of silos.,Incredibly fast pace sometimes sacrifices good processes. Onboarding can be challenging due to  shifting priorities and  focus on operating the business.
1765,ServiceNow,Your Experience will depend where you work. Marketing is not the team to join,2017-12-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,ServiceNow has a great growth trajectory ahead of them. People who work here are in high demand as what we have had to do over the last 3-4 years to build the foundation and scale from $500M to nearly $2B is an amazing achievement for those that have been there during these years.,"The opportunity for newer employees is still there but not as great. The stock grants are much smaller than they used to be due to board limitations and the value. Your experience at ServiceNow will really depend on which department you work in and your manager. Marketing is not the place you want to work. People are tossed out not for performance but because they don't have skills that the company needs for the next phase. This is no way to treat people who grew the company. Sadly the CMO stifles innovation, its his way or the highway and we went down a path over the last year where we put way to much focus on demand gen and nothing else. Departments have suffered lack of resources and budgets. Thankfully our CEO and CCO see this and are ensuring we invest outside of demand gen."

1767,ServiceNow,It's all about the stock,2017-12-06,3.0,Software Engineer,"Depending on the team you get assigned to, the hours tend to be reasonable. Expect ~40 hour work weeks for most teams with a bit more depending on the team. This can vary depending on the team, but after several years of working at ServiceNow, weekend work was fortunately rare.

Many teams use Scrum and there is a lot of maturity in their processes. Typically people self-assign work. The work can vary between development work, working on customer issues, and investigating and fixing bugs. Expect it to take a year to come up to speed and really get a good grasp of the product. The work is fairly interesting and the product itself is extremely flexible.

The stock, while I was there doubled in value and bonuses were given out every 3 months. There was never a quarter where there wasn't a bonus. The gym in San Diego is pretty nice. They were good about providing the tools needed to do your job. Ask for a wide monitor.","After several years of working there I never received a raise (not even a cost of living increase) despite good reviews. I received no additional stock after the original offer. There was no indication from management above my boss that they thought I was valuable. In fact, getting 85% of your bonus is considered doing exactly what you should be doing. This means, that if they offer you 10% of your salary as a bonus, you should actually expect to receive 8.5%.

Middle management on the development side comes across as unpleasant and I avoided contacting them when at all possible. While there are some middle managers that are easy to get along with, generally I did not want any interaction with them.

The company in general is all about the stock price. Don't ask about 401k matching, they won't consider it (and will give you a lippy response). Unlike other places I've worked, they also don't seem particularly interested in talent retention. Beyond not giving raises/stock etc, they also don't have much in the way of groups to join, volunteer work, etc... You won't find groups for people of color, women, LGBT (though they did have a running group)."

Compensation is fair; stock price has made ServiceNow compensation package very attractive. Customer love ServiceNow technology,"CMO 'leads' through bullying, micromanagement, retaliation and fear-based tactics.  Diversity is non-existent with only one woman on the marketing leadership team which has likely helped fuel the 'bro culture' mentality.  The marketing team avoids innovation or 'pushing the needle' due to fear of reprisal or public embarrassment of the CMO telling them their ideas are 'not good' and/or ensuring that those ideas are not supported broadly.  Therefore the majority of the marketing is focused on tactical execution which will not take the company to the level it needs to be in support of the CEOs vision.  Many very seasoned marketing people have joined the company over the past few years who are chomping at the bit to implement new programs and ideas, but the culture of fear, lack of appreciation for innovation, and lack of acknowledgement of people's expertise that they bring to the table, has caused many people to leave, and/or just punch in and punch out in order to wait for their stock to vest."

I worked in the Procurement division and was a very negative environment, bad management, micro managers and basically insecure, jealous group of women. Half the team did not have a college degree, management did not foster challenge or growth, it was essentially a paper pushing structure. The main manager was not even based in Santa Clara, which made no sense, as most of her team were based there. 

Not a forward thinking environment, women focused more on gossip and talking behind people's back - created drama. Would not recommend anyone apply for a position to work in procurement. Unprofessional, unrefined group of people where they lack analytical/progressive thinking."

You'll always be challenged, whether good or bad","Unfortunately, the cons currently outweigh the pros for me.  Old-timers who get promoted to management purely because they're legacy employees does not create a good culture.  These managers only care about themselves and managing up.  A lot of them claim to not care about titles, but that can't be farther from the truth.  The worker bees under the managers are often left to fend for themselves.  The sink or swim mentality runs rampant at this company.  As a new hire, you are pretty much expected to figure things out for yourself.  In fact, management will blatantly say things like, ""We are all busy.  Try to find the answer yourself before asking questions.""  There are a lot of frequent policy changes, often which are poorly communicated.  Employees receive conflicting or unclear guidance on topics such as sales policy or pricing.  The politics here are extremely difficult (refer back to my comment about legacy, non-qualified people in management).  There is virtually no work-life balance.  You're expected to go above and beyond...and beyond...and beyond.  Weekend work is not uncommon.  You have to push yourself to limits you didn't even know you had if you want any hope of collecting 100% of your quarterly bonus.  What makes it worse is that the quarterly bonuses are totally subjective.  There is no company-wide process in regards to how the bonuses are scored and allocated.  It's purely based upon how your manager feels about you based on things they hear about you, if they don't bother to regularly come into the office to actually witness your performance.  A lot of poor or non existent execution is common as well.  The word execution gets thrown around as a buzz word, along with vision and strategy.  No one cares about actually executing.  We're just trying to make it through, day by day."

1813,ServiceNow,Letter to my replacement,2017-08-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"To my replacement,
 
Hello, as a manager at ServiceNow,  you have stepped in to the easiest job ever. Your boss will do your job for you, such that all you have to do is show up, surf the web all day and wait for your boss to tell you exactly what to do (but don't worry because he will still do it for you so that you don't have to). The most difficult part of your day will be deciding what to have for lunch.
 
Don't worry about expectations, roles or responsibilities. I have been asking what is expecting of me and what my role and responsibilities are for several months now, and nobody can answer that for me, so I eventually gave up, and now I just hang out and do whatever I feel like, so that is another thing you won't have to deal with.
 
You also don't need to worry about managing your staff because your boss will do it for you. He will regularly bypass you and contact your staff directly, issue them guidance, assign tasks to them and gather status from them. So, managing people is extremely easy here since it requires no effort on your part, and you'll never know what they are doing anyway since they will communicate directly to your boss instead of you.
 
And, you will never have to submit any status reports to your executives because your boss will gather his own status by talking directly to your staff, so more time freed up to surf the web or play games or search for other job opportunities.
 
Worried about how you are going to do strategic planning if you don't know what your staff are doing? Don't worry about it because (yes, you guessed it) your boss will come up with your strategic plan for you, and better yet, he won't tell you what it is.
 
You know what? On second though, I think I will stay. This is the best scam in the valley. In fact, I bet nobody would notice if I stopped showing up.
 
Good luck finding some other place to get paid to do nothing",Zero career development; you have to find a new employer for your career to advance

1841,ServiceNow,Nice culture within teams but work life balance can improve,2017-05-24,3.0,Senior Technical Support Engineer,"Working with amazing people, who are not only talented but have friendly and caring attitudes towards one another. So the work relationships with colleagues do get strong. There are also an increasing number of opportunities to improve your skills as well as other training offered to keep up to date with the ever evolving platform that you support.

It is one of the top IT companies in the world, with a strong focus on customers. With this growth they do look after you with competitive compensation packages, relaxing areas and snacks.

There is a monthly newsletter to keep people informed of what's happening in their global team. 

I really do love the product and the company, but there's a lot more it can do to improve its image internally.","As the support environment is intensive and fast paced, it's quite easy to fall behind. 

While you take the opportunity to do training you could be seen, unfairly, as a slacker, because of course you fall behind. Then you'd face an uphill battle with minimal assistance from your seniors. So, yes, opportunities are there and it will cost you time. You have to work extra time to make up for it because you cannot afford to leave it to the next day. 

Even if you do a good job, it is thankless and a pat on the back is a rarity. So, many see their job simply as a job and not a career. I've never seen so many sad or scared people.

The major disadvantage to the growth is there is an explosion in the management structure which is quite bureaucratic, somewhat flat on the lower chain, and there is no consistency in how they work. Speaking from experience and observation, there are some managers where they maintain distance with their staff. Then there's those who like to micromanage, which simply does not work well.

This leads down to quite a bit of infighting and no clear path for progression. In fact there is a hint of favoritism from upper management when it comes to promotions leaving other well deserving people in the lurch."

Fast paced - Never a dull moment

Great customers and technology","If you want to work at ServiceNow, make sure your starting salary is amazing, because for as long as you work there, it will never increase.

Very cut-throat environment. In all my time there, I feared for my job - as does everyone else. Unless you were hired thanks to nepotism (which runs rampant in this company), your job is on the line every single day of the year. Colleagues disappear all the time and with no explanation. 

The European head of HR is one of the most cruel people I have ever worked with. Does not listen to employees, seems to love firing them."
1843,ServiceNow,A long way to go,2017-05-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The product is amazing - customers love the technology.,"The marketing is outdated (yes, even the new stuff), and has the vibe of a late-90s tech company.
The internal systems are a nightmare - the homegrown CRM is so bad that employees regularly laugh about its lack if usefulness. Being a SaaS company that uses Microsoft Office instead of Google for Enterprise is embarrassing, but it probably makes sense given that it seems all employees are middle-aged white men.
Lack of diversity - the list of enterprise sales reps is almost all white men. There is one female who leads a BU. At a recent Women in Tech lunch all panelists were asked about programs to include more women in the workforce. Where every female exec from other companies was able to site specific programs focusing on diversity, ServiceNow didn't have a single initiative. 
The company also hasn't committed in any way to being a good corporate citizen, with a complete lack of company-driven volunteer initiatives.
Total lack of transparency - you'll never hear an executive say, ""you asked and we listened!"" They take surveys about internal systems and practices and then never share the results."

Longterm employee especially in middle-management are resistant to change and refuse the acknowledge that the company has grown. Conflicts between locations (SD and SC), silos and overall bad culture and morale. Employees on all levels, including managers are afraid to speak up. Lack of consistent HR processes, no goals setting or performance measurement practices, no peer/360 feedback.

If you want to work for a company in which you can scrap by and earn a paycheck find somewhere else to work.

Leadership does not take time to mentor individuals nor teams with mutual goals.  Leadership refuses to reflect or acknowledge their role in projects going sideways.

If you are unhappy with your current position, management will work with you to find a better fit.  Full time remote work is available.  Competitive compensation and benefits.  There are many very smart people in the company who are accessible and eager to teach.  Tons of training opportunities.  Incentive compensation is often paid over 100% quarterly.  If you've worked at BMC, CA or Salesforce, chances are you know someone already working at ServiceNow.  Lots of opportunity to travel, if you're into that.","No 401k match (although there are other profit sharing opportunities).  Year end raises are hard to come by, many people I know have gone years without one.  Professional Services is trying to be too many things at once, and the scattershot do-it-all method is burning out employees.  The mission to reach four billion in revenue by 2020 is all consuming, and the management's focus on money is getting tiresome.  As the company grows, the longtime senior management that made the company such a great place to work is slowly filtering out and the ""suits"" are moving in.  With them comes the numbers based penny pincher management style that makes ServiceNow's competitors bad places to work.  Although it's easy to change positions within the company, the work from your former position often follows you.  TIMECARDS!  As a billable resource I easily spent two hours a week filling out and submitting timecards, then having half of them rejected because the timecard process is constantly changing, and spending another two hours filling them out again!"

The company appears at the right spot of SaaS vertical market at the right time.  Its large competitors are too established to be competitive.","Hard lesson learned, this is not a place you can bring a ""vision"". Literally,  speaking the word ""vision"" is a dangerous act. Hey, there is almighty ""platform"". Quench your passion, shut up, and ride with the ""platform"". To be honest, I have to admit this is bluntantly the good part of working at SNC,  comparing to all other controversies. 


Now all you techies can do is to focus on execution. Oh yeah, as a non-customer facing team in Santa Clara, you never really get staffed because ""disappointment"" of bay area talents. (link below)

You techies squeeze every scarce bit of resource; build up grand system / product from scratch up; on-call day and night;  prove knowhow and deliver a highly motivated team. After all these, your retiree boss called you out ""not working hard enough"".

Have to mention: the management style is very controversial. Careless placement of reporting chain is only a tip of iceberg.  It came out clear that many managers were so imcompetent and scared that all they care is survive, and to some, survival means to manage know-how out. People without delivering promises survives well as VP's gang; people talking hours of non-actionable survives, because the job is ""not innovation"" but ""business value""; people totally not fit for high-tech company survives --- who with no idea of OKR judges team's execution on ""sense"". 


On the contrary, good leaders who knows how and inspires,  either were put aside, or been kicked out,  or can only stand it as part-time. I am afraid SNC never built up a culture of inspiration: There is only ""judgmental"", or judgmental disguised as ""metric-driven"".

1928,ServiceNow,An ADR Perspective,2016-09-14,2.0,Account Development Representative,"-Good health benefits 
-ESPP plan","1. Middle management nightmare.  Creates toxic environment where everyone lives under the fear of being fired.  Cannot speak honestly to managers who ought to be invested in team's personal growth ...they are just there to collect an undeserved paycheck.  Do not work here unless you want to be miserable and micro-managed.  Not only is this true, but your own manager will talk behind your back about anything they might view as negative about you.  This goes for everyone.  It's the most unprofessional, corrosive environment I have ever been a part of.  Everyone who works as an ADR is great, but  we are all miserable due to this middle management horror story.  Please think over your decision to work as an ADR here.

2.  Promotional opportunities much more scarce than they say.  In interviews, they will butter up the fact that everyone is up for promotion after 1 year and 6 months.  Firstly, this is a very long time to be an ADR compared with the industry average and secondly, when you are finally up for promotion, there are a very limited amount of spots you can proceed to and everyone is fighting for them.  Good luck.  Expect to be an ADR with little closing experience for closer to 2 years if you choose to work here.

3.  Quota is near unattainable.  If you miss quota by 1, you lose out on around $1,000 in bonus money..which for an entry-level sales job is a lot.  They expect you to generate 24 new opportunities per month.  Yes, you read that right, 24.  That is more than 1 per business day.  Sound impossible?  Because it is.  That is how they want it.  In our Boston office it's 26!  

4.  They do not match 401k and they have continuously lowered the amount of restricted stock units given to new ADRs.  They have lowered the amount by more than half since a year ago.  These RSUs were an excuse for the company to say they do not match 401k...well, it would be much preferable for a new employee to have some sort of match with a 401k than to get the measly amount of shares not distributed.  Although, the CEO seems to find a way every quarter to sell all of his stock for tens of millions of dollars.

I have included more detail on these topics below if you'd like to continue reading.

Middle management nightmare.  This company's entry-level sales department, as mentioned in my pros, has a lot of potential.  But unfortunately, the wrong people have been promoted to a leadership status based on their ""previous performance"" instead of by their ability to be good managers.  To put this in perspective, there are two teams of eight ADRs in the San Diego office.  Each team is run by a manager and those managers have a director.  Any sane, logical person with a shred of common sense would think that the managers who ""lead"" one of the ADR teams, would do their best to assist their ADRs in achieving quota, exceeding quota, learn more about the product and the next role etc...  As one can imagine from my tone, this is not the case.  The managers who ""lead"" the ADR  teams are the biggest detriment to any corporation I have ever seen.  Instead of being change agents, being motivating, and leading by example, they choose instead to weigh on the backs of their ADRs and micro-manage until their pay-check comes in.  They rule with the power of fear; the fear that if you say something honest, true, or helpful that is disagreeable to them, you will get fired.  If you want to succeed here, you must be a complete fraud.  By fraud, I mean you have to agree withe everything said to you, execute it perfectly, be extremely charismatic and optimistic about it and go on with your life without your brain turned on.  There is no room to be a real person in this department.

Besides the toxic culture provided by middle-management, there have been quota hikes to a degree in which it is near impossible to reach quota and claim bonus money.  Bonus  money may sound like a small amount, but if I miss quota by 1 for example, I would lose out on around $1,000.  When you are in entry-level sales, this is a lot of money!  They expect one to create 24 new opportunities in one month.  Sound impossible?  It is close to it.  You do get inbound leads, but as one may already know, inbound leads are inconsistent due to marketing - so you may have one month with a lot, and the next your commission paycheck will be substantially less.

There are less opportunities to get promoted and it takes longer to get promoted than the industry average.  The industry average to get promoted from an ADR position is around a year.  At ServiceNow, there is a mandatory 1 year and 6 month waiting period until you can even be considered being promoted.  That means, even if you have a territory you work for, their director really likes you, and they want you to become a part of their team for about double the salary and incentives, you can't do it because of this waiting period.  This is due to selfishness on the director level because their commission is based off of ADR success.   If ADRs get randomly promoted, they are still responsible for their quota and the director may possibly miss out on their bonus check.  Instead of being for the team, they implement these rules to benefit themselves.

They micromanage by implementing a minimum amount of calls you must make per day regardless of your own goals on how to manage your business."

Its very easy to support something that inspires so many outside of the organization.,"Change is inevitable at ServiceNow.  As the company begins to grow (and grow at a rapid pace), there is a constant flux of individual contributors, management, and senior management.  If you've been there for any length of time, there are only a handful of familiar faces from when you first stepped through the door.  As much as the company is embracing the change, they do not embrace the idea of investing and growing individuals.

* Customer support group is the worst group to work for. Favoritism is rampant; pre-IPO employees enjoy a favorable status and they bully newer employees. The company has its own proprietary systems and there is little if any new employee training or knowledge transfer. 
* You are completely at the mercy of your manager for performance review with no HR involvement. There are no 360 degree reviews and your manager can give a bad review on flimsiest pretext. Since stock options do not start vesting till 1 year anniversary of joining, managers abuse the system to make sure you never get your 100% bonus till your stocks start vesting. HR always favors managers and there is no way they will support you even if you have incriminating evidence against your manager.
* Poor work-life balance -- Being a cloud-based SaaS company, 24X7 support is necessary. Some positions are staffed to follow the sun, but others are not. So if there is an issue, you are supposed to be ready to wake up at any hour of night and sign up for pager duty.  As you are an exempt employee, there will be no compensation for those hours worked. Employees are expected to work more than 50 hours per week.  Company has unlimited vacation policy, but it is to dissuade employees from taking time-off. If you take PTO, you will be penalized by citing a non-issue as the reason or may be let go when you return."

Work/life balance occasionally gets out of whack. You can get calls at any hour.

They've gone to one of those ""unlimited"" vacation plans. That stinks. So you never really know how much vacation time you have and if you leave without having taken any you don't get unpaid vacation paid out.

2041,ServiceNow,"Brilliant Software, Horrible Culture",2015-07-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"ServiceNow has developed Excellent Software and is displaying an astonishing ability to release new capability all the time - keeping them agead of the competition who are not as agile.
The Technical leadership is both visionary and engaged with where the products are going. They are executing on the strategy with enthusiasm and precision. 
The Platform provided is - if not revolutionary - a strong evolution of legacy systems. The platform has pretty much refined what other legacy applications have learned by experience.
The Marketing messaging is engaging and effective - resulting in great sales in the regions where the leadership supports the messaging and not going off on a tangent.

Nice Laptop and great salary packages.","In spite of a very strict and lengthy process of hiring including full background checks, the eventual people hired are not hired to build a long-term company. The company bears all the hallmarks of a company that has grown too quickly. The processes are immature, the HR people and back-office bear all the symptoms of being promoted to the point of incompetence too quickly in that they are treating senior people like kindergarten kids. Policies are being applied badly or too strictly. Benefits are below average, and promises often broken.

ServiceNow seems to get rid of more people than they are hiring, and that can be through anything from classical non-performance to offending management or influential sales people. If somebody cannot be gotten rid of outright, they are bullied till they resign. There is very little logic to firings/forced resignations. They are hiring the A-Team, but expect lackeys, so the first to go are normally those who are the best at what they do and who do not have to put up with this kind of rubbish.

Nobody - from the most junior to the most senior or competent are sure of their job and live in constant fear of being sacked/forced to resign. 

ServiceNow management micromanages each and every person in the organization. There are several systems that have to be updated with the same information, and weekly and even daily calls diving into great details are the order of the day.

I will not recommend anybody who I know to work for ServiceNow, as they are sure to be disappointed."

Too many quickly developed application that have no better look and feel than a well-designed Access database and associated forms (30 years ago). Most of the Guys have come from HP and BMC (Remedy) and continue to provide the look and feel of these old school ITSM Products and it is evident when you are introduced to Snow for the first time.

Similar to purges in Stalin era Soviet Union where they removed all record and even airbrushed people out of photos. ICs get fired. Managers and directors get fired. There hasn't been a VP firing in a while.

Any technical interest is eclipsed by the lack of freedom to influence the direction of the organization, product, or codebase. Some thrive, but most have their wings clipped. You'll probably be the latter.

Personality cult around their founder. If you work in the sphere of influence of their founder a reality distortion field will set in. The laws of organizational physics won't apply. You will be micromanaged like never before and you'll be lucky to survive a year or two. Best to avoid those areas.

Some competent, core people but huge swathes of deadwood. Similar to how they backend load quality (inadequate investment during product development, huge release support costs), hiring strangely follows this backend load model. The bar to get hired is often quite low. If later it's discovered that you weren't what they really wanted then no problem, you'll just get axed. Not a good way to run things."

The upper management team, as far as I've interacted with them, are top notch people in the field. I would not describe them as typical managers, or rather as the kind of people that you would see in Dilbert cartoons.

Additionally, I'll note that compared to other companies I've seen, ServiceNow tends to promote from within. I myself have been promoted in lieu of bringing in a new person on a couple of occasions. It has allowed me to grow with the company.","If you just want a job to get paid, then ServiceNow may not be the right fit for you.

Because pretty much their tool sells itself - unfortunately, no much of competition. They need a lot of bodies to do mundane scripting and data entry work - so they hire like crazy. They expect you to do as you're told, not worry about career development, and absolutely no creativity is allowed (all these will get you fired).
To bury any bad reviews like this, HR (who's only purpose is recruitment and firing) and senior management posts these (very obvious) fake reviews.

I was working in digital marketing team. In two weeks after onboarding I started hesitating in my decision to accept the offer. I was working as a contractor. Sr managers will immediately tell you they want to hire you because you are so so good. However, they do not mean that. Do you really think two weeks enough to conclude it? They just want you to work as crazy and devote all your time to the project. You will work extra hours. I do not mind working extra hours. However, no need to lie. They give you a hope without any intent to do so.
All team members are competitors to each other.  That is an explanation of gossips in the company. The environment is highly competitive. I was new to the team and team members were complaining about each other all the time. Even though they are not direct competitors to each other in terms of their responsibilities. Politics all the time. You may not know what other team members complain about you and you will not have a chance to explain yourself. It doesn't matter whether it is true or not. They would prefer to kiss the butt than building a team.
Turnover is very high. In digital marketing team for a year 29 contractors went through the team. Senior managers would prefer to hire 3 interns, but not hiring a manager. My Sr manager told me they did not need my ideas for marketing, i had to do everything they would tell me. In marketing?!! They do not need my ideas?!?! Why then my ideas went live? Plagiarism? Yes. You do the work. They put their name on it.

1) Fred Luddy, the founder of ServiceNow, made a billion dollars and then came back the next day and worked harder than anyone else. In fact he still commits as much or more code than anyone else.

2) It's a culture of making the customer happy... and we have a TON to keep happy!

I love my job because I know that literally thousands of people will actually use the things that I build. This is why I occasionally choose to work extra hours... not because it's expected of me. But taking time off is encouraged and I never count my days because of the unlimited vacation policy!

Our teams are growing fast but they have made organizational changes all the way up to support it. So I always know who I can go to and get a straight answer.

We get to choose our project management style although scrum is the most popular.

I get to work with some of the best engineers in the world, many of them great teachers! I am stretched and challenged every week.

I have been blessed with opportunities to travel to exciting places to work on exciting projects.

The free snacks are legit: kind bars, peanut m&ms, hint water, greek yogurt... really nice perk.

The quarterly bonuses are awesome. First time in my career that I've ever actually gotten what I've been promised.

ServiceNow is an industry leader in what they do- clients are the cheerleaders and are fanatical about the platform over any competitors. 

- Super Helpful environment (most of the time), Professional Services Consultants that have been there a long time are happy to show new people tricks on the platform. PS has a tremendous amount of talent.  

- Corporate Culture is attractive- they embody the typical ""Southern California"" Tech company, and I mean that in the best way possible. Free snacks, food, drinks, etc. (some offices even have a private gym). HR puts together some funny videos- moral is overall solid. 

- The ServiceNow Community is helpful and intelligent, many connections can be made at the User Group Meetings.","- Low-Mid Level Managers have nothing to do sometimes except for build power points, which is amazing. Some managers want to do consulting it seems- leave those choices to the consultants.

- Employees need more training. Pony up and take them away from clients for a few days (yes- it's not billable) until they actual become trained on an application before touting ITIL Best Practices. Send your employees to ITIL Training instead of reading about it in a book. Managers brag about how quickly they can get their Consultants billable, this isn't cool or respectful to the client. 

- Management is obsessed with pushing Consultants to bill 40+ hours/week. This leads to artificial bloat that some consultants in Professional Services have zero problem with- it's immoral. I've experienced this first hand on many occasions knowing peers are upping their billable hours and have spoken up. Management ignores...

- Hiring process was simple- push prospective employees through multiple hiring managers. Don't hire jerks. More transparency is needed here.

- Partner Community has some all stars, but also some duds with low level engineers that muck up implementations. Figure out some way to fix this.

- Reinstate the policy of sending all new employees to HQ for training. It will pay dividends down the road and give your employees and understanding of where they're coming from as a company."

The management refuses requests of moving teams internally unless someone is already working there for 1.5 years on average (long time to stick around if someone is burning out). Despite opening up locations internationally, they do not promote/allow transfer to other locations.

Classic bait and switch- they say you can earn a wonderful bonus yet no one does. They fire employees at random with no process or warning. They eliminate entire departments the same way. This is a company run by fear with little regard for humans. Stay away. Or better yet ask for a guarantee on your bonus for the first six months.

For everyone else: you will be digging for gold dust and hopefully be deemed ok. This company should be avoided if you think on your feet and are proactive. Employees will be asked to respond to every whim of their manager and smile while running out to comply. All the bling outside charisma of the 'startup' culture doesn't mean a thing... The culture is mostly corporate, risk averse and set in 50 shades of grey. Customers are treated well before signing, and pretty much ignored until they raise their hand.

There are also two standards for employees - if you're tied into Slootman's team from a previous company or not. If you're in, you have the opportunity to advance, sometimes despite poor personal performance, if not, you can grind your fingers to the bone and be anchored in place or even demoted. You're either in or you're out. 

Gender diversity is very poor, with nearly all leadership and management roles filled by white males. The workplace itself is very sterile and tense - people don't smile.

Directives are top-down with the sole goal of driving numbers. There is no vision as to what the purpose of the company is other than to make money in the short time when cloud replacements for legacy systems is still a novelty. The company does not give back to the San Jose or San Diego community in any real way. This is a great place to work if you follow orders without question and capitalize on every opportunity to stroke your manager's and director's ego.

Customer focus is a formality - formerly simple, customer-friendly pricing was replaced by a complex matrix of pricing designed only to break out numbers for Wall street and position NOW with the PaaS players. 

The company's soul died the day of the IPO. Now it's just another EMC or Oracle.

don't expect that if you've been here long enough they will cut you some slack. you are perpetually under the radar. another nasty thing is that they tend to let you go close to the date when your stocks are about to mature. that way you leave the company with nothing.

2147,ServiceNow,"Something from the future, as in robots & slaves",2013-09-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Servicenow has some very talented people working for it and the company's growth is phenomenal. They pay very good wages and has the standard benefits across the software industry.,"The company is very fast paced as it's growth is huge. However they often treat employees like dirt. If you are management you are treated like a slave and if you are below management, you are expected to be a robot and just do as you are told without any deviation. The management have very very high expectations and not everyone will fit into that. The bonus scheme is flawed as they operate a stacked bonus scheme which means you are ranked against your colleagues and will only get a percentage bonus based on where you rank which is unfair especially if you do different jobs with different metrics. The employees are expected to work long hours and take regular abuse from management, the only reason that they stay is because a lot of the employees have shares/options at a very low rate so they stand to make a lot of money when their options vest. Anyone new is at an immediate disadvantage on that front as their options will be at a high price. 

There was no Christmas party last year as they 'didn't want to offend any religions'. In all honesty, they don't want employees to have fun, it's a heads down and get on with your work culture. I use the term culture loosely as there actually isn't a culture there. Expect a lot of work, long hours and little reward. The company is also very top heavy, ie a lot of directors, VP's, senior management that do very little. If you are expecting a career path, then don't hold your breath, they prefer to hire externally for senior positions rather than promote from within. If you work hard and are very good at your role, they will want to keep you there for as long as possible. 

The platform for a SaaS company is also very unstable & uptime is very low. The architecture is such that it falls over multiple times in the day/week, this has a knock on effect as customers will end up getting very agitated and you will have to bear the bunt of that. There is work to improve the stability but changing the architecture costs large sums of money and will take time to improve. If you are working weekends, you may as well cancel any appointments/plans you may have. 

My opinions are around the UK organisation within PS & Support. Although there were multiple dotted lines to US management. 

In summary, if you are looking for a fun place to work, with great career progression and job satisfaction, look elsewhere! This place is only good for the money and even then it's a case of how long you are prepared to put up with the poor work/life balance."

2151,ServiceNow,A life-changing career choice,2013-09-11,5.0,Software Developer,"ServiceNow is in an outstanding position to get its software platform used practically everywhere, dramatically increasing our value. Our founder is still here and is actively contributing to the code base in ways that get thunderous applause in keynotes. Customers are truly jazzed about us. Even if they encounter problems, it is usually a very supporting partnership getting them through those problems. Not antagonistic. They love using our software and keep finding ways to use the platform in other parts of their business once we get a ""foot in the door"".","With the recent avalanche of hiring as we grow, it is easy to lose sight of a common goal.

He and his EMC cronies have no long term goals for the company only short term at the expense of all of the hard working employees. It is an atrocity how they treat employees, allowing senior management to pick others to take their falls and firing without any warning. HR is nonexistent and not there for employee support but to carry out the will and whims of the executive team. Backstabbing is rampant among senior executives which trickles down."

Happy cows make good milk. So that applies to developers. And management their is all about them selves. They do not treat their directs with dignity. After a year. I feels like escaping from a communistic camp. Sorry not much pros.,This company is run by the hard headed old timers that ant' let go of the product. They are very closed minded. The product has so much holes in it since i worked there. The customers that are using this is seeing layers of cake frosting over bad stale old cake. Product is using such an old 2000 technology that if there are decent competitors they should be dead soon.
2167,ServiceNow,Best Company I've ever had the pleasure of working with,2013-02-16,5.0,Senior Quality Assurance Engineer,"SN is dedicated towards attracting talented and fun people.  The company utilizes the technology they sell very well. I've worked for cloud companies before and they used antiquated technologies to build their ""cutting edge tech"", SNOW uses the same tech they offer and its evident from every level.  The work environment is very positive and easy going. If you are a self starter and can deliver top-notch work, you will be rewarded.
The company still feels like a start up, in all the good ways. It also has great direction from upper management.  The messaging always seems clear, on-point, and without the cliche corporate speak that so often pollutes the workplace.
It truly feels like a team and I'm happy/excited to go to work every day.
Each employee getting a macbook pro doesn't hurt either ;)
Bonuses are great. Vacation is great. Benefits (health, etc. are average).  
Bi-Weekly socials encourage the team to have a drink and some dinner together and enjoy themselves.
Friday free lunches are great as well.
The company is moving at a blazingly fast pace, but you do get the sense that everyone is happy to be together. 
Training classes are offered frequently.  If you are willing, and pro-active, there is no excuse for not building your skill set and moving up in the company.",The hours can be long. 45-50 hour weeks are the norm.

You could have fool me that we even have an HR department.  Completely shocked that some managers still in position on the sales side (field and inside sales).  Some managers are able to float under the radar and perform their roles at the most basic and just satisfactory enough to skate by, I've never seen anything like it.  Some managers lack a ""bigger picture"" thought process and simply due the bare minimum.  You won't receive any recognition and zero work life balance.  This place is a gentlemen's club that makes inappropriate behavior the norm.  After 9 years (the company's entire existence) a woman is finally in a senior leadership position.  There's only a few women that work here and they're in HR, Marketing and Sales Operations.  This is not a politically correct company which may backfire at the customer level one day.  Mid level-upper management fail to look at the company's and the products opportunities which will catch up with them one day."
2169,ServiceNow,Technical Support Specialist,2012-12-31,5.0,Technical Support Specialist,Very positive and empowering environment. The hiring interview as very professional and enjoyable. The people at ServiceNow are examples of the best in their field and always willing to help other employees.,Extra time is the norm always more the 40 hours weekly.  You are expected to do 40 plus hours weekly.  It would be nice if they had more vacation time.
