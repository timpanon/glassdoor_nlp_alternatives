The team fosters open communication, diversity, inclusivity, transparency, and using empathy for their team members and clients they design for. 
Being remote first also has its obvious advantages and disadvantages these days, but the leadership team manages to bring people close and build relationships through fun virtual team building workshops and non forced fun time to connect with each other that continues to strengthen the culture there.",The IT support could use improvement but again a normal part of the process of a company growing fast.

Awesome culture and they really care about staff,No chance of progression unless you are in relationship banking or GFB to senior positions. There are now about 40 MDs in Relationship Banking with many staff promotions in job with no more responsibility. Very few MDs in RB would be at similar levels in other organisations and hugely over promoted. MDs in functions are few and far between with experienced individuals filling these roles and unlikely to move.

A lot of wonderful and smart people. Branding is great.,HR Leadership seems inept to deal with problems within the HR organization. They keep loosing key people and not realizing the reason why. The reason are HR leaders who can’t manage people and are stuck in their ways. I’ve seen HR leaders make people cry in meetings. The CHRO needs to clean house or else they will loose significant talent (which they already have).
30,Silicon Valley Bank,Startup Banking,2022-02-14,4.0,Associate,"Great benefits, great work life balance, fair pay and no work on the weekends.",Company is growing incredibly fast and it feels like some employees are being left behind while others are getting ahead.

42,Silicon Valley Bank,Excellent Employer,2022-01-25,5.0,Administrative Assistant III,SVB actually walks the talk. They take care of their employees.,Internal shuffling of departments happens too often. Internal joke is that your group will report to a new area at least once a year.

49,Silicon Valley Bank,Widespread burnout,2022-01-16,2.0,Accounting,"Good pay, excellent benefits. Unlimited PTO would be great if we could actually use it.","Zero work life balance. Rapid growth has increased workload tremendously, but additional staffing or systems updates have not kept up with the pace, leading to more work spread across the same people with the same outdated systems. 
The response when saying you are overwhelmed is that ""everyone across accounting is feeling it too, it's not just you"". That's not helpful. 
The message from exec level is that our health and well-being is crucial, but mid-level management is more concerned with work deadlines. Your personal life or your exhaustion doesn't matter - just get the job done."
50,Silicon Valley Bank,Underwhelming,2022-01-15,3.0,Associate,"- Filled with people that love SVB (kind of weird but still more of a pro)
- Still fully remote if you don't want to come in
- 2 month training for ADP before any real work
- large cohorts of new associates
- get to interact with really cool VCs and founders
- opportunities to move across the bank every couple years
- good first job. Good occasional perks kind of. They'll toss us $25 doordash codes every now and then","- technology is so terrible that I probably spend 2/3 of my week updating repetitive trackers and submitting compliance crap. I don't mind bc I get paid the same either way, but there's truly so much of that nonsense to fit in it sucks
- No indication of any Covid-related raises despite the retention issues. I'll probably end up going to a diff bank since they're poaching us anyways
- Commercial Banking also blows. Some deals are cool but most of your clients will just have credit cards but you still have to cater to them just as much. This isn't a substitute for IB if you actually want to exit to something good in finance
- Hit or miss on ADP/rotation managers (as expected anywhere)
- they make it seem like they care but will never address real issues that people have. work-life balance has severely gone downhill and upper management thinks the solution is to come back to the office regularly. What?"
51,Silicon Valley Bank,"Lot of internal politics, people building own resumes than working for corp success",2022-01-15,2.0,Senior Director,Used to be great company till the COO change.

54,Silicon Valley Bank,Company Cares about Employees,2022-01-03,5.0,Product Manager III,"SVB is a great company to work for. They have been exceptional in their response to COVID, providing resources and time off, pivoting to Virtual work environment, checking in to make sure everyone is doing okay. SVB as a company is phenomenal.","Like many other companies, hiring is slow which leaves us having to pick up the work for positions that have not been filled."

The team are amazing and there is a real emphasis on collaboration. SVB treats staff really well and we are compensated well for the work we do,The main downside is there is very little work life balance even though the company tried to install a culture of flexible working and honouring work life balance.

Organization is embracing a remote workforce model (for many if not most positions)

Career opportunities are plentiful. You can really grow here.","Growing too fast. This results in chaos (across business units not just mine).

Compensation and benefits are better compared to other financial institutions.

Overall the company has a sense of purpose and trying to stay on top of emerging disruptions in the financial sector. I see the company growing in the next 10 years, with forays into global markets and innovative products.","The technology leadership gets recycled at an average of 3 years and when I say refreshed its right from CIO and CTO level down. Check how many CIOs and CTOs the company had in the last 15 years. Obviously, with that the entire division gets re-orged and loses focus on work and goals. The current leadership does not look very bright either, results are yet to be seen.

There is a weird nepotism culture at SVB, whenever there is a leadership change, the leaders and their subs get a free hand at bringing their friends, family, neighbors, etc. and with that, the entire work culture changes. This has happened multiple times in the last few years. Right now, it's in the technology and product team. >50% of these teams are now completely new and hired via friends and family offer and have utter disregard for everyone who is not part of their new ""team"".

There are no career opportunities in technology, there's not even a roadmap or job leveling. For many, they don't even know if by some miracle they get promoted what will that title be. Management will hire someone external than promote internal, as there is always a friend, family or referral waiting in line."

- Lots of dinners and events to join if you are market facing
- Unlimited vacation policy
- Most people are nice within the org","- SVB intentionally underpays and tries to maintain a lean structure. However, this is a bank that requires lots of human and capital investments into operations. No one wants to work for you if there isn't a fair reward/output ratio across functions.

- Extremely political. As folks like Mike D rises up in the org, people he trusts get promoted faster. Mostly nothing to do with talent but everything to do if their thought process aligns with his. And similar goes to other members within the steering committee. Not a bright future for the bank when you keep doing story telling on diversity while your own leadership table has zero diversity. Having 2-3 women at the table has nothing to do with diversity. You need diversity on career background, race, age, and geography.

- SVB went through at least 6 annual re-orgs in the last few years with the hope to break things down. The results are horrible. One team that really needs to be re-org'd is HR but nothing happened to them. Same drills every day. And never spent time/money to actually provide onboarding and career training when half of the company has been there for less than 3 years.

- Less than 20% of SVB staff is actually tech-savvy. Most people have no clue and no interest in what SVB's clients actually do. Most people within SVB can't even actually tell what are some of the main subsidiaries of the financial group and don't even know how the organization makes its money."

-Helpful and nice employees.
-There is some wonderful Koolaid to drink when you first start in the Marketing group.","-The Marketing group is not highly respected within the company so this leads to a lot of finger pointing and gossip.  
-Many layers of management for a small Marketing team.
-There is no promoting from within.  Prefer to hire manager/director level externally.
-A lot of favoritism for those who are a friend of the CMO or a C level manager.
-Bottoms up organization.  No support from the top.
-Many claim they have too many meetings.  These meetings are spent talking (I.e., collaborating) which means projects go on for an eternity.
-It is more important to be liked. If you are the type who likes to be innovative, take risks and feel respected for speaking up and doing different you will be viewed as arrogant. not a team player and/or difficult.  Your manager will speak to you about this...drink more Koolaid...you will be fine.
-When/if the Koolaid has worn off it is time to move on.  Use SVB as a stepping stone.  Leave when your gut is wrenching on the daily."

In IT we had almost the entire network team quite all within 1 week and on the business side we had an entire PES team walk out on the same day across two offices. If this isn't a heads up to management then I don't know what else will. 

In IT all we see is micro management, a senior leadership of yes men and a culture of fear and retribution. Management says one things but does something completely different.

Example, SVB' has a documented work from home policy and a process to implement a work from home schedule but the leadership team questions anyone that has followed this process and has a work from home schedule on place.

Currently our longtime CSO has been promoted to CIO and hoping that he will see the dysfunction within the IT org, specifically Engineering and Operations and work to fix it as soon as possible before we lose many more talented people."

Employees have lost hope and are either leaving on their own or being forced to leave if they dare express their voices.  It’s a terrible shame!  I was once proud to be an SVBer, but that time has passed.

It is clear that leadership is focused on the shareholders, but enough is never enough.  Even with a meteoric rise in stock price, the staff is treated as an expendable commodity.  Long gone are the days of the family culture which is still promoted in a desperate attempt to retain talent.  I’ve lost count of times I’ve heard coworkers say they are hanging on just long enough for the upcoming bonus before they have had enough.

The worst part of all is the toxic culture of leadership which has poisoned everything.  The expectation for privileged treatment has trickled down across all departments.

424,Silicon Valley Bank,Tone Deaf Approach to Diversity And Inclusion,2017-07-18,2.0,Relationship Manager,"working remotely is not stigmatized, a good place to learn about the tech ecosystem","I have been at SVB for almost 4 years and have seen our management attempt to understand the lack of diversity at the bank but they are clearly doing it because they have to and not because they get it.   

Recent reorgs have no direct reports that are women to the new president. Women on the board are not in revenue generating roles and the long time SVB woman who led the commercial bank was slowly squeezed out and it unclear what she is working on now.  SVB hires senior women but doesn't think about developing who they already have.   

Our management has used terms like ""not lowering the bar"" and at a townhall our CEO flubbed an answer about whether there was a diversity problem at the bank.  SVB follows the herd. I f VCs care about women in tech and public opinion is there, SVB will too. If VCs start to talk about race, maybe SVB will too but for now it barely knows how to talk about women in the workplace. 

Diversity and inclusion teams are not effective because there is no desire by the majority to shake up the status quo that has worked for them.  Diversity and Inclusion teams are led by HR which does not hold credibility at the bank because HR is there to protect SVB and not advocate for employees.  

To be clear, there are well meaning men and women at SVB who support diversity and inclusion but that isnt enough.  

Lately there has also been tension between those brought in to help the bank ""go pro"" and old timers who are feeling unappreciated.    Also going pro has been used in a menacing way/veiled threat/corporate jargon to hide behind unpopular choices.

Additionally, I read some of the other reviews and it is totally true that IT is a mess and the technological debt for a tech client serving bank is enormous.    Maybe the lenders are doing ok but most divisions are going through changes."

Quite the contrary, if challenge is what you crave for, then SVB is perfect for you. 

I love how my job keeps me on my toes, bringing out the best in me. I'm part of the CCAR team, where turnaround time, accuracy and efficiency are crucial. The good part is that I'm working with the best of the best. As stressful and challenging as it could be, I feel tremendous support from not only the project team but most importantly management. 

SVB is great about recognizing and rewarding hard work and good performance. They give out awards, recognition and on-the-spot bonuses throughout the year. Even better, you don't need to wait for mid-year or year-end performance reviews but Management actually takes time to schedule 1:1 meetings with the employees to provide feedback and encourage open communication. Management, in general, has an open-door policy and are very approachable.

On top of all these, camaraderie between employees is the best I've seen. There's constantly something going on - offsite events, picnics, community service, happy hour events. We had our Christmas party at a Casino last year where they set up tables/games for us, so fun!

They smile at you even if they do not know you and make you feel welcomed.,"There is an absolute lack of good leadership and management across the company. Fearful managers and leaders do not care for employee development and growth. Only the tenure in company and the relationships count for promotion and appreciation of good work. Few teams like CCAR Stress Testing and IT Client Services / Information Management / CCAR Data Governance teams are dreadful teams to work for. There are incompetent people who are not fit for management role but still promoted to Director and Head of the department roles. Employees are treated like a piece of garbage and slaves. In CCAR Stress Testing business team, highly qualified and experienced people are hired and told to work for IT. There is no basic management provided.  For eg, no 1:1 meetings, lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities and expectations are common in CCAR team. There is no freedom for doing things differently and no place for people with creative and out of the box thinking. One person is loaded with responsibilities of 3-4 persons and no help and resources provided to do your job effectively. IT CCAR Data Governance team has a toxic work culture.  This team has nobody with Data Governance experience. Managers hire highly qualified people and make them work on their own terms which becomes frustrating. It is the most bureaucratic team exercising old management style (“Yes Sir” mentality). When you question anything, you are alienated and pushed out of the team and the company. Only people in the inner circle are promoted based on relationship with manager and not based on performance. All the work is done by outsourcing consultants and employees are just acting as middle man between consultants and Business. Consultants have all the critical knowledge and they do not share knowledge for job security. Eventually they are hired as full time employees in this team. Business is very much dependent on Data Warehouse for any data related stuff as there is no sharing or documentation available for Business to understand and use data effectively. Technology project and program managers are treated by this team as puppets and PMs do what functional managers tell them to do."

Its normal and healthy. But you hardly ever hear a person leave JPMorgan, or First Republic, Morgan Stanley, KPMG, Cooley etc and vow how horrible their experience was leaving their old firm. To the point that they want them to fail, as some form of justice for their ethics, obfuscation and flat-out dishonesty. People who leave SVB...ALL of them feel this way. Almost literally everyone."

There was never a boring day and always hand my hands full and things to do.  In fact, more projects than resources most of the time but that was a good thing in some ways.  My direct manager was probably one of the best managers I have every had.  I can think maybe just 1 other manager I had that I would say was better, however, that manager and I have become best friends now for many years so that would be hard to beat.  The camaraderie is awesome at SVB.  My co-workers I worked with daily are all great guys and ladies.  I would come back in a heart beat if I decided to leave my new company.","The only cons that I can think of is the no working remote policy our department had.  This wasn't necessary a company policy but a department policy.  I will say that they are looking at changing this policy soon.  I would still be working for SVB if they would have allowed remote working from home.  I am not talking about just once in a while telecommuting, but we wanted to move out of state where SVB didn't have an office and would have had to work from home 100% of the time.  The only other con which really isn't a con is how the desk are setup to be more of a open environment to collaborate.  It was a great idea but I myself am a fairly loud person and other groups near us didn't care that I was loud.  :)"

This may be because they lack experience of such senior level roles from outside the company in some cases.
- No form of flexible working and very limited progression.
- Projects/processes are chaotic.

Why do they say it is unlimited?   When an IT person leaves they dont have to pay for any unused accrued vacation time.   Having to pay out that much accrued vacation weighs heavily on the balance sheet -- great way to cut costs.  Buyer beware."

The fringe benefits are somewhat superior to most financial services firms (ESOP, ESPP, Health and Dental).","Many in middle management are drunk on their on Kool-Aid and think they are the smartest person in the room. After having conversations with VCs, they start to delude themselves into thinking that THEY are as smart and valuable as VCs. The culture is very cannibalistic and very political. The firm even encourages it. They had training sessions about 'developing your personal brand.' The effect of it was a culture that very 'back stabbing' and completely devoid of trust. I have never seen so much corporate in-fighting and political posturing. In terms of compensation, the hours are closer to I-Bank hours while the pay is closer to commercial banking.

There is a agile initiative happening in Tiburon, with idea of increased productivity, and FTEs involved are required to travel 2-2.5 hrs one way, with commute involving train system + walk system & ferry system. Talk about increased productivity with 5 hours of precious employee time lost in commute. There had been lot of incompetent hiring in IT senior management, and competent people are suffering, some of whom left and more are on the tipping point. They want to hire talent but talent is not allowed to bring new ideas, and told to learn the svb way first, prove themselves and then bring ideas. By the time talented people prove themselves, the talented people have reached level of incompetency and outdated skills as others. Performance reviews are joke, as rating is already decided by management weeks in advance, and then directs are asked to enter self-reviews. Reviews are based on what others think of you, and not what you have delivered, so everyone joins the race of keeping others happy and stop delivering."

The business model and resulting revenues are impressive.,"IT is a disaster right now. Besides the lack of genuine leadership from the people in charge, some of the key ITers are leaving. Its not as much fun compared to my other jobs because most of the ITers(including the leaders) can not stand up for what is right for the company. The few who did were overlooked and they have now moved on - what a way to loose the key asset for any company. The worst part is the acting CIO who has led the company to this situation thinks we are in good shape. You can not fix a problem till you acknowledge a problem !! 
If you are considering a job, please do yourself a favor and ask the hiring manager about how many people have left their organization and why - you will get the idea. Also know the hiring manager well, as some of them especially CTO are incapable managers.
Till last year IT was in mood to hire like crazy and all of a sudden at start of this year - no hiring. This is the level of strategic planning the temp CIO has brought on. 
I have heard this used to be a professionally managed IT team till the CIO change in 2013. What I can see is the team spirit is totally subdued, no real motivation, no attention to real problems, no sense of accountability.

HR seems to stack lowest compared to the other companies. The company freely uses the marketing lingo - employees are our key assets, but does little to follow it. They are unable to do anything to retain or motivate key personnel looking at recent exits by senior personnel."

Company is improving training resources for new and existing employees.,Poor compensation for work done; most junior associates on good teams will work investment banking hours for half the pay.

579,Silicon Valley Bank,"Interesting work, great benefits, flexibility but lot of expectation for putting in the hours",2014-09-13,4.0,Worker Bee,"If you are smart, have good communication skills and ready to work hard, this could be the place for you. You will be amply rewarded. SVB pays above market salaries in Tempe, AZ, however, salaries in bay area are probably inline with the market. Very wide range of useful benefits such as employee stock purchase plan, 401K matching with immediate vesting, generous bonus and good medical benefits. The company takes care of its employees financially.

 People are very professional and friendly in general. The company is growing so there is ample interesting work. If I am not mistaken, they have not had  mass lay-offs at least in the last 20-25 years . They remained resilient through the financial crisis because they were disciplined and avoided real estate sub prime loans. (Only because they got burnt in real estate in the 80s and they pledged to stay away from real estate). The former chief credit officer, Dave Jones, was a hawk so he probably kept them away from trouble prior to the financial crisis.","People are overworked. It is a very sales like culture. Talkers do better than doers.

After years of growth and success, executives have become arrogant and there is lot of politics. Only if you are on the right side of the authority, will you do well. They started the SVB values thing so that more people start drinking the kool-aid. The top execs don't really live by it but want it drilled in the worker bees to create a cult-like culture and increase productivity. The integrity of some of the top guys is also questionable. 

There is lot of group think. Depending on who you work for, you can be shot down for disagreeing with the boss. 

SVB has been lucky to be in the right place at the right time. Venture capital investments are going through the roof and SVB being in that space is benefiting tremendously.  The C level management and senior management seem to believe that they are somehow responsible for the success of the company. I believe they have little if anything to do with the success and growth. They just got lucky. Now they believe that higher interest rates will make them even more successful. I am not so sure. Higher interest rates will slow down the economic activity and reduce the money sloshing around in VC world. SVB might benefit in terms of higher margins but will lose in terms of volume.  

Not too many people with good education, not even the senior management has good education but there are a few exceptions here and there. They can promote you to the top even if you don't have a degree (not necessarily bad thing if you did not go to college but are a real go-getter). They are trying to promote more women now to increase diversity. I personally think that discriminating based on gender, skin color, race or sexuality is not the best way to increase diversity. In fact, I see a lot of group think in some departments. If you do not agree with the authority, you are considered a trouble-maker. Increasing difference of opinion is probably a better way to increase diversity rather than discrimination but that is just my personal opinion and obviously not a fact."

I have been through many CIO's in my time here, good and bad, and I have to say the current CIO is the worst one SVB has every had. First off let me say SVB is a great place with great people and a fantastic culture unfortunately, the IT dept has now devolved into a cess pool of distrust, dishonesty and disingenuity. Management at all levels tell one story to their teams and individual contributors while telling a different story among themselves. Everyone, individual contributors and management, are scared to speak up or voice their opinions as they have seen good people get fired for doing the same. The offices the once used to be vibrant and outgoing are now quiet and introverted. No one speaks unless spoken too and people rarely leave their seats or offices to mingle and interact. It's now like working in a morgue and everyone is just waiting for the next dead body to appear.

The CIO has a great vision in her One IT culture but unfortunately she is not able to execute on it. She is never in IT leading them but instead chooses to be in the business informing them how IT has failed and how she is going to make it better. She is unable to make a decision and stick to it and constantly changes her mind depending on who she is talking to and what time of day it is. She dissolves and fires any competition to her ideas and gives more responsibility to under performing teams on false promises. SVB IT was once a functioning department, not perfect but I think anyone would be hard pressed to find an IT Dept that is 100% perfect."

The COO has appointed a head of global banking operations that almost everyone hates working for.  He is a dreamer, talks big and thinks by talking everyone around him will magically make it happen.  When things don't go as expected, he blames his team and technology partners.  Message to this guy:  its not bank of America, you don't have the budget or personnel to bridge the gap of your lack of tactical knowhow.    The bottom line is the COO is very good at the details and vision, he doesn't hire well and doesn't understand that he needs inspiring leaders who people respect and want to follow, not leaders who prescribe to ""the beatings will continue until morale improves"" mantra.

He was the only one seemingly with a vision as our CIO keeps flip flopping from one priority to another depending on the week.    Now, nobody in the senior management team is trustworthy and they are all tainted--everyone is scared and out for themselves at the expense of the company and IT which is the real tragedy unfolding here.   The CIO actually gave a speech after she made her ""breath of fresh air"" moves that if your not with her on her latest moves, get out of the company.  Inspiring.   Great values.   Message:  agree with me or get fired.   Others in the company who are really outstanding contributors and know their stuff are getting sidelined and marginalized---a disaster in the making as they scramble for the exits.   Who is going to be left to do the work?  Im sure the CIO will continue to blame others for her own failures as she likes to prattle on constantly about taking more ownership and accountability yet doesn't follow her own rules.   The two posts on here applauding the CIO are very poorly done plants--its well known in IT that she asked her remaining leadership team to post positive items due to prospective recruits reading what is really going on.  Don't listen to them, IT is truly hell.    CIO has done nothing in over a year except demotivate and disrupt the entire IT operation.

Meanwhile, a few good IT leadership members (engineering and client services) that have fallen out of favor (not surprised) and im sure wont be around for long while the IT leaders who kiss up and talk about what they are going to do get love.

Unique niche
Location
Most of the people outside of internal audit are cooperative","Internal audit department is one of the worst departments to work for in SVB. The team comprises of Caucasian male managers and Asian female staff.  Teams are managed by fear and intimidation.  There is no guidance, mentoring or coaching from any of the managers.  Head of internal audit has an objective to force at least two employees to quit each year.  In the 7 years that he has been on the job 14 people have quit the group.  The size of the internal audit team is 10.  

Outside of internal audit, if you are on the lending side you can have a defined career path depending on your networking skills.  Having a parent that is connected to the startup ecosystem is a prerequisite for success.  

SVB executive management is stacked with Greg Becker's followers.  As expected, this leads to a single point of view which is good if it's the right view."

A standard weekday report suddenly becomes an emergency on the weekend if it involves a client.  Almost all project workloads are generated by audit due to compliance issues. There is no career path for people in IT.  Management personnel decisions are made without employee input.  Staffing levels are insufficient.  One IT leader is known for inappropriate emails.  People are burnt-out and management downplays or ignores complaints.  IT management is better at fire-fighting than strategic planning."

610,Silicon Valley Bank,SVB is like family,2013-12-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I started as a contractor and was able to land a full time job. Throughout the years I was able to work my way up and be asked to relocate to the Tempe office and be a part of mgmt. I feel so honored to be working for such a great company. I see myself retiring from SVB as they have been on an upswing and growing with so many opportunities.,We are still learning to grow as a company yet keep that small company feel. Its a good thing but sometimes I wonder if they are biting more than they can handle.
611,Silicon Valley Bank,"Great place to learn, bad place to stay.",2013-12-10,1.0,Mid Level to Senior Management,"If your interest is the technology, life science and venture capital space, you can learn a lot here and gain great exposure to these sectors. Ability to learn an interact generally and specifically with these sectors is reason enough to work here. The bank has build up a tremendous amount of traction over the last 20 years, working here opens a lot of doors in these sectors. If you come here to be a 'banker', realize this is not a typical bank in a lot of ways. Their 'Guiding Principles' are a great thing to emulate anywhere you work, they focus on honesty, integrity, ethics, focus on the client.","For a long time I felt SVB was a meritocracy. The group you are in may be very siloed from other groups, but you can distinguish yourself with hard work and a little luck. I got to understand early that certain groups and individuals would be waiting for you to trip up, (and seeing how they could help make that so) but if you don't trip up, you would succeed. It's a bet I think many others would be willing to take. 

Having decompressed from the culture for a few years I learned two things: 
1) having to watch your back is not a normal work environment...it's just not 
2) SVB wasn't large enough to be so siloed, that was just a consequence of the culture. Functional groups can actually work together willingly and collaboratively. They should.

I can only speak definitively to culture created by Greg Becker and his steering committee, but the meritocracy thing definitively and permanently ends once you are in the top 5-10% of the bank. At that point, up is down, black is white and personal politics drive a remarkable amount of strategy. HR is the executor of senior management's will, and great lengths will be taken to achieve that will.

Lastly, you will not find this a place where speaking up is terribly encouraged. Vision comes from on high and nowhere else. Very different from even 5 years ago. Those who don't buy in or feel compelled to question, they do so at their peril."

But when you try to deviate from the framework, they say you can't do it. The framework has ""stage gates"" that impede on project delivery. If one document isn't completed, you fail your stage gate and progress cannot continue.  They require live signatures, then you physically scan the document, and save it on a shared drive.  Ever heard of esignatures and SharePoint?!? I felt like I was working for a company back in 1980, not ""Silicon"" Valley Bank.  Then they generate a ""red"" list for every project that is late, even though the process was the one that made it late. And the list is frequently incorrect with the wrong PM assignment on it. If you miss one milestone, management will come down hard on you with a series of meetings all the while, you told management three months ago of the issue and they did nothing about it. FINGER POINTING CULTURE. Some people work from home or work alternative schedules but when you ask to work from home because someone died or you have the flu, the answer is no.  Inconsistent policies.  Worse, after all this, they frequently have announcements like ""good news, I took away one required doc you have to fill out"" ""but I added four new ones you have to do"". What kind of good news is that? Then they ""grandfather"" required documents ""starting today and for all project three years ago"". So resources scramble to meet the audit instead of focusing on delivering the project.  Again, management comes down on you for working overtime or not meeting your dates when they are the obstacle to begin with. It's a no win situation.  I've not learned anything during my time there that is marketable. It was a waste of my career progression."
