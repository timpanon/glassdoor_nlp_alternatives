- pestering employees to leave good reviews or share content so the company can be seen as a top company… not a good look.

- Great place for early career consultants to learn/grow in IT space
- Flexible working hours and work life balance
- Overall competitive pay and opportunity to work with latest/greatest tech with few barriers to entry. They hired me with very little practical software engineering experience.
- Associate consultant ""BootCamp"" was fun to meet other colleagues from across the country.","- Very project-dependent. Some clients are, let's say.. unkind.. some are very nice 
- Hard to specialize or work on just a few technologies/ types of projects. I felt my role was designed to be more of a generalist consulting role - which could be amazing for some people's career goals. You might have one super technical project then one non-technical project as an associate. 
- Growing rapidly and becoming a bigger consulting firm that competes with Accenture, Deloitte, BCG, etc. I noticed a culture shift and more bureaucracy over time.

Ultimately, I did not find IT consulting that interesting and wanted to pursue other passions. But if you want a career in tech consulting, can't think of a better place to start (speaking from an early-career perspective)"

Great work life balance!",So far nothing negative to say.
89,Slalom,"Questionable Management, Discrimination",2022-01-20,1.0,Solution Principal,Can rack up lots of air miles.,"Early in my time at Slalom, I referred an Indian women to work on my team- she had with relevant skills and experience and impressive academic credentials. He refused to give her so much as a tech screen and then proceeded to hire a man with no relevant education/experience outside of a bootcamp, when I asked why, he referenced referred candidates race/gender and implied I was argumentative because I'm Jewish. This ended up going to HR and was the start of several years of retaliation.

I was kept on the bench longer than my male peers, though I was an experienced hire, and put in situations where I said manager hoped I'd fail so that he could justify keeping me on the bench. After passing a difficult client interview and finally making it off the bench, I was heavily monitored/babysat compared to my male peers. My female direct report was also kept on the bench longer, given lower titles/pay despite my attempts to advocate for my team.

The petty retaliation impacted my mental health: I had a ridiculously high rate of travel compared to others, department lead would do things like organize department the off-site (about 12 people) for when I was already on vacation... I could go on. I asked HR for an ADA accommodation and they refused to negotiate accomodations. I have a history of anxiety and offered documentation. There was definitely a shift from petty retaliation to actively trying to fire me after ADA request, and I ultimately had so many panic attacks I took FMLA and left.

I would have left much sooner except this was the tough part of the pandemic and I didn't feel like I had a choice. Many higher level leaders were aware- please don't believe their PR hype about DEI.

Leadership, especially in the ML space is incompetent. They were often so desperate to sell anything that they would make crazy promises and drastically under estimate work. This often meant long hours for consultants to pick up the pieces or lots of travel."

There are so many things to love about working here, and I have grown to become a bigger advocate for Slalom over time. Slalom has been the longest employer that I’ve been at in the past 10 years since graduating from college, and I’ve been fortunate enough to have worked for other tech and industry companies prior. I am trying really hard to keep this review short, and to give other’s a glimpse of what Slalom is about. I plan on staying with Slalom for many more years to come, there’s so many learning opportunities, from earning new technology certificates, to new coding languages, or consulting skills, to leading internal initiatives, or helping great companies accomplish even greater things - this is the career benefit. For work/life balance - I am new mother, just returned from maternity, and I get to spend every morning and evening with my kids; I rarely work over time. Now for the people you’ll work with (colleagues) - everyone is super intelligent, humble, and will do their best to support you always. It’s about making connections and being authentic; as long as you are you, and are a team player, you will do well at this consulting firm. Now for Slalom - Slalom’s leaders mean well, they reflect often and do their best to show appreciate to their employees and awareness to changing times. I respect all of them, especially our ID&E leader. Slalom is an incredible company to work for and to be a part of. Good luck!","Maybe more PTO time, but they just increased our floating holidays and bumped up our 401k match, and give solid raises every year, even through 2020 COVID-19 and had no layoffs. They have their priorities straight, which is always putting their people first!"

123,Slalom,Beware - Unorganized business  ops,2022-01-05,1.0,Operations Analyst,Good company overall. Business ops is a nightmare. Wouldn’t recommend.,"The company as a whole is good. However, working on the business ops side is a nightmare. Some markets only have 1 business ops person to support 100+ leaders. When concerns are mentioned to management they say this is how it’s always been. Many duties for this role are unconventional. Ranging from tasks that are HR related, training leaders, forecasting for consultants bonuses, tech support, admin related work leaders don’t want to do and anything new that might come up that they want you to help with.. all while not having a plan to increase the team. There is no documentation for anything at a company wide level. They encourage each market to have flexibility. This leads to repeat questions from leaders and dependency. In some markets the manager you report to may not be in business operations. This means they don’t fully understand your role, value your time or what you do. Business ops employees get a ton of work dumped on them to “own” with little to no guidance on how to complete said tasks all while being the sole “champion” for the entire market and being responsible for training 100+ leaders on said procedures. There’s a huge lack of black employees. I think maybe 2% of the company is black and some markets have zero black leaders. Too many on camera back to back meetings for things that could be said in an email."

The supportive culture, which is highlighted as a differentiator in interviews is non existent. Leaders are trying to deal with scale of the business, but are unwilling to prioritize the activities that will get them there. In my time, I've heard the organization compared to a kindergarten. Folks at the manager level and down are hard working, but the politics and manipulation taking place at leadership levels was more than a surprise.

Growth opportunities are given","The company has changed so much since I started and almost multiplied by 10. This obviously comes with a lot of change. A lot of my coworkers are leaving due to the new executives and changes that haven taken place. In my opinion, the executive changes has made Slalom has lose its charm. It's becoming more focused on the numbers than the relationships and people focus that they previously had. When I left Slalom, I didn't feel cared for by senior leadership like I previously did. The close family vibe changed to more of a corporate vibe where I seemed more like a worker/number than a person. It's just not what it used to be and many long time employees are leaving because it. 

Also, they don't do anything to help with seniority and compensation. They aren't willing to pay fair market rates accordingly even if you have worked at the company 5+ years, and therefore they're losing on great talent who care about the company and perform well. Then they end up paying higher amounts for new employees coming in since they obviously can't get them at the cheap rates they were paying previously."

181,Slalom,Don't drink the Kool Aid,2021-10-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pay is good:
I don’t know why people are complaining, we are in tech we are all paid well and have great benefits. Slalom didn’t fire anyone due to the pandemic and did not rescind any offers. Financially, the organization is stable, successful, and growing.

Work life balance:
I know that it depends from project to project and some people do work crazy hours, but many of us stuck to the usual 40. I also know some people who had periods of nothing to do and would log on but do other things. I never had to work weekends and rarely worked over time.

Some people are genuinely supportive:
I met wonderful people who supported my career growth and offered a sense of community during the pandemic.","Diversity, equity and inclusion:
Slalom tries to convince us that the organization is already doing well in these areas. Unfortunately, the outright and subversive acts of racism, sexism, transphobia, and homophobia I’ve experienced and witnessed exceed what can be summarized here.

Promotions:
The reality at Slalom: you are more likely to get promoted if you are a white man, the numbers don’t lie. Slalom’s promotion process is simple: all you have to do is ask. Who has the confidence to ask for a promotion?

Lack of action:
Leaving Slalom was a last resort. I raised concerns with my managers, leaders in the department of diversity, equity and inclusion, and HR, and was met with inaction. In multiple cases, I faced gaslighting, meaning they denied the problem, and defended their choices.

People are leaving:
Slalom is growing because they’re hiring faster than people are quitting, for now. A lot of people are quitting, especially women and people of color. Not a great environment."

213,Slalom,Go Elsewhere (Bad Leadership and Below-Market Pay),2021-09-15,1.0,Principal,"Smart and nice colleagues and very large, interesting client base. Plus, the name is good enough if you want to go to another consulting firm or into industry. Some semblance of work / life balance.","1. The ""project work"" is mostly staff augmentation like business requirements and PMO and mostly IC roles; very little traditional team-based consulting work. A lot of consultants have asked for more strategic work and management does seem not care - they just need to meet their absurd quotas and will ""sell"" bodies. Slalom is essentially a body shop. 
2. The management does not give one hoot about their people. They claim to care about careers, growth, diversity, etc. - but ALL they care about is utilization. Period. They treat the office as a body shop.
3. Sole focus on utilization. You can sell above your quota, but if you are not utilized at their absurdly high levels then they will put you on some sort of an improvement plan. They do not care about building out internal collateral to help sell or anything else; just utilization.
4. Fake Performance Improvement Plans. There were rumors of folks getting placed on bogus ""PIPs"" as an excuse of throwing them out to beef up utilization and profit numbers. This has happened in multiple markets across the firm.
5. Terrible management. Leadership across the markets across terrible. They would not be allowed in industry but, because they are able to sell tons of work, that is all the company cares about and so, they will continue to go unpunished.
6. Below-market pay. It is amazing how little they pay and if you ask for more, they will push back severely and if you leave for monetary reasons, they will insult you.
7. Leadership only cares about their stock price going up and will do whatever they can to preserve it (like low analyst wages)
8. Lack of diversity at the top of Slalom and the SF office. Also, curious how many other GMs at Slalom in the US are ethnic minorities? Also, why do you not give MLK and Juneteenth off? Is it because you don't want to lose the revenue from utilization that would have been gained on those 2 days?
9. Lack of career advancement. Promotions are pretty much based upon who the senior leadership happens to like and those people are accorded preferential treatment. If you are not one of the ""chosen ones,"" good luck!
10. They waste so much money on the pep rallies. They call these quarterlies (pep rallies) ""culture"" and say that is a benefit. I felt like I was back in my Midwestern High School waiting for Friday Night Lights to occur!

I am sure with this response, I will get some generic response from management asking me to contact them. Why? This is a firm that lies through its teeth. My advice: go to a Big 4, get some real consulting experience (and not BS staff augmentation work) and make some lifelong contacts. With those firms, you know what you are signing up for. At Slalom, you are told one thing and get another. The CEO says he wants to create ""a different type of firm?"" That is an absolute lie! Good riddance!"

From day dot, I was welcomed in like a new family member and supported all the way through, had the opportunity I had always wanted in learning new things that I could not in my prior career and have met some brilliant people.
People do actually come first here, and we are one big family pulling each other along, I live this feeling everyday, even within a WFH environment.

This review is to let others really know that there are awesome companies out there and this is one of them, I hope they stay here in Australia, because I cannot think of anywhere else to be or could top the conditions here.","No cons, doesn't make sense right?

224,Slalom,Awesome company to work for,2021-09-01,4.0,Principal Consultant,They are all about people. The people they hire are very smart and really good consultants.,"Sometimes, you get to work on a staff aug project ... which kind of makes you disconnected from other slalomers."
225,Slalom,"Good intentions and they care about their employees, mediocre work opportunities and low pay",2021-09-01,3.0,Software Consultant,"Benefits (they truly care about their employees and listen to feedback)
Pretty good PTO though its accrued
Good people (I imagine the culture is great, just havent had much experience because of covid)","Poorly matched ""alignments"" (client projects), you are often thrown into unfamiliar tech stacks and expected to figure it out. This pattern reflects poorly on Slalom because the client sees this inadequacy first-hand.

Disorganized process to staff you on a project, unclear steps and very ad-hoc.

Much of the work is staff augmentation at large companies. Rarely do you get a green field project with mostly Slalom members (which is what Slalom claims is their bread and butter)

Low pay. Slalom boasts about year over year growth and is a very successful company, but notoriously under pays people. They try to make up for it with ""mental health stipends"" (~$700 pre-tax) but ultimately that doesn't come close to a significant raise of 5% or more when most developers make six figures.

Growth internally feels very political. To get ahead you must work extra hours off the clock and play political games to win favor. Its not simply ""do your job well, show growth in responsibility and you'll be promoted"".

Hiring practices since the BLM movement started (June of 2020) are a bit awkward. There's a vague ""goal"" to have office demographics match the locale (racially), which ultimately results in preferential hiring.

Culture at Slalom is good, but sometimes feels like a cult. People are overly enthusiastic and rarely speak ill of the company.  Imagine a classroom where everyone is the type of person to raise their hand and be the teacher's pet (Hermione). Its get old when work != life for some of us."

There is a genuine care for their people that reflects in not only their values but from the first day you engage with the company. 

The people in the company are very friendly, and very much approachable from day 1, you genuinly feel part of a family from day 1.

One of the biggest aspects that I hugely respect and admire about Slalom is how we approach and treat our clients...there is genuine care there to solve problems and really take an approach where the client is at the heart of everything we do, money is not the focus! Having just left a big tech corp, I can tell you it was money first, client second, which is not the case here!

Other nice touches;

- Dental, Healthcare included in package (not salary sacrificed)
- Nice bonuses
- Yearly retreat for employees + 1

If something goes wrong, they'd blame you. They will NOT support you and would do everything to keeps the customer paying for as long as they can. 
The only reason employees do not talk about it is because after a while, you don't care anymore as long as they keep paying you. Also, you're subject to the NDA that HR makes you sign. No wonder why they don't have many honest reviews."
235,Slalom,Slalom does not dissapoint,2021-08-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I was going through the interview process, everything sounded so great, it was almost too good to be true... But three months into my role, I can say Slalom has a great working culture where the people really are at the heart of everything. You can bring your true self to work as there is a culture of openness and acceptance. Collaboration between teams is very much encouraged, with the office feeling like a big team, rather than siloed departments. They also re-evaluate their wellness and benefits policies every few months and keep adding new perks, which is a great plus. 
There is no pressure to be hugely billable, like in other big consulting firms, and you have a voice in the staffing because they really want you to work on projects that are exciting and value added for you.
Career path is very well setup and they have great learning and internal growth opportunity platforms.

People are aware of what's going on in the world and try to create a space where everyone is valued & accepted for the person they are. Leaders are accessible (in concept) and generally people are friendly. 

A lot of the cultural aspect of the job changed when we went remote because of covid, but at least in our market, the office ops team put in a huge amount of effort to maintain as much of the community feel as they could remotely.","A lot of politics. Internal politics matter more to career progression than they should. There are times when internal politics have negatively impacted client delivery, and this wasn't an isolated situation. 

Additionally, a new career framework was rolled out last year and despite promises that it would standardize criteria for promotion, it only added more politics and subjectivity into the mix. 

Managers are promoted when they don't have the actual skills to be good managers (provide consistent feedback, remember details about conversations with their people, advocate for their direct reports when appropriate).

Most of the roles at the consultant level are staff aug roles. You have to fight to be staffed in roles that actually align with your career interests...and there aren't that many to go around because of the type of work that is sold. NB: this is practice-dependent, but was the case for my practice.

Slalom pays a lot of lip service to diversity and inclusion, but the reality is there are very few non-white, non-male senior leaders across the company - and especially in my market.

Compensation for non-technical roles lags behind some other consulting firms and definitely lags behind equivalent industry jobs. Benefits are average at best and 401k matching is comparatively pretty low."

- friendly co-workers who are very understanding of family/work balance 
- high growth firm with opportunities to lean in","- overwhelmingly white senior leadership team, with very poor scores on overall diversity 
- Lots of internal diversity emails but lots of talk and little ""walk""
- Recognition happens infrequently and only by the same few people aimed at the same few people
- Internal career advancement framework is incredibly broken. They tried to re-do it in 2020 and it was a debacle. 
- Have to scratch and claw to get a promotion and even then, relationships with Directors is a must have, otherwise your work will never get recognized on merit alone
- Compensation is way, WAY below industry standards. Known to counter-offer with higher salaries only as employees are on their way out the door.
- Don't come here trying to do business consulting. Was always and continues to become mainly an IT consulting firm. The fit for former Big 4 consultant is becoming less logical than it was 3-4 years ago."

So easy to connect with and meet everyone. Lots of fun events and a cool office. Most of the people that work here have the greatest energy and will support you in any way.","There are a lot of great benefits but unfortunately, my experience was outweighed by an extremely toxic manager that was a bully with coworkers that would throw you under the bus. If I had to call into work sick, I was made to feel guilty and ask how sick I was. I saw another review on here that seemed similar to my own experience when I shared with my manager and HR that I suffered with depression and anxiety and how not only was it getting severely worse as a result of my job, but it had also been impacting it. The response I received was blank stares, simply asking how can we help even though they really would not be able to actually support you, and hearing ""well that's the job."" If you are looking for a true work-life balance and an organization that ACTUALLY will support you and your mental health, look elsewhere. I received so much respect and appreciation of my hard work but the complete opposite from my direct manager. The pressure is extremely high, especially as all offices continue to grow. The cliquiness and toxic culture were experienced with the internal teams and much higher compared to consultants I spoke with."

I was almost always asked to making large comprises to fill placements needed on projects that were either not my preferred subject-matter or role, and almost always later promised that the ""next project"" would be something closer to my professional goals. I felt that Slalom never cultivated my strongest skills, because the projects sold didn't match my goals. It was a mismatch of company and employee, but the sad thing is Slalom kept telling me the next opportunity would be something ""I"" wanted.

- great potential
- private company","- leadership is ill equipped to lead with inspiration. saying things like ""world domination"" is immature, vague, and not inspiring. pandemic management was handled pretty well but I felt it was far too sensitive and not based in reality. i'm not interested in seeing leaders cry or conjure up some perception of sympathy on a monthly or quarterly basis. I would have preferred to understand the harsh realities of the situation for our business and have leadership rally everyone as a cohesive unit and team to confront our challenges.
- lack of focus; spray and pray approach to BD with 300+ partners. Slalom is trying to be all things to all people without building truly deep and lasting relationships that endure
- every office/market is in essence it's own entity so there is zero continuity of focus and messaging across markets. this is masked as ""entrepreneurship"" but it's really just a lack of proper management and leadership
- middle management can be extraordinarily poor leading to churn of really good people. most thought provoking, challenger, type leaders that joined Slalom while I was there only last 18-24 months. some who lasted longer began looking for a new job after the initial two years.
- churn of really good people occurs because middle managers feel threatened and tend not to listen to new and fresh perspectives. leaders feel like they have to have the answer so new thought can be quickly squashed by incompetent leadership
- there is no sales organization in this company; zero sales culture; it's a go get a meeting and get out of the way approach. funny though, leadership wonders why they can't negotiate better deals, longer term projects, and higher rates with operational/delivery focused people leading the negotiations.....hummmmm"

319,Slalom,Staffing firm masquerading as a consulting firm,2021-05-27,2.0,Consultant,"1. They hire very talented people like ex Big 4 consultants
2. Great events to socialize and mingle, albeit the format is always completely catering to the extrovert
3. The office is warm and inviting
4. Most people (non-management) are great to work with","I post this specifically related to the LA office, my understanding is that the culture can be different in each Slalom office. 

1. ""Consulting"" opportunities are few and far between. If you are not in a purely technical discipline, good luck getting staffed according to your skillsets, let alone desires. 
2. Management on projects kowtows to clients, no backbone whatsoever when it comes to SOW conflicts, scope creep, etc. I've had management throw me under the bus first, instead of standing up to the client.
3. You will mostly be on projects by yourself, and left to yourself, management doesn't see or really ask about your work, just as long as you are staffed and paid for by the client. 
4. You can't say no to a project, or you're toast. Even if the project work is completely out of your wheelhouse. You are asked to ""tweak"" your resume so they force-fit you into a role. 
5. If the wrong person in management doesn't ""like"" you, you're toast. They all share subjective ""feedback"" with each other about you behind your back. I was told by a previous manager that your relationships are actually more important than the work you do. To some extent that is true in consulting, but at Slalom LA it is taken to an extreme level. 
6. If you're not extremely extroverted you fade into the woodwork, no matter how hard you work or how good you are at what you do. 
7. Lastly, the LA commutes are brutal, but management will never negotiate WFH with a client, even on Fridays. They would rather put you through a 2 hour commute each way everyday than negotiate any kind of WLB with the client for you. All in the name of ""customer love"". Which morphed into ""customer obsession"" during my time there. Face palm."

Work/life balance is better than big 4 and you don't have to travel.,"Slalom started off as a great place and is shiny looking when you interview and the first couple of months in, especially if you started before covid, but once you've been around for a few months you start seeing cracks in this organization and its empty promises. If you are an ambitious, hard working professional trying to grow in your prime years, this is the place your career will go to slow down or die unless you are one of the lucky few to have a people manager who actually cares about your growth over their own, even with their new career growth framework, which is terrible. Most projects are staff aug and if you don't sell work, you will not have any upward momentum no matter how well you perform in client delivery. The leadership team loves to call themselves ""leadership"" constantly, but don't act like it and the turn over of both leadership and consultants during my time there was over 50% in most practices. While the pay is pretty solid, the bonuses are really small for the criteria you have to meet for a single digit percentage opportunity. Over my tenure at Slalom, I saw the best people leave left and right for better opportunities and that should tell you everything you need to know."

Culture of the company doesn't necessarily translate to the local market. While some corrections have been made, several of those who created the issues remain in leadership positions. I wish the company well but I could never imagine going back there with that cast of characters. Problems include:
* Politics, cliques, favoritism (promoting friends, unwritten rules, ostracize those who do not ""play the game"") 
* Saying the right things publicly, doing the wrong things privately
* Huge focus on new age mystical philosophy with a meaningful disregard for operating a business
* Lack of local leadership (Lots of charisma and personality, but not substance)

362,Slalom,Never Been More Proud,2021-04-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,4 years here at Slalom and I can honestly say I have never been more proud to be part of such an incredible place. There have been incredible opportunities for growth and development both personally and professionally. I have always been amazed by supportive leaders and driven by the exciting work we do. Excited to see what the next 4 have in store!,I don't have any to share.
363,Slalom,Great consulting firm,2021-04-26,4.0,Senior Consultant,"- competitive pay
- super sharp colleagues
- office spaces are typically very nice and well-stocked with supplies and snacks
- good work-life balance... compared to other firms","- work-life balance can definitely be a challenge as market responsibilities increase and attending 'voluntary' events after hours
- big pushes for engaging/meaningful work, but still often hearing complaints about staff aug projects
- boy's club culture at times/in some markets"
364,Slalom,"Truly, people first",2021-04-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"People first culture, true to their values, safe space for innovation",Small WFH stipend; office needs and WiFi/phone reimbursement
365,Slalom,"Great Culture, Values, Learning and Growth Opportunities",2021-04-25,5.0,Consultant Data Analytics,"Focus on culture and values. Friendly coworkers and clients. Challenging projects and continuous opportunities for self improvement, learning and growth.",There are optional lunchtime and dinnertime meetings about once a week. Leaves me feeling frayed sometimes.
366,Slalom,Did not have meaningful system in place to ensure equitable wages,2021-04-22,3.0,CRM Consultant,Pretty good work life balance,"Culture is very frat-like, only meaningful pay raises come from bro relationships you build with those in leadership"
367,Slalom,Losing its soul,2021-04-22,4.0,Principal,The best and nicest people I’ve ever worked with in my life.,The new career framework is a bell curve trying to disguise itself as something else.
368,Slalom,Slalom Managers the worst,2021-04-21,1.0,Senior Consultant,"Lots of new projects and technologies to work on, not necessarily on one's own domain","Speedy burn-out due to numerous reviews and pressure to exceed every time. Managers are pressured to perform, this in-turn translates to employees being pressured to work themselves to exhaustion. Slaloms policy is to work the employee out to the max. Every which way. Grow Slalom, Customer Love, Exceed Client Expectations, Reviews, Leadership initiatives, Technology and Practice growth targets. Simply performing at client site is also not enough. It gets overwhelming. I don't think a Senior Consultant can keep a healthy family life with all the targets flying around."
369,Slalom,"Overall company is good but, depends which group or people you work with.",2021-04-21,3.0,Software Engineer,"Good benefits, Nice work culture. But unpredictable team or managers.",Very silo working model. I was with them for 1.5 years. I know my friends working there planning to leave ( not currently happy ). Some are stuck till they find better opportunity. The consulting model is very competitive. Not that many projects. So you will be on higher level pushed to take what comes or else will sit on bench for a while. When you are on bench then really lot of pressure to do pass certification or do any projects which do not interest you.
370,Slalom,Love it!,2021-04-21,5.0,Associate Consultant,It is a great place to work,Hard to maintain culture while remote
371,Slalom,Different than the big consulting firms in the best way,2021-04-20,5.0,Principal,"Joined Slalom from a large consulting firm. So far, Slalom is everything that I thought it would be and what everyone told me from the recruiting process.

A few examples...
1) A culture with psychological safety - you are encouraged to pursue what you are interested in, only get involved in things that you want to (rather than other firms where it is expected to spend hours each week on non-client work)

2) A focus on work life balance - leaders do not expect you to work late and actively protect their teams. It's the little things, like managing scope with clients effectively, being ok with testing out work-in-progress ideas and truly co-creating with clients (rather than big consulting firms that have so many layers of hierarchy and review cycles and re-work), and leaders jumping in to help with work no matter what seniority level they are at. Here it feels that I am trusted to do my job well. I am encouraged to prioritize my well-being and I am surrounded by like-minded people.","Because it's a newer, smaller consulting firm, not all types of consulting work is well built out. There are some areas that Slalom does very well and sells lots of work in, and other areas that are still in the early stages of growth. I think this actually is a pro not a con for people with a growth mindset as there are so many opportunities to help the company scale."
372,Slalom,People-centric company,2021-04-20,5.0,Communications,"Slalom recognizes that its employees are people, not cogs in a machine. Everyone works hard and cares about doing a good job, but at the same time human connection is at the center.","I have only worked there for a few months, so don't have any cons yet."
373,Slalom,Great People!,2021-04-20,4.0,Program Manager,The talent here is high quality!,The location was not the best for me.
374,Slalom,Good Place to Work,2021-04-19,4.0,Consultant,A company with good core values,Nothing that I know of
375,Slalom,Top notch company,2021-04-19,5.0,Consultant,Incredible balance and engaging work. Slalom truly puts people first,The pay is below market average in the Seattle area
376,Slalom,All good things come to an end,2021-04-16,4.0,Director,"Great People
Great Culture 
Work-Life Balance
Improving Benefits
Growing Company
no layoffs during covid. 
no travel unless you want to","If you are not in technology - there are very few opportunities to do great work. Strategy practices are still selling mostly PM work. No clear direction or strategy from Seattle leadership to leverage advisory work. The salespeople, or the leaders within various offices, don't understand how to sell strategy work. They are not willing to invest in the right type of strategy leaders. They need to understand that advisory work brings in more technology work – it is all connected. If you are a strategy or a finance professional – best to look elsewhere. Maybe Slalom will get their act right when it comes to selling strategic work but I don’t see it happening. Not many growth opportunities for non-technology folks. 
The new career framework was not rolled out properly. They wanted to standardize roles and titles but did a poor job of it. They did not consider people's experiences. Giving someone with 20 years of experience the same title as another consultant with 5 years of experience is not the right way to do it. They purposely held back people and didn’t give them the deserving titles because Slalom did not want to increase their pay. Now, everyone is trying to get promoted to a position they should have already gotten and or looking to move out of Slalom. 
Pay is lower than the competitors."
377,Slalom,"Nothing ""modern"" about this company",2021-04-16,1.0,Principal Consultant,Cold brew in the office,"-What you see if not what you get- old school leadership
-People there the longest are protected even if they aren't competent
-Pay is way below standard"
378,Slalom,The people of Slalom care,2021-04-15,5.0,Senior Consultant,"Slalom people, peers and leaders alike, love to see people succeed in their careers and in their life; it's engrained in our culture (I was going to say *their* culture, but realized that I'm that way too.","In order to really succeed you will need to introduce yourself to as many Slalom folks as you can, in order to become someone who comes to mind when your skill is needed at a project. Being a consultant at Slalom is therefore not a something for introverts, though there are opportunities for them. Meeting new people and getting to know them on a personal and professional level is also really tough during COVID."
379,Slalom,Slalom,2021-04-15,3.0,Consultant,"Great team culture 
Great Leadership at the high level","Mid level leadership is not trained well
Promotion process is not well defined and involves alot of favoritism"
380,Slalom,New Employee Experience,2021-04-14,5.0,Consultant,Management cares about your development and what you want to do with your career. They work to engage you on projects that fit your skillset and will also expand your skills.,You need to be self starting as much of initial setup of your profile and determining your projects depends on the efforts you put in. Haven't experienced other cons at this time.
381,Slalom,"Good overall culture, poor leadership at a practice level",2021-04-14,3.0,Senior Consultant,Great brand and reach for a local consulting firm,"Very staff aug. in the D&A space. Practice leaders mainly care about utilization and treat people like they are all replaceable.
Comp is not competitive."
382,Slalom,Not what I expected,2021-04-14,2.0,Consultant,People were fun and smart.,Lack of transparency with leadership
383,Slalom,"Great Company, Poor Design Leadership",2021-04-13,3.0,User Experience Designer,"Overall the company is good, _Build is great. Stable work.",Staff aug roles. Denver Local Design leadership is really Toxic. Recently had the majority of the design team leave to get away from the toxic management.
384,Slalom,"Nice coworkers and fun office culture, but not for everyone.",2021-04-12,3.0,Consultant,"Fun gatherings (pre-covid), friendly people, fun office. Great place to work if you are a project manager/BA/Change Manager. Employees generally treated very well.",Uneven treatment between differing groups within the office. Has gotten more and more political. Finger-pointing when things go wrong (preferred group(s) can do no wrong). Company seems most concerned about its social reputation/profile above all else - hiring quality suffers.
385,Slalom,Great people,2021-04-12,5.0,Sales Analyst,Work life balance is always respected.,The benefits are good but not phenomenal perks compared to some others

- Listens to and takes action on feedback from employee surveys","- I don't think it's easy to get a ""5 Stars, nothing wrong! Wouldn't change a thing!"" for any company - there is always rooms for improvement and I think Slalom does a good job recognizing that 
- Some growing pains - we are growing and trying to be mindful of how we do that while staying true to Slalom and I think with that, there will always be things that go wrong or don't land as well as we'd hoped, but being a mid-size company, I'm not surprised by that"
389,Slalom,"Decent for a large company, but remote work is becoming taxing",2021-04-06,3.0,Senior Consultant,"Great office amenities, employees easy to get along with, respectful of PTO","Little choice in clientele, big company allows individuals to skate by with little effort, politics and ""office contributions"" held to the same standard as good client work."

391,Slalom,Great place to work,2021-04-06,5.0,Senior Principal Consultant,Little travel due to working mostly in the local market,Potential for bench is high due if your area of specialization is relatively unique
392,Slalom,Heading down a bad path,2021-04-06,2.0,Consultant,"some great people, some great clients, relevant service offerings. Decent pay, average benefits.","Slalom's core differentiators/selling points have always been ""easy to work with"", ""no politics or hierarchy"" ""our people get to work on great projects"" ""our office is cool"" ""we are flat"" ""we are so different than the big firms"" - unfortunately in the two years that I was with them, none of these held true by the end of my time there.

Management surveys their employees, but denies all results with comments like ""we are already working on that"" -- ""we have already fixed that"" -- ""always a few bad apples or negative people that sway results"" -- "" we are far better off than our competition anyways"" 

The senior leadership team is all ex-large firm. As much as they say Slalom is different, they are implementing everything they had at Accenture, which is in many cases the reason many of us left those firms to join Slalom (think vertical specialization, new titles and pay rates, promotion paths, higher bill rates, being less picky about what services we provide, no culture of feedback, pushing people out through performance plans, leaders billing out on projects at tremendously high rates, etc.)

I have witnessed bullying and condescending conversations within my practice, on the leadership team, on group calls, and more. There is a ton of passive aggressiveness, toxic positivity, and gaslighting happening here. Anyone who denies that, especially on the leadership team is out of touch and in denial.

Quarterly meetings and any internal socials became a reason for senior leadership to take credit and brag about their team's success. 

At the time I left, I. had around 8 hours of non-client internal meetings per week. Become more efficient and focused.

From what I understanding from some of my US peers, Canada is worse than many of the US markets. It seems to me that many of the offices have a great culture - not perfect, but not as toxic and big-firm like as Toronto. Just an observation but many of the project team members I worked with were much happier and content with their office, leadership and overall experience than what I hear in Toronto from others.

I've seen leadership and client services act in ways I am not comfortable with in front of clients on many occasions. 

When good resources leave, they are talked about badly and it's seen and messaged as ""their loss"". There doesn't seem to be much if any at all reflection on if the organization could have done anything differently to keep that talent from leaving. There seems to be an air of arrogance at the leadership level that there isn't much to improve here."
393,Slalom,Great culture makes for great company,2021-04-06,4.0,Client Service Partner,"Strong delivery and experience focus; good mix of consulting, advanced data analytics and engineering skills; platinum/equivalent partner status with top Tech companies (AWS, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce); extremely people focused and supportive",Very few if any cons !

All certifications are paid for, regardless of pass or fail. Focus on doing the best we can for our clients. Positive working environment and culture. Introduced 401K matching within the last 2 years.","Primary focus is utilization (total billable hours divided by total working hours per year) as a measure of consultant performance and practice success. Negligible investment in consultant office equipment besides a laptop and a phone allowance. Employment roles and career paths are limited to consulting, sales, or practice administration.

To top it off, the client list you consult with are among the best in the world, dream clients.","This is not so much on the company, but more on the consulting industry - it has it's benefits, but there is also a lot more expected of you as a consultant.

For a large company (~9k consultants), Slalom has far less red tape or bureaucratic nonsense than most other consulting firms. The people are smart, fun and interesting, and the pace of work is fast. Slalom has been growing quickly for many years, which creates many opportunities for career advancement.",The federated model leads to varying levels of maturity and skills. Internal processes and procedures are under-developed for a company of its size. Lack of an official operating model can make Slalom challenging to navigate - especially for new hires.

455,Slalom,Interesting place,2021-02-24,3.0,Sales Executive,There is a lot of autonomy and not too many internal roadblocks. They operate much like a franchise model so the GM's of the offices have their own P&L and can spend as they see fit. This is beneficial because every market has different strengths/weaknesses.,"There are a lot of ex-Big 4 employees along with their large egos.

466,Slalom,Great company with good values,2021-02-10,5.0,Senior Consultant,"I really like how true Slalom is to their values and how they stand for what they believe in, which is a culture of inclusion, customer love and work life balance among other things. Company leadership is very forward thinking and accessible.",They are trying to sell more strategic work and team work but many roles are still individual contributors. Pay is ok but not great. Benefits are some what lacking.

468,Slalom,Love it here,2021-02-09,5.0,Principal,"It's hard to put into words just how much Slalom has changed my life. I was burnt out and probably suffering from a little PTSD after 3 years in a Big 4 consulting environment. Slalom has been a breath of fresh air - from a work life balance standpoint, but also in terms of how colleagues treat each other. 
At Slalom I feel valued as a human being. Im encouraged to pursue hobbies and interests outside of work, and colleagues are invested in my success in all facets of life. 
When I first joined, Slalom was a way point for exiting consulting. Now it's the place I want to spend the remainder of my career.","As the firm grows, I'd love to see management continue to improve benefits. PTO and 401K match increases would certainly be appreciated. That said, I feel like Slalom is pretty close to the industry average in this regard."
469,Slalom,"Good WLB, considerate leadership, down to earth coworkers",2021-02-07,5.0,Consultant,"Good WLB, considerate leadership, down to earth coworkers",Pay progression and upwards growth is unclear and not as structured as other firms
470,Slalom,Nice work-life balance,2021-02-05,4.0,Consultant,"Because of the local consulting model, usually you don't have to travel outside Oregon","You have to travel in Portland Metro (which includes Vancouver and other large cities in Oregon, e.g., Bend, Eugene); commute times can be bad at times"
471,Slalom,Great Leadership and good projects,2021-02-05,4.0,Senior Principal,WLB and choices of projects,Salary is less as compared to benchmark
472,Slalom,Avoid at all costs,2021-02-05,1.0,Consultant,I worked with some wonderful consultants (non-leadership level),"Local leadership is a mess. If you are a white male you will do great in the company, but any woman or BIPOC watch out, you will be asked to work twice as hard for less pay and little to no recognition. They love to make you a slew of promises and then never follow through and will never take any sort of responsibility - it will always be your fault."
473,Slalom,Great change of pace from the Big 4,2021-02-04,4.0,Talent Development Manager,"Non-linear career opportunities. With creativity and resolve, you can carve your own road.",Too easy to plateau your career in a role.
474,Slalom,Terrible Culture and Work-Life Balance,2021-02-04,1.0,Consultant,Fun events. Cool office. Good people.,Too much drinking. No work-life balance. No cultural values.
475,Slalom,Overall good people. Some bad apples.,2021-02-04,3.0,Sales Executive,Decent pay. Company overall cares about culture/values/D&I initiatives (hired 2 women to executive leadership team last year). Most people who work here are smart.,"Lack of growth opportunities and mobility within the company. Extremely low raise in 2021 with Covid as the excuse, although the company performed well. There are some bad apples in the company that changes the experience for some. This seems to be at the market/office leadership level and not consistent market to market. Some days are long with no care from leaders promoting after or before business hours calls on the calendar (7am calls or after 5pm calls). Some leaders promote working on weekends too."
476,Slalom,Can't speak highly enough.,2021-02-04,5.0,Talent Acquisition Analyst,"Shortly after starting I met Paul Schurr, General Manager of the Atlanta Office. He reminded me of Slalom's mission: ""To help you reach for and realize your vision."" He emphasized that this is not just for clients; it's also for employees. He said (as verbatim as I can recall):

""My goal is to ensure that when you leave Slalom--whether that time comes in one year or ten years--you'll be better equipped, skilled, connected, and empowered than when you arrived, so that you when you do go on to the next thing you'll be in a better position to do it, and do well, than if you had worked anywhere else.""

Talk about investing in your people.

In my year at Slalom, I witnessed leaders in all stages of their careers deliver exceptionally for their clients while facilitating the growth of everyone around them. Even the executive team was available for one-on-one conversations. As an analyst (entry level) this blew me away. 

Slalom goes above and beyond to support your growth as both a professional and an individual. I was especially impressed by their employee resource groups, their commitment to giving back locally, their quick and transparent adaption to Covid, and their response to the Black Lives Matter movement. They don't just talk, they take real action. Slalom demonstrated, in real time, the ideals within talent acquisition, engagement, and culture that drew me to this field.

They fully embody their #loveyourfuture motto.","Slalom has a startup feel, there's a lot of autonomy (this is a pro). They've grown explosively (also a pro). Currently, they're in the midst of adapting their structures to better support the scale they've reached and the scale they aspire to (forward thinking leadership, another pro). This means that a lot of their ""how we do things"" is evolving. If you want to stand firmly in either a startup vibe or a multinational corporate vibe, Slalom is not the place for you. If you find change exciting and want to play a part, you'll love it."

496,Slalom,They deserve 3.5 stars but I'll round up to be nice,2021-01-21,4.0,Principal,"- Leadership is usually true to their word (key word, usually)
- No layoffs at this place but if you're not good, they won't hesitate to let you go
- Culture is second to none
- They throw great parties","- As you progress, pay and bonus does not keep up with other firms. They need to definitely work on this and everything is lip service until something is done.
- They hired a new Chief HR Officer and all of a sudden, the health benefits went down the toilet. Especially if you have a family.
- New career framework/titles are no good. Some people are average at best but rubbed elbows with the higher ups and received an inflated title. This really upset the high performers who didn't get the title they were looking for.
- Some clients truly suck. I've worked at a number of consulting firms and for some reason the majority of clients we signed were truly horrible people to work with.
- Too many people hired without a consulting background. This means the trained consultants would need to pick up the slack. I personally worked with someone that had many years of industry experience so they had an inflated title but when it came down to consulting skills, they were horrible and I felt like I was training an 8 year old."

Slalom genuinely lives its values and has leadership that cares about its employees. During the COVID pandemic in 2020, these values really came to light. We had no layoffs and the response from leadership was positive, consistent, and transparent. There was and continues to be a lot of support to employees.

527,Slalom,Toxic Work Culture and No Career Path,2021-01-10,3.0,Consultant,"Slalom was founded on core values. When I began, these core values weren't simply decorations on the wall. Management and leadership truly valued them and would step in when employees did not uphold these core values. Formerly, the culture was vibrant and all were invited to have a seat at the table.","Slalom has several systemic issues:
- The ""inclusive"" culture touted by white males on LinkedIn isn't actually inclusive. Diversity is approached as a check the box rather than an actual shift in mindset where diverse backgrounds are included at the table.
- Slalom expects a volunteer group of women to solve the sexist culture. Recently, women have been promoted to ""management"" to positions and this is showboated to the company of hey look we hired a woman! We are so not sexist. They hire women into inclusion and diversity and HR positions rather than President, GM of a region, or other more strategic positions. The strategic positions are pretty much held by all men. 
- Slalom doesn't have a clear career trajectory. Their thought is their new framework will solve all their problems when in reality, they haven't done any work to address the heart of the problem. Slalom needs to give managers training (such an easy win), and allow them to not be fully utilized so they can support their direct reports. Tell me if someone has a family or a sick mom or can't put in the 60+ hour work week, how are they supposed to succeed and support their direct reports?"

530,Slalom,Not what it used to be,2021-01-08,2.0,Consultant,Slalom LA has hosted amazing events pre-COVID but has failed to maintain culture and appreciation for employees in the past year.,"Ultimately this is a sales-driven company with little focus on technical abilities. There is very limited opportunity for mobility here since success is largely based on sales. There is very little time and effort spent on up-leveling existing team members. This was evident during the rollout of their new role hierarchy, which was rushed and sloppily executed."
531,Slalom,Awesome culture,2021-01-08,5.0,Consultant,"Collaborative culture, great people, care about staff and community, interested in your development, inspiring leadership, no required travel","PTO policy could be a bit better compared to other consulting firms, but hey . . . no travel required."

533,Slalom,Career dead-end with slimy leadership,2021-01-07,1.0,Consultant Data Analytics,Peers are good folks who deliver good work.,Leadership is weak and sells crappy projects. Tons of lies about the work that you end up doing. No professional development and people seem happy to coast. Great place to work if you want to work for clients at bad companies.

535,Slalom,Driven but difficult to communicate,2021-01-05,4.0,Salesforce Developer,"Smart and talented people, treats you like an adult with little handholding.","Lack of leadership at certain levels, allowing blame to be passed around until it can stick somewhere. Accountability can be spotty, does not encourage collaboration with clients in favor of showing up as 'thought leaders'. Can seem a bit culty as well. Will assure you they will work with you for job placements but at the end of the day what they say goes."
536,Slalom,"Appalling, toxic, with a culture that perpetuates mental illness",2021-01-01,1.0,Consultant,I met one outstanding human during my time at the company.,"Leadership is disorganized, unknowledgeable, immature and does not take accountability. Training and on-boarding was insufficient at best, provided by an associate that either did not have a thorough understanding of the job, or was mentally checked-out already. I witnessed first-hand an incident of bullying by a colleague then by a superior. While feedback was solicited, it was not well received and perpetuated a feeling of a fake positive culture. Whereby you are gaslit into believing everything is great by simply not acknowledging the team’s shortcomings or areas of growth, and admonishing or negative-shaming those that provide authentic and transparent feedback as requested. Unfortunately, it would seem this company - while claiming a great culture of “doing the right thing” and leading with empathy, are really just the same as any multi-national corporation. Only wanting to hear what they want to hear, and discouraging dissent."

541,Slalom,Great place to work,2020-12-24,5.0,Solution Owner,A very people driven culture,New / going through growing pains
542,Slalom,Cliquey culture dictates growth opportunities,2020-12-18,1.0,Consultant,"- You can work on a variety of projects at different industries, gaining exposure to a lot of different areas.

- The culture can be fun. A lot of coworkers are friends and will hang out outside of work. 

- Slalom does a nice job with Quarterly meetings, though it can be a bit of a drunk-fest.

- Work/life balance is what you make of it. You can easily keep a 40 hr workweek. This is nice if you have a family.

- The good people managers are very good and genuinely care about you.

- A lot of ERGs if you want to get involved in more efforts outside of your typical consulting projects.

- I consider the executive team (Brad, John, etc) to be transparent communicators about where the company is going.

Unfortunately the Pros are overshadowed by the list of Cons below.","- “High School”: It’s a juvenile culture. People drink a lot, co-workers date and hook up, people gossip. There are cliques, which completely dictate whether you’re included/excluded in opportunities .

- Cliques and Favoritism: People use the phrase “inner circle” to describe the cliques within Slalom. The “Inner Circle” is typically a group of people with leadership titles and who have been with the company for awhile. If you are in the ‘Inner Circle’ you’re golden - they’ll pull you into growth opportunities and leadership conversations, and your career within the company can take off. If you’re not in the clique, it doesn’t matter how much you do, you won’t be included in any growth considerations.

- Unclear/Limited Opportunities for Growth: Slalom is a flat organization. It’s well-defined what each role is (e.g., MD, PAL, CSL, CM). But, jumping from one to the other is ambiguous and entirely dependent on the relationships you build within the company (see above point). In my experiences, I saw multiple average/low performers move up because they buddied up with CSPs or MDs, while high performers who didn’t specifically befriend the higher ups were glossed over and eventually left the company. Very sad.

- No Growth Development Framework: Slalom does a poor job of grooming leaders. There is no formal process of rating performance, or managing high performers. I’ve seen many top performers get frustrated with going above and beyond and not moving up, while others who buddy-up with the MDs get chosen for growth without doing much.

- Elements of a Toxic Culture: Given the above, Slalom has many elements of toxic workplace culture. Favoritism is a huge part of one’s path in the company. As an example, I was personally workplace-bullied by someone for months who saw me as a “threat” to getting promoted. I eventually left due to this behavior (and other things), while the other got promoted even after not hitting key metrics and being on the bench for over a quarter. Wow. Care to take a guess on why? See the above few points.

- Awkward Diversity and Inclusion Rollout: Slalom has been trying to make strides in diversity and inclusion (which is a great thing…and also interesting given my comments above on favoritism). When this first kicked off, there were at least a couple DI leads who told other individuals that they shouldn’t be promoted based on their gender or skin color, because they were trying to even out the quotas. Yikes. I hope they’ve gotten things together and are on a more inclusive path."
543,Slalom,Growing company with loads of growth potential.,2020-12-15,4.0,Analyst,Plenty of opportunity to grow. Good work culture (outside of COVID-19 limitations).,"A growth path isn't laid out for you. You'll have to make your own way. Salary and bonuses are totally dependent on the individual office, team, and employee. Title doesn't really indicate experience or salary levels (although they are rolling out changes to this for client facing consultants). Benefits are mediocre."
544,Slalom,Trust local reviews: experience varies by market,2020-12-15,3.0,Senior Consultant,"I haven't met a consultant I did not enjoy as a person. Everyone is kind, a team player, and committed to working hard. 

There are a strong set of firm values that the organization uses regularly to drive culture. This provides an anchor for explaining decisions, delivering feedback (mostly positive, sometimes constructive), and evaluating performance. 

If you're in a market with great leadership, there are good opportunities to explore, innovate, grow, and advance.  If you're not...","Corporate leadership evaluates market performance first by utilization--not revenues. That translates to a ""just get them staffed"" mentality, creating some of the  shortcomings referenced in other reviews:  
-Focus on billing hours, as opposed to doing what's right for the client
Little concerted investment in product/service innovation
-Pressure on those who want to move up to do bill 40 and then do the job above them to prove themselves 
-A broken performance management system that rewards hours--not revenues. 

These experiences are not universal; read the reviews and you'll see that average ratings and NPS scores vary by market. The senior leadership team of each market has autonomy to run their business as they see fit. As a team member within the market, there's almost 0 opportunity to  provide feedback/ open conversations about negative patterns/behaviors at that SLT level in a safe way.  

I'm not sure if its a product of my market's SLT (which is a black box when it comes to decision-making) or the firm, but I've been told by many that moving up will require that you demonstrate you can do the job you want while also hitting the targets for the job you have. So, bill 40 hours per week to meet your utilization target (it's 87.5% and PTO counts against you, so don't take vacation or spend any time on the bench!), sell a few high-value engagements (with little sales support to open doors), contribute to internal initiatives, then ""tell a compelling story."" Then maybe you can get that next role. Or maybe you can continue to work 50 to 60 (or more) hours a week hoping for better luck next year... Bottom line, work-life balance only exists for those who don't want to move up and promotions are not guaranteed even if you came with significant experience in sales/practice leadership before joining. So, don't come in as a consultant unless you want to stay there or you have the foresight to negotiate a promotion timeline when you take the job. 

I hope this explanation of how different markets operates helps explain the variability in reviews. I don't believe those negative reviewers are necessarily disgruntled employees; they're probably in a market with leadership challenges, not receiving opportunities to do work that is impactful or challenging, have no clear growth path, and/or are not in a high-visibility clique (as one reviewer described). I feel those things some days and it's rough."
545,Slalom,Not a good place to work for women in tech,2020-12-14,2.0,Consultant,"Most people are very nice and friendly. The culture is pretty good too, as they have a lot of employee activities after hours. They have lots of happy hours, a retreat and quarterlies with food and beverages. I guess it's not that great for people that don't drink alcohol. I would say the best of the company are the ERG's, which are very diverse and constantly have meetups and talks of their topic of interests.","I don't recommend you to work here if you're a woman in tech or want to transition to tech. They might promise you'll have opportunities to work in projects that will help you develop tech skills, but that's probably a lie.
The Technology Enablement department has a big bro culture and their App Development group is sexist. Unless you have a lot of years in experience in tech, you'll probably will be signed in to projects that are more business oriented because that's most of their contracts. For some reason, a lot of the contracts they get in TE get cancelled after they have been announced. This kept happening way before the pandemic. 
I know many women with tech skills that were very capable and left less than a year because they kept getting administrative work, or they were just treated poorly. Their TE leadership just doesn't know how to promote their skills and capabilities to the clients well, and they don't know how to treat them respectfully. They might offer a competitive salary as a consultant, but not as a software engineer. Honestly, if you can afford to, try getting a job somewhere else.

They don't offer sick days, so most people have to save their PTO's in case they get sick."

You're going to have tough clients, there's going to be politics, and you're going to have to work long hours sometimes. Personally, I don't think this is a con - I chose consulting, but I think some people come to Slalom thinking that it's going to be different, and while culturally it is, the work is still the same, and clients are still the same.

1) My experience is that Slalom does not have a sales culture. Make sure to ask a lot of questions about the support you will receive in a team selling model. Will your manager support you ? 
2) Slalom's compensation plan and benefits package is from the 90's. Read closely. Earned bonuses or commissions are discretionary. Read the compensation plan closely and make sure you are comfortable with it. 
3) Slalom sides with the company if there is a bonus/commissions dispute and will look for ways not to pay sales."

607,Slalom,Inauthentic culture and low-value work,2020-08-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The office does its best to make employees think that they get a lot of ""cool"" perks like free coffee and snacks.","Over the course of 4 odd years, they have established a homogenous leadership group and continue to promote individuals to higher ranks based mostly on those qualities. After working under management across various projects, you come to find that these ""leaders"" have very poor management skills and are not experts in their respective industries. You also find senior consultants acting as project managers who really struggle to manage a team and produce quality deliverables. As other reviewers have mentioned, many employees come from the same local consulting firm as the the person running the office.

The head of the office, who initially comes across as very caring and involved during the interview process, is really quite cold and plays extreme favoritism. Top management enthusiastically speak at office events but lack the decency to even try to familiarize themselves with all employees. You see certain teams put on a pedestal whereas some are not even given a shred of importance, and this is all based on the $$$ they are bringing to the company. Slalom dc is not as different from other consulting firms as it claims to be.

The work done has low impact/value to customers as projects are too short to even make much of a difference; But there is a high learning curve for employees. The combination of these leads to stressful and often meaningless projects."

There are some super smart people here doing some really interesting projects and growing the Houston market.  They know how to party and celebrate.   There is a company trip yearly that is super fun and company meetings regularly with drinks and activities.   They do their best to be socially responsible of the current social landscape recognizing BLM and gay rights efforts and organizing awareness events.   They have done great offering support during Covid 19.,Highly focused on billings hours so I miss many of the fun events to ensure I don't lose my bonus.  There is no exemption when there are company events.  Missing work to attend Conant training or company meetings you must work overtime to make up hours.   They also encourage you to work 44 hour work week instead of 40.  I would also love to see even more diversity in the Houston office.

- Most people are friendly
- A few that know their area really well","- No exciting projects in the pipeline. Sometimes no projects at all. Being on the bench for *only* 4 months was completely normal. A lot of people did leave because of this.
- Seems a good place for scrum masters and project managers but not so much for technical people that want to learn and grow. Big focus on selling process (agile/jira/post-its) but not technology. There are more project managers than developers.
- Attempts of selling technology (i.e: _build) reusing formulas from the US and Canada didn't work in the European market.
- Some very bad people managers

After making the jump from industry (software engineering) to consulting, I've learned so much during my time here. The people are truly at the center of the company, and the way leadership has navigated recent events in 2020 is inspiring. Slalom's core values are taken very seriously, and it's awesome to see team members actually live out these principles on a daily basis. I'm truly grateful to be here, and am excited to see the company continue to grow in the coming years.",The career path/promotion process can feel vague and ambiguous at times. It occasionally feels like networking and putting yourself out there is valued higher than hard work and contributions. I expect this may change as updates are made to the career development framework.
622,Slalom,Do What Is Right,2020-07-09,5.0,Consultant,"I enjoy working with Slalom. I'm in a newer, smaller market office (San Diego), and I feel the type of work that we have is more impactful than that projects that I worked during my many years at Deloitte. The office seems more agile and nimble with more self-determination than typical Big 4 consulting. Everyone that I work with is super friendly and sharp. And I appreciate that my projects are with fellow San Diegans. The pay is competitive and the client list is growing.","The Slalom name is not yet widely known in San Diego, so I have to explain what Slalom is almost every time someone asks me where I work."

- A commitment to transparency and truly living our values, from leadership to compensation models,
- Exceptional vertical and lateral mobility - if you're interested in something and self-advocate, you can make it happen,

- A candid, caring culture. This will be my last corporate email address - I won't always be in this role, but I don't see the need to leave.","- Internal knowledge management is still a work-in-progress,

624,Slalom,Good from the beginning until trust was broken,2020-07-07,2.0,Analyst,"- Incredibly intelligent and kind people

- Awesome network of resources around the nation

- People-focused (for the most part, not all-inclusive)

- If you're a 29-45 year old consultant, this is the place for you. Great people, but the vast majority of the office falls into that age group. If you're coming straight out of college, I personally would've potentially preferred a different firm.","- Leadership loves and welcomes the word diversity but the only diversity I've observed them pursue until recently is gender parity. As a person of color, I didn't feel they completely had my interests at heart until there was pressure from the world.

- Talked about during the interview process and confirmed within 2 months of starting, I brought up work travel, asking if there were opportunities. They said I could if that was what I desired. To that, I said I want to travel as close to 100% as possible. It's been over a year since I started and I haven't gotten an opportunity to travel for projects.

- Earlier in the interview process, I asked if I would be acting in an individual contributor on projects. I'm a growing professional who wants to learn from the intelligent people at Slalom. They said I wouldn't be alone. The last two projects I've been assigned to, I've either been the only Slalom employee at the client or the only Slalom resource on the project.

- Slalom told me I would receive a promotion in 6-12 months if I delivered after I started. About 9 months in, I took the initiative to play a role on a project two promotions above my current position. I delivered well, the client trusted me from the beginning of the project, and we worked well together. Thirteen months later, even after delivering exceptionally, I'm still promotion-less with a promotion date that stands as TBD."

634,Slalom,Everything that I expected and more!,2020-06-17,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"I accepted an offer to join Slalom back in January this year. By the time I had arrived at the end of my three month notice period, lockdown had already started, meaning uncertainty around whether I was still able to join Slalom started to kick In. Thankfully, I was able to join, and I received the best onboarding experience I’ve ever had. This started with receiving lots of Slalom branded items a week before joining, followed by a detailed plan of what my first few weeks would look like. I’m now coming to the end of my second month, and considering the circumstances of joining remotely and not physically meeting a number of my colleagues in person, all I can say is that it’s been a truly awesome experience and one that I’ll never forget. 

If you’re looking for a business who truly puts their people first, a business that is transparent from the very top down, and a business that truly embraces their core values, then you’ve come to the right place. Look no further!","None so far, everything has been great."

There is a genuine focus on taking care of our consultants so that they enjoy the work they are doing.,"There is systemic racism in the company and it's evident by looking at the racial makeup of the senior leadership team. One of the companies ten core values is to celebrate authenticity. But you're far more likely to be promoted if you're white or can effectively 'act white' at all times around other executives so they always feel comfortable. The company will use code words like 'culture fit' when assessing promotions and external hires and hidden behind that is making sure that the status quo isn't changed. The status quo is that 19 out of 20 senior executives is white. 

To get promoted your accomplishments need to far exceed any white peers and you need spend tremendous energy to make sure all white leaders feel very comfortable with your presence, so avoid any confrontation, even healthy discussions."

Things started to change quickly 18 months ago. I/we have since unfortunately noticed an exponential increase in the amount of political maneuvering setting foot within our walls. It is frustrating to see how this has directly impacted promotions (ie. promotion to MD). There are some fantastic candidates who possess leadership we admire who were overlooked recently. This, coupled with the many great practitioners who have chosen to leave to go elsewhere over the past year as a result of what I have noted is disheartening at best. I know of others actively looking (Covid is keeping them here for now), and I wonder why I am still wanting to work here. I miss the old culture and the true genuineness that once existed."

This team is the one that does the traveling and augmentation for other offices. I never had to go to my home office as my teams and projects were all over the country, rarely in the city I lived in. Would have been nice to have more flexibility to live anywhere if I was WFH home or traveling all the time. This may have changed since I last worked there though."
649,Slalom,Wasted over a year of my career with this firm,2020-05-19,1.0,Consultant,The office space is nice.,"This company preaches client love, but I did not see any of that during my tenure at Slalom. The things that leadership would say behind the clients' back disgusted me. Of course they need your help and your expertise - that's why you're there! It's inappropriate to make comments such as ""their mindset is still in the stone ages"" or ""they have no idea what they're talking about"". It's our responsibility to help them improve and elevate their current processes. I worked at my previous consulting firm for over 7 years and I had never encountered such vile leadership with such a superiority complex. 

In terms of career, I was never placed in the role which I was promised during the interview process. They will say they try their best to place people in the right roles but don't be fooled. Slalom has a tough time competing with the Big 4; therefore, they've made their mark in a small number of the same roles. 

Also, don't expect to have work-life balance. I live in the city and commuted 3.5 hours a day to Deerfield for months on end without a WFH option. I spoke with my people manager about this, but she was too passive and didn't want to make waves, hence I was stuck without options."

No support for your onboarding despite they claim it. No one can hear you over those who are generating money for the company. A lot of pretentious behavior. Management and lead roles are given to people with limited skills and knowledge. A very high rate of staff turnover. in less than a year no one from my team of 6 who were all under 2 years, 3 of them less than a year in the company were there. You as a consultant should be always at the client. Catastrophic low amount of work they get leads to long bench time for engineers (Sometimes over 3 months). The London office is still not profitable after over 10 years and it is being fed by the US office."
651,Slalom,Its a Decent company,2020-05-13,3.0,Consultant,"You don't have to travel mostly. Most projects are local. If you are put of a non local project, you still get to avoid unwanted travel in most cases.

Most people I worked with at Slalom were nice to work with.You do get your share of jerks. 

If you like networking/work events, Slalom generally has plenty of them. We've had them in places like Disneyland, Knotts Berry farm etc. Those are fun.

It feels like the top leadership genuinely cares about having a people centric company. But since each location is kind of run as an independent smaller company, each has its own culture.","You need to be an extrovert to get noticed. Since most of your work is staff aug, your management chain is mostly unaware of your work. 

I joined Slalom with the assumption (based on what was told by my recruiter and hiring manager) that they do a lot of consulting work, but turned out most of the work was staff aug.

For the few consulting projects that Slalom did, there is a lot of overpromise on the timelines and the end product.

When the company grows you hire a lot of folks from outside and you'll see the culture changing. For all its faults, I used to like working at Slalom in my initial couple of years. Then our team grew and we had a lot of new leadership who cared more about their growth and the money they can bring.

What got you There won't get you Here. Slalom is not hierarchical, it's more family where you need to trust, be respectful, and lead with empathy.

I was apprehensive about starting a new role during this time but the team at Slalom made me feel incredibly welcome and connected despite everything being remote.

Their approach to recruitment, sales, strategy, technology and transformation are all extremely ahead of the curve and you can tell immediately that the business hires for the right values first and foremost. 

Their commercial maturity is apparent with their growth over the past 20 years (through some difficult times including the dot com bubble burst, the GFC and now COVID-19) and they continue to be committed to that growth plan and to their people.",Their parental leave policy is not quite as good as others in the tech industry in Australia and their appetite for purchasing recruitment tools (i.e. LinkedIn) isn't as positive as I thought it would be.

671,Slalom,"Great place to work, great people, very supportive",2020-03-04,5.0,Solutions Architect,"Freedom to explore new technology and get involved in a seemingly endless amount of internal projects. Great support around creativity and exploring new technology and client offerings. Easy to get involved in multiple places of the business. The local market was happy to have people lean into whatever they held an interest in. 
Extremely people focus, they want you to have a life, they only ask for reasonable time commitments and they support you with everyone in the practice. They see their employees as individuals and they embrace diversity, i never felt like i was a resource to be utilized while working at slalom. Caring, thoughtful leadership, especially in middle management. My two managers over my tenure were exceptional and stuck their neck out for me time and time again. I will always respect and admire this companies commitment to their people and focus on inclusion.","Some client work became a bit repetitive or not very interesting. Always the chance you get stuck on a long engagement that you don't have a substantial interest in, however you could always keep your sanity with internal work that could fit your interest better. This is more an issue with consulting as a whole and not so much a slalom issue. 
Benefits are not as great as many other consultancies"
672,Slalom,Great place for product managers,2020-03-03,5.0,Solutions Consultant,"I started out in the analyst program, and work in the technology enablement practice. Since I have not been in the consulting industry before, I can't really provide any comparisons other than it isn't our job to find ourselves engagements and projects. Slalom is not cutthroat -- they are a supportive environment where you can truly do whatever you want to accomplish. I love my coworkers and I feel so lucky to be able to be supported here, especially as a woman in technology. I've made a ton of friends through Slalom. If you want to work in product management, this is the best place to do it. Same pay, varied projects, tons of growth opportunities, a stable environment, and wonderful culture and coworkers. This is the first place I've ever seen myself working over 4 years at -- and coming from industry, that's a very, very good sign.","Hire more women in technology! Provide more for your employees. Travel without a car is rough, and we shouldn't have to front the cost to do our jobs."

675,Slalom,Meh,2020-02-20,1.0,Solutions Specialist,Keeping it local and not traveling every week.,They decide your performance based on 1-2 persons at the client side who are the main buyers; and not based on what work you have actually done and the results. The constant need to network with everyone to help you get billable is frustrating! Not a good place for introverts.

679,Slalom,Nasty alt-right corporate culture,2020-02-10,1.0,Consultant,Good social atmosphere and great parties.,"If you ever wondered what an alt-right corporate culture feels like, you will find it at Slalom DC. They talk a big talk about diversity because it's necessary to attract talent  in a  tight job market.  But the reality is that if you are a minority, the odds are your mission is to staff undesirable positions just to help management meet their financial  targets.  If you don't mind a job with no real growth, or if you are in it for the short haul,  go for Slalom DC.  But if you are counting on real long-term growth, take a shortcut and look elsewhere.  To reiterate what other reviewers have written about Slalom DC, this is a staffing agency masquerading as a consulting company.  Limited opportunities exist but not for minorities. Another common complaint I hear from employees is the bull job interviews where they promise you  quality work. Once you join, you will soon discover that Slalom DC goes after crumbs and contracts other vendors turn down."

684,Slalom,Great Place to Work,2020-01-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Local model with global reach is not just a tag line here. This is one of the only companies that executes well on the ‘local model’ because it fosters cross-market collaboration while allowing each consultant to truly own their work. We work on tech forward projects at small businesses and some the biggest companies in the world. And the roles are not small pieces but integral parts of very large programs.,If you like low expectations or to be guided through your career this is not the place for you.

Overall great hiring experience.,"- Meeting room is extremely LIMITED. To make the situation worse,  the VP/president's secretary constantly overrides booking calendar and kicks people out for their ""important"" meetings.

Three years seemed like the right time since it marked the longest job in my career, but I knew the true test for me was whether I could pass that point and still be happy. Then five years hit, and I have not only exceeded the time I spent at any other company, all my expectations around what I could achieve at Slalom have been blown out of the water. If you are looking for a company that truly cares about growing its people, and you want to surrounded by the smartest people you’ll ever work with, Slalom is the place for you.","The biggest challenge I’ve faced at Slalom is navigating internal politics. It is true however that if you should up humble, curious, and authentic, you will go far.

-PTO time is generous","-Pay is okay...and very inconsistent. There aren't pay bands so it is very possible that someone below you may make the same amount or more than you.

They have nice offices and are continuing to grow. The interview process is really one of the best processes I had and everyone so far has been just as kind and helpful as day one.,Snacks and drinks are so popular they aren't always well stocked! Not the worst thing in the world. Really have to negotiate a fair salary but they will budge after presenting an offer. It is slightly offensive that you can be told a number during the interview process then be offered a number 10-20k less than discussed.

I had an initial chat with Ria who was really easy to talk to and really friendly, we ended up chatting for about half an hour and agreed to come in for a face to face.

I had two interviews, both blurred the lines of a technical/cultural interview. The culture at Slalom is amazing, it's the best I've seen when researching companies and since starting I can say that they definitely live by what the say.

I had a my interviews within a couple of weeks of each other and had the offer the day after my final interview. Things move very fast, I was also talking to other consultancy companies and some hadn't even sorted out my first interview by the time that I'd accepted the Slalom offer.","I'm only a few weeks into starting at Slalom but everything so far has been incredible (even to the point of being taken out on work events before I started!)

If you're not a rockstar or not ok with being in the boys club, do not bother.  Lots of talk about culture, but its only at low level, not with leadership... at that level, its just about a marketing firm and money machine selling consultant services and resources. Aka Cult-ure.  (URE = U R expendable).  And JT, I'm sure you'll reply to this... you could always answer emails, too."

Slalom has a great environment that promotes inclusion and diversity, multicultural, transparent and honest.
They honor all the benefits offered from the beginning,  they are good with different family scenarios, such as time off for the birth of a child.
Slalom always is trying to keep the team integrated with quarterly events and activities for the entire office or each department, they also do a yearly event where you get to bring your husband/wife to also enjoy the fun and meet your coworkers and their families.",I do not have any bad experience at this time.

-Great culture building events and diversity initiatives
-Smart, talented, and funny co-workers and collaborative environment","-Promotion and career development process is vague and frustrating. The vast majority of people who manage to receive a promotion will tell you the process was excruciating. Middle managers need training in effectively guiding their direct reports through the promotion process.

-I was extremely impressed with our CEO, Executive leaders in Seattle, as well as my local executive team in Denver. However, my particular practice area was led by a PAL that consistently belittled and humiliated her direct reports. Her power hungry, people pleasing, micro-managing behavior created a toxic environment. The only condolence was that the vast majority of consultants on our team felt the same way and we could support each other through her harsh treatment. I want to emphasize that I am referring to one specific PAL, and I do believe that other PALs were very good at people management and well liked by their direct reports."
731,Slalom,My experience so far.,2019-09-17,5.0,Consultant,"Friendly Environment

Slalom Overview / history",Tons of information for the first day
732,Slalom,Great Foundations,2019-09-15,5.0,Client Service Lead,"This organization has one of the best value systems of any company I've come across. They truly value their people, and do as much as they can for a professional services company to support them, make them happy, and give them a place to grow their careers.  Don't like you commute? Don't like your project or role? Okay, we'll help you find one that's a better fit. What would work better for you?  I've been amazed at the focus and quality of the conversations around people and culture within the leadership team. 

Similar to Southwest Airlines, by focusing on their employees, Slalom trusts that their clients will be well taken care of, and that financial results will take care of themselves.  This is a huge asset for the company, as they have a deep sense of what matters to their employees and clients.","The autonomy afforded each office is great for many reasons, but it also comes with some downsides - namely that the wheel often gets recreated between offices, and you may be finding yourself asking ""Where have we addressed this challenge elsewhere in the business?""  It is a wonderful feeling to have autonomy and authority to build the business as you see fit, but with the scale that Slalom has, it'd be nice if some corporate functions were invested in a bit more."
733,Slalom,Striving for Big 4 structure with lots of college grad employees,2019-09-15,3.0,Management Consultant,"Lavish events, yearly retreat hosted by company, various project accounts, food at office","Tenured employees have been leaving, big boys club, takes a long time to get promoted,  raises are MINIMAL, they are only looking at making money and don't care about holding on to old employees, they are staff aug  in Delivery Leadership,  very cliquey, DONT GO here if you're established in your career/experience, it's great for college grads like ACCENTURE.

735,Slalom,Not what was advertised,2019-09-10,1.0,Consultant,"- Majority of people are friendly 
- A good culture
- The snacks are top notch
- Work/life balance (but because the work is not challenging at all)","The work is absolutely boring. Majority of the projects revolve around project/program management - so if you really want to dive deep into an industry and try to learn/understand nuances to it, the projects here won't allow it. Forget about any actual ""strategy"" projects that challenge you. The worst part is I was sold a different bill of goods - projects that are challenging, exciting, and trans-formative. Considering how much I've learned at my previous stops in my professional life, it's sad to say I have learned absolutely nothing of value at Slalom. Even when you try to engage those folks who are considered ""experts"" in an industry, you quickly realize the expertise is surface level - when you try to go a deeper level, it goes over their heads. Slalom is good at making you feel great upfront when you start, but you will quickly realize meaningful work is hard to come by. Also, don't expect leadership to provide any guidance - they seem pretty clueless on what's going on and always make false assurances."

Focused on client delivery so not too many internal meetings / processes.
Progressive, supportive and collaborative culture.
Exciting to be part of a growing market.
Fun people.","Still evolving the UK market so relatively unknown in the UK.
Can be a bit immature as a company, e.g. roles / career paths still being defined.

740,Slalom,"Highly overrated, don't buy the hype",2019-08-28,1.0,Consultant,"Free snacks and coffee, nice office, decent work/life balance","Lack of long-term projects, lack of innovative work in general, lack of transparency on project pipeline and available roles, low quality managers, sales trying to sell project work without understanding what they are selling or what the client's needs are, quality of consultants and work diluted by new analyst program. Regional programs mean that people are actually traveling more often, which goes against one of the main reasons that people join the company in the first place. Company is basically becoming a smaller version of any of the larger IT outsourcing vendors including the high degree of turnover, but without the ability to compete on a cost basis due to not having offshore teams, and without offering pay/comp/benefits/bonuses/PTO that is competitive with those firms."
741,Slalom,Great place to work!,2019-08-27,5.0,Consultant,"Coming from a Big 4 consulting firm, Slalom has been a breath of fresh fair.

744,Slalom,Everything that I was promised during the recruitment process,2019-08-23,5.0,Client Service Partner,Been with Slalom for a couple of months. The onboarding process was excellent. Super impressed with the focus that the leadership team places on getting the culture right for our people and clients. Really exciting to be part of what is effectively a start-up with the backing of 7000 global colleagues. Lots of scope for personal development and to shape the business. Work-life balance is fantastic and much appreciated after many years on the road.,None really. The pace is super fast. We don't have every detail nailed yet but that just means being prepared to roll your sleeves up to tackle something new every day.
745,Slalom,"Wonderful Culture, Collaborative Workplace",2019-08-22,5.0,Intern,"- Welcoming Environment: Everyone is smiling and willing to talk/lend a hand
- Real, meaningful work is given to interns. No hypotheticals, simulations, or busy work","- Very informal: open work space, no assigned spaces, tends to be loud and busy/crowded some days. Can be a pro, depending on the day and your preferences."
746,Slalom,Flexible work life while working with cutting edge technologies,2019-08-22,5.0,Consultant,"I really enjoy working at Slalom. I love that I am not stuck traveling weekly anymore, but still am able to work with the newest cloud technologies. I feel like Slalom doesn't cheap out on their employees, the company hosts a lot of events (happy hours/team events) which always have continuous free food and drinks. Little things like this mean a lot to me. When we have more formal events like State of the Office or Quarterly events, you can tell that the they actually take time to organize and make these enjoyable events, rather than just scrape up some things to talk about with last minute preparation.

In addition to all of the above, I also am a fan of Slalom's annual retreat. It is a unique perk to have a weekend getaway covered for yourself and your significant other - with the rest of the office. A cool way to get to know your colleagues, who really end up becoming your friends.

Culture is also a great part about Slalom. If you come from a larger consulting company, you will likely experience some culture shock when you're no longer treated as just a number. Instead, you'll find snacks/drinks in the office and people shooting each other with nerf guns.

Finally, given the company is still growing so quickly, I feel there is a lot of potential for career growth.","There aren't many to be honest. Our current 401k match is 50% of contributions, up to 6% of your salary in total. Although this is pretty decent as it is, I think it would make Slalom and even more unique and desirable place if this was an even more competitive benefit."
747,Slalom,Really take care of employees,2019-08-19,5.0,Business Intelligence Analyst,Managers really look out for the employees,No cons that I can think of

749,Slalom,There’s something for everyone in Phoenix,2019-08-07,5.0,Consultant,"First and foremost, an amazing culture with people who genuinely care. Slalom provides the platform to develop the culture, experience, and career that you want. It’s not prescriptive, so you’ll need to take action and be accountable for what you want to do at Slalom.

Within the Slalom office in Scottsdale you’ll find talented individuals across the multiple practices within the Phoenix office. What makes this group stand out is their commitment and drive to do better each day for their clients and each other. The people I’ve encountered here are amazing, and a pleasure to be around, or have a drink with.

I’ve been a part of the Salesforce team here in Scottsdale for a little while now, and I can say that my teammates are some of the most talented architects and engineers that I’ve worked with. I’ve been on site with clients who love us, they are excited to share in the project, and they introduce challenges that have been fun to solve. I enjoy the team dynamics where we are all helping each other, and each of us has a unique background.",We are working on getting markets more aligned together to share assets and not re-create the wheel. It’s a work in progress and shows that it is something people deeply care about.
750,Slalom,Best Places to work,2019-08-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The projects are very interesting. The management is supportive.,Sometimes short duration projects put us down. Not bad though.
751,Slalom,I've Never *Loved* My Job Until I Came Here,2019-08-01,4.0,Consultant,"The people. The opportunities. The experiences. The culture. 

From the moment I walked in the door three years ago, I've felt like Slalom offered me more than a job; it offered me a new way of seeing myself and a chance to build and shape my future. And, in my role and my level, that's not something I expected to find at this stage of the game.

I love the people. People are at the centre of what we do here, and we're so lucky that our TA team works hard to find the right people.

Every day here I am challenged in the right way, I'm touching so many different things and working with so many different people. It always feels like no two days are alike. 

Slalom has offered me personal and professional growth by virtue of the work that I do every day and because of how fast we've grown in Toronto and, now, Canada. There have been opportunities for me to step up and work directly with leadership on a number of initiatives that have had a positive impact on our team across the board. 

If you're seeking opportunity to grow yourself, your team, your capability, an initiative, whatever it may be, there is space for that here. But you *do* have to drive that on your own sometimes. If you want a place that will hand you something for nothing, Slalom isn't for you. That being said, if you're passionate about it? Do you want to make it happen? Does it *mean* something to you? Then you will find the support here to do it, if you show that you're willing to be accountable and drive it. And I love that. It's that attitude of ownership and accountability that means there's no end to what you can do here. 

Not to mention the fact that there's no shortage of fun events that run the gamut from mid-morning stretch sessions at the office to weekend long company retreats (with only fun stuff!!), Hackathons with an opportunity to travel to our other offices, loads of snacks in the office, and a culture that makes you want to stay and hang out with your colleagues instead of racing out the door to be anywhere but work.","I think anywhere that has experienced such rapid growth is going to have some pain points. We went from being a scrappy-start-up-vibe to a big company with a real presence. Fast. I think there is some catching up to do from a leadership perspective to add some additional rigor to processes, to continue being more transparent around promotions etc. and being able to support growing teams from a people manager perspective (eg. really getting that ratio of people manager to independent contributors right so that PMs can really continue to focus on their people)."
752,Slalom,Great career move,2019-07-26,5.0,Consultant,"Working at Slalom is my first foray into consulting. I was a bit wary of the jump into consulting having only worked in internal roles in the past, but I'm quite glad I made the move. Everyone here is so sharp and easy to work with. The work can be intense and challenging at times, but not so much so that I feel at all burnt out.  You get to tackle difficult and interesting projects with a team of smart people from different professional backgrounds.

Pay and benefits are competitive, and there's some great perks like catered breakfast on Fridays and a fancy weekend away in the summer. I got a pretty generous number of vacation days to start, which is great (and I think much better than the supposedly ""unlimited"" vacation days many tech companies offer).

I've probably learned more in the first 4 months here than I did in the last 2 years at my last job. Overall, coming to Slalom was a great career move for me.","Health benefits are expensive compared to previous companies. HMO is not available in Massachusetts so I need to buy more expensive PPO. Compensation is good overall though.

Working on site at clients all the team means I don't get a lot of face time with my manager and members of my team, but Slalom puts on lots of events for the office and each team to get together occasionally. You do get tight with your project team though.

Hours can sometimes be long and you might need to put in some time over weekends from time to time, but I there's not a super intense workaholic culture here. There are periods if intensity, but most of the time things are fairly flexible. You get a good number of PTO days each year and you are actually encouraged to take time off. This is not an extremely low-stress job, but it probably won't burn you out either."
753,Slalom,Not all that it's cracked up to be..,2019-07-25,3.0,Analyst,"-The Downtown Seattle office is conveniently accessible for most commuters.
-Stocked break rooms (snacks and beer).
-Fun work events.
-Occasional free lunch.","-Processes and systems are constantly changing due to inefficiencies and constant trouble shooting.
-Management are unwilling to consider 'outside of the box' thinking or suggestions with regard to inefficient/manual processes. 
-Career advancement/promotions are unlikely unless you kiss up to management by taking work home/take on additional projects.
-Work-life balance is not promoted, as most supervisors will encourage team to take laptops home and plug-in.
-Lack of diversity. I believe HR's definition of diversity is geared at hiring women first and foremost, rather than the inclusion of minorities and folks of the LGBT community.
-HR will drag their feet with the hiring process due to delayed responses and are unwilling to negotiate salary upon hiring. 
-Lack of accountability seems to be a common theme among management and account/sales teams. Much blame and responsibility will fall on analysts and specialists when processes are not running smoothly."

755,Slalom,Career Autonomy,2019-07-23,5.0,Talent Management,I love being the driver of my own career and I have Slalom to thank for allowing me to pursue and explore my passions. There is a plethora or people to talk to about their roles and such genuine people I get to work with that care about you.,Compensation may not be adjusted with cost of living prices for Boston or perhaps simply on the lower average end.
756,Slalom,"Greedy, superficial, and clique-oriented",2019-07-19,2.0,Consultant,"great in-office perks (snacks, beer, drinks), lots of social events, fair market base pay and bonus","I joined Slalom just over 3 years ago when the Toronto office was still new and the organization was very entrepreneurial. Back then, the company felt like a dream - small family-style team, everyone got along and respected each other, leadership listened and made changes. Once Slalom Toronto broke even profit-wise about 1.5 years ago, however, the company took a sharp negative downturn and is only getting worse with each passing week. Recruiting took a nosedive and now hires virtually anyone with a pulse. Leadership is focused purely on sales to hit their numbers and get their big bonuses, and there is no longer any care about lower employees on the hierarchy. Promotion is entirely based on perceptions - if you suck up to the leadership and parrot their false smiles constantly, you get promoted regardless of merit. Conversely, delivery or technical excellence is no longer a concern. Projects have become chaotic, filled with poor-performing practitioners, and stacked with expensive leaders billing but not contributing.  Additionally, projects are no longer interesting - the focus has become to sell anything, rather than selling interesting and fulfilling pieces of work. The local consulting team is slowly getting phased out, with everyone focusing on selling developer (Build/XM) projects or augmenting their offerings. Finally, even the culture has hollowed out - Slalom Toronto no longer lives by the company's core values and just parrots meaningless platitudes around to each other in an echo chamber. 

My advice for those looking to join would be to understand if you're looking for fulfilling work and career progression, or if you're looking for a shallow superficial ""happy"" place to work. Slalom will not provide any meaningful fulfillment. Caveat Emptor."
757,Slalom,Great company with great culture,2019-07-18,5.0,Consultant,Projects are always interesting and I get to work surrounded by a great group of people.,Client sites are not always in ideal locations which ups the commute time.
758,Slalom,Not what it seems at Slalom's Arizona practice.,2019-07-17,1.0,Consultant,"Great office location in Scottsdale!
A lot of company activities, which is always good for culture and camaraderie.","- False claims during hiring process, i.e., practice size and experience level.

- Customer Experience (Salesforce) team is a brand new Salesforce practice in Slalom's Arizona Market. Unfortunately, they are not utilizing  resources, materials, or methodologies from the rest of Slalom's established Salesforce practices, which makes for an inconsistent brand message and a premature practice.

- Slalom's Arizona market is run more like a franchise model instead of sharing in Slalom's success.

- Many roles on a Salesforce project are filled by a PM with no Salesforce experience, who wants to ""try something new"".

- There is an extreme lack of accountability. One of the core principles is to be your ""Genuine Self"" but there is no hierarchy of accountability. If you have an issue with a coworkers style or handling of a client, its up to you to tell them no matter where you sit in the chain of command. Makes for a very uncomfortable situation that everyone avoids so crazy people, stay crazy.

- Expect to be very underutilized and bored but it makes for a great work to life balance!"

We receive soft skills training that goes far beyond the typical training through Lift and ILP. Our local training curriculum challenges us to consider our biases. We are coached by leaders who care about our personal development beyond just the numbers.,I lost all my status with the airlines and hotels since I am in Denver all the time.

767,Slalom,"Claims to be people centric, but is far from it",2019-07-02,2.0,Consultant,"Slalom NYC started as a pretty autonomous, flat organization with minimal politics. The place it was three years ago is very different from what it is now.","Focus on Sales has created a culture that is very ""sell or die."" This creates a discrepancy with Slalom's 'love your future' ethos and company values. Additionally, they don't support their people in the ways they claim. A team was bullied by a client for months on end. Similarly, a team was bullied by a leader for months on end, and the inaction was deafening. It wasn't until it was escalated to HR three times that something happened and that was after true retaliation occurred. They claim to be ""flat"" but treat people who are consultants as worker bees.  They don't find funds to support people's L&D asks. Someone should look into the NYC culture as they keep bleeding strong talent. Promotions continue to be very opaque.  People who are in the boys club get paid higher and promoted faster. It really hurts your brand equity to live these experiences and continue to see patterns re-emerge over and over again."
768,Slalom,Recruiting team and overall genuine nature,2019-07-01,4.0,Analyst,"During my process of interviewing and then joining Slalom I interacted with a recruiter multiple times.  He was genuine and very honest in his communications with me. Slalom people pride themselves on candor, authenticity, and people-first nature. The recruiter and most other's I have interacted with here are true to those qualities. It sold Slalom for me from the first phone call.","There were only a few downsides. I did have some struggles during my recruiting process as did a friend of mine, responsiveness. The communication at time was sparse but they did eventually get back to me after I emailed a few times. It's a busy time and Slalom is popular for a reason. This doesn't excuse the communication but it does explain it to an extent."

770,Slalom,A promise unfulfilled,2019-06-26,2.0,Solutions Architect,"Intentions to have great culture, lots of gatherings after work to maintain continuity, some interesting work depending on the project","Management makes too many decisions in a vacuum that have far-reaching impact.  Folks on-the-ground bringing in the coin are at the mercy of the Managing Director overseeing the project.  At-a-whim you can be ripped from a project with zero warning.  Horrible continuity when there is project turnover which leaves the people left behind at a severe disadvantage.  When projects go off-the-rails (happens way too often) the almighty dollar wins in nearly every case.  This is not the way to build/maintain a culture and values.

Oh, and you can kiss your bonus goodbye unless you are nearly 100% utilized that year-end payout will not be the nice surprise you expect."

783,Slalom,Choose your own adventure,2019-06-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slalom markets itself to candidates as a place where consultants can come to get off of the road and perform their work locally for clients. This model allows each office to develop its brand and culture independently, albeit with some guidance from HQ. The DC office is relatively new, ~3.5 years at the time of writing, which means that there is a lot of opportunity to make your imprint on how things get done and delivered. For people who like to ""drive"" work rather than ""consume"" work, it is a great place to be. In this regard, you have a great deal of agency to determine the challenges that you'd like to take on. Work life balance is excellent in general and especially good when compared to other consulting firms. The people in the DC office are cognizant of creating an inclusive and comfortable environment for all. There are many regular employee appreciation events held offsite (e.g. Quarterly meetings and an weekend-long Annual Retreat).  

Moving to Slalom from Big 4 was the best decision I've made in my career. Slalom has given me the space and opportunity to become a leader both in the office and in my field.","Like any company, Slalom is not perfect. A frequent complaint is that the office leadership team near homogeneous with former Booz Allen alumni. Additionally, Slalom's scale is smaller than some competitors, which makes it tricky to pursue large pieces of work.  It has also been a challenge to find consistent leaders below senior leadership in our office."
784,Slalom,Awesome Place to Work,2019-05-31,5.0,Software Engineer,"I’ve worked for Slalom Build (the engineering branch of Slalom) at first as an intern and later as an engineer. The number one reason I decide to join full-time after the internship was the management. They have complete mastery of the agile development cycle, so the project went smoothly. Additionally, I felt like they trusted me to get my work done--I was never micro-managed or nitpicked for long lunches or short days.
I get more PTO than I know what to do with and generally feel overly-rewarded for my performance. The hours are reasonably flexible and the environment is very inviting and casual.","My only complaint is probably more personal preference—I’d like a slightly more professional environment and to see more faces in the office before 9 o’clock. It’s pretty quiet in the morning. Additionally, because we’re located in the heart of the city, the commute can be a little rough."
785,Slalom,Great place to intern while in college,2019-05-29,5.0,Intern,I worked at Slalom during the summer as an intern. I was paired with three other students and a Slalom consulting team supervisor. My entire team was knowledgable and motivated. The supervisor was very attentive to our needs and offered one-on-one mentorship along with team advice. The Denver office is also a super nice location - easily accessible with lots of amenities.,The cons were not so much with Slalom themselves but the company we were working with.

- Mostly Staff Augmentation Roles
- An alarming amount of leadership does not have Technical or Interpersonal skills
- Not interested in selling?  You're most likely not going anywhere
- The people that do sell don't fully understand the delivery implications of what is being sold.  You better get familiar with these people, you will be reporting to them sooner or later.
- Leadership that is ""afraid to trust anyone"".  It's an actual quote that was said to me by a practice lead.
- Leadership overstep their bounds and try to tell you what to think on political/social issues.  Expect to get many emails about how to think about things outside of work
- Exaggerations about compensation, bonus %
- Very high conformist culture.  Not into drinking with your co-workers at least once a month?  Better get comfortable with your current title.

788,Slalom,Staffing Firm masquerading as a Consulting firm,2019-05-23,2.0,Consultant,"Simple dress (no suits), local only projects, smaller environment, decent location, low stress environment, and no micro-management","There are four major concerns 1) Non existent strategy for creating strategic value for clients, 2) No approach to teaching consulting skills, 3) Leadership does not accept discussion of ideas, and 4)  bias against minorities at the lead and leadership levels.   (1)  Slalom does not have a strategy for creating value for clients, the work they perform is more about augmentation or tackling low priority items for clients.  Slalom does not perform strategic or game changing work.  I have asked friends at large companies that know us and they say - ""we don't call you for the really hard / game changing stuff.  You guys just don't take ownership of the problem the same that the bigger firms do"" - in a down turn when you have to create real value for clients - this firm will not do well (2)  Consulting firms are powerful because they teach you how to solve problems in a structured manner, this is reinforced by the on-going review of your deliverables that you receive from your leads.   Slalom does not have on-boarding training, nor do they review your work to make sure that is high quality.  This might be because they don't feel that the work they are doing is important or because your leads don't have the training to provide that to you (hint: look at how many people in Slalom employees spent 5-8 years at larger firms - those are the ones with the proper training to provide feedback.  Slalom either has people with <3 years of experience or 8+, the lower people don't have the skills, and 8+ people are in leadership and never review projects)  (3) Every time I have created something powerful and game changing, it has come by having hard and passionate discussions about an issue, in effect - rethinking how to get things done.   Top leadership does now allow discussion here...the number of times I have seen leadership give anyone that questions an idea (in a medium that is setup for discussion) the death stare is amazing.  This stifles creativity, discussion and makes this an unwelcoming environment, (4)  There is a clear bias against minorities (of color) at the more senior and leadership levels.  The number of senior personnel that have been fired, asked to leave,  demoted or made to feel uncomfortable is impressive.  At the lower levels, there is definitely diversity - but if you go up the leadership ranks - the number of people that are of color shrinks dramatically.  The only way to survive is to keep quiet and spend your time supporting senior leadership.   If you are male, not white, and passionate then this is not the place for you.  You will receive smiles, warmth and then 12-18 months later you will be asked to leave or boxed out"

793,Slalom,"Former Seattle Cross-Market Engineer's Perspective: Depending on your goals, it can be a great place to work.",2019-05-12,4.0,Solutions Architect,"A little about me, so there's context around why I'm rating the pros/cons the way I am:

1. Currently, my long term goal is to move towards a SME (Subject Matter Expert) role. I'm not interested in marketing, sales, travel, etc. I want to stay technical and lead a team while a project manager or someone else deals with all that other stuff. I'm loving that I'm able to continue to mentor as long as it's at a technical level.

2. I'm an introvert that will look like an extrovert around my team, but will quickly escape large events (i.e. Fridays at Four Happy Hour, Town Halls, Quarterlies, etc).

3. I prioritize pay/benefits over annual company retreats, Christmas parties, BB-8 races, stocked snacks/drink fridges, etc. As long as I love the company/people I work with/my work, then I'm happy (and for the record, I did)! I don't need those extras because I suspect those costs will drain any extra money that could go to a salary instead.

PROS

1. Work/life balance.

This is a big one for many of us in consulting. Slalom has a fantastic work/life balance for the few years I was there. There was never a point where I had issues taking vacation, working from home (depending on the project/client), etc. I think there was about 2 weeks out of the whole few years I was there that I had to work over 40h because there was some emergency, but sometimes that happens. The key is that it was super rare and always met with recognition/gratitude (sometimes compensation in the form of a small spot bonus) if it was needed.

2. Project Work

This one is probably in the middle, but I'll put it here since my last project with them was awesome. I think there is a decent amount of stuff to choose from to work on that you'll be able to find something interesting. Your People Manager will work with you to get you on a project that makes sense for your goals and interests. A few of the projects were boring, but some of them can also be awesome. I won't really put this on Slalom because that's just consulting in general.

3. The People (Friendly-wise)

All the people at Slalom that I met were friendly. I made quite a few professional connections before I left and I'm sure I'll work with some of them again. Leadership is especially great at this (not a surprise). My People Manager was the best and truly enabled me to go after my promotions, professional goals, etc. I learned a lot while I was there, which was awesome.

4. Events/Parties/Hackathons

I think it's great that Slalom puts these on. Some of them are smaller and happen more often like game nights, pizza Fridays, and the like. Some of them are larger like annual company retreat, Christmas party, Hackathons, etc. Personally, I'd prefer to not go to these. I went to a few company retreats and one Christmas party (only because my significant other wanted to). It was nice, but I would've been happy just not going. However, I'm putting it in the positives column because it's something that's offered and I'm sure that those looking at Slalom as an option will be interested.","CONS

1. Promotions

In some cases, it's not very clear what it takes to get promoted. When I was working on getting promoted from Senior Engineer to Solution Architect, it wasn't very clear why I wasn't initially promoted. I went through a lot of painful red tape and found out part of it was because of budget and not my performance. There wasn't an available Solution Architect ""slot"", if you will. It was acknowledged that my performance was above average/on the high end and I would be fit for a Solution Architect role. I think that was the disturbing thing to me. I was at Solution Architect level in terms of merit, but simply not promoted. In any case, it took another 6 months for that to actually happen. I'm guessing because one of their SA's quit and a ""slot"" opened, but it's possible I'm mistaken. Maybe they're trying to move away from that mindset.

2. Career Progression

I couldn't see a path that I wanted to take after I was promoted to Solution Architect. The next step from there is Solution Principal and every single one of them I talked to were WAY less focused on the technical side of development and more on managing the client/team. I want to stay on the technical side, but their current structure doesn't seem to support a Subject Matter Expert or Technical Principal role. That's more what I want to do long term, but that's not currently an option at Slalom. Therefore, my choice was to progress into more of a manager doing WAY less development or quit. Unfortunately, I wasn't really given much of an option there. For now, a Solution Architect is as far as you're going to be able to get in Slalom without getting into the ""less technical"" space. Hopefully that will change in the future, because I'd love to come back in the years to come.

3. Compensation

This is the primary reason I left. Simply put, Slalom pays under market value in the Seattle market. When I can go from ~110k base salary (~120k with Slalom annual bonus) to ~140k base salary (~155k-160k), that's too much of a gap (which is approximately a 30-35% raise from where I was at working at Slalom). I brought this up numerous times to leadership (director level mostly), but I didn't get anywhere. I'm not upset since some of it may really out of their hands (at the director level). However, I hope they realize that it's costing them top engineers."

That has all changed. Now we basically just ask clients what they want and tell them how many people and weeks it will take to do what their asking. Pushing back and suggesting better approaches doesn’t happen often.

And senior leadership have basically become the thought police. Just today the CEO sent an email asking everyone not to use the term “hey guys” because it’s not gender neutral.

803,Slalom,Proceed with Caution,2019-05-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some really smart, great people that work at Slalom.  The offices are all mostly all updated, cool spaces with the typical downtown amenities (snacks, drinks, lounge areas, etc).  

Some of the projects Slalom does are interesting, forward-thinking and exciting in cutting edge areas of technology. The corporate executive teams are accessible for the most part and ask for feedback (if it’s actioned or not is a different story).  

Slalom has a separate business unit called Slalom Build which is essentially a super innovative development lab that employs some of the brightest minds around.","All Slalom offices have a local model and operate autonomously so you can’t compare satisfaction office to office.  Very few processes are streamlined or defined and as large of a company as Slalom is, there is very much a start-up vibe in a many of their offices.   
  
Slalom does a lot more staff augmentation work than they would lead on.  As a consultant it’s hit or miss if you get on a project that is what you want to do or are interested in.  Some of the perks for consultants (mileage/parking reimbursement) are sub-par compared to larger firms.

Utilization is super high so lots of times it’s hard for Slalom to take on new projects.  Sometimes projects that aren’t ‘interesting’ get ignored for projects that are deemed more ‘strategic.’  The majority of Slalom’s resources go to their larger clients.  There isn’t necessarily anything wrong with that but it makes it hard to grow the business as aggressively as they would like.   Another problem with high utilization is it makes it almost impossible to align the right resources to the right projects. 

There is a significant amount of professional ambiguity at Slalom.  Decisions are made in a vacuum and there is very little transparency between leadership and employees.  This leads to low morale in the office, among other problems.  Lots of times expectations are vague or non-existent and that can lead to a volatile work environment.  

Slalom is a very much consulting organization NOT a sales led organization.  The sales team has a very small seat at a very big table and little to no voice or support internally.  Slalom does millions of dollars of work without ever engaging the sales team.  Again, not necessarily a problem but Slalom has aggressive growth targets and you can’t preach growth without aligning resources and leadership that support sales.  

I agree with the reviewer who said “Slalom’s value proposition decreases dramatically over time.”

(There is a strong movement internally to have employees complete reviews which can skew ratings.)"

Starting with the recruitment part, it went very smoothly and the in house recruiters are so nice and kind, very helpful and prompt to help you. Interviews were so nice that they felt more like a chat, and what stood up to me was that they cared not only about how technically good you are,  but also how strong your soft skills are and how it's a match with their culture. On-boarding was also great! Slalom office has such a friendly vibe and they really designed their process to make us feel good with all the new info, that usually make newbies uncomfortable and overwhelmed. In a nutshell, they just not preach user/customer/employee experience, but they seem to really apply the principles they sell to clients internally, and this feel right and great, very consistent! Small details really count too, and I was delighted when I received a hand-written card alongside a book that translate their culture delivered to my house prior to start and also a warming email from my practice director, welcoming me and asking which size of screen I wanted for my work mac-book.

Leadership really wants you to focus on doing good work and delivering for your client (a/k/a “customer love” and “smile”) .

Since we don’t have the typical progression/promotion “up or out model,” people need to know what to work towards to continue growing and keep our edge.  People Managers aren’t completely looped in to how all this is supposed to happen and national resources are vague on this matter.  This is ironic to me, as we have people in our OE practice who would love to do this kind of work.  I appreciate the latitude offered by the firm in terms of professional development, but we need to better formalize and articulate where we should focus throughout the office."

Most coworkers seem pleasant","Almost walked out my second week on the job. The GM presents this as a family-friendly company, but I did not see that. My second week I sent an email to my people manager on Sunday saying I would be in late on Monday, giving the time that I would be there as 10:30. He acknowledged this, but the following morning I received at least three emails continually asking where I was and if I would be calling in to meetings. So I wasn't left alone during the time I said I would be unavailable. I spent $40 on a Lyft to make sure I got in on time and was publicly chastised for not seeing an email that was sent five minutes earlier while I was in transit. I later told him in a firm voice in front of people that if I say I am unavailable I am unavailable.  Instead of fixing the issue he ran to his manager. This would be consistent with his public crying saying that his biggest fear is letting down his family. I assume his parents as there are no kids. Weak. I revealed that I had health issues (these are on file as a disability with HR) and the behavior didn't happen again but the damage was done. I was especially bothered by the fact that he engaged in doublespeak and misrepresented the situation, never admitting fault for harassing me when I had given notice a day before. I was new to a project and not billable so this was micromanagement and harassment. I never trusted him again and he was bothered by the fact that I wouldn't be bullied.

My 1:1s were vague and he said he saw improvement. But yesterday I was going into the meeting room for our 1:1 and in walks the GM with HR on the line with a PIP. This was improper. As the lead and my people manager had put my position on LinkedIn within the past week, they knew this was coming and could have warned me. The client wanted me off the job. There were numerous complaints and I wasn't happy with the job or manager and was not going to have that hanging over my head so I resigned. 

I was not given leadership or guidance and had signed up for a mentorship program as I wasn't getting guidance from my absentee manager. I asked what kind of leadership training he had and he mentioned being pledge lead in a fraternity 10 years ago. How is that relevant? I had to reschedule a simple meeting numerous times over the course of two months just to do expenses. There was no training.

I don't know that the job would be the right fit for me under anyone, but I think with better leadership I might have been better, if not ideal."

If you are a technical consultant and are looking to grow here, this is NOT the place for you. Career growth is very challenging, a lot of staff augmentation/underwhelming projects, a lot of uncertainty as to what you will end up doing, projects are driven by Slalom’s ability to make $$ on your skillsets as much as they can. If you are into sales or tech management, this may be okay. 

Don’t believe on those stellar reviews - there is a very strong movement internally for employees to post good reviews based on a false company-depicted image of success in the rankings of one of “best places to work for”. The reality internally is not what it looks like on the outside. Keep it real, save your career from the fall, and seek employment elsewhere!"
827,Slalom,"Not perfect, but very close and striving to get there",2019-04-07,5.0,Principal Consultant,"Worked at Slalom for well over a year, on divers type of engagements with different clients. Here are the strengths:
1. Culture: Senior management is working hard at fostering a great culture of collaboration. support and inclusiveness ... in an agile kind of way (i.e. you are entrusted to figure out the right solution and Managing Directors are available to help/unblock you)
2. Client list: While the UK branch is fairly recent, the client list is really starting to be very impressive and exciting to work for!
3. Workplace: The office is right by the Borough Market, has just been fully refurbished, with floor to ceiling windows facing the Thames river ... it is a very conducive, practical  and stimulating workplace. 
4. Colleagues: The caliber of people hired is really impressive. In all my time there, and even while working with US market folks, I've always been proud of my colleagues ... never been disappointed!","Now of course, the place isn't perfect or without areas for improvement. 
But the list is both short, and the attitude is to tackle those issues head-on versus burying them.
1.  Salary: Was told during the hiring process that salary negotiation wasn't limited to once a year, but when I introduced the subject, my MD told me that we could discuss it during our annual review. I also witnessed a colleague negotiating substantially higher day rate with a client during engagement renewal for which our management refused to translate into a salary increase to that employee when asked for. Though, in all fairness, salaries seem to be in-part with the medium range of the market.
2. Fast growth: While not a con intrinsically, it can lead to culture dilution and turning the place into another ""Big 4"" grinder which is more focus on milking accounts then repeat client due to amazing work being done or because we are pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved."
828,Slalom,White Male Need Not Apply,2019-04-03,1.0,Consultant,So of the employees that have been at slalom for the 'good 'ol days' (that haven't left yet) are some of the best in the business.,"If you are a white male you are pretty much screwed. We like to have 'road shows' where we fly in the executives and they will brag that we only exclusively interviewed women or minorities for a General Manager role. 

Or more recently the CEO had an entire slide that outlined the Dallas office was under performing due to us not having a perfect 50-50 split on women to male ratio.

I work in a technology field - unfortunately Texas colleges do not graduate a 50-50 split in technology field. University of Texas has around a 15% women population in Computer Science.

 If we need to hire a 50 -50 split that means we are not looking for the best candidate (regardless of sex, religion, race). We are just trying to be an identity politics company.  If I was a women I would be questioning if I actually got hired for my skill set or if they were just trying to hit a quote. 

Here is a crazy idea - lets hire the best and the brightest and not look at their physical appearance as a hiring factor."
829,Slalom,Great Company - except when it comes to Agile,2019-04-01,1.0,Consultant,"They are generous in many ways and stingy in others. Their PTO policy is an example of stingy while on the generous side they will pay for you and your partner to go to an annual weekend company retreat. Overall though, more generous than stingy.",They are immature in the realm of Agile and agile adoption. The other areas of the business I can't really comment as that is not so much my expertise and from where I stood it looked like they are doing a good job. But at agile - meh. They have a long ways to go to catch up to their competitors in the field.

My manager really cares about my growth and what I’m interested in working on. They check in often to make sure our current project is working for me and that I’m happy. It’s safe for me to speak up if I’m not happy because my manager works with me as my advocate to support me and my career goals. Together we are able to find solutions either on my current project or an exit strategy to transition to a better fitting project.,"It’s a minor con, but because we are growing, when we hire new folks, often times they are sent to the client site in the first or second day on the job. It can be challenging for them to get a feel for our culture and company if they aren’t at least spending some time at our HQ in the beginning. Of course other Slalom folks at the clients site spend lots of time with new folks helping them get their bearings but I’ve heard many new folks say they feel more like they work for the client in the beginning before they have a chance to attend our trainings and quarterlies.

There is a lot that Slalom can do better, but I have never worked for a company that aspires to do so great... and I appreciate that. I find most of the leadership team to be refreshing, fun and skilled. The consultants I work with are a pleasure. 

The work is mixed, as with most consulting. Some is strategic to the client and some is strategic to Slalom. I have found that they work hard to put people on projects that align to their strengths and will at times ask you to stretch a bit. I appreciate that. 

The amount of new clients is incredible. In listening to the updates, it often sounds like we are in most local major companies. The types of work that is being sold excites most and many just hope to be apart of those opportunities.","As with most companies, I have found, you have to contribute to the companies betterment. It is expected. I don’t find this to be a negative, but it is something to note. If you are one who desires to put in your 40 and go home, you might not rise as high as others to choose to do more.

They promise they are different on how they treat employees and how clients are brought in and serviced,  this is consistently communicated to gain employees and clients with a trusted message.   After a short period employees realize that they are only valuable if they can be placed at a very low rate, and even though they promise they do not layoff employees, they do just that at every level if you won't be relegated to role that is beneath you that suits their low cost model.  For clients, they get in the door with being different, but in fact they want to provide the lowest rate and once you are in the door their goal is then to bring as many people as possible to the engagement.  They consistently change employees experience when presenting to a client, and this has horrible end results for the success of each project.  The model is based on a few people on top, promising a great environment through company sessions, but in fact they are behind the scenes running a current day sweat shop where everyone is fooled.  The very best people they have to offer consistently leave on their own when they realize this environment, and also understand that if you aren't in the inner circle, you wont work or be around long."

If your leader is good, you will get some mentoring that may advance your career.","Good leaders are very few and far between. If you are not selling work, there is no meaningful advancement. The novelty of social engagement wears down, and you become an outsider to your org, office, and practice group. 

You may realize, too late, that you wasted your time in your billable title, while doing the real leadership work that keeps people together and going strong. Be prepared to be let down by a failed recognition system that values people who can brag the most effectively. Eventually, you leave, disappointed in Slalom for not seeing your value and accomplishments. You leave disappointed in yourself for being fooled by a false corporate culture. 

You will leave and see Slalom for the machine that it is; it takes talented people and makes them sales people, or marginalized experts, while chasing the elusive 50% margin to make the highest leaders extremely rich for doing nothing more than standing up a pyramid scheme."

There is no ""up or out"" model - you are encouraged to grow your depth and breadth of skills, but you won't get pushed out if you just want to be a ""consultant"" rather than climb the ladder.","Compensation varies by market (of course) but in this location, doesn't seem to have caught up to average market rates. Benefits are improving year-by-year, but could be better. 

There are a LOT of work-related committees and events, both during and after business hours. To really stand out consistently, and get ahead, it seems as though you need to be involved in multiple internal efforts and show up to most of the events. 

This is fine for extroverts, people who enjoy being extremely active, or those without families, but for others, it's difficult to find the time and energy.

Understanding what consulting as opposed to contracting is, is one of the keys to understand if this is something you would enjoy."
887,Slalom,Love Your Future,2018-12-05,5.0,Analyst,"Work at Slalom if you want a fun, positive, happy, scrappy, and entrepreneurial workplace culture. Growth opportunities abound, the company's local consulting model is hugely impactful, and the culture is high-energy and incredibly open. People really do live the core values - including ""smile"" and ""celebrate authenticity"". We deliver incredibly inspiring and thoughtful work to our clients every day and get to form impactful relationships in our communities.",The local model makes collaboration across markets challenging at times because the incentive structures are also local.
888,Slalom,Frat-boy culture: un-enjoyable experience if you are not a socialite,2018-12-05,1.0,Senior Consultant,"I liked the PAD (director) level leadership, they were intelligent and seemed to genuinely care about their consultants.  The analyst program is also great, they show a lot of enthusiasm and really embrace the culture.  PAL level was a different story.
The Local model is a great change of pace if you’re a long-time consultant, and a key reason I joined.  The local lifestyle for a consultant is family-friendly, and is great when you want to come home.
Slalom is great if you have an out-going personality, love to drink, party, and mingle.  I’m sure a lot of people would find great joy in it, after all a successful consultant should be out-going and social.","I waited a year or so after I left to finish this review, as my outlook may have been skewed at that time...But being in consulting for long enough I'm now positive that Slalom is not the right place for more reserved consultants - who can be very successful elsewhere.  Its also not the right place if you are not hyper-competitive against your own co-workers.  I tried, but had a difficult time making close-enough friends here, and this could have been my fundamental flaw.  The friends I did make ended up being from the client and not from Slalom.  I would suggest new joiners to really “bro out” with leadership, especially at the PAL level as this is where there can be egos…If you’re cool and really liked, you could get by with sub-par performance just because you make everyone happy.  Hardcore developer types are always needed, so if you’re a pure coder and developer, you’re still valued as you’re churning the machine.
I myself became miserable because it felt I needed to succeed in a popularity contest.  A few female co-workers of mine also professed that they were frowned upon as ""not a culture fit"".  
The culture Slalom prides itself for is not for everyone.  The rating for being the #1 place to work for might be for the majority, as I see a lot of people having fun, but in complete honesty its a very Frat-boy like culture.  Girls have to look really good."

-Great office location in Palo Alto.
-Support for attending external conferences and training.","-Projects you are assigned don't always align with your career goals. You have to focus deliberately on building your brand and network.

898,Slalom,It's Just Consulting,2018-11-14,2.0,Consultant,"•Good coworkers
•Cool management team
•Fun off-sites","•Promotion unclear. Yes - I understand that slalom is ""unique"" - that everyone climbs the ranks at a different speed, and that they don't want to set time frames to get to SA, for example, as this would be an oversimplification. I agree with this in principle. What I don't agree with - is really the lack of understanding and communication regarding promotion. Others may not agree with me, but I don't agree with the ITP process. If Slalom is going to continue to be ""leaner"" than other consulting firms, continue to be more ""personable"" - I don't think this archaic form of promotion works, and can create a feeling of opacity and confusion in those that want to get promoted.
Additionally - it seems to me that the way that you really get promoted is by building partnerships with clients and selling more work - not really the delivery aspect. Which can be very disheartening for a consultant, in my perspective. You get rewarded and promoted for selling work (not saying this is bad), but it can be very hard to get recognition even if you are giving it your all and doing great work individually.
•Pay structure. I understand that a lot of companies do this - but when I was brought on to the position, they told me that I was at the ""maximum"" of the range for the consultant level - that there was no flexibility at all. However, as soon as you talk about potentially leaving - they promise to put you on a fast track to whatever the next level or pay grade may be. It just seemed like a lot of smoke and mirrors to me, and this lack of clarity made me not want to stay. Also, in general, pay seems to be lower than industry standards. This would be fine if you are working less hours than your consulting competitors - however - see my next point.
•Hours. Now I believe this depends on what practice you are in - but many, many people have to work the 50-60 hr weeks that contradict the ""45 hour max"" that Slalom swears by. Not a lot to comment on here regarding hours.
•""Interesting work"" - There's a promise that you will work on interesting work the majority of the time - that the team actually turns down work that seems too boring. This may be true, but you still see people working on work that they would not consider to be challenging or related to how they want to grow their career.
•Summary - At the end of the day - Slalom wants to be the golden consulting company that is different from the rest - but ends up being identical to its Big 4 competitors. I think the people are truly great that I worked with, but people/culture can only go so far when you are dealing with clients and are measured on how much work you can help sell."

Potential to work on interesting projects with Silicon Valley tech giants.,"Middle managers lack people skills.  Examples include being reprimanded for taking a sick day despite covering client work, not keeping confidential discussions anonymous, and general lack of support and sometimes hostility (raised voices and put-downs) when consultants turn to them for guidance.  If we cannot rely on our managers, where can we turn?  

Work-life balance is heavily dependent upon the project.  Poorly scoped or staffed projects appear to be the norm, but the concern is about  making that dollar, often at the expense of clients and consultants."
911,Slalom,"Building careers, culture and clients",2018-10-15,5.0,Client Partner,"After a dozen years consulting in the Big 4, I moved to Slalom to help build the Boston office.  Six years later I still feel it's the best career decision I've made.  Slalom allows me to focus on things I'm passionate about, not just what I need to do at my client.  I never feel I'm being told what to do, rather I'm being challenged to understand what I can do better and supported in that journey.
When I made the switch, I worried a smaller company would limit growth but have found even more career opportunities – especially if you embrace an entrepreneurial spirit.  While I no longer lead large off-shore teams, I am leading local teams of smart, multi-disciplinary consultants making massive impacts at clients.  And it feels better doing it the right way, with respect for the individual, their family commitments, and career aspirations.","Slalom does not have a single approach to career growth, which can be challenging for some.  For those who want to maximize their strengths and do more of what they love, it’s great.  For those who do better with a checklist to get to the next level, it can be frustrating.  Slalom is evolving in this space and providing more guidance than before. But it’s important to know career growth is still focused on the individual and guiding their passion versus a universal checklist of skills and activities."

We try very hard to take care of our people; as a leader, this is one of my core values, and feeling it supported by the company I work for is very important to me.

While we don't have the brand name of a Big 4, we do have enough cachet to pull in big, interesting work from both Fortune 500s and smaller, nimbler organizations. Sitting in leadership, I can say that ensuring that work is high impact and exciting is something we consider when we decide whether or not to accept an engagement.

Paternity/Maternity leave is also a mess. 1 week paternity isn't at all competitive in 2018, and the complexity and limitations of the maternity leave policy need some work as well.

938,Slalom,Slalom = staff aug + revolving door for college grads + forced culture,2018-08-12,3.0,Senior Consultant,"The consulting industry has been maturing for 100+ years; however, as private clients focus on optimizing business processes and rapidly building IT infrastructures, this historical consulting model is struggling at the fundamental level.  Specially, the Big4 and other large consulting firms have built models that are subject to inflating rates - especially in the government - where you see entry level people trying to bill out at a 3x multiple, e.g., $150/hr for a recent college grad.  These legacy consulting firms must keep pumping their multiples to offset the poor financial decisions being made by their aging executives, lack of billability at the mid-level, and the need for innovation to keep up with newer markets, like data science.  

This struggling model has paved the way for a new generation of consulting firms - enter Slalom - who are focused on providing lower rates, high output and adequate levels of technical skill.  This forces a business model that is focused on identifying talent that is: (1) willing to work/bill extra hours, (2) billing at the lowest possible rate, and (3) up to date on the current technologies and industry tries.  So, how does Slalom do this?  It's simple: they predominantly hire college grads and manufacture a superficial culture that speaks directly to that demographic to consistently energize them to do work and/or take the necessary trainings to be minimally effective on projects.  When you were interviewing with Slalom, did you notice how much time they spent showing off that wine fridge and keg while talking up the culture?  And, did you primarily see desks of busy-looking junior staff sitting around?","The initial problem with this model is that it only really works when everyone is billing out 100% of their time and when the firm is willing to sign up for ""any"" type of work in exchange for adding staff to projects.  This forces a flat organization within Slalom where there is some variance in rates and experience but minimal strategic work or opportunities for true career advancement.  This is unlike the Big4 model which creates the opportunity for staff to grow at the expense of their aging business model.  The side effect of this model at Slalom is that staff can oftentimes be aligned to projects that don't match their core skill set and, due to the flat nature of the organization, they will rarely have a manager/senior leader go to bat for them if they are unhappy with their project or drifting in their career.  

The only real way to get promoted and build a career is to find an entirely new client for Slalom and build an account from the ground up, which would provide Slalom with a new, ongoing revenue stream associated to you.  This is certainly not impossible - and several junior Slalomers have climbed that chain - but rest assured that it's a huge dice roll.  When you're spending 8 hours/day with a different client, doing staff aug work and then being asked to participate in seeming endless culture-building exercises for Slalom (happy hours), it becomes very difficult to gel into a true consulting role and proactively find new clients/work.

Because Slalom is comprised of younger staff who have yet to develop the full range of management and consulting experience, most of Slalom's projects involve day-to-day services, like developing Tableau reports, testing, documenting requirements, taking meeting notes, etc.  Did I mention testing?  Further, projects typically only grow when clients proactively ask for additional staff vs. Slalom pitching new strategic services (like what you'd see with the Big4).  Again, this is not a problem for Slalom because they are ok with staff leaving after a few years of their boring work because - in the next year - there will be new graduating college class with fresher technical skills who are ready to do technical work for 50-60 hours/week while only billing 40.

The biggest problem that I - and many other people - have with Slalom is that it's not honest to its employees about what the company actually is - at all stages of recruitment and employment.  They have armies of recruiters and a large social media presence to show future employees how much ""fun"" it is to work for the company.  They beg employees to submit surveys to get the firm on ""Top 100"" lists for consulting publications and to provide online feedback on social sites so that they can provide hard statistics to further recruit young talent.  But the benefit of using college grads/younger staff in this capacity is that they're new to their careers so they really don't have any baseline to compare their Slalom experience to.  So, they stay until they realize that having an in-office keg does not truly provide that career-ROI they are looking for.  Welcome to Slalom: the post college Frat."
939,Slalom,It really is different than anywhere I've worked,2018-08-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture comes from the top, and Slalom - unlike MANY other places I've worked - has leaders who aren't shy about leading and who are truly committed to growing their people, serving their community, and creating an environment that consultants actually WANT to work in.  The pay is competitive (but not outrageous...  you'll have to travel 24/7 and make many other compromises if that's your only goal).  The benefits are decent/good but getting better (recent 401K enhancements pleased me).  The office recognizes that, with few exceptions, we're experienced consultants and treats us as such (no stupid micromanagement from my boss or anyone else for that matter).  Slalom creates an environment that tends to bring out the best in people, and it shows.","One of Slalom's core values is ""celebrate authenticity"", but it's clear that the company favors a certain type of personality: Outgoing/extroverted; loquacious; community-service-focused; kind, gentle, and understanding in all circumstances; conflict-averse; diplomatic.  None of these things are necessarily objectionable, but that doesn't describe everyone (some people are introverted, some enjoy respectful conflict/disagreement as a constructive tool, etc.), and I worry that I (and others) sometimes lack the innate characteristics that are ""expected"" of a Slalomite.  But I've never felt unwelcome, just a little pressured to conform."

Our entrepreneurial culture is also infused with  one that focuses on our people and giving back to our community.  Given our growth and expansion of service offerings, there's the opportunity to work across & in collaboration with other practices.

Expectation: Direct your career to what you want to do 
Reality: The Chicago market is already quite limited to healthcare and pharma clients. Slalom is not big enough to have the option to pick and choose projects within these industries - they staff people on any project they can sell.

Expectation: The firm has a fun culture with lots of employee events. 
Reality: You can attend events here and there if you’re not tired from your commute or your client work eating up your life.  Chances are you won’t even make it to the Chicago office.

(vs flying out Monday and back Thursday which gives you Friday from home, caveat is that top consultants do work some weekends)

965,Slalom,Smart consultants paired with management that cares,2018-06-30,5.0,Consultant,"Slalom is purpose-driven and it shows. Management is invested in the personal and professional development of consultants here. I’ve been given so many opportunities to learn and grow while working at Slalom, from informal brown bag lunches with consultants from practices other than my own, to actual technology training and conference opportunities that were paid for by the company. 

Everyone from the market lead down to my people manager all seem to care about my well being. I know this isn’t the case in every market (see one of my negative reviews below) but in my market we are asked if a project is interesting to us before we are assigned. And we can say no! Demand for our services is such that consultants are allowed and encouraged to choose projects best suited to their interests/skill sets. And, of course, Slalom famously has its no unwanted travel policy, which is very real and much appreciated. 

Its also worth noting that clients seem to have a very high opinion of Slalom, which in turn helps me take pride in our product and our company. In consulting, reputation is everything and Slalom’s is rock solid. I’m not saying folks don’t make human errors or projects never go off the rails because of course they do, but on the whole I believe Slalom produces smart, compassionate and purposeful consultants who do right by the client and genuinely look out for each other. 

This is a good place to be.","No place is perfect, and neither is Slalom. My cons are twofold: 

1) The market-centric design creates a fragmented organization and the services delivery can vary greatly between markets, which will confound national or global clients that interact with more than just one Slalom market. As a consultant, the market-driven approach is my friend: it’s what ensures that I can sleep in my own bed every night instead of a Hyatt Place every Monday through Thursday. But it undercuts the strengths that come with being a large organization. It’s hard to leverage what teams in LA or Boston have done, for example, because there is poor infrastructure set up to surface our work to the entire organization. The company seems to recognize this and lately we’ve been getting more communication about breakthrough projects and case studies from around the Slalom network, but I think more could and should be done to create a ‘one Slalom’ culture. 

2) The firm’s rapid growth rate risks diluting its awesome workplace culture. They are recruiting so heavily from Accenture and Deloitte that I absolutely fear that we will become more like those forms and less like Slalom. I’ve seen practice leads from Accenture come in and run people like Accenture consultants which spells trouble to me, especially since Slalom prides itself at being different from its consulting peers. I generally suspect that growing larger will come at the cost of preserving the Slalom values that have propelled this firm to the forefront of professional services, but is like to be proven wrong."

967,Slalom,Red Flags,2018-06-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Pay/Benefits: benefits are good, though 401K could be better. Pay is alright. Could be better, but I think it’s fair. 
I don’t regret working here because I truly have learned a lot. However, it’s not all that it’s cracked up to be, and I’m currently looking for an exit.","I waited this long to post this review, even though I noticed red flags after red flags on my projects. That is because I gave Slalom the benefit of the doubt, blaming either the client or the nature of Consulting. But as of today, I am realizing that the underlying reason for my unhappiness is the fact that Slalom truly doesn’t live up to the promises it sells to candidates during recruiting as well as the “Slalom values” it heavily advertises to attract Big 4 applicants. 
- Work/life balance is the biggest myth. I work as many hours at Slalom as I did at multiple Big 4 firms prior to coming here, if not more. Most projects are Slalom are understaffed and the scope of the work is poorly estimated. Maybe the people in leadership have good work life balance. However as Consultants, you are a slave. And I’m not talking 40-50 hour work weeks; trust me, I’m no stranger to hard work. I’m talking consistent 60-70 hour work weeks, but allowed to charge only 40 hours, because God forbid, you get interrogated if you’re going over the allotted hours. I really wish I could share a screenshot of my entire team being online at 10pm. 
- PTO counts against chargeability. Which negatively impacts bonuses. In fact, if you are below a certain chargeability level, you get negative bonuses. Since Slalom advertises so heavily as a firm that cares about people’s well-being, I would like to point out this hypocrisy. Note that HR will try to either not mention this or straight up lie when asked, so be careful.
- People development: depends on luck. I’m lucky to have a great People Manager who *seems* to care about me. But I personally know people who have unfortunately been paired with leaders who only care about you if you’re part of the popular crowd. Which brings me to my next point. 
- Culture: very political. If you “piss off” the wrong person, your career and reputation here is done. If you suck up to the right person, you’ll get the necessary good feedbacks in Workday. If you are a white male with a salesperson attitude, you’ll fit in and get promoted quickly, regardless of your skill set."

988,Slalom,Consultant (Technology Enablement),2018-05-29,5.0,Consultant (Technology Enablement),"Slalom genuinely cares about its employees, and invests a lot of time and resources into the professional development of their people. Everyone I have worked with so far has been kind, hard-working, wicked smart, and relatively easy going. It's also a really fun work environment - there are plenty of outlets to get involved and spend time with your colleagues, whether through a book club, an intramural volleyball league, or a group volunteer opportunity. 

If you're coming from a consulting background and feel bogged down by constant travel, Slalom will be a breath of fresh air for you. Each Slalom local office only takes on local clients, which means their consultants do not need to travel. If remote work is more your style, you can apply to their delivery centers, where you work to fill gaps in local resources in other local offices. (My current project has consultants from Chicago and Seattle working remotely to fill in our development team.)

The company is also very supportive if you're interested in following a non-linear career path. Whichever direction you want to go, Slalom will help you grow. I love my job and am learning new things every day.","The cons are basically the cons of being a consultant anywhere: you're working at the client site, so that might entail some commuting. You're also usually being brought onto the project to tackle a particularly challenging problem, or because things aren't going well, so if you're not up for a challenge, this might not be the right place for you. (Personally, I find the projects challenging in an interesting and exciting way.)"
989,Slalom,Step outside your comfort zone,2018-05-25,5.0,Solutions Architect,Incredibly smart people with drive and passion.  Great office space with snacks/drinks.  Challenging client engagements with opportunities to learn and grow.  A safe space to be yourself with no pretense.  A company that truly cares about each and every person at every level.  Pretty good life balance that you can control.  Yearly offsite play weekend up in the mountains.  Everyone's voice matters and can affect change in the company.  Local market focus so you don't have to travel far.  True culture that is not just a tag-line on a brochure,Very few.  Perhaps a bit more control over which client engagements you are put on might be in order.
990,Slalom,Disrupt yourself,2018-05-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The opportunities to learn are plenty. The people at Slalom care about the place they work, the people they work with, and the community they work in. The leaders care and invest in your success. It's challenging in the best way possible. The feedback culture helps you make quick pivots and get better along the way.  I came to Slalom after being in another industry and was looking to disrupt myself, learn new things,  work with incredible people, and be challenged.

I am constantly challenged to push my skills in order to deliver more value to the client.   Slalom hires amazing, talented and generally fun to be around people.  We operate by a very 'entrepreneurial' mentality where whatever ideas we come up with can be presented to Leadership for possible inclusion.  Our executive leadership team is approachable, available and is constantly looking for areas of improvement and feedback.  This is very flat organization where you're encouraged to 'do what you love.'  If that means staying in a Consultant role it is completely fine.  
Overall I love working here because I feel empowered by my peers, encouraged to seek new areas of growth and surrounded by amazing people.","There can be times when you are staffed at a client to do work that doesn't align with your career path.  It's the balance of being billable vs doing the work you are passionate about.  Since it's a small office being on the bench waiting for the right role as opposed to any role is a fine balance.  
Also the benefits are lacking as compared to the bigger consulting firms.  The 401K match is not great but they are making improvements to it as we grow."
992,Slalom,Smart People with a Great Culture,2018-05-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some incredibly smart people in Slalom who know what they want and doing everything possible to make it happen.

Company culture is good, when you happen to be there.","As a software developer at least, it doesn't feel like you work for Slalom. It feels like you work for the client. I'm never really at the slalom buildings or events because it's quite difficult to be a part of 2 companies.

So if you get on a good client, great. If not, not so great. Opportunities are quite limited. If you are looking to join, make sure you ask what client you will be working with/for."

It's a company that really cares about it employees, which is baffling to me given its size.","Could be a little more inclusive on non-drinkers. Large drinking culture, which often excludes non-drinkers."
1002,Slalom,BEWARE,2018-05-10,1.0,,I got to meet a lot of smart people.,"You get placed with clients for the sake of it.  It is not a great place for women.  They will tell you over and over again that they want to help grow your career or find a client that is a good fit.  But when you are unhappy, you just need to deal with it.  Low pay compared to industry or other consulting firms.  401k is a joke.   You will find many people drinking the kool-aid but very few people who are actually happy at Slalom."
1003,Slalom,Lack of trust for leadership,2018-05-09,2.0,Solution Principal,"- The 'appearance of culture' make those of us that are out at clients feel good about the culture.  We experience this culture during our annual employee retreat which is a really nice perk.
- If you like your client that’s good because you’ll be there as long as the client will keep you.","- I don't trust leadership in Dallas.  Especially after hearing rumors of multiple high level executive departures, then confirming those rumors then seeing 5 reviews that give 5 stars all around the same time these departures were happening and being kept secret. Feels like management is padding the Glassdoor reviews while trying to hide the fact that Executive leadership is leaving.

- Culture is only felt by those in the office, I relate to the culture and client that I'm stuck at and have no hope to get out of.

- There is a small group of people that get the good projects and others are bounced around the remaining accounts."

Creativity can thrive in tiny niches as long as the engagement gives you cover.

But they can't keep teams together and they can't break the addiction of being a body shop to the local big companies, and they end up taking orders instead of genuinely being the trusted partners their local companies need."

- get to work in different industries and companies","Now, as far as I've heard about other branches, this feedback is strictly for the Palo Alto office.

Don't know where to start:
- Don't have competitive salaries
- Not many benefits (health, PTOs) as compared other consulting companies.
- Horrible PALs and Managers: push you to the brink of morale break-down and still keep beating you while you are down there.
- Worst work-life balance: (work is the only life that will be left)
- Managers/ Leaders don't know how to scope the work: probably need to get their foot in the door with the clients first that's why they show one of the lowest quotes in the market.
- I thought I was the only one who felt these drawbacks of working here, but there were others and had the same complains; couldn't do anything but keep quiet. More than 10 people left around the same time due to these complains.
- They probably say or show that they care about the feedback, but seriously management can't take any kind of scrutiny. So, if someone opens up by giving bad feedback, they are gone!
- Force employees to provide good feedback on Glassdoor. It is one of the items on the checklist for new-hires to complete in the first three months.
- Keep doing these small useless gatherings every quarter and put up a show how great their success is in terms of revenue, but lack serious human interaction and management skills (even though that's a major necessary skill)
- Treat old employees who have gotten them leads and business as if it was their duty and they were supposed to do that.

The list keeps going on, but I won't be reaping any benefits anymore with this feedback so I will end it here. This was all to warn who are seeking employment within this office."
1015,Slalom,A good fit for me,2018-04-18,5.0,Solutions Principal,"Honest and open leader tell it like it is, and don't hide facts.  One of the most transparent places I've worked in my 30-year career.

1019,Slalom,The BEST Culture and Company out there!,2018-04-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture is the best that I've experienced of any company I've worked for. Even leaders are not only willing but encourage everyone to speak up and to contribute, ask questions, and be involved-- no matter if you've been there for 2 weeks or 2 years. There's a real focus on keeping their culture and values as the priority and the open environment allows everyone to really collaborate and learn from each other. You always feel like a valued member of the team and work is actually 'fun' and bleeds into your personal life. Not micromanaged whatsoever!","Honestly can't think of any. If there are issues, you're encouraged to bring them up and management (even at an executive-level) actually listens and ACTS on it. You get answers."
1020,Slalom,I love working for Slalom UK because...,2018-04-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Slalom builds things. So you can confidently discuss say digitalising a process or customer experience and with a client that you can confidently say you can build or have access to people who can. 

- Work for some great clients who want to do cool things.

- Flat structure open culture which means you can always share your views with everyone regardless of rank - if you want to improve the office space, take an proposition to market, spitball solutions for clients, improve the hiring experience, improve the benefits....just SPEAK UP! Start a conversation with the person next to you, the MD’s and even the GM (who is probably sitting right next to you).

- People laugh a lot. It’s very refreshing to work in an environment where people are happy and like to laugh or make others laugh

- Playlists in the office - want to listen to music, share your favourite song with people to get them in the mood. Switch on your Bluetooth and hook up to the office speaker.

- Foodies - there is a good number of folks that love to share food experiences - being right next to Borough Market helps a lot and the Flat Iron /  Bankside / Bermondsey St. areas

- Office location is on London Bridge - perfect for FS clients, commuting into London Bridge, Borough Market.

- Growing at a fast pace - bring your energy and enthusiasm

- Access to advice and helpful materials from the network for 5000 consultants !!! I email, message or call someone in the network and they respond!!! They share insight, materials (that they can) quickly. This is sooooo helpful and refreshing - this can be a hassle or not even worth trying at the other large consulting organisations.","that said...

- getting kind of tight in the office - but we are expanding space soon!:)

- still nailing down performance process - but that’s a good thing - we want to get it right"
1021,Slalom,"Talented people, great culture and amazing potential",2018-04-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The things that have impressed me about the company are 1) the people and 2) the ability to learn from mistakes. I have found that everyone is kind, welcoming and all are just trying to do the right thing - there may be conflicts or differences of opinions, but everyone respects each other enough to  work through it. As well, we (as a business) have not always made the right decisions, but leadership has reflected, learned, pivoted and emerged in a better place than before.  

I will admit, the first few years were tough; it was hard to get our name out there, we weren't always getting the best work, we made some bad hires and lost some good people. But we got  through it and now things are so much better - we have incredible talent, interesting projects and the energy is buzzing - you really feel as though you are part of growing something that's going to be great.","There are growing pains as with any small company growing quickly. There are lots of senior leaders who are great at their craft, so it can be more challenging for those at the mid-level management level to find opportunities to step up / lead and move to that next level."
1022,Slalom,Don't believe the hype,2018-04-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Colleagues are amazing -- hardworking, smart, friendly, with really interesting backgrounds. Unlike my experience with previous consulting firms, people are more than willing to share knowledge and information; the environment isn't super competitive and there's no drive to  steamroll over others to get to a coveted promotion or leadership position. The organization is fairly flat. Lots of great perks to help you feel like you are truly part of the larger Slalom community.","For all of Slalom's magic, there are several drawbacks:

Little work/life balance/flexibility - Slalom will claim that their focus on work/life balance differentiates them from other consulting firms (w/ their focus on the local market = no travel for the consultant), but they make up for it by holding multiple company events EVERY WEEK. Supposedly most of it is ""optional"", but you quickly learn that this is simply untrue. People notice when you're missing from an event. There is absolutely no respect for your time.

Unfulfilling client work - This is another one of those exaggerated claims that Slalom likes to make. Consultants absolutely perform staff augmentation work! And like every consulting firm on the planet, as long it's making money for the firm, it doesn't really matter what you're doing. To be fair, not sure if this is a pervasive issue across all markets, or just the one I'm in.

Lack of diversity -- This is an interesting one. I don't mean lack of diverse racial backgrounds, ethnicities, etc. Almost every consultant is former Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, Booz, etc.  who attended a big name school and completed study abroad somewhere exotic. If you're not of a certain pedigree, be prepared to stick out like a sore thumb. 

Questionable ""leadership"" - some of the more senior-level consultants responsible for overseeing multiple projects clearly don't know what they are doing. Despite a seemingly fair and objective promotion process, I've wondered many times how some of these folks got to where they are.

Bottom line: don't be wooed by all the promises made during the interview process. Understand what you're getting into before you accept the offer. If you don't care much for a life outside of work, and enjoy the cache of being a ""consultant""and everything that entails while losing your identify in the process, then this is the place for you. If you value true diversity, work/life balance, working relationships built on mutual trust and respect (not the facade of it), keep looking!"

Life is different at Slalom. We are encouraged to think a lot more, to really understand the question before jumping to solutions. Selling becomes almost a ‘by-product’ of having interesting conversations with clients, instead of the sole reason the meeting was booked in the first place. Clients love that, and in return we sell more. If it sounds simple, is because it is - great people working together, without the politics or silos of the big-4, doing interesting work and building a career they want.",Slalom has only recently (last 3 years) started its expansion outside the US. It’s a great journey and the company needs to get better at servicing its new offices outside America.

Working for Slalom is a truly rewarding and fulfilling experience.","When I joined the 401K plan was not strong, but the leadership team is actively improving it to make it more competitive."

The career structure is flexible... you really can create your future.
The culture is relaxed yet professional.  The team make a big effort to make new joiners feel at home.
The business is growing fast... growth creates opportunities!",You need to know who you are and have confidence in your own ability. Slalom won’t define who you are for you.
1035,Slalom,"Great experience, great place to work",2018-03-20,5.0,Solutions Principal,"You have the ability to shape your future at Slalom. It's the best of the consulting world, in an environment that fosters growth and encourages curiosity. You'll find yourself teamed with high-performers in every area. There is tight focus from the top down on making Slalom the best place to work and grow, it comes in terms of inclusion policies, opportunities, team-building events, and financial compensation. It's fair, fun, and fabulous.","The projects you are assigned to can define your experience. If you're working remotely, you can feel disconnected.  This is one place where you really want to be in the office, feeding off the energy."
1036,Slalom,A great place to grow your skills!,2018-03-20,5.0,Consultant,"Slalom really does allow it's employees to define their own career path, take on opportunities outside of their comfort zone and continue to grow as a professional. I've received nothing but continuous support, guidance and mentorship throughout my time here as I actively identify (and voice) my goals and aspirations.","The benefits, while actively being enhanced, do need to continue moving towards a position that are in line with our competitors."

1039,Slalom,Great place to be!,2018-03-19,5.0,Consultant,"- It really is fun, entrepreneurial and inclusive - that's not just a tag line. 
- The hierarchy is flat, and everyone's encouraged to follow their passion - if you have an idea, you are free and supported to pursue it and make it happen. More over, the organisation aligns to make it happen fast. 
- Unlike other consultancies, work-life balance is considered very important and is protected which is a major plus.
- No unwanted travel policy.
-  Very little to no staff-augmentation work - we are working with exciting clients on exciting projects 
- It's a growing business and a very exciting place to be.  
One of the biggest positive surprises in my first weeks of joining was the fact that strategy discussion was in the open space and everyone was welcomed to participate in the discussion and shape the future of the company.",None that I can think of.
1040,Slalom,Consistently Delivering on Their Values,2018-03-19,5.0,Solution Owner,"The company follows through on their values. They're not just writing on a memo, but something engrained in the culture. Slalom hires talented people that match their core beliefs. It can sort of feel like everyone is gearing up to drink the kool-aid, but after you've been here for a while you feel like family.","London is growing, and there are a lot of new faces So if you're adverse to change or fast-paced growth, it might not be right for you."
1041,Slalom,"Great Company, Maybe a bit too scrapy, and not scrapy enough?",2018-03-17,4.0,Analytics Consultant,Amazing people with a great culture built. Managers are real people you can have conversations with.,"Some of management are wearing multiple hats which can stretch them thin and make checking in with the consultants on the ground rare. Yet, they are hesitant to let the consultants help with proposal work. Tech is very staff aug. You're sitting at the client site 5 days a week being directly managed by client management. Almost no interaction with Slalom outside of happy hours and quarterlies. Slalom has a bunch of events at the main office in Detroit but if you're a tech consultant, you're never going to be able to go to them, unfortunately."
1042,Slalom,"Great culture, people and work!",2018-03-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slalom is remarkable for hiring excellent people and doing outstanding work for their clients.  Even more remarkable is how hard the company works to keep their employees engaged, involved, educated and energized.  Slalom is also a model for inclusion and embracing diversity.","If you fit the culture, you will do very well.  If you don't fit the culture, it will soon be apparent and you will need to find another place where you might do better."
1043,Slalom,Fun place to work,2018-03-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"• Good brand

1044,Slalom,Visual Designer/Developer turned Consultant,2018-03-14,5.0,Consultant,"I came to Slalom from small digital marketing / web design firms, and there were many projects that got held up or that I knew weren't going to work because there was a bigger problem at the client's company, but it wasn't our job to fix that.  Here its been using design thinking and UX best practices to solve some big problems.  First of all companies come to Slalom with huge management and technology problems and different teams are always looking for designers to help out with bigger picture things, like dashboards, internal apps, ect. There are plenty of opportunities to make a difference. And everyone really just wants to do the right thing for the client.

It's a big company with offices all over the US but it's private and they reallllyy make an effort to put people first. There is always a fun event on the calendar. There are so many opportunities to learn new things.","We're growing quickly and we need a new office.
I wish more people (developers and designers) knew who we are."
1045,Slalom,Analyst,2018-03-13,5.0,Analyst,"The workplace culture is the best! Great people, meaningful work, good flexibility. Slalom’s values are at the core of everything we do. Our company values align with my personal values 100% and truly represent who we are.",There really aren’t any I can think of- if I had to choose something we are starting to grow out of office space but will be expanding soon.

1047,Slalom,A company driven by amazing employees who creat a great work environment & culture.,2018-03-13,5.0,Analyst,"I have recently started my career with Slalom Hartford, about 3 months, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. I came from the rigid banking industry where everything is regulated, and the technology and culture is antiquated at best. I still find myself in awe sometimes that I can work from virtually any computer anywhere and have access to all my files thanks to Office 365 and the cloud. It is one of the perks that no one talks too much about but would make it very hard to go back to a company that does not offer that.
It’s not only the technology, everyone talks about Slalom’s culture, I don’t think I’ve read a review that didn’t mention some aspect of the culture at Slalom. However, no one really tells you how positive and encouraging everyone at the company is. I haven’t met anyone who wouldn’t take 30 minutes out of their busy day to help you and answer any questions you may have. Many companies preach a modern culture or promise flexibility and work life balance, but Slalom delivers on all of those.
What makes Slalom’s culture truly great are the employees behind it. I feel this is often an overlooked, yet important quality for any company. Being new to the consulting industry, Slalom takes great strides to teach me the skills needed to be a great consultant and has paired me with an excellent project manager and mentor. I feel as though my thoughts and ideas are valued, heard, and that I am making a positive contribution to the projects I am on.
TLDR; Slalom is an amazing company to work for who makes good on the promises of a modern culture, flexible work life balance, and whose employees truly make it an enjoyable and fun place to be.","Slalom Hartford is going through a growing phase and we are currently getting to big for our current office space so finding a spot to sit on Fridays can be challenging when you want to work from the office. However, this problem is currently being worked on and a good one to have."
1048,Slalom,I am finally home!,2018-03-13,5.0,Consulting,"After 21 years of looking for a company that values skills AND people...I finally found Slalom! Here core values are not text to fill a home page on a website. 

To most, you may not think that matters,
 UNTIL you experience a culture that embraces such things.  Who can say they work for a company that texts them during a storm to ensure they are safe? 

The list of pros for Slalom, and further for the market I work in (Hartford), can go on and on. I would be happy to talk to anyone interested in Slalom.  You can find me on Linked In and simply reach out.",I have nothing but wonderful things to say about our company. Truth.
1049,Slalom,I couldn't be happier,2018-03-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Incredibly bright and passionate people that truly support each other and live the values every day.  The company is growing thanks to focused, organized teams and leadership.  The learning culture means there's really not much room for egos as everyone is on a path to grow and improve.  The new Denver office space is an incredible workspace.",Too many people in Denver still don't know about us.
1050,Slalom,Enhanced 401K match,2018-03-12,5.0,Consultant,"Slalom recently announced an increase to their 2018 401K match % which makes them much more competitive in the marketplace. In addition to the match, Slalom also made an additional one time contribution to our 401K accounts because of strong 2017 financials.",The % match is now competitive to the market but still not better than the average.
1051,Slalom,The Real Deal,2018-03-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slalom is one of the best places I’ve ever worked. It’s challenging, calls upon me to be and my best, and allows for interesting and creative thinking as we solve our clients’ business problems. Recently, the company significantly upgraded our 401k benefit in response to strong results, thus “spreading the wealth” to what Slalom believes is its highest priority: employees. I like that Slalom is committed to remaining a private company. Another pro is that you are encouraged to participate in improving the business; all ideas welcome, from anywhere.","This is hard work, and you have spend extra cycles to keep your personal network and reputation strong in order to work on the most interesting opportunities. For some this may be a drawback, but I find it an honest way to stay in the game."
1052,Slalom,Let's See if We Fit,2018-03-09,5.0,Consultant,"Process began by being reached out to via LinkedIn. After doing some research on the company and seeing what they were about, I accepted the initial phone interview (would eventually be a series of 5 interviews).
First round (phone): Basic discussion with a recruiter on my background and interests. Received some basic information on the Phoenix office, Slalom's business and what they're looking for in a candidate.  After agreeing Slalom seemed like a good fit, next step was to meet in person.
Second Round (in person): Met with another recruiter for appetizers and drinks. Really relaxed and laid back conversation. A little more technical with specific skills, discussed more about professional goals and how that may fit with Slalom as well as Slalom's needs. Left the conversation feeling positive but no immediate next steps.
Third Round (in person): Received a message on LinkedIn that Slalom would like me to meet with one of their Delivery Leadership (DL) Consultants. This was a morning coffee meet and was the most technical conversation. Ended up discussing a business case and what my initial thoughts would be around strategy, high level but definitely a dive into your abilities as an IT Consultant. Left the conversation feeling like I nailed the questions but no immediate next steps.
Fourth Round (in person): Reached out to over personal email, offered to visit the office and have lunch with another DL Consultant. This interview had nearly zero talk regarding Slalom or my professional background. This was much more of a culture fit interview. Got a feel for who this consultant was, what people like to do in the company as well as share my interests and hobbies outside of work. Positive conversation and definitely felt like this was the company for me at this point.
Fifth and Final Round (in person): Reached out to over personal email, lunch with the leader of DL. This was a mix of the previous three interviews in terms of discussion and topics. Conversation primarily solidified expectations of the role and what Slalom is trying to achieve in Phoenix.
The next phone call I would have would be a job offer (if it was another interview, I probably would have ended the interaction). I accepted the offer and have had nothing but positive experiences since joining.","Although the interview process felt longer than normal, it gave the right opportunity and time to ensure both Slalom and I were a great fit."
1053,Slalom,A great place to work!,2018-03-08,5.0,Sales Executive,"Slalom is a great organization to be a part of. There is a focus on core values, growth, and fulfillment. You get to be surrounded by amazing coworkers and fantastic clients.",None to share at this time.
1054,Slalom,Organizational Effectiveness Consultant,2018-03-08,5.0,Consultant,"This is the absolute best place I have ever worked. Slalom has clearly defined values, competencies which align to those values, and goals aimed at living those values. Slalom's leaders have a deep compassion for people and it shows. I am surrounded by highly engaged, kind, happy, supportive people who possess incredible intellectual horsepower. Slalom  focuses on confidently and humbly serving customers to help them achieve their desired outcomes. I am proud, everyday, to be a part of this team.","PTO could be increased to allot sick time.
401K benefit could be better, though an improvement was just announced, so they are moving in the right direction."
1055,Slalom,Don't work in DC Office,2018-03-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You might get put on a project that you like, but it will be completely random and by chance.","The management in the DC office is very sub par. They act like cheerleaders who place people on whatever project they can weasel their way into with false promises to clients and a self aggrandizing way of interacting with prospects and recruits. 

The turn over in this office is high. The office is decorated to draw prospects and recruits  in with nice decor, but the overall brain power of management is devoid of any real  awareness of the subject matter that they are working in. It's more about hiring as many consultants as possible and getting them billable wherever they can get them in. 

It's one thing to be a snob and have a good reason to back it up like brains or talent. This office contains vapid managers who think way too highly of themselves. A lot of them worked together at a previous employer before they started this office and are pretty united no matter how they perform. 

Above all else, the DC office lacks an overall team cohesiveness. In fact, it excels at creating an ""in group"" and an ""out group""."
1056,Slalom,Amazing people!,2018-03-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great multidisciplinary teams in London!,I don’t have any negatives to share!
1057,Slalom,Focus on outcomes,2018-03-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slalom actually works hard to be the best that they can for their employees and customers. It's not lip service, it is their DNA.","Projects, individual work, and each person's day to day experience will very greatly. I find this to be one of the reasons I love the company but it is not for everyone."
1058,Slalom,A Different Kind of Consulting Firm,2018-03-02,4.0,Solutions Principal,"Everything you love about consulting with less of the stuff you don't.  Focus on the individual, you manage your own career, very little micromanagement, local model, they truly live their core values, lots of backline support when you need it.","Benefits are slightly less competitive, but they've been working on that, salary increases are meager unless you're truly in the upper 10% of the curve, leaders are expected to work twice as hard for only a nominal pay increase.  Very relationship-driven so if you're not establishing relationships, you'll miss out on a lot.  Less standards, templates, and oversight than the bigger firms, which is both a plus and a negative."

1063,Slalom,Consulting is not a dirty word,2018-02-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When you hear the word consulting you might think of an army of suits overtaking a floor of a client, keeping to themselves and leaving all at once in 6 months to a year. That's not how Slalom does it. I

I have been really impressed by the level of talent and collaboration, both with clients and colleagues, that is engrained in the ethos at Slalom.","There are some internal processes, including transitioning on-to and off-of projects could be a bit smoother for consultants, but I believe management is aware of these issues, so hopefully help is on the way."
1064,Slalom,"One year, still the greatest place I have worked",2018-02-26,5.0,Solutions Architect,"Transparency throughout the recruiting process was an immediate attraction.

I get to solve interesting problems & help clients re-imagine the way they run their business. I am also able to pursue my passion for learning & teaching others. The upper management team has a consistent open-door policy and are always willing to give me time when I need it. I genuinely like the people I work with.,"Slalom is going through common small-to-medium company transitions with internal process definition and some issues with consistency. But, at the same time, not having a formal way of doing everything allows us all to add our own touches to the way work is done or the how a deliverable is crafted."
1066,Slalom,Living Slalom's Core Values,2018-02-26,5.0,Client Service Leader,"I have been working at Slalom Minneapolis for almost 4 years and found a place that matched my core values.

I would suggest that if you are looking at Slalom be honest about who you are and if you are comfortable being vulnerable at work and bring ing your true self every day.  Here at Slalom we believe that means you get to be your best self however for some it can be a real struggle as they have been guarded for so many years."
1067,Slalom,Good Place to Work,2018-02-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slalom does a good job with making their employees feel valued.  The ""all local"" projects is nice for a consulting firm as it means you're not traveling each week to wherever you're needed.","The ""all local"" can have a downside if there isn't a project that fits your skill set - you might be doing something outside of it.  As long as you are the type of person that views this as a learning experience then it can be a positive."

I have made great connections, as well as friends at the company over the years.  Good work life balance,  work events are always fun and entertaining","Personally, miss the ""family, connected"" feel since a large amount of employees have been hired and many of the older ones have left.  
Lower pay than most consulting companies in the area. 
I have been with the company over 5.5 years and have not received a significant raise to speak of, below market value,  Insurance isn't 100% covered,  People Managers aren't always accessible and the support has dwindled over the years along with the connection. Many of the accounts can be found at other consulting firms at a higher pay for the same work"
1072,Slalom,Your future is truly up to you at Slalom,2018-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Outstanding culture; honesty and integrity is baked into everything the company does.  Lots of kool-aid and core values, but relative to other companies I've worked for, it's real and authentic.  At first I was skeptical but after time I've come to realize why so many employees advocate for Slalom.  People care about each other, and care about their work/clients.  Consulting is a challenging space and it's never perfect, but Slalom is as good as it gets.","Most offices are run slightly differently, so experiences across markets and practices can vary wildly.  What they all have in common is that you need to be self-directed and own your path.  If you want hand-holding, it's available if you seek it out, but otherwise you may not find it.
Benefits kind of suck.  I've worked for big/small companies, and it seems that health and 401k benefits are inferior by comparison.  This seems to have been a theme for a very long time that is never fully addressed for whatever reason.  I believe Slalom makes up for this in other ways (work/life balance, great culture, etc) but if they improved the benefits I think it would knock out one of the very few consistent complaints employees have.
Knowledge sharing across markets is lacking.  While everyone is ready and willing to help each other, it's a time consuming process that is costing us valuable time and money.
Marketing/sales needs stronger alignment.  We need more IP/thought leadership and better strategies for creating, promoting, and selling specialized/differentiated capabilities."
1073,Slalom,Great company that is losing it's shine,2018-02-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,My teammates make this a great place.,Too much staff augmentation work.  Company leadership means well but does not know what they are doing.  Bullying behavior is not addressed

Great people and culture, exciting work, phenomenal growth and a solid management team focused on all the right things.  I genuinely feel lucky to be part of what we have going on at Slalom and I hope that as we grow we continue to operate with the fluidity of a small company.","With any consulting firm comes some long hours during crunch time.  Its not constant but its there, and expectations are that you will rise to the occasion when needed.  Im good with it.

Killer coworkers who care and succeed with you

Amazing team events; happy hour and ping pong tables aren't the half (or even the tenth) of it. The company events are lavish, the leadership team takes every effort to make time to get to know everyone, and you can basically count on a culture of success, happiness, and positivity. It's hard to overstate the extent to which this impacts your life: People are just so damn supportive and thoughtful, it's almost bizarre to see in business.","Anything money related is going to be a little behind market. But if you work 40 hours here at 90k/yr versus 55 hours per week at company X for 130, you're not really losing anything. 
If you're not proactive in letting people know what you want (even if that thing is 'support to figure out what I want') it can sometimes be hard to push for career goals."

- A team committed to creating a positive and vibrant culture; there are so many events that run the gamut from small, intimate board game nights to large quarterly events where everyone has a chance to go to a cool venue and connect with team members. There really is something for everyone.
- Opportunities. There is room to grow here and the leadership team will help you get where you want to go
- The people. There is so much care that goes into our recruiting process and it shows. The quality of people here is exceptional. From operations to leadership level, the same amount of effort and care is placed on recruiting people that will live our values and contribute positively to the culture of Slalom.","There aren't a lot of cons here!  One thing is that with our rapid growth, space is at a premium and we're meeting with some challenges around that. I see the leadership team working hard to rectify this and, in the meantime, it's been great to see how everyone is working to mitigate the impacts of growing team as the space catches up to accommodate them."

This office, as with most at Slalom, is filled with passionate, empathetic, like-minded individuals who are dedicated to each other and to the success of our clients. Given the relative newness of the market, there is an air of excitement in these days of early growth, and a tremendous opportunity to shape the business in the UK and Europe.","It's not for everyone. The people who fit best here are autonomous, experienced, and okay having ownership over their projects and relationships.

Every person who I've encountered has welcomed me and offered a helping hand as I become more familiar with the company and our strategic vision for the future. 

You're empowered to drive your own career and success.

There are a lot of interest groups to become involved and network.

The opportunities to learn or teach others are endless and encouraged. 

The onboarding process was short and sweet. I was setup with a laptop and access on day one, and within a week had been welcomed by ~50 people in the office. 

Recruiting (Jeff) did an amazing job at keeping me updated throughout the hiring process. I was impressed by every single person I had interviewed with.",The hiring process is a bit long and took me approximately 2-3 months. I had expected the process to take time based on reading other reviews and I can confirm it is well worth the wait.

1093,Slalom,Five Years on Cross-Market and Loving It!,2018-01-15,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"I've been on the Cross-Market Delivery Network team at Slalom for five years and have lived in two Slalom markets. What keeps me here? The leadership listens, values feedback, and allows individuals to help drive change. Slalom has grown to be almost 5,000 employees but still has a scrappy and entrepreneurial drive. I have had amazing experiences at Slalom - being recognized for my work, being given difficult feedback that has helped me grow, and working around hungry, humble, and emotionally intelligent people. I highly recommend looking at Slalom if you value those three things - you'll find them in every office!","There is international structure at Slalom, but as you've read in other reviews the level of structure varies in every office. If you're someone who needs a specific career path or someone telling you exactly what you need to do for a promotion, you may struggle. Slalom allows for you to drive your career, so make sure to get good mentors outside of your people manager to help navigate you through the process of figuring out what is right for you here."

1096,Slalom,5 years in & getting better every day!,2018-01-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"After 5 years at Slalom, I can truly say that this is the best place I've ever worked.  I have had the pleasure of joining the Boston team a few months into its inception and have been an integral part of the ebbs and flows of our growth.  I'm continually impressed by our leadership team - their genuine approach to the operation of our business, people management & servicing our community is inspiring.  Our consultants & internal employees are also a unique breed - everyone is collaborative, innovative, & always challenging one another to do better & raise the bar.  The sense of inclusion is palpable and makes coming to work every day a happy experience.","The benefits can continue to get better! Although, I've been impressed with the positive changes our leadership has made to our benefits packages over the last 5 years (PTO, paternity/maternity leave, 401K, etc.)"
1097,Slalom,Great place to work if you're willing to sacrifice compensation for good working environment,2018-01-09,4.0,Software Engineer,"- Have genuinely enjoyed working with almost everyone I have worked with here.  You can generally count on your co-workers to be good at their jobs.

- Management makes a concerted effort to be forthright and transparent with their planning and vision for the company, and a very open and accessible if you have questions or concerns

- For the most part employees are given some input into what projects they would like to be on.  For all my projects my manager has come to me before the project to describe it to me and get my approval before staffing me on it (that being said I haven't had a project I turned down yet, so not sure how that conversation would go).

- Office environment is very laid back and fun.  Lots of events, chances to connect with co-workers.  Seems to me to be generally a very open and welcoming environment.

- Slalom has the most mature agile practices of anywhere I've worked.  Most projects generally follow agile practices and are fairly well run and organized.","- Compensation is below average for Seattle.  401k match is much smaller than I've had elsewhere.

- There are a fair number of pretty frustrating/directionless projects that people get stuck on.  I haven't been on one personally, but seems that most people have a couple horror stories of really bad projects they've been on, or are currently on.  I can think of a three project right off that are going right now that I know people that can't wait to get off of. 

- Management can lay it on a little thick with the ""we want to change the world, we want to be the best company ever"" narrative.  Perhaps they really feel that way, but it doesn't land well with the individual contributors, particularly when they're on a mundane, dead end project."

1100,Slalom,Slalom Houston from the Beginning,2017-12-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slalom Houston is a great place to work, and to build a fulfilling career. I have worked with multiple consulting firms during my career, and Slalom is by far the most fulfilling. Never have a seen an organization so committed to its core values, with the most critical one being to ""do what's right, always"".  Slalom is a great place to work, and leadership is always striving to make it better. I have been at Slalom Houston since the beginning in 2014, and I know that this is where I will spend the rest of my career. The reception by the Houston market to Slalom has been incredible. We have great customers, and do great work with great consultants. Dream job.","People struggle with our name, which is odd but provides comedic relief regularly."
1101,Slalom,One of the finer management/technology/business consulting firms,2017-12-13,4.0,Practice Area Lead,Slalom's culture is quintessentially the defining quality which makes Slalom the incredible consulting firm it is. The culture is rooted on core disciplines which the executive leaders hold true and live every day. It is based on putting consultants first and requires a level of clarity and openness. Th firm is private and owned by employees. As such it allows for a level of close knit bond which allows for decision making and process improvement not readily available in other larger consulting firms. The people employed are highly skilled and fairly good at what they do.,"It is a consulting firm. Requires one to be innovative with projects, clients and deliverables. Requires consultants to be self-starters and lead independently. Slalom also grows fast and adds several new consultants to the ranks every month. As such change is constant and sometimes it can be overwhelming. This often comes across as leaders who aren't plugged in, off-ish, and not in the pulse of things or know. Being consulting, each market sets the trend of success. So some markets are better than others. Some struggle with talent and some struggle with projects. Attrition can seem high, but percentage wise it is really low when measured with similar size firms. Pay is good, but can be better. Benefits are satisfactory and has room for improvement. Leaders are not all equal. Some are great and awesome, while some lack and not all that polished. Ultimately this is a consulting firm, know what Slalom brings as value is important to know. Consulting in your DNA is almost a requirement. Not for the inexperienced. Good consultants get great at Slalom, the mediocre fall behind."
1102,Slalom,Former Big 4 Consultant - Welcome to the good life,2017-12-13,5.0,Consultant,"While you still feel the competitive spirit of working with smart, capable people, the constant pressure to outperform peers and ""move up"" is nowhere near the levels of the traditional consulting model.

The flat organization structure allows people of different backgrounds and experience levels to truly develop and learn through stretch roles instead of being shoe-horned into roles based on title or service line.

Slalom's org structure and ATL leadership allow you to carve your own path. While the responsibility is on you to decide how you buy into the culture, learn and develop, and ultimately move up in the organization, that freedom allows you to feel a sense of ownership in your career, rather than simply being told what to do to move up to the next rung.

People are happy at work. In my experience, teams at Slalom are built on trust, which allows them to flex to fit team members' needs and make progress rather than teammates constantly feeling the need to talk about how ""busy"" they are. This leads to better work/life balance and greater day-to-day enjoyment of the work.","Processes like performance management and staffing are constantly changing, which leads to a lack of buy in of the new processes."

I’m talking about a specific here. Why are 95% plus leaders all ex-Accenture? Particularly at the MD and GM level. You can’t expect someone who’s spent 20+ years at Accenture not to carry over that experience, ingrained traits and perceptions into Slalom.

1107,Slalom,Caveat Emptor,2017-12-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are many good people at Slalom; they just tend to be in the wrong roles, including leadership. 

Old joke: How can one tell the difference between heaven and hell?  “Heaven” is where the French are the chefs, the British run the government, and the Germans are the engineers. 

“Hell” is where the Germans are the chefs, the French are the police, and the British are the engineers. 

Slalom Atlanta is the latter… Lots of good people in the wrong roles, as well as a few bad people protected from pushing in the wrong roles.","Like another older post, it’s true the office has ‘lost it’s soul.’ That fun-loving environment is now replaced with a transactional sentiment toward employees, which is in contrast with the repeated mantra ‘people come first.' While the Big 4 re-invent the review process, Slalom Atlanta upweights it in a way only the Stasi could appreciate (go ahead, Wiki that) all the while claiming it can be on the cutting edge for clients’ needs. This is just one example of the office dysfunctionality.

To add to the suffering, leadership is intent on creating an echo chamber, sitting in an isolated room off the main floor and eliminating those who disagree with their views on office and company strategy. These actions then lead to the required promotion of several people deemed less than ready for their senior positions, reinforcing an unenviable vicious cycle.

The result? 

1.	A harsh ‘what-have-you-done-for-me-lately’ mentality now dominates
2.	Systematic disengagement in many teams. All those ‘fun’ activities promoted by recruitment and during monthly calls quickly lose their luster when people drown their disengagement with drinks 
3.	The much-hyped People Management system is a charade; you will enter Slalom Atlanta at the peak of your skill set
4.	Much higher turnover than in the past and relative to the industry
5.	A loss of challenging voices (and females in leadership… until a recent promotion of females into leadership)
6.	Subpar performance and lower bonuses

Slalom national leadership is not much better. 

While there are 1-2 leaders who can point the org in the right direction, the others are lost, spouting various mantras and metrics with a short-sighted view on directing the organization. The result at the office level is, well, unfortunate.

Some teams continue to do well. It’s essential to  do your home work beyond the recruitment team if you’re looking to Slalom for a career move. Reading these posts is a good start, cautioning some of these are glibly fraudulent. Or fraudulently glib.

If you are looking for a “career” here, be EXTREMELY careful about which team you join. With the short-term focus on results and no infrastructure for development,  your most likely outcome of joining here is: work on average for 2-3 years and exit unhappily with lower valued skills than when you entered."

1118,Slalom,Consider your options carefully.,2017-11-01,2.0,Consultant,"- The work/life balance is fair.
- Experienced and considerate colleagues.","In reflecting on my time at Slalom I tried to come up with points as neutral and informative as possible. However, I once read a review here on Glassdoor that said something along the lines of “don’t leave a good position to come here” and I think that reflects my sentiment. While there is a good aspect or two, in time, if you prioritize your character projection based on your work product rather than social likability you will be disappointed with Slalom.

There are some considerable organizational issues brought up in these reviews that are not easily addressed. It will take reflection and action by leadership to solve them.

There will be many reviews that focus on pay, hours, time off, etc. - quantitative things. However, these are easy to control and I’ll let other reviewers focus on those. Slalom has trouble in the qualitative areas: politics, accountability, etc.

- The culture and work environment is political. You must have very high competency in this area in order to succeed at Slalom.
- Skills among staff are not inventoried or leveraged optimally. The lack of a skill inventory amplifies a social importance factor since likability and self-promotion are the few factors leadership has to use to match staff to projects if project-skill matching even occurs.
- Middle-level leadership is lacking quality - When I think of an ideal leader, I think, “What can I do to be more like this person? What qualities do they have that I want? What could I learn from them?” There were few people that I worked for at Slalom where I was able to even approach these questions.
- Accountability and responsibility across all levels was murky leading to ‘do now, think later’ half-completed, abandoned, or poorly considered initiatives.
- Despite a formal process, timely feedback was rarely given by superiors. 
- Colleagues never seemed to like to work together to achieve for the betterment of the company, it felt more individualistic.
- My experience with payroll and benefits was inconsistent and took too much time to solve errors.
- The local model leads to redundant and/or fragmented operations between offices."

They can't even seem to sell common peripheral tasks. This office only sells Salesforce and a couple other minor technologies. Projects are typically short and poorly staffed (likely due to sales not being able to sell  or understand the whole project) and expected to perform miracles with the minimal time they are given in a project. Project estimation is done without any formal estimation tools but instead, an educated guess done by someone who has never touched the technology. This results in wildly inaccurate project schedules. Consultants are either working day and night to fulfill a crazy schedule or are sitting around pretending to work, lying to customers about what you're doing. It's absolutely unacceptable for your manager to ask you to lie to a customer under and circumstances.

We discussed my experience and interests at a high-level and I learned a bit about the Slalom model and culture. Over the next few months I met with various members of the Philly team across practice areas which eventually led to an offer of employment in September.

I found the open dialogue interview process to be rewarding in and of itself.  It allowed me to get to know some of the team members a bit more than a traditional question and answer format and gave me a better sense of the kind of problems Slalom excels at tackling. One of the things that stuck out to me was the culture the organization portrays and how genuine the individual's within the organization seem to live it.  I have now been with Slalom Philadelphia for 1 month and so far I cannot say enough good things about this place. Hoping for many more years of solving interesting problems and working with a great team.",I guess if you don't like fun teams and interesting work than this place would be pretty miserable for you.
1133,Slalom,"Terrible, Terrible Leadership! Loyalty more important than competence.",2017-10-06,1.0,Consultant,"Great colleagues
Fun company sponsored events
Decent nationwide network of support
Most have decent work/life balance","Leadership at its worst. Most the leaders can not perform at the level the consultants are expected to yet unchecked egos flourish.  

Sub-par consultants get rewarded at company meetings for minuscule achievements they are more or less loyalty rewards. 

Promotions at the company rarely made sense and didn't seem to be based on merit. 

The most important thing to Senior Management is making sure consultants are billable.  There was so much turnover I lost track of who I worked with.  

The culture of fear and back stabbing is so rampant I am unsure how it could be course corrected. 

People managers were unqualified to manage people."
1134,Slalom,Slalom is a Special Place,2017-10-03,5.0,Client Service Leader,"- Culture is like no other.  No egos! All ideas, suggestions, questions, concerns welcomed.  You can be part of shaping direction in numerous ways (e.g. Go to Market, New Clients, Corporate Citizenship).  Leaders are concerned about fostering this culture and not letting it slip away.
- Events are meaningful and fun. T-Party, the yearly all-expense getaway weekend is unique and a highlight of the summer.  It is a unique and rewarding to spend quality time with coworkers/friends in this type of setting. The Ski-trip, Bowl-a-thon, Cocktails for Community Awareness are other examples of events that are all well-done and fun.
- Leadership is open. I've seen tough questions from coworkers tackled head on. The leadership at all levels makes a point to be approachable, personable, and honest. When things go wrong, they own it. When things don’t work out, we figure out why and address it.  There are a variety of monthly and quarterly events that highlight where we are as a business, what we are focused on, and what is needed from everyone in order to be successful.
- Work/life balance is modeled by leadership. I've seen Client Leads take additional time off after having children.  Consultants have the right to say ""no"" to a project that won't fit their desired work/life balance.","- Slalom continues to evolve, refine and tweak things like career path and feedback processes.  While change represents opportunity to some, it can be a point of confusion, concern and/or stress for others looking for a clearly marked career path with specific timings and/or titles."
1135,Slalom,Great Place to Work,2017-10-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,A great company that cares about you professionally and personally.,I love working for Slalom.
1136,Slalom,Not as advertised should be the montra,2017-10-01,3.0,Senior Solutions Architect,"Lots of very energetic and smart folks
Potential to pitch your ideas and drive your own path
High end clients, so big budgets to work with
Events and after work activities","As an hourly consultant, insane pressure to hit 40+ billable weeks
WLB is not real for the lower level folks, or people staffed out to clients
Benefits lower then other firms of this type
Growth stagnant do to internal culture
Being a 40+ white male used against you by your bosses
More technical folks commonly under promoted, kept in worker bee roles to be more billable so you leadership is not as knowledgeable as your teams.  This leads to issues and tension between your technical staff and others.
Was told remote working was a future, was a total lie...have to be either close to the office, or willing to fly and live on site at a client....not real remote opportunities."
1137,Slalom,Glorified staffing/temp company with some great people,2017-09-29,2.0,Consultant,"These reviews are based on Slalom Boston only and I believe each office operates little bit differently.

Majority of the people are hired from Big4 consulting firms - therefore there is a pretty good talent and pedigree of people.

People are friendly, nice and good camaraderie among people.

Pretty good work/life balance.

Annual summer and winter events are pretty solid.

With all the ""Cons"" you might see below, still lot of good talent. May not be a bad company if you are < 3 or 4 years of experience and/or you plan to stay only for 1 - 2 years.","These reviews are for Slalom Boston and I believe each office operates little bit differently.

Pretty much 70% of the consulting engagements are staff augment / temp staffing type assignments. You are by yourself at the client with little to no support except when role is being extended or opportunity for potential up-sell.

The client engagement staffing is poor and is based on available roles (demand) and available people (supply) rather than skills and experience match for the role. If you were an experienced PM before you may end up staffed as junior BA in a long term client project or if you are not an IT person and you might end up in an IT project. And you are stuck there for a long time doing things you do not like.

Most of us end up as perpetual Consultant (job title) - no meaningful upward career trajectory. There are many many ""consultants"" who have been around for a 3+ years without any potential for upward movement and many people who joined 3 years ago or before have left the company.

Internal leadership roles are filled by hiring from outside rather than grooming and promoting the experience staff.

When you joining Slalom, they may match / even pay little bit more than your current salary, but once you are in your annual increase and bonus are are very very small (3 - 4% a year at the most). And you are expected to do lot more than your client work to crack the 5% mark (with at least 10+ hours a week).

Not a great option for experienced consultants - for instance if you are a Sr. Consultant, Manager and above in any of the major consulting firm, then you will feel very much stuck in Slalom.

The job titles are not very industry standard and comparable to others. The job titles in client services are: Consultant, Principal Consultant, Consulting Manager, Solution Architect, Solution Principal, Practice Area Lead and Client Services Lead.  You are told that this is not linear and you can go from any title to any title. There are couple of people who used to be ""Directors"" in other firms joined Slalom as consultants and they have been ""consultants"" ever since. They are at the bottom of the pile with everyone else.

If you were to compare to Accenture, Deloitte or PwC consulting titles: Principal Consultant and Consulting Manager is equivalent to ""Manager"" in Accenture; Solution Principal and Solution Architect is equivalent to ""Senior Consultant""  or Manager in Accenture and the only difference is you are specialized in certain area (example Project Management).

Poor leadership - During the hiring process you are told Slalom is entrepreneurial and you can make your own career, flat organization, etc., but in reality there is a ceiling you'll be stuck under and if you stay here many years you career will stall and you will not be marketable.

There is lot of dissatisfaction among staff and resulting in quite a bit of attrition.  

There is a general consensus that people have been treated poorly when they gave notice to leave the company.

Most everyone I know are looking for opportunities to jump.

Poor benefits."
1138,Slalom,"This is NOT the place for everyone!  Love your work, love your life... are you kidding?",2017-09-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The offerings provided add value to the clients and solve real business problems. There are some very smart people working at Slalom.,"Please do not overlook my perspective because you feel I am disgruntled.  I want to share my excruciating, terrifying experience I had working at Slalom in case some people feel the same way and are feeling alone.  Not to be overly dramatic, but I still have PTSD from my time at Slalom, certain things set off severe anxiety.

90% of the people working at Slalom are mean.  There is zero room for error and everyone looks down on each other's work.  People are constantly criticized except the few elite who are overly coddled and congratulated.  Slalom people care more about what university you attended and what your IQ is than who you are as  a person and what your character is.  Although they claim to be a highly diverse organization, it's completely untrue.  If you attend the national sales meeting with over 200 attendees, 95% are white men.  Women's work is not equally respected or compensated.  

My manager was horrible, so mean and cold.  Zero personality.  This I point out because it is a symptom of the company.  They breed these type of people.   

One night I was in Seattle and stepped up to the hotel bar by myself.  Three men sitting next to me did not know I was a Slalom employee.  They were so rude and disgusting, talking so much crap about their own company.... Slalom.  Calling their manager fat and ugly and making derogatory comments to women in the bar, going on and on about how Slalom is the worst place to work bla bla bla.  On the other side of me were two people from Microsoft, I looked over to them and they were equally disgusted.  I told them I worked for Slalom but these other men at the bar didn't know that.  They proceeded to tell me how horrible of a reputation Slalom has for being a terrible place to work and how many clients feel the people are mean and look down on them as stupid.

I could go on, but I think I have made my point.  This is not the place for everyone.  If you are mean, highly intelligent, and like to put others down, this is the place for you."
1139,Slalom,Smoke and Mirrors,2017-09-28,2.0,Consultant,"Slalom is 15+ US Offices with a few offices in Europe and Canada. Each office runs as it's own company and is only as good as the leaders in each office. 

The SF office specifically has a lot of energy. Their Quarterly meetings are a lot of fun and it's enjoyable whenever you go into the office. It's a great place to escape and get off the road which is how the company was founded.

If you dive into the Slalom community you will meet some great people and friends. Definitely a plus for someone new to SF.","Unfortunately the high energy / fun environment is camouflage for Slalom paying you below market without any equity options. No matter what they say, you will be doing staff aug work at 1-5 Customer's in SF (Genentech, PG&E, Salesforce, Gap, etc..) The projects will range 4-12 months long and you'll cycle between those clients. There is little opportunity for you to advance internally and you won't come out more valuable to other companies. Advise is to skip the company all together."

– Local model is great because you get to sleep in your own bed, but Chicago's sprawling suburbs and congested highways mean some consultants spend 1-2 hours a day on the road. For some, this is less favorable than being on a plane twice a week.
– The firm is becoming well-known, but a significant portion of the work is still uninspiring and local model means there isn't always a great match with a consultant's skills. Work is generally meaningful, though."

1146,Slalom,21 years in consulting. Best company I have worked for by far.,2017-09-20,5.0,Practice Area Lead,"I have worked in consulting for 21 years and have therefore worked for multiple consulting companies as well as been inside of roughly a hundred more.  Slalom is the best place I have worked bar none.   Management is bright, humble and approachable.  Every consulting company says the same thing ""Our people are our product and so they are our most important asset"".   The difference is that Slalom actually lives that was as well.  I have seem managers here bend over backwards to accommodate the needs and desires of their consultants. 

I came to Slalom in part because I wanted to work with a lot of really smart people and learn a lot.  I am constantly surprised with the depth of experience and just plain amazing people who work here.   As the saying goes ""Culture eats strategy for breakfast"".  I cannot fully explain why Slalom's culture is so good but I know it is.   You don't get the type of ratings they have here and on other sites by snowing people.",Slalom has a socially liberal leaning (perhaps more here in San Francisco) and sometime I see this creep into company culture more than I would like.   I believe it comes from a genuine concern for people but I sometime find it a bit too much.

1156,Slalom,My first impressions of Slalom,2017-08-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My interview process was a series of 5 interesting and engaging conversations over the course of 4 weeks.  I was struck by the quality of the talent that I was interviewed by - all exhibited very similar behaviors: confident, intelligent, witty, unassuming, engaged, warm, and professional.  Each also spoke very positively about Slalom, it’s culture, the quality of work, the management team, specific development opportunities and prospects for substantial growth locally, in the US and globally.  I was offered a position during week 5 with a more than fair compensation package and gratefully accepted the role.  

My experiences after joining the team week 6 has been equally as positive-I am surrounded by a group of people I respect.  In one way or another the team clearly relayed that they are invested in my success:  I was given the tools to begin my orientation within minutes after my arrival, was greeted with countless welcomes from management and my new peers (many of who sat down and took the time to help me come up to speed), met with and was assigned to a very prominent client - and by the end of my first week had a meaningful conversation with each one of my leaders via one-to-ones, over lunches, a happy hour... and will end my first week with an all-expenses-paid trip (spouse included) to the company’s annual retreat.",I can't think of one.
1157,Slalom,Fantastic Decision to Work Here!,2017-08-22,5.0,Consultant,"- The people you work with will push you to be the best version of yourself.  Having so many co-workers come from other consulting firms means that everyone has been around the block before, there's no ""oh what do I do now"" conversations with new hires, and things work smoothly.
- My managers actually care about me in a way I haven't had at other firms.  There's a serious culture of making sure that you are doing ok both professionally and personally - before any new engagement I'm asked several times if I want to do it, if I'm ok with it, and there's no problem if I say no.
- The activities are fantastic - there's always plenty going on after work with colleagues; plenty of clubs and organizations to join and try new things with!","- The promotion process is opaque - which is somewhat fair considering that this is a very flat organization and the title ""Consultant"" can mean a 27 year old from Deloitte or a 43 year old who had his own firm for several years.

This is a disservice to their development as well as to top performing consultants who are expected to pick up slack. 
- No career progression or promotion path. 
- Leaders value sales (or relationships) over delivery. Similar to larger consulting firms, impossible projects are sold and consultants are expected to deliver. However, instead of large teams to lean on, there are small teams with little support from the top. 
- Toxic culture of male misogyny, with disparaging comments about female employees and clients, and escalations ignored or swept under. 
- Problems in the office are swept under the rug and masked by continued ""rah rah"" attitude from leadership, particularly when other leaders are present. 
- Delivery quality seems to be all over the place, with different expectations for different clients, not defining quality based on what we are proud to put out.

Two years later, I'm thrilled to say that somehow Slalom has figured it out.

Slalom has great work / life balance, the culture is outstanding, and the investment that has been made in my personal growth by my manager and leadership team is outstanding. I recently received a job offer from another company and felt comfortable enough with my manager to sit down, talk through the opportunity, and discuss how I could meet some of the characteristics of the role that were interesting to me at Slalom. 

Senior (national) Leadership is approachable, transparent, and honest. I trust them. They are also making exciting investments like Workday, Salesforce, and additional technology to improve the way that the Slalom offices work together nationally, while still maintaining the local “flare.”

I have been staffed on projects that align with my personal and professional goals and have been put in stretch roles to grow and develop.","At times, I miss the quality of resources that were available to me at my prior, Big 4 consultancy. It was easier to access information, find out who the SMEs were, and use templates, methodologies, etc. to deliver client work. 

Similarly, the infrastructure at Slalom could use some work. Our support like IT, HR, etc. isn’t as robust as my previous employer and it can be frustrating to have to wait hours to troubleshoot your computer. 

While they do their best to support the local model, it isn’t always perfect. Some clients are five minutes away from the office, others are much longer. Considering I used to fly around the country every week, it’s much better, but not perfect."

1188,Slalom,"Good Company, Bad lower Management",2017-06-27,3.0,Consultant,Pay is great. No Travel if you wish. Plenty of vacation time.,Poor lower management. They place consultants into positions just to fill a spot but in turn set consultants up for failure by placing them into areas they have no experience.  Let clients walk all over their consultants. Can be very stressful work.

Not a bad thing at all as the core ethos of Slalom is about the employee.,Consultants will have to make compromises regarding the assignments they take because the core Slalom DNA is staff augmentation of project managers.

1200,Slalom,Best and Happiest Place I've Ever Worked,2017-05-24,5.0,Consultant,"1) Amazing culture.  Some companies just say they have a good culture, but Slalom lives it.   I moved to Denver from another major city and Slalom has quickly become  my family, both at work and outside of work
2) The Work - Slalom does really meaningful work and it's refreshing to be part of a company that really wants to change Consulting game.
3) The Events - From participation in the Big Gay 5K, to our annual getaway ""Skedaddle"" to our monthly  State of the Office Happy Hours.  They are great opportunities to catch up with folks you may not see all the time because you're on different clients.  
4) The People.  I consider some of the folks at Slalom to be some of my best friends.   There's usually this clear delineation between ""work friends"" and ""not work friends"", but at Slalom, that doesn't exist.  
5) The GM - When I first started, he said ""I want Slalom to be the most impactful place you've ever worked"".  Two years later, he's still saying that, which is great to see.  He inspires us to do our best work.  
6) Executives - It's not often that you get to interact with C-Level folks at  your work.  We routinely see our CEO and President and GM of North America at our events.  They engage with everyone, they remember your names, and they genuinely want your feedback and want to know how you're doing.","1) 401k needs improvement.  Matching is not at industry standard.
2) Intent to Pursue - This is our promotion process.  It's a bit of a free for all and needs improvement / standardization of processes"

Working across teams, with leaders, with peers is so easy - everyone takes Slalom's values very seriously and you can see it in each project. I've never worked anywhere else that has so many people that really strive to do the right thing always. It makes it easy to come to work with a smile, and makes taking on big/scary initiatives and projects more fun because you know you'll have great support along the way.","Slalom is still developing infrastructure in some key areas. There are a few tools/processes that make it feel a lot like a start up - but that also means that the right person in the right role can make a big impact by coming up with solutions to areas that haven't been ""fixed"" yet. BUT - patience and flexibility/adaptability are key. Some materials/development opportunities feel limited for Corp.

If you are just looking for the status quo you can earn decent money flying under the radar and not doing much (if that is what you are into) as they are very disorganized.  Hard to get fired unless you do really, really poor work (if that is your aspiration).  No real standards or guidelines which is bad for clients but good for employees so you can sort of do what you want as long as you get the job done...there are some smart skilled people here so great place to learn and grow personally","Not very organized and not really a consulting company but more like a staffing company.  They preach a lot of one team stuff, innovation and core values but they throw them all out the window when they are not billing enough so they are obsessed with staffing people and not really interested in growing the company or providing a career path.  The offices operate like independent agencies that all do their own thing...they really push employees to vote their offices as a Best Place to work in local and national publications which they typically get and it is a ""nice"" atmosphere to work in but not recognized as a real leader in consulting because there is no real internal growth strategy or innovation unless you make it happen for yourself at a client engagement and then Slalom claims it as their own innovation.  It is sort of like Leadership does not understand business strategy 101.  There is definitely a good ol boy bias as well as it is not a meritocracy but more about who your buddy in Seattle is and who you go out drinking with which determines your career path.   They are also very sensitive to criticism or new innovative ideas internally they like to say they do things the ""Slalom way"" and will nod their head and smile when you try to suggest improvements but at some point they will pull you aside and tell you that you need to just get ""on board"" which pretty much means your ability to move up is no longer possible because you are not drinking the cool aid.  Overall younger less experienced people will be happy at Slalom but more senior, seasoned consulting professionals will be disappointed and only used as bait to lure new clients as there is no real career path"

- They have high consulting rates compared to many similar consulting companies which often means you may not get to work on projects that align with your career development plans
- Generalists are highly preferred over specialists and often you will not get enough time to ramp up on a technology that the project will use before the project starts
- Scrum is the only agile framework they want to use instead of tweaking/experimenting what will work best for a client
- Higher percentage of non-billable employees than I've encountered at other consulting companies. In particular, they have an unusually high number of people involved in the sales process / client relationships

Great place to explore local clients and find a long term home.","Generalist work is expected - your development can take a backseat to whatever your current client needs. 

Slalom sells you on a vision - it's a great vision but it's not always the reality of the work you'll do on a daily basis as a consultant. 50% of the time it'll be staff aug work disguised as ""strategic consulting"". Usually there's room to advise the client strategically - Slalom puts the onus on the individual to ""make the role what they want it to be.""

Don't complain about the work (""opportunities"") given to you - it's not the ""Slalom"" spirit. 

Promotions center around sales. If there are other paths to leadership they are not clear. Feels like an old boys club/popularity contest. You will work with leaders that you're more skilled then."

1232,Slalom,Excellent culture,2017-03-23,5.0,Data Visualization Consultant,"Slalom has an excellent culture, molded by their set of core values which are a very big deal to them. There is a culture of collaboration and team work at at Slalom which I gather is very unique among consulting groups (this is the only consulting role I have been in). Their preference for experienced hires means the workforce is a bit older (mid 30's average) and less hyper competitive, which some may see as a drawback but I personally enjoy the extremely reasonable work life balance that seems to come with that. 

At no point during my time at Slalom have I felt anything less than fully supported by a team; that my success was the organization's success and vice versa.","As so often mentioned before, the benefits are good but not great compared to peer organizations. The 401k match and PTO really stick out as problematic to me. The local model they employ is really great except it creates really inconsistent experiences between markets. I've also seen some really puzzling cost cutting decisions, like a refusal to get enterprise teleconferencing established. Consultants live on the phone; it astounds me that Slalom expects us to use free versions of conference line services - it definitely makes us look cheap to clients.

1238,Slalom,Life-draining,2017-03-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Responsibility tends to be high, good for people who want to see things through to the end.

A feeling of self-sufficiency, take the project and run with it.

There are a lot of co-workers who genuinely care about the work and about being good teammates. In best of times, you feel like a well-oiled machine. Generally smaller-sized teams, which increases your level of contribution to the project and feeling of camaraderie.","If you're taking a consulting job you likely already know what you're getting into, but you're here reading reviews for some reason, so here goes...

..the hours will be very long. And that self-sufficiency? The company is full of people who like feeling self-sufficient, so depending how your luck swings on a given project you'll be working with people who want to see things done their way, on their schedule. This is fine if you consider your job to be your life, but if you do not then this will be a constant pain in your side. You are always on the clock - even not answering e-mails on your day off is a risky proposition. Work-life balance is luck of the draw to the particular project; the company does not presume to owe you any allowance of free time. Weekends, weeknights, holidays, and on.
 
...which leads into the next point. Mentoring and support is purported by executive management to be a core value from the top down. I saw some of this from certain individuals, but it seemed to mostly take a backseat to egos and getting contracts signed. You will be blamed for not giving over your entire life and every waking minute to fix deals signed by people above you, especially since they have so many other people willing to do so without a peep. Again, it's consulting, that's likely to be expected, but then why are you still reading this review? Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining, credit to the Honorable Judge Judy. It's a slap in the face every time you're told what a great culture the company has and how much better it is than all those other consulting companies - which is half a dozen times per week in various e-mails and meetings, possibly an underestimate.

They seem to have issues finding enough good projects and take on disadvantageous deals, which further exacerbates the previous points.

Incredibly low PTO, even with the new model. But, as you'll be reminded constantly by HR and management, it's OK to go ""negative"" on your PTO. And then you get to literally be in debt to the company if you leave. Besides, this doesn't change the effective number of days you have to work with in the long run; going negative now just means waiting even longer to take your next day off.

Medical plan is fine, not great.

401k match very low."

Dallas' leaders fostered a great community, and you actually felt valued as an individual vs. just a revenue generator. Budget for ongoing professional development is a nice perk.","Slalom Dallas vs. Slalom Denver vs. Slalom (Insert office) all operate like individual companies - in all aspects. I tried to transfer from Slalom Dallas to Slalom Denver for over a year and eventually had to resign from the company due to Slalom Denver continuing to hire external candidates vs. facilitating my transfer. I had perfect reviews from Slalom Dallas, had led my own engagements with great client feedback, and had interviewed with Denver staff who said they’d do their best to facilitate the transfer asap. After dealing with Slalom Denver dragging their feet for over a year on the transfer, and with Slalom’s National Team also refusing to help facilitate a transfer, I resigned and joined a different local Denver firm. 

Every office culture is different, and while they are trying to streamline it, the reality is there is little to no oversight from Corporate for how each office handles its operations. I’d give Slalom Dallas 5 stars, and I’d give Slalom Denver 1 star for how they treated me worse than they would an external interview candidate."

1250,Slalom,Love it here!,2017-02-17,5.0,Principal Consultant,The people who work here are truly team oriented. The on-boarding process is pretty good and the company encourages all employees to continue to develop in their career. They even offer unlimited Personal Development funding. The variety of clients is amazing and the opportunities for growth are endless. Compensation is good in terms of salary and earned bonuses.,Parking for the Seattle location is expensive and the company reimbursement only covers a portion. The 401k match is low and the PTO per year is really low.
1251,Slalom,Good place to transition to a local consulting firm,2017-02-16,4.0,Consultant,"1.  No travel if you don't want it.  It's a good place to transition to if you're in a big 4 firm and burned out on constant travel.
2.  Work life balance can be great.  Depending on the project and how involved (or not) you want to be in the firm, you can have excellent work life balance.
3.  You can work on some meaningful projects.  Some of the projects I worked on gave me good stories to tell (I presented in front of a billionaire software entrepreneur, with minimal handholding.  That would have never happened at a big 4 firm.)  Other projects are staff aug, and rather routine.
4.  They really do care about the staff.  Compared to big 4 firms, you will not have to fight for time off, and they will work with you to accommodate your needs, as long as you communicate proactively.
5.  If you are new to the San Francisco area, you have a social / support network.","1.  It's still a consulting firm, with all the associated baggage.
2.  Culty cliquey culture.  There is a lot of Slalom Kool-Aid.  If you like to keep your work life at work and independent from your personal life, it can feel hard to fit in, and move up.
3.  Benefits and comp are not great compared to other companies, especially the reduced PTO when you start.  These are improving, but when you see what 
clients pay vs. what you take home, you realize there's a LOT of overhead.  All the events and the annual out of town retreat for all the staff and family are nice, but I'd rather have that $ devoted to improved compensation and benefits.
4.  Introverts might find the culture challenging.  If you don't feel like broadcasting how ""Slalom-azing"" you are all the time, it might be hard for to fit in."
1252,Slalom,Favoritism,2017-02-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work-life balance, close to restaurants for lunch, open floor concept.","In Corporate Services, the work environment and culture is very hostile and a favoritism environment. To elaborate more on that, if you did not fit into the “cool” circle or fall into the “favorite” bucket, you were slated for failure in your career.  The manager had already pre-determined who would be in the “favorite list” versus the “non-favorite” list. If you are in the “favorite” list, then you are provided opportunities to gain more knowledge, lead projects, and get praised for not doing much work in front of the whole team. However, if you fall into the “non-favorite” list, you get slotted to fail in your work and career and have to live with a fear of being fired if you made any mistake. For example, employees that are surfing the web all day and are part of the “favorite” list, are promoted within a year to 2 years of being on the job; but if you are truly a dedicated hard-worker, you will not see a future in this company. Also, if senior leadership tells you that the job you are in is not a good fit for you and is super excited to see you go instead of helping you find a role that is a good fit for you to grow in, then that is a big red flag that this is not a good company to be a part of, with no growth at all (unless of course, you are the favorite to your manager).  If you try to find other opportunities within the company - outside of Corporate Services, senior leadership immediately looks upon you as a traitor to the company. Of course, there are some senior leadership employees who truly care about your career, but are outside of the day to day scope of the internal teams to know what is going on. Lots of micro-managing occurs and you don't have a say in projects or provide opinions. Projects are only slated for favorites. Secret meetings occur behind closed doors and its comes as a surprise to the team when some new project has already been assigned to one of the favorites. There is no open communication between the manager and employee or the team overall."

1254,Slalom,"Growth of people, growth of profits",2017-02-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Career growth opportunities are good. You can get promoted. You can carve your own road.,"Company seems to be re-defining itself, its culture.  The emphasis on purpose, inclusion,  and living our ""why"" is encouraging."
1255,Slalom,"Three years in, this is definitely the best company I've ever worked for",2017-02-06,5.0,Consultant Manager,"- Compensation is fair.  I've personally witnessed people receiving 10+% raises because leaders did a market evaluation and found that their folks were not making enough.  I've always felt well-compensated.
- Culture is outstanding.  If you stay plugged-in to company events, you will feel like part of a family.  I've gone through some personal issues recently, and the amount of people who have reached out offering support, hugs, dinner, beers has been hugely impactful to me.  There is a family feel with this company that I have only found at one other place in my career.  And as we grow, it's clear the leaders are concerned about fostering this culture and not letting it slip away.
- Events are top-notch.  Skedaddle, the yearly all-expense getaway weekend in the mountains, continues to be a huge draw for me.  I love getting to kick back and spend the weekend with coworkers/friends.  The Christmas party, summer picnic, Rockies opener tailgate, and other events are all well-done and fun.
- The company is willing to be self-critical.  The Widening the Circle training, for all of it's ""diversity rah rah"" has a great introspective point to it.  We identified the ""typical Slalomer"": avid drinker, young, preppy, college-educated, white, among others.  And it makes us think about the people we may be missing out on because we aren't stepping out of our typical circles to find folks that are just as good if not better, but don't look/act like a typical Slalomer.  And I've seen results from the training: we offer more events where drinking isn't a central point--variety is great!
- Leadership is open.  I've witnessed very frank questions from coworkers to both office and national leadership, and have heard frank answers.  The leadership at all levels (barring a few folks in the Denver office) is very approachable, personable, and honest.  When things go wrong, they own it.  When things don't pan out, they analyze why not and tell us.  We have insight into company financials and plans on both year and multi-year forecasts.
- Work/life balance is modeled by leadership for the most part.  I've seen practice directors take additional time off after having children.  I've had coworkers who moved to a 4-day week to support their personal life needs.  All of these changes are supported wherever possible.  Consultants have the right to say ""no"" to a project that won't fit their desired work/life balance.","- Benefits, particularly 401k match, could use some work.  The company has made strides in the benefits area, but they are still not at the level I expect from a world-class company.
- The ITP process (Intent to Pursue--the promotion process) is not fun for most people that endure it.  I've seen two quality coworkers get stuck in ITP with objectives met but no appetite for their promotion.  We lost both of them to other companies because they were fed up with not having the promotion occur.  ITP is different for different people and roles, as well.  Some people it seems don't even go through it, while for others it takes a year.  I haven't talked to a single person who has gone through ITP that thought it was valuable.
- If you aren't willing to put in the time to see and be seen at outside events, your mobility is limited.  I don't necessarily see this as a con, but I'm putting it out there for those who expect quality work to be the sole promotion force.  Slalom still has a solid group of Consultants who just want to do the work and go home, and that is supported and not in any way deterred."

There are a lot of social activities that are company sponsored, such as an annual retreat, team happy-hour, and meet-and-greets, plus occasional affinity group activities.  Professional development opportunities exist, but access to them can be highly dependent on your manager.  The most talented group is the recruiting department - they genuinely find good great people to be consultants.  The place is full of smart and skilled interesting and diverse people at the consultant level.  Managers are highly variable in quality, but many are good.  As with much of consulting, salaries can be high, health benefits are about average, and leadershp does  appear to be trying to do something about the 401K plan which has definitely been lacking.","(Atlanta specific.)  While individual managers are often good, overall leadership is missing.  The senior leadership team is conflict-avoidant and this cascades through the company.  ""Get along, be happy, don't disagree"" is a mantra you should get used to.  If you have a family, or are introverted  you may find the social aspects of the company burdensome.  Failure to participate in sufficient social gatherings can cause you to be labeled an ""outsider"" or ""not well known"".  More than one colleague reported their annual review including a high personal performance rating, but some comments about needing to improve on ""getting to know people in the company"" which drew their overall rating down.  Strangely, being too well known can also be a problem.  Being a smaller company, there is a challenge promoting talented people to greater responsibility.  To be fair, Slalom is actively trying to address this problem."

- Nice people - Everyone I have met is truly a nice and respectful person.","- Staff augmentation - They place people into roles versus sell projects and deploy project teams. All ""projects"" I have seen have been staffing work. 

- Lack of transparency regarding type of work during hiring process - That's the nice way of saying they were not forthright with the type of work in the pipeline. 

- Work does not align with interests or skill sets - Again, they are placing people into slots that a client or another consulting firm needs filled. There is little information regarding how you can align yourself with suitable work. 

- Employees with highly variable skill sets and levels of competency are all branded as ""consultant"". This seems to reinforce the staffing model."

I've been here for over a year as a Recruiter and have had an amazing experience. The company does a great job of touting its culture and local model as some of their main differentiators. 

They have built their culture around the idea of reaching for and realizing your vision (whatever that may be) that will help you to love your work and your life. A simple proposition, but extremely impactful and resonates with me every day. When I interviewed with Slalom, what drew me to them was the idea of a unique type of culture that aimed to be different than other companies and the idea that you could really love your work was really refreshing. The Core Values intrigued me, as well as the breadth of capabilities and services the firm provides in software engineering, big data, cloud infrastructure and customer engagement. 

The opportunities for career growth particularly interested me, as they leave the door open for trying different things (Analyst program to step into a consulting path, Sales, Operations, etc).

The bulk of the work Slalom sells is staff augmentation / individual contributor project manager roles - the kind of work management consultants in other firms would actively avoid. 
- the culture of the firm creates a cheerleader like atmosphere, where leadership routinely exaggerates how interesting or impactful the work actually is. 
- not a proper meritocracy; promotions are as political or more so than in the large consulting firms.
- this culture also incents positive attitude over talent. Compared with peers at a competitor such as Accenture, Slalom employees are generally sub-par. 
- the firm grew up as a technology / data services firm and that remains the only practice area where the firm can actually compete

I have great colleagues that I am happy to count as friends and hang out with outside of work. Healthcare premiums did not increase this year.","When you read a lot of these ""this place is great"" reviews, you'll notice that many of them are written by former big-four consultants who are new to the firm. I think their perspective is correct, it IS a better place than big-four. However, this firm is hiring so many big-four folks that we are beginning to look and sound like a big-four firm. 

This isn't necessarily a welcome change for those of us with tenure. Long-term employees who are looking to expand and grow into new roles, or resurrect roles we once played before we got typecast into a particular role, are often overlooked for the ""fancier, shinier"" new hire. People managers are inconsistently successful in advocating for their people; if you have one who is politically connected and cares enough to invest their political capital in you, then you're in good shape; if not, well, good luck.

This office also is struggling with retaining female leaders. The most senior female leader just announced her resignation. Who knows what will happen. Given how things have operated lately, we can only assume that this means that ""new, extremely talented"" women will be hired from outside (probably big 4) before any current consultants are given the chance to step up and be developed into these roles."
1293,Slalom,Life here is pretty darn great!!,2016-11-04,5.0,Principal Consultant,"Leaders actually ""walk the talk"" - so refreshing that the things said are actually true, that the actions match the words.  The interview process is lengthy for good reason - it's really important to get the right fit for the culture and it's obvious they turn away a lot of folks that won't fit.  The efforts they make for top down, bottom up and across the middle regarding culture are evident.  People here are happy.  Dare I say, ""it's fun""!!","Shockingly and yet wonderfully, I have none."

1295,Slalom,Disappointing,2016-11-01,1.0,Consultant,"A great opportunity to get a tour of local companies from the inside.   

Slalom is very proud of their frat house culture that promotes after hours camaraderie fueled by lots of alcohol.  You are guaranteed to run into a Slalom consultant in hottest late night venues in the city.  Consultants get rewarded for arranging happy hours.  Skipping social events is frowned upon.  There is an annual drink-a-thon weekend, which is a ton of fun to go once.","Project work is mostly staff augmentation.  Consultants get harassed if they dare to point out their work is not meaningful or challenging.  Any constructive criticism towards the project or company leaders is received negatively.  There are no opportunities for advancement or learning.  Consultants rarely get stretch roles or opportunities to grow professionally.  The management team is cliquey and not transparent in their communication.  Odd for a team of people who claim to be organizational effectiveness ""experts"".  Promotions are based on ones ability to become friends with one of the leaders and/or to endure boring assignments without complaints.  People who leave or complain are labeled as someone who 'failed to understand consulting.' 

Work-life balance is hugely dependent on the location of the client.  Majority of the clients are in the suburbs and require long commutes."

1303,Slalom,Senior Software Engineer,2016-10-24,4.0,Senior Engineer,"Great company culture, work-life balance. Scrum agile practiced regularly. The dev culture was low-key and relaxed without too many fires. Little overtime unless you really want to push for yourself. Work from home / remote work once a week is common, brown bags and happy hours. With consulting, whether you have fun at work depends a lot on landing the right project with the right team. Building a product for a small company with a lively team will make work much more fun than getting stuck on large boring healthcare mega-projects.","Consulting projects were getting boring and repetitive. More health care, more slow-moving clients, more meetings, more testing iterations and slower dev cycles. Much of the project excitement depends on the landing the right client and right team. Quite political and small, so if you have a bad day, word spreads quickly.

The caveat with consulting is that it's best when all engineers are billable, which means that if you hit it out of the ballpark and complete a complex and challenging project with lots of visibility you may just end up on a boring test role for months until another billable client comes up."

1311,Slalom,Slalom is the best place I have ever worked!,2016-10-13,5.0,,"Where to start - there are so many amazing things about this company!  
1) the leadership team - both our local and corporate leaders are top notch.  They really care about the employees and want to help us succeed in whatever our individual career goals are - key word being individual - we don't have the up and out model here so all of our employees can really take ownership over our own careers. 
2) culture - we have a supporting, inclusive culture at Slalom.  We value work life balance, and not just for families, but for all of our employees to pursue their passions both at work and outside of work.   
3) core values - we truly live our core values!  It isn't just something we talk about, we live them every day.
4) opportunities to get involved - similar to being able to have ownership over our own careers, we can also get as involved in Slalom as we want!  There are many clubs and groups, social events, meetings, etc. so our consultants can come together outside of work.  On the same note, there isn't pressure to do more.  It is 100% up to you!","It is hard to think of many!  See ""advice to management"" for a couple of areas for opportunity to improve."
1312,Slalom,"Good for a while, but culture is on the decline...",2016-10-10,2.0,,"When I first joined Slalom it was fantastic. We worked hard but maintained balance while doing it. Talent was top-notch, almost everyone had an ex-consulting background. Over time this started to shift as staffing needs rapidly picked up and the standards seemed to get watered down. There is still some great talent at Slalom, but if culture doesn't begin trending towards a more positive work environment I'm afraid others will find better opportunities. Paul is a fantastic leader and did a great job building a culture that attracts good talent. Pay is good, better than many competitors if you negotiate well.","- Slalom culture got lost on client engagements. Because everyone was sitting onsite with a client, typically we ended up adopting a client's culture, vs protecting our people from their negative environments. 
- I was disappointed that leadership wasn't more involved with the work we were actually doing on clients, they seem more focused on developing new business.
- Few leaders actually understand Agile software development and how to scope a project according to agile practices. Almost every custom design/development SOW had a promised scope, which led to painful client negotiations and wasted time re-estimating. This also often led to consultants working crazy hours in order to meet deadlines.
- Promotions were based on how everyone feels about you vs what you actually accomplish - cliques became very evident here, if you weren't 'in', you risk not moving up. The annual review process never felt like everyone was evaluated equally.
- ""No unwanted travel"" policy only held true to a degree... I had several clients over my tenure for which I had to travel and didn't have much say in the matter.
- It became really hard for me to trust people here, there is often gossipy chatter in the back channels.
- Work life balance is good compared to road-warrior style travel, but there isn't really much flexibility otherwise"
1313,Slalom,Good people leaving Dallas for better culture,2016-10-07,1.0,,Pay is good and there is training available if you want it,"Culture has changed a lot in the past 6 months and many people who were around for the past 5 years are leaving due to this. Leadership is driven more by numbers than taking care of their people. Feels like a lot of good people are leaving. ""Diversity"" is stressed but this means promoting women to leadership positions(about 50% of the office leadership is women and the office as a whole may be 15% women). the old GM moving up hurts the culture as people are not happy with the new culture (money driven vs. people driven)"
1314,Slalom,Great Experience,2016-10-05,5.0,Consultant,"I just started, but I can see a huge difference here as compared to the large consulting firm that I just came from.  The interview process, the on-boarding process, and time at the office when not on a project: always consistent - you get treated well.  

It's early to tell but it seems, so far, like this is the place to be - a great company with lots of smart, humble, kind people, with a vision, a future and the plan to make them happen.  

I have an opportunity where, if I work hard and use my technical and soft skills well, I can further my career, help clients, and help my company all at the same time.  Win-win-win.

It's nice to be at a company where you have an opportunity and the chance to love your future.  Just give me a chance, that's all I need - I can do the rest.

In my experience as an internal employee, I witnessed that those who are proficient at stroking the ego of leadership or were chosen as a favorite by leadership are the ones who benefit from career growth. It is not based on skillset, but rather if your manager does not feel threatened by you. Managers I have come across will put their own growth ahead of yours, and you will not be allowed to grow before they do.

Advice to prospective internal employees - if you have growth aspirations, especially interest in consulting, make sure your manager has googly eyes for you within the first year. If you do not see this in a short amount of time, you will not be allowed to reach your goals."
1316,Slalom,Great company within the consulting model,2016-09-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Work life balance
2. Very smart and experienced professionals
3. Annual company retreat
4. FaceTime with leadership.  Within a practice area it's relatively flat so it's very common for the most junior consultant to be transparent with the director or MD
5. Leadership actually listens to the feedback that you provide and most of the time will only staff you on a project that you agree to be on
6. Much less bureaucratic than the big four
7. Cell phone and transit expenses subsidized.  (It's a local consulting model!)","1. Staff aug projects - this is case by case but I believe leadership is fully aware and making efforts to move towards true consulting work
2. PTO is improving but needs to be better since it includes any time off such as sick days and we have fewer holidays than the competition and even many of our clients
3. Deals with the same problems as our big 4 competitors that can lead to a negative stigma of companies hiring consultants. For example, having an office wide focus on increasing and measuring utilization and placing utilization targets, hence creating a vested interest for consultants to bill more hours.  Perhaps the right answer to increasing utilization is restructuring how we sell work, or finding the appropriate work to sell, rather than asking consultants to ""work"" (Bill) more hours"

1329,Slalom,Home sweet Slalom,2016-08-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The title of my review is truly representative of how I feel about coming to work each and every day. I think I have a unique story about how I found Slalom. I graduated from college in 2014 and struggled to find a position, company, and culture that felt like it would be a long-term fit for me. My boyfriend was experiencing something similar but in 2015 found Slalom through friends. He was nervous during the interview process and we would have lengthy discussions about the individuals he met during interview rounds, the job responsibilities and the company as a whole. Through this I became a champion for Slalom and I didn't even know it. I felt confident based on his takeaways that this company was the right opportunity for him. He was hired in July of 2015 and has been beyond happy ever since. Fast forward to January 2016 and I am now ready to find a new job opportunity, something that I can make a career out of. My boyfriend had been recruiting me to Slalom since his very first day of work and once I agreed I was ready to job search, he sent me a position on the Marketing team. Each conversation I had during the interviewing process ignited more of a desire to join this team and this organization. To make a long story short, the past month and a half has been the best I have spent post-college graduation. My team is supportive, thoughtful, committed, and humorous. The company is progressive, genuine, and ambitious. I love going into work and am looking forward to the months and years ahead!","I was brought on during a busy time for the team so some of the on-boarding process (specific to my team) was a bit rushed. However, I am up to speed on everything and don't feel like I am missing anything because of it."

1337,Slalom,A welcome change from a lifetime with the big consulting firms,2016-07-27,5.0,Solution Architect,"Slalom is such a welcome relief after a lifetime (10+) spent with the large consulting firms.  
So here are some of the things that I have come to appreciate at Slalom.
- Nearly everyone has spent significant time in consulting....so everyone is a professional.  Project  start producing value quickly because everyone around you knows how to do the small things well (imagine never having to review an associate / analysts ppt again)
- Everyone has skills
- People are helpful
- People don't appear to be in this huge rush to get promoted - people just want to do well.  That makes the promotion rate race much nicer
- ""Do the right thing, Always"" (one of our core values) - they really do it here.  I recently saw slalom re-write a SOW because they found a better way to add value for the client on day 2 of a project
- None of the hierarchy....well yes there are different levels - but I don't feel that I need to worship the ground that Directors or MDs walk on.  If an MD / Director is wrong on something - they are cool with it.  Directors / Managing Directors / General Managers here are normal people, they are fun to talk to and treat you really well
- Everyone is really supportive...everyone finds ways to help or protect you when you need it
- Work life balance - every conversation travel starts with ""only if you wan to go"" and they mean it
- They are open to Monday to Wednesday or whatever travel you need to do.  Unlike other places that make you do Monday to Thursday no matter what - at Slalom - they ask you if you really need to travel, and then they ask if you really wan to travel, and if you say yes - they work with you to find ways to make the trips shorter and less frequent
- Lots of former big consulting partners and directors.....but its good...cause only the good ones that took care of their people are here
- people ask me if I want to work on a project...they don't just assign me to it
- if you want to build it...even if it is outside of your area - they will let you do that
- open to new ideas...to anyone that has ever tried using a unique approach to solving problem instead of the supported ISO / NIST ""best practice"" at other consulting firms - you will really be happy to know that Slalom will let you create a bestpoke solution for your client that does is different from what ISO / NIST say you should do
- They recognize that not every solution requires a new technology - so basically you won't be stuck implementing a technology solution that won't solve the client's problem
- low overhead (they are chill on WBS codes, pre-project approvals, change orders, etc.)","- I have heard that sometimes you need to bite the bullet and take projects that are outside of your core skill set or area of interest....but really - we're in consulting that happens all the time
- people smile too much....its making me wonder if I should get my teeth whitened (just kidding)
- 401k is a bit weak (1.5%) but I have heard that they are considering fixing that
- Year 1 PTO = 17 days + 1 floating holiday (it goes up by 1 day every year until you hit 25 days PTO + 1 floating holiday).  Slalom starts with less PTO than the big guys - but seriously - I never even came close to using my entire PTO balance with my previous companies.  So 18 total days in year 1 is good in my book."

No travel, local model.","The leadership team can seem a bit like a college frat. Also, Slalom lacks a point-of-view in many industry verticals and aren't seen as experts compared to competitors, whether its utilities, retail, or health care / life sciences.

1343,Slalom,Not Great,2016-07-17,1.0,Senior Consultant,This company works on an extreme local model.,"Lack in Depth of Leadership.  Most managers are new and have only worked with the company a year.  33% new hires in the past year, equals over expansion and not managing the expansion well.  This company was born out of a staffing agency and has emerged to a lower paying ""consulting firm"" based on a staffing agency model.  This is also why the benefits are so poor - low amount of vacation days, poor if not non-existent 401k matching.  No upward mobility opportunities.  No opportunities to transfer to other locations, due to staffing agency model.  Due to bench time and project lifecycles, requires long hours to make it to billable hours performance bonus."

1352,Slalom,So disappointed,2016-06-16,1.0,Management Consultant,Initially-when I started at Slalom everything was great...,I have been with slalom for nearly 8 years and stayed with them mostly because of the project I am on. Over the last year I have gotten a new boss who has harassed me and been very verbally abusive. I was told by my contact who placed me from Slalom that our jobs as consultants is to make sure that the projects run smoothly for our clients. I did that-however the treatment has gotten worse. I have brought this up not only with my Slalom contact but other management from HR. This is not the first issue that I have tried escalating. I had a problem 4 years ago on a project and they did not care to even listen. I'm sorry to say it but this place is over rated. Good reviews have gotten to the company very quickly but the treatment they give is just terrible. My contact at Slalom is absolutely terrible and just a tool. How she got the job she has blows my mind. The verbal abuse I have gotten is not appropriate and I will say their sister companies are no better.

Still good at implementing feedback from consultant surveys.,"Offices have become rife with in efficiency over the years.  Underperforming consultants can fly under the radar and don't get ""counseled out"" early enough putting pressure on their team and account management to cover for them. ELT is severely dysfunctional and it is apparent throughout the org. SLT have been stripped of most power and doesn't make decisions although they are running the business. CSLs and PALs do 90% of the leadership work but are paid badly, underappreciated and given no career guidance to get to the next level.  To get promoted you have to pick the right MD and ride their coattails to the top. Expecting your performance to be decider of promotion is a myth: it is now purely a political game. And if one MD harbors a grudge against a consultant, it will severely impact their growth at the company. Sadly, this company made its mint by hiring big 4 consultants and thinking they would be different because of the local model but they have just become a big 4 firm that focuses on financials before people.   The company grew too fast and gave up its soul in the process."

Not necessarily a con, but you need to be very self motivated to succeed here."
1372,Slalom,Where Lazy Consultants Go,2016-05-03,2.0,Management Consultant,"Note: This review specifically applies to the Business Advisory Services (BAS) practice within the Chicago office as I have not had enough exposure to the other markets / practices.

Slalom is a great place to be if either of the two apply to you:
 
1) You just couldn't make it in the Big 4 or any other strategy firm
2) You've plateaued in your career, and you have no desire to grow, move up, or develop yourself professionally","Commute - Slalom will try to sell you on ""no travel / local projects."" What you'll find, however, is that all but a handful of clients are in the suburbs of Chicago. With limited public transportation options, you'll likely end up spending the same amount of time (if not more) sitting in Chicago traffic than if you were traveling.
 
Project Alignment - In interviews, you will be told that you have full control over your career. The reality of it, however, is that you are a plug and play consultant. You will be placed in the next open spot, regardless of your background or experience and you won't have much of a say in it. If you do, however, decide to voice your concerns, you will be talked into staying on the project for only ""X number of months,"" which can easily turn into years.
 
Projects - Anyone who has been in consulting knows how important it is to be staffed on a good project. He/she also knows thatso much of that is dependent on business development leaders. Unfortunately, what you'll find is that Client Service Partners (CSP) and Client Service Leaders (CSL) have absolutely no industry knowledge in the accounts they own. They don't know what they are selling most of the time, so what ultimately gets inked is grunt work the client doesn't even want to do.
 
Culture - Slalom puts a great deal of effort into organizing social gatherings and events. This is their way of compensating and covering up the major inadequacies in other areas: PTO, 401k benefits, annual bonuses to name a few. Lastly, while the office never fails to have a stocked kitchen with snacks and a fridge full of beer, this alone, from my perspective is not enough to call Slalom one of the ""Best Places to Work."""

Exciting to see the vision to long-term have an office in every major city in the world.","Slalom leaders have expressed a goal to become the world's most connected company.  Today, most people at Slalom will go above and beyond to help a co-worker.  Yet this is often done without the benefit of a great collaboration platform.

Above all else, Slalom says and truly believes in putting its people first. I can approach anyone on or off my team for help and should a personal matter arise, someone is always willing to step up in assistance with clients.

They do not do anything on a small scale when it comes to out-of-office activities (holiday parties, team outings) and they are extremely generous with these types of events.  Annual outing where you are allowed to bring a significant other for an entire weekend away from the office, with almost all of the expenses paid.  The former Chicago GM still sends an email on everyone's birthday or anniversary which pretty impressive considering the number of people that are now work in the Chicago office.","The company grew fast but some of the perks and benefits of this don't seem to have coincided with the growth.  The 401K match is still extremely low, the PTO is catching up but the work/life balance model seems to be inconsistent between teams.  Some members of leadership restrict or limit the ability for individuals to work remotely when between projects or even when they're on internal projects which isn't what was ""sold"" as a benefit during the interview and recruitment process.  It also seems like that as the company grew, employees were promoted into management positions due to tenure and not because they are qualified or have ""people management"" skills."

Good snacks, beer, etc.","Staff augmentation is a harsh reality of working for Slalom. They do not sell consulting services, they sell people. The roles they have available are not based on providing strategic consulting and developing plans based on collaboration with clients; they are based on selling 1-off roles where you are told what to do everyday. If you want your brain to go numb or be bored out of your mind, frustrated and feel undervalued...join Slalom.
 
Career paths at Slalom are a joke. They are so disorganized when it comes to career paths; they will feed you a line of BS when you interview but have not put the time or back office support toward determining what career paths look like for each practice area. They do not promote from within, when they need to fill a leadership position they look externally and do not coach or mentor internal talent.  If you want to work in the same boring consulting role forever…join Slalom.
 
There is also an enormous focus on the bottom line to the point that work/life balance is ignored and you are made to feel like it is your own fault or problem if it isn't being managed appropriately (and when working in a staff aug role there is often times little opportunity to discuss balance with a client.) The vacation policy also contributes to poor balance; you are given 2-weeks that are accrued but you're ""encouraged"" to make up your vacation hours at your client to keep your chargeability rate high as well as keep the overall chargeable hours for the office high. If you want your social life to end…join Slalom.
 
The rumor mill is worse than a high school locker room. Everyone is so hungry for the next promotion or even just a pat on the back that the gossip and slandering that take place are utterly shocking. Clients commented on it, people that work with consultants both directly and indirectly commented on it. It is so inappropriate. If you want to be ripped on behind your back by a bunch of people that smile at you on a daily basis…join Slalom.
 
Bottom line, they are in a period of growth that is being severely mismanaged and unless you want to work your butt off while being slandered by the dork sitting next to you … think again before joining Slalom."

You work with talented, hardworking, and fun individuals and are given the opportunity to work with executives across multiple industry verticals. There are a lot of social events and team outings. You have more control over your destiny here - whether it's to get off the road and achieve some work life balance or it's to build a new service offering.",Paid time off and holidays could be better.

The culture is fantastically inclusive, tremendous diversity (at least in the offices I've been to or worked with, including Dallas, SF, Seattle, Atlanta, and NY), lots of mentoring, training, unlimited training budget, great office (when I get to go there :-), and overall just a great company to work for.","Like every company, there's a tendency for folks to silo and work more closely within their own practice/area of expertise, but that's something that can be worked on. Some offices have a focus on maximizing billable hours on top of all the internal meetings, training, and travel time which can be a little frustrating. But then again, it's never been strictly enforced but more of a guidance, so not really a big deal."

I was lucky enough to work on several projects at Slalom during my two years there which introduced me to a wide range of industries, clients, and skill sets. I was grateful that my teams were constantly changing and I had the ability to grow in areas I wasn't familiar with (i.e. strategy consulting) and perfect areas that I was skilled in (technology consulting). I never felt as though I was micro managed, and I appreciated that.","With any consulting firm, it's hard to feel like ""a part of the team"" when you're always on client sites. You can feel disconnected from the company as a whole, but Slalom makes an effort to host events consistently. I also wish there were more reviews and touch points with senior leadership.

1423,Slalom,Mini-Accenture,2016-01-06,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"What remains of the initial culture that existed 5 years ago is still a positive. Each employee is empowered to say ""No"" which doesn't exist in many other organizations (whether they be industry or professional services). Work/Life balance remains a priority across the organization...In Denver this holds true depending upon whom you work for. More and more of the account leadership resources are pushing to sell solutions (likely based upon pressure from National) which do not exist or are otherwise immature. This results in long hours and poor delivery. In a relatively small market such as Denver, Slalom cannot afford poor delivery.","After 5 years with Slalom I've watched it shift from a very people and client focused organization to a model shaped, by and large, from Accenture. Much of the leadership team in the Denver office is ex-ACN and are ever changing the culture and approach to mimic that of their previous employer. No longer is the focus on aligning closely with the client but to deliver a solution ... often one that doesn't exist. Communication within leadership and down to those delivering work is near non-existent. The result is an expectation by the project teams to know what leadership expects even with the absence of clear communication. This is accepted by senior leadership and even fostered so long as revenue numbers are met. Like ACN, sales = success regardless of the price to people or culture."
1424,Slalom,Doesn't follow through on recruiting committments,2016-01-04,2.0,Management Consultant,"People are nice, the work is descent and can't beat the local model","I was told a lot of things while I was being recruited and so far nothing has come to fruition. I was told there is no budget for training but when I asked to go to a conference that I have attended for years I was told I can only go if a client goes. But people in other cities are able to go. Its a learning opportunity and I specifically asked while being recruited if I would be able to go and I was told yes. This is just one example, but so far, they have dropped the ball on all the things they told me to sell me on Slalom and make the jump. I'm 50% regretful of my decision and that's never happened before."
1425,Slalom,A decent staff aug firm,2015-12-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Strong family oriented culture: I honestly do believe that the some of the leaders are really trying to inculcate a great culture and value employees. 

- Work hours: During my 3 years at Slalom, there may have been 2 weeks where I billed more than 55 hours. Prior to Slalom, I was used to billing 60 hours on average every week. So that is some respite. If you work on downtown clients, then you get a lot of personal time to either do firm initiatives or pursue personal goals. If you work in the burbs then it is a different story.

- Great office space: If you are lucky and staffed downtown you will get to use it often as well. If you are in the burbs then not so much.

- Great parties: Slalom throws amazing parties. I though the concept of Rendezvous was pretty neat where you get to disconnect from work all weekend. You can bring in a guest and its fully paid.","- Lack of full disclosure in the interview process: I came from Big 4s. I really liked the work I did but did not want to travel. When  I interviewed with Slalom, I was quoted that ""90% of the projects were team based and 10% was staff aug""). After I joined Slalom, I realized that it was actually the reverse. Maybe 5% of their projects are team based. I also was told that I would be ""local"" and most of their projects were downtown which also was not true. I understand that they are trying to cater to a different kind of market - role based vs. project based and it makes sense for their size and goals (local consulting). What I did not appreciate was being presented with incorrect facts. Had I known this up front, I would not have accepted the role with Slalom as I did not want to do staff aug work or be stuck in a car for several hours a day. I would rather fly. 

- Travel to burbs: Although Slalom advertises no travel, they are not open about the fact that no travel by plane doesn’t mean no travel by car. Most of the time I was at Slalom, my client was anywhere from 1.5-2 hrs drive away and that is just one way. So even though I worked only 40-45 hrs a week, I spent 15 hrs a week just commuting in my car to the suburbs. I can take driving couple of hours in total on any given day, anything over that is frustrating and physically exhausting. 

- Staff Aug Roles: I jumped from client to client on roles which I had no interest in and which did not align with my skill sets at all. The onus is always on the consultant to grow his/her role rather than on the CSL or CSP to sell the appropriate role. I have had numerous conversations with my People Manager and other leaders at Slalom on this but no action was taken about it. On the flip side, once the clients saw what I was capable of, they always gave me better roles and raving reviews. But I always had to wait for a few months every time to prove myself.  You know a place is not for you when the client recognizes your potential but your own firm doesn’t or when the client tells you to join them instead.  

- Career Progression: You definitely have to be part of the in-crowd to get promoted. This firm definitely values firm initiatives more than client work. I have seen individuals who were rolled off the client due to performance issues but who did organize a lot of happy hours get promoted. There is no clear definition on what the next level is or how to get promoted to it. 

- Leadership: Finally, I have found very few true leaders at this firm. A lot of them are resource managers with fancy titles. But very few whom you can look up to and see this is the guy/gal I want to be in 10 years. I worked at Slalom for about 3 years and I have had several conversations on all the above with my People Manager and leaders at my office. I was ready to compromise on some of them. But disappointingly, I did not have one single leader follow up with me on any of my conversations which just showed me the value they placed on me. It was like the conversations never happened. 

Many consultants in Slalom feel the same way from conversations I have had with them. They either decide to suck it up and be miserable or leave the company and go somewhere else."
1426,Slalom,Premier Staff Aug Firm,2015-12-24,2.0,Consultant,"Slalom prides itself in its office culture and family like atmosphere - which really shows when you walk in the office.  You feel very welcomed.  The office is very vibrant with free snacks, shuffleboard table, keg, and etc.  They understand that majority of the former consultants lacked in work/life/balance therefore are very cognizant of their time.  If you are looking to get paid descent, don't care about career progression, and would like to work 40 hour week, this is the greatest firm for you.

In addition, their marketing department does a tremendous job overall.  The marketing campaigns are on point and promotes awareness across all the different office.  Doesn't directly translate to the projects that you will be working on but I'll give them credit - the marketing is on point.  They leverage modern technology to make themselves seem like the best firm to work for - and its working, you'll see slalom on many awards and social media.","Here comes the issue for most people at the firm.  I was promised that I will be engaged in Management/Technology Consulting projects.....  However, 85-90% of the jobs were staff augmentation where the consultants are glorified PM and BA's that triaged failed internal IT projects locally.  For those that have worked on high-value added projects in their previous life will walk away disappointed and most people wouldn't find out about this until they on-boarded a project.  My first project was fielding support tickets for the IT department.  Majority of the consultants that I talked to had the same complaints and not a single person seemed to be satisfied.  Every discussion I had were discouraging.

The so-called CSL's (who nobody at the firm really knows how they add value) will lie and sell you on projects to ensure that their accounts will remain happy.  Their model is to become a ""value-add staff aug"" and eventually get to other internal projects for clients by delivering existing projects.  So that leaves majority of the consultants to do the grunt work and have them talk their way up the chain by themselves - not a great strategy and I rather just work for the client in that case (which is happening more often than not).  In addition most companies will go with a higher tier consulting firms that can provide them with a whole solution, not to fill gaps like Slalom does with Staff aug.

The company does have expertise in certain areas, but that's if you join the national team which has a very similar model as the Big 4 where you will be traveling to certain clients.  If you're local, you have no choice but to be stuck on Staff Aug projects.  

Lastly, they pride themselves as a ""flat"" structure and everyone is at the same level.  Horrible idea. No structure for people means no career progression and any ambitious consultant will not like that.  They did start creating structure as I was leaving but most promotions were based on who you knew in the office and not based on skill level.  I think this is done on purpose, but as you get larger as an organization its an necessary evil.  Probably something to work on.

All in all - Slalom is a great Staff Aug firm, but I wish they didn't lie to themselves and gave employees empty promises of exciting projects in the pipeline.  Be real about it, you measure yourself on run rate, not the quality of the projects which is the business model and I am 100% okay with that if the transparency is there.  

I hated being lied to and it happened right in front of my face by many of the CSL's.  Overall, it was a tough decision to leave because the office culture was great, some of the leadership were respectable, but at the end of the day, I couldn't deal with the lack of career progression, constant complaints, and uninteresting staff aug projects.  I don't think it would have been as big of an issue for me if this was transparent to begin with, but no one's going to join the firm if they knew what they were getting themselves into.  So I'm not entirely surprised.

Oh yea, and the benefits are horrific."

I just didn't love where and how I was doing it. I've been a consultant for just over 10 years at a few larger firms. I've had bigger titles, more responsibility and still didn't feel able to contribute the way I am able to at Slalom. There are no egos, no pretense, just great people who want to work hard for our clients. It's an ideal environment if you're looking to make real connections with your colleagues and clients.

All they truly need are bodies to fill chairs, they don't utilize or value the analytical rigor that permeates culture at the Big 4 firms.  It's a sink or swim culture where they throw experienced hires into IM projects and expect that the natural ""leaders"" will rise to the top.  This makes sense if you are staffed on the type of projects in which you've led in the past.  However, if you're coming from a strategy or analytics background you may not have experience in leading a typical IM project and will be staffed (and treated) as an analyst.  

3) Tedious staff-aug work
Fully expect to be bored mindless and be sitting in a chair with absolutely no clear project goals.    They need you to look busy rather than develop interesting client solutions (that are in your area of expertise).  Ultimately, if you have subject matter expertise in a particular field (strategy, advanced analytics, etc.), don't expect that your first job be driving business strategy or generating insights using analytics.  Instead, expect to be sitting in a seat.

4) Lack of compensation and benefits
Read the reviews... they're all true.  It's kind of ridiculous."

Slalom embodies culture of collaboration and teamwork. Truly the best place I've ever worked.,It is fun being part of a growing company but sometimes I'm nervous we are growing to fast.

1451,Slalom,Staff Aug shop run by inept middle management,2015-10-26,1.0,Consultant,"- Decent work life balance
- Many social events
- For the most part friendly people","- Staff aug: it's been repeated often.  Slalom likes to say they're nothing like the big 4, which is true, because the big 4 engage in long-term, strategic projects, while Slalom fills bit roles in which an employee might be asked to run pivot tables at a client for a week (no joke).  if you're interested in actually learning something beneficial for your career, steer clear.

- Middle management:  the solution principles, consultant managers, blah blah blah are some of the most inept and pretentious people i've ever worked with in my career.  in my time at the company, all my projects were 'overseen' by one of these invisible entities, who would be offsite somewhere and send an email once a week to check on progress when in reality they have no idea about what you do day-to-day, and then be the ones responsible for writing your review.  They'll base 100% of the review on client feedback, so good luck if dealing with a difficult client, since his/her word is golden.  from what I could see, none of these middle management did any real work, just kept trying to create more staff aug roles that they could try to claim as their own in addition to just hitting the approve button on people's timesheets.  Aside from a few select fellow consultants, I did not meet a single soul in any level above consultant who I would classify as someone i would personally work with.

- Culture: I'm all for a positive work environment, but Slalom just takes it to new, unhealthy extremes.  The quarterlies consisted of hourlong presentations in which vague and meaningless awards are given to people as if it were the Oscars, complete with applause and hollering.  The happy hours are plentiful, until you realize it's the same cliquish people who've managed to tolerate teh company for more than 2 years going to every one.

- Salary/Benefits:  benefits are mediocre, aside from the cell phone and transportation reimbursement.  I still can't figure out why there's a variable model salary that's available (thank god I chose full salary), other than to trick new consultants into taking it so that they can be paid half salary while on the bench (and trust me, there's a LOT of bench time)."

1453,Slalom,In-fighting and power struggles in Atlanta office,2015-10-20,2.0,Management Consultant,"Slalom Consulting is a primarily an IT staffing and solutions firm that has rapidly grown their Atlanta business over the past several years.  By offering attractive compensation and benefit packages, projects that do not require travel, and frequent, well-funded social events for its consultants, Slalom has been able to attract quality IT talent that is a notch or two above what other local staffing firms have to offer.  As a result, Slalom employs some of the better software engineers and IT analysts in the market.  However, this success has not come without a price.","While Slalom consultants excel at building technology solutions, they often fail at selling solutions that are a good fit for clients.  They introduce solutions prematurely, significantly shortchanging the planning phase of a project.  Unfortunately, many Slalom implemented solutions suffer low user adoption because the right planning was not done up front.

While this may not be true across all Slalom locations, in-fighting, has become all too common in the Atlanta office. Recently, Slalom introduced several new middle management roles that were intended to help retain consultants by providing advancement opportunities. However, these roles were not well defined, and they created confusion, distrust, and, ultimately power struggles within the organization.  Unfortunately, consultant morale has suffered as a result. 

Many clients see Slalom employees as contractors (not consultants) so be prepared to toss your best practices out the window and rework your deliverables until you are blue in the face to please clients who see you as nothing more than an order taker.   Do not forget that a senior role at Slalom typically does not mean that you’ll be given more challenging work to do only that you’ll be expected to do junior level work faster.

If your enthusiasm for Slalom does not rise to the level of religious zealotry, you are  probably not going to advance far with this company.   Be prepared to attend all  company after-hour functions and stay until last call if you want to stay visible and relevant.  Also, you will be encouraged to provide feedback about Slalom on surveys and on social networking sites with the unspoken understanding that it won’t be negative.

Beware of unexplained delays and sloppy bookkeeping.  Don’t be surprised if your vacation hours disappear or the utilization rate that determines your annual raise and bonus ends up lower than the time sheets indicate.  Even routine changes, such as converting from hourly to salary or taking an earned sabbatical, take weeks to get approved."

I was originally forced to use this giant brick with crazy bad resolution.","Often I felt like I wasn't respected for the value I was giving to the company.  I had to fight tooth and nail to get a better monitor and laptop while non engineers seemed to all have macbooks.  I was put on projects  time and time again with companies that wanted us to just keep the lights on.  When I complained about the type of work, the standard response was that I needed to improve my attitude and that good engineers and consultants find ways to score even in the darkest of environments.

I might of been ok for a while if was getting paid anywhere near the avg software engineers salary.  When you get billed at 150+ dollars and hour and only make 30, it feels pretty bad to hear ""There just isn't money in the budget"" during salary negotiations.  When I left I doubled my salary.

With this model, there are start up pains and growing pains that every market must go through. This is probably the root cause of some of the negative opinions of the consulting work on Glassdoor.

National leadership is always visible and frequently sends out emails or stops by local offices to meet and greet employees. 
Some of the projects/clients represent very interesting and strategic work.","There is no paternity leave policy in place, which is astounding given the message that the company seeks to be ""the best place you'll ever work."" How am I supposed to #lovemyfuture when I have a child on the way and I know the only way to spend time with that child is to take unpaid leave?

A lot of the work is very staff aug feeling. Most of the business development team was hired from staffing companies, so be default they sell staff aug work and aren't having conversations with clients about higher level strategic work (this happens occasionally, but not enough). 

Office leadership places extreme pressure on utilization. Our bonuses are determined by utilization rate and if you're not billable (which is sometimes beyond your control), you won't get the same opportunities as someone who is 110% utilized. 

PTO policy is only 3 weeks and we don't receive sick time. When you take vacation you aren't billable, which therefore impacts your bonus. Our office bonus model is literally built so the less PTO you take, the bigger your bonus will be. Leadership has tried to message their way around this, but everyone sees through it and knows that if they want a bonus they shouldn't take all their PTO (even though it's just 3 weeks). 

401K match comes out to be 1.25%, which is more or less a joke compared to industry averages. Yes, Slalom offers the chance to become an owner in the company, but that's typically after 7 years (and only if you're highly utilized). 

Lastly, the sabbatical program they advertise so heavily is only available to consultants. Therefore if you want to advance in your career and get promoted to something like a Client Service Lead or a Principle Consultant, you will give up the ability to take a sabbatical. You could be a consultant for 2 years and then be faced with the choice of either taking a sabbatical or getting promoted."

I was finishing up some schooling, burnt out from being over worked and treated poorly by clients, and my grandmother was in the hospital. I asked to take a 3 month unpaid leave of absence. I was denied this request even though Slalom Consulting  claims that sabbaticals and flexible work schedules are part of their DNA. 

They were particularly unkind when I tried to leave. I was denied the ability to quit because I was very valuable to the client and the project had been in jeopardy prior to me joining the team. I stayed for about 6 weeks after I had requested to quit and considered possible alternative work schedules at their request. I was yelled at by a few upper management people that I did not understand what ""true consulting was"", and my mentor in the company refused to speak with me. I was really sad about all of this because I had also been running crazy hours (80+ per week), working in areas outside of where I had been hired (aka BA takes on SQL database developer role), and having been verbally abused by the clients (managers did little when our team reported being called ""stupid"" and ""lazy"" by a client when the customer was in fact changing requirements and vision altogether - worked until 8pm Christmas eve for this client).

A good social environment with generally nice people.","Extremely open floor plan with no privacy. They have en entire department devoted to routing inquiries of consultants to the proper departments, because they don't really expect consultants to do anything for themselves nor offer them the proper tools to get that information appropriately. Frequent changes in new procedures are distributed via email announcements without being documented elsewhere. In fact, they insist on not having a written record of some procedures/discussions to avoid liability. 

The workplace culture consists of a veneer of friendliness over ruthlessness. Once management targets someone who isn't a ""culture fit"", they use all manner of tactics to push them out to avoid paying unemployment. One week you're doing great and at the top of the rankings, the next week you're under strict review and receiving harsh feedback for minor issues from other managers (at the instruction of your direct manager). All of this is meticulously documented, of course, in order to build a case for misconduct to deny unemployment.

One example, in particular, was that despite feedback that I wasn't being ""accurate"" enough in my work (they declined to offer a measure of what that meant), in a span of two weeks, they increased my workload by 30%. Then they initiated a cascade of talks about my performance without allowing for more than a day or two in between to show improvement. This led to a PIP, wherein I was given several days to have 100% accuracy (without giving an objective measure of evaluation) shortly after being given 30% more work with a new client and during the most hectic time of the fiscal cycle.

In regards to their training methods, it is very piecemeal with no documentation other than incidental emails and trial and error. Most training is done in sessions where one is given the same, repetitive scenarios and examples with the same, exact wording. Management stresses that questions be asked in any scenario yet punishes targeted individuals for asking too many questions then reprimands the individual when questions aren't asked in a particular situation. It's crazy-making.

Even the perks and benefits are mostly geared towards revenue-generating consultants. They ""offer"" the same perks to internal employees, but it's generally frowned upon if they are actually used as freely as consultants use them. There was some controversy over the use of the kegerator in the Accounting department (which has since been removed) while consultants can be seen pulling from other kegerators during lunch. Don't even get me started on ""mandatory fun""."

They've got some great recruiters, though sadly thats the limit to anyone who has seemed invested in my experience there.","Starting without a project can make one feel disconnected, you may not have the opportunity to form any bonds until you're on one and being kind of a cliquey place it makes for a difficult start. 
If you don't love it and anyone at all can tell, you don't fit in. No one bothers to change your mind about it. Reading the more negative reviews here and seeing they have fewer HR responses than the positive ones is further example of this. 
The frequent parties, free food and drink, and games around the office seem a bit more of a bribe. 
I'm on a project that I know has high visibility and has raised mgmt concern yet the team has yet to receive any sort of support from mgmt. 
Not all people managers are cut out to be people managers and it's not clear who to go to if that's your experience.

They practice what their preach.  The culture and work environment is great.  Great work/life balance, great pay and benefits.  Best employer I've ever worked for.","Maybe more flexi schedules for corporate such as 4/10s or 9/80s. Other than that, keep everything up."
1491,Slalom,Great Place to Work,2015-08-21,5.0,Technology Consultant,"The company focuses on the quality of its team members. Senior Leadership does not refer to project members as resources by as team members. They are adamant of rating the success of a project on not just the delivery but the overall happiness of the project team as well. 

Our team members are great and operate as a community of friends. I feel comfortable with our work place and enjoy the culture here.",Not at the moment. Have been working here for 3 months
1492,Slalom,Not a horrible place if you like Staffing work,2015-08-19,2.0,Consultant,"Culture was a focus, after hours meet ups, loose open office space.  They really tried hard in Chicago to look the part of a big player in Management consulting,","Mostly staffing work.  Not much actual consulting.  Benefits package was weak, seems like they keep saying it will be addressed, but I am still seeing the complaints.  The Firm seems to want to be a ""cool"" place to work with mandatory quarterly dinners and what not.  How that equates to a good work life balance is beyond me.  Lots of after work drinking parties.  

It seems like they want to be like the consultants on the show ""House of Lies"" but are forcing the issue"
1493,Slalom,Great company with some negatives,2015-08-18,4.0,Consultant,"Let me summarize the Slalom for you:

The work culture in Slalom is absolutely fantastic. 
The Leadership in New York office is amazing. 
The people are mostly big 4 retired road warriors. We have seen the war and now it is like a good fresh air, with good people. 
Everybody here is smart and filtered 360 degrees to fit the culture. 
100% local. Haven't travelled at all since I joined.
You see a lot of smiling local people in the office.

The work itself varies a lot. It is not ""strategic"". Work is just work. It is mostly staff augmentation. You go into a client side and do whatever comes up. If you are a Manager or Senior in big4 don't expect to have a team, manage others etc.. It is basically a pay check in a laid back environment and you mostly work solo. 

Most of the folks here are around their late 20s or early 30s either with a new born kid, newly married or wants to have their own start up but didn't find the time in big 4. Slalom is for these type of people. If you are a good consultant, after very careful elimination you are in. You go to a client, do whatever, figure out stuff (mostly staff augmentation), get your pay check. You come home at a reasonable time and do your own thing either family, dating, sports, your own company work etc... 

For me Slalom is all about People and Culture. Those 2 are amazing. 
The work you do, the benefits and the rest of the stuff are all average. But, I am assuming Slalom is probably better than what you are doing right now especially if you are a big4 Manager or something like that and you think you are in ""partner"" track. 

Lastly, no mandatory firm development activity, no mandatory anything. You don't have to participate in anything unless you want to. Just keep your client happy, enter your time and go home is very well an option.","Please keep in mind that I am happy at Slalom but I want to make sure everything is out in the open.

- If you are an H1B holder immigrant and you want to get a greencard forget Slalom. They are doing H1B transfer but they don't sponsor greencard. So, If you are an international college student, H1B owner or any other type of immigrant and want to be sponsored via your company don't consider Slalom.They will probably keep you around with your H1B but there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Don't waste your precious H1B time at Slalom. I feel you fellow immigrants. I know how important it is for you and your families.

- Benefits package definitely needs improvement. It is only 15 days of PTO. Parental leave is bad. I keep hearing some improvement will happen soon but nothing happened about it yet since I joined. 
- If you care about your career progression Slalom might not be a good fit for you. It is very flat. Everybody is consultant and there is no promotion ladder.  You could very well be a consultant 10 years later. So, if you are competitive and you want to put the hours needed to become a partner at big4 or whatever Slalom is not right for you. Slalom is very flat. People do other things after work. They have their own thing going on. They don't care much about promotion in Slalom. At least that is what I observed. Personally, I care to have a career path because I don't want to stay in the same title 3-4 years later. This might bother you  as well if you are similar to me. But on the bright side, no pressure for progression. As long as you deliver your client work you are good. Job is secure. And, your other projects can progress outside of work.

- Work is mostly staff augmentation. Don't expect to advice XYZ company to expand in China market. You do excel stuff and PowerPoint stuff. Typical big4 work.

 - no MBA, education or school support."
1494,Slalom,Probably the best company I've ever worked for,2015-08-17,5.0,Senior Engineer,"- Work-life balance is built into the culture. People will seriously start to question you if you work past 5 or 6 PM
- Very interesting work, huge growth opportunities
- Incredibly supportive management, you can go to any of them, tell them exactly how you feel, and *they will listen and make changes*. I have never worked anywhere else where I actually felt comfortable talking to management about these things and having things actually getting worked out
- Incredible people, I love working with them every day",- PTO and 401k are a bit less than other companies
1495,Slalom,The last job I'll ever have,2015-08-14,5.0,IT Consultant/Project Manager,"I've been with Slalom for over nine years.  In that time, I've seen phenomenal growth without losing any of the original culture that attracted me to the company.  We continue to attract very talented team members and our client list continues to grow. I have been blessed with challenging projects that are critical to my clients.  I've been offered employment offers from nearly every client I've worked with, but I have no desire to move.  I expect to retire from Slalom.",I wish there were more team-oriented projects and fewer individual contributor opportunities.
1496,Slalom,Challenging and Fun,2015-08-13,5.0,Information Management Consultant,"LOCAL CLIENTS! Generous with learning and education, entrepreneurial and open to new ideas, tech-forward, very smart coworkers, you generally work in industries within your preference profile and always have a say in approach/SOW etc. 

Social programs and getaways a plus!",None about the team or work. 401k plan is sub-standard but there's an active initiative to improve it.
1497,Slalom,Consultant,2015-08-13,5.0,Consultant,"Slalom has a unique culture that truly boasts hard work, fun and personal life balance like no place I've ever worked. Consulting is challenging but I always look forward to going to work because I know my Slalom colleagues will support me and keep it fun. Absolutely love this company and look forward to a long career with them.","We are no longer a small consulting firm and as such, Slalom really needs to invest in more PTO and 401K matching if the want to retain top talent. Time away from work is so critical for us to stay sharp and grounded, especially with the line of work we're in. It's time, Slalom."
1498,Slalom,Great Experience,2015-08-12,5.0,,"Throughout the interview process everyone was accommodating, and made an effort to consider my schedule. I am now happy to be working in a collaborative environment with some of the brightest and forward-thinking individuals out there. The environment is truly unique and refreshing.","No cons really come to mind. The process is drawn out, but you come to understand it is because they truly are making an investment in each individual they hire. So in all reality, it is to your benefit."
1499,Slalom,Just as Advertised!,2015-08-11,5.0,IM&A Consultant,"For a professional services firm the work life balance is amazing! It's just as advertised, very rarely do I leave work past 6pm. You get put on more long-term projects where Slalom owns the solution so you might be at a client for 6-12 months. It really just depends but that is the goal.",Lack of diversity and old boys club culture (at times). They are really working on diversity but change can be slow. You also tend to work on smaller Slalom teams (3-6 people) so you can feel isolated from co-workers at Slalom who do not work on the same client.
1500,Slalom,Slalom,2015-08-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great culture fit and good place to work,some times dealing with managers
1501,Slalom,Great Place To Work,2015-08-11,5.0,Consultant,"When I left another consulting firm to join Slalom I was skeptical about the culture.  I was proven wrong in little time.  Slalom truly has the best people. Everyone is generous, unique, passionate, and cares about others.","What started out flat has now become overloaded with mid management.  Gives the impression that that ship has sailed so if you haven't made it yet, it's probably not going to happen.

Amazing leads often fall flat.  Slalom needs to focus on closing deals.  Majority of the work is staff Aug.  PTO and 401k match are very poor."

1503,Slalom,Best Company Ever,2015-08-07,5.0,Consultant,It's a family here... I'm not a number.  The work/life balance is a primary focus and I really appreciate the local model.,Career advancement can be tough.  Most people remain a consultant the whole time they are here.  not a con if that's what you are looking for.
1504,Slalom,Comes with good and bad - like any other company,2015-08-06,3.0,Consultant,"Great people (so clichéd), lots of social events and happy hours. Benefits are getting better and leadership claims sincerity in how they view and value employee surveys and feedback. 4 week sabbatical after 3 years of service and 6000 billed hours and at 75% pay. Good career opportunities if you're fortunate enough to be staffed at the right client. Can be staff aug-ish at times, but the work is usually good. Company is is growth mode and is looking to expand like crazy. I feel I've been treated quite fairly.","There are great people at other companies too (don't use this as the sole reason to join Slalom). While your client probably allows jeans on Fridays, don't do it if you're going in to the Slalom office. Its frowned upon. No, seriously. Don't do it. Sabbatical ends once (if) you get promoted into a leadership role. Some amount of sucking up is required to be ""noticed"" by senior leadership. You have to toot your own horn or be left behind in the dust. If you're lucky you'll get a manager who cares about you and will do some tooting on your behalf. Events will always be downtown, if you live in the suburbs, well, too bad. Events are always, always very extravagant. Way too many people are assigned to projects they have no business being staffed on. This is all in the name of billing and keeping that utilization rate high so the revenue numbers look good. So, with this, comes the chance that you will eventually be put on a project that you have no interest in."
1505,Slalom,Best company I ever worked for,2015-08-02,5.0,Consultant,"1. Fluid responsibility and room to grow your skillset, network, and career.
2. Collegiate atmosphere, very collaborative and supportive
3. Generous compensation and perks - 401k and insurance packages are pretty good. 4/5 stars. Company retreats and celebrations included.
4. Very innovative, wins awards for app and web design and development
5. No travel!!
6. Mgmt values your time. It's a family-oriented culture.","1. Hard to feel connected to everyone since there are no mandatory days at the office (not that I'm that upset over it)
2. Lack of structured approach to career- some may dislike the ambiguity.
3. Sales success varies widely be region."

NYC office has amazing senior leadership. Majority of office is ex-big 4 so transition to culture was ready.,No paternity leave and only 15 PTO days is not very competitive with the market. Slalom promotes the focus on work life balance so should address this.
1508,Slalom,Fantastic Consulting firm to work for!,2015-07-21,5.0,,"-Slalom is a company that truly cares about its employees well-being and input. All of our company strategies and the initiatives that come from it are all based off of employee feedback and ideas. 

-I truly feel a sense of work-life balance here that everyone respects.

-The culture is truly something special- extremely smart, talented and humble people who make coming to work very enjoyable. Many opportunities to get involved outside of typical project work- both from professional and social standpoints. The emphasis on the employee and retaining our culture is felt at all levels of leadership-including our CEO.","The 401k plan and match is not great. I don't have a problem with the benefits or PTO- but suppose an extra week would be nice since there is no distinction between sick/personal days. The HR team did a roadshow and took everyone's extremely candid feedback, and have sent out many communications that this is something being worked on, which I am confident will eventually be improved."
1509,Slalom,Lost their way,2015-07-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice co-workers
Still manages to land some decent projects","Local management is aloof and disconnected from the field consultants. Very cliquish and political. As Slalom grew, they could not adapt and reverted to their Accenture ways. It is a shame, it used to be a great place to work."

1513,Slalom,"Great for consultants, no travel",2015-07-06,5.0,,"I've been with the company 4.5 years and they've grown tremendously.  There are plenty of opportunities to advance your career on either a practice area path or with the sales (account team) path.  Compensation is more than fair and I'm pleased with how I'm rewarded based on performance for yearly bonus and raises.  There is still flexibility and little red tape to try new things, expand your skills and get staffed in a areas that will ""stretch"" your skillset to grow quickly.  Great support for training either internal or external, you just need to make the business case.","In Atlanta office, there is still a significant percentage of work that is sold as an individual contributor role.  This isn't much different from being a contractor and unfortunately some clients view it that way as well.  All it takes is a very difficult client in a long-term role to impact a person's morale.  Paid vacation has been improved, but it's still nowhere near the big 4.  Maternity leave is short term disability and after 1-2 month return, you receive the balance to make you whole for a total of 8 weeks leave.  Decent, but we can and should do better for our working moms."
1514,Slalom,Great Company,2015-07-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Transparency and availability of the leadership tied with the engagement of the employees creates a contagious culture in and out of the office. The firm is growing fast, but the key is that they're doing it in a sustainable way and maintaining the smaller firm feel.","The benefits might not compare to some other players in the industry, but the leadership is focused of filling the gaps as the company matures, which is encouraging."

This is one of the great perks of working for a company that is privately held and truly cares about it's people.  The company culture is fantastic, there are honestly so many people here that I would be friends with outside of work, so the people are amazing.  There are always team building events happening which brings the group together (even more important in a consulting firm where everyone is typically spread out at clients).","There are a few who have been promoted into leadership (CSL, BDE) that have you scratching your head as to why they were put in those positions to begin with.  But the other senior leaders are pretty much great people both in LA and OC."

1518,Slalom,"Good Culture, Middle Management Issues",2015-06-23,3.0,Management Consultant,"One of the best cultures I've seen in consulting.
Definite push toward being fair and equal to all genders, ethnic groups, orientations, etc.
Visible effort to receive anonymous employee feedback and try to address concerns.
Strong push towards hiring women.
Some Training Opportunities","Upper Management have vision.  Middle management has problems.  New managers very lacking management experience.  

High chance of being placed into roles unrelated to your background at some point in your time at Slalom.  
Middle Management downward communication is very poor.  I awaited responses to emails for upwards of 6-12 months.

Upper Management advocates that if a project isn't for you for whatever reason (skills, people, etc), you can talk to your people manager about it, but in my experience they ignore you.

The company has prided itself on aiding you take the next step in your career.
I spent so much time assigned to a role that had nothing to do with my expertise/ past experience (in a different practice than mine) that my people manager started telling people I was better suited for it.  My P.M. started realizing some of my prior skills after being in management for a year.  I felt like I went backwards in my career because I kept waiting on / going back and forth with my People Manager.

Be wary.  I think this company is much better if you're on the management consulting side, because they're better connected internally.  
Technical Consultants can be put in the back-burner and ignored."

It tries hard to be a great place to work.","Slalom placed a lot of emphasis on diversity, but people who had a different point of view to the regional and local leaders (all of whom, without exception, are middle-aged white men) had a tough time. 

I came to Slalom to learn how to build a consulting practice, but in the end, I learned how not to do it. So I learned some valuable lessons, but it was unfulfilling and I quit with relief.

Slalom's local model means each office acts like a franchise, operating quite differently from other offices, with few opportunities to work collaboratively across markets.

We tried to sell strategic, project-based work but the constant fire-drills to clear the bench meant most consultants were body-shopped to clients."

1527,Slalom,Good company but becoming a shark tank,2015-06-03,3.0,Consultant,Some great people. Fantastic IT support. Pay is fairly good. Challenging projects. Many good clients. Great events especially the annual getaway weekends for each local office.,Teams are growing very quickly which causes lower utilization rates and penalizes existing employees at bonus time.  It can be very difficult to get training. They are hiring lots of Deloitte and Accenture folks so the culture is quickly turning into a shark tank.
1528,Slalom,Don't believe the hype and look elsewhere,2015-05-29,2.0,Consultant,The commitment to work-life balance is embedded in Slalom's culture and the firm does not have a shortage of events for employees.,"The downside of the local model of consulting means that most of the projects are staff augmentation and really have nothing to do with consulting. The Managing Directors seem to be aloof, at best, about the prospects of moving into true strategy consulting and I have found that overall the leaders in the practice groups are not terribly interested in finding a project that fits personal and career development goals. 

Slalom also is incredibly disorganized with a complete aversion to anything that might be classified as ""Big Four."" Proposals and bus dev work are ad-hoc and not well executed, and it's difficult to understand the long-term plan when it seems like every consultant is just scrambling for the next project."
1529,Slalom,Good Company,2015-05-26,3.0,Consultant,"I recently left after working for Slalom for many years. I had the opportunity of joining when the company was small and seeing them grow and succeed. I was given many challenges and always treated as an individual and not a number. While the local model was not what attracted me to the company, I liked that Slalom realized that there were plenty of roles and investments that could be made in the local community and it was not necessary to fly people all over the country. 

Management also realized that when they went from 100 to 101 employees that how the company was run had to change. It was not always easy for those of us that had been around for a while to swallow, it was necessary for continued success and growth.","I left Slalom for personal reasons and not for anything that Slalom was doing wrong or not offering to me. I would have course liked:
 - better 401K benefits
 - vacation days

The biggest con for me was that leaders were often promoted too soon. As examples, I often worked with leaders who were selling projects that they did not understand what it would take to deliver, they sold it short and then walked on to the next sell leaving the delivery team to clean up the mess. This could be fixed by putting more emphasis on delivery experience and responsibilities before promotion instead of putting as much emphasis on the sales goals."
1530,Slalom,Not as good as it looks like,2015-05-25,3.0,Consultant,"Pays well, good people, smart people to work.","1. If you are technical person don't expect to work in the same technology for more than 6 months.
2. Talks of employee concern is not practised .
3. 401k match is not good
4.pays well but you would be surprised to see the margin , since their billing rates are so high clients mostly prefer to have short term projects with slalom.
5. Lots of training activities but you will never use them in next few years.
6. Pressure to attend all the social activities is high, it may be required for leaders and managers but for consultants its waste of time.
7. Reporting managers are changed very frequently , tough to maintain a relationship with manager .
8.very small client base , so as stated in point 1 growing in same tech is not practically possible. ( makes you feel jacks of all trade but master of none)
9. Project is considered only if margin is 50% , higher rates are scaring clients .
10. People are promoted just because position is vacant instead of skills.
11. Splited sf office into 2 , just to create room for promotions. Causing smaller client base .
12. In lots of projetcs consultants are asked to learn some tech with a week .
13. People with wotk visa have some serious concerns ."

I have read the few negative reviews, and it's clear that those people didn't try. Slalom is a place where you can create what you want: want to work in X industry? Sell a project in X industry and you'll have the full weight and support of the company behind you. If you're unhappy at Slalom, it's probably your own fault.

John Tobin, President, makes it a point to stay connected to everyone in the company. You can e-mail the guy and expect a call or swift e-mail in return. He visit every office quarterly, if not more often, and takes all new employees to lunch to get to know them.

I love consulting!  I love the variety and the challenges of my role, but it can be tough.  Clients will typically blame the consulting firm before taking any responsibility, but most consultants are professional enough to take it on the chin and move forward.

It's a tough job but I get to work with some amazing people at Slalom which makes it all worthwhile.  If I wanted an easy job I would have been frightened away by the challenges of consulting long ago."
1544,Slalom,DO NOT FALL FOR THE GLASSDOOR/RECRUITING HYPE!  STAFF AUG BODY SHOP AT ITS FINEST.,2015-04-14,1.0,Consultant,"Opportunity to work with some pretty sharp consultants.

There are office events however if you are a billable consultant, you won't have time to participate.   Otherwise, your client owns you pretty much.","Slalom employs a large team of recruiters, all of whom blast social media with a lot of hype about company culture and the ""awesomeness"" of the company.  I was approached by a recruiter on LinkedIn to have an initial ""conversation"" to be a part of their Technology Practice.  Pretty standard experience questions, nothing technical.  Additional ""conversations"" took place and I go on to meet other members of the team and then eventually the Practice Area Director to assess if I am a ""fit"" for the team and the culture.  Slalom makes me an offer which in retrospect, I regretfully accept.  The company was sold to me as being generally ""awesome"" and NO STAFF AUG.  It can't be that bad right?

Onto my first ""local"" client (conveniently 40+ miles away).  In this role, I was essentially thrown/augmented onto an already failing project which was already a few weeks over deadline (margins cut, etc).  After a few weeks of working in this sweatshop like a good little sheep, project is finally completed however at the expense of the quality of the work and deployment.

From what I've heard it's commonplace here for projects to be underestimated which results in extremely stressful deliverables for the technical resources actually working on the projects.  What a great way to start you new career at Slalom!

It gets better....

Onto my next project.  For this one, I was essentially staffed (augmented) to build an application using technologies that I had no experience ever using (or ever claimed to have the experience) with no ramp up time or training.  Long story short, I got out of the project early and they found some other sheep to do the job.  At this point, I realize that staff aug is a recurring theme across all projects from what I've seen, with work being assigned to resources with very little regard to their skill sets (despite what the recruiter will tell you how Slalom does not staff augment, it's very much a body shop).  Truly not much learning on the job and opportunities to do so are scarce due to the aggressive deadlines around which all projects are sold.  Slalom is a small shop with limited resources, so you will find that all project deliverables are ""urgent"".

It can't all be bad though right?  I see the light at the end of the tunnel and it looks like an exit sign!

This is a life lesson.  If something sounds too good to be true it absolutely is.  I know when to cut my losses and only a few months in and I am headed for the exit.  Slalom has taken from me months of my life which I will never get back.  Never again."

The company hosts great quarterly reviews and the annual retreat with significant others is awesome. The GM is top notch at what he does, personable, humble and remembers everyone.","Assignments won't necessarily be within your professional expertise and staff aug assignments aren't out of the realm of possibility. Resisting a staff aug assignment or one that is not close to your profession is highly frowned upon. You take what you're given. Too many members of the 2nd tier of management seem to be more concerned with selling anything that they don't take the time to think whether it's a good fit for the company or the consultants. You're at their mercy. Top management talks about meaningful work for us but it's just talk due to some of their direct reports. They need to review the motivation and work of their 2nd tier managers.

Volunteering for internal projects seems more like a mandate than an option. If you're not active internally then it can be looked upon negatively. Internal contributions outside of your full-time assignment are expected. Doesn't seem to matter if you have a family or long commute, it is in your best interest to volunteer when it comes to raise and bonus time.

Not a lot of travel, although I did travel to conference and management meetings outside of Chicago.  Profit sharing and extra $ incentives for people at my level.  I've been promoted, I've been respected, but the pats-on-the-back only go so far.","Flat-out miserable benefits.  Not the best insurance.  Terrible PTO structure.  Having a child? Forget Maternity or Paternity.  Pay for it yourself, use up your PTO, and then lose money.  401k or other investments?  Poor selection and one of the lowest company contributions I've ever had in 18 years.  If you're at the managing director level you are allowed to invest in the company's private growth - i.e. shares.  Not atypical to need to invest $100K of your own capital.  This is absurd!  I understand the reasons for wanting that cash infusion based on the equity structure, but many of the best places competing for talent give substantial options/equity at a fraction of that cost, and only have very short vesting times.  Employees working for more innovative companies see a MUCH higher upside when it comes to employee equity.  I've experienced it myself.  Management is hit or miss.  Some are very misleading.  Some are very collaborative and helpful.  I think they all care, just not about you or your success.  I suppose this happens everywhere.  However Slalom advertises how different they are, and it just isn't.  Very Anderson-Accenture like.  You can rock the heck out of a project and a client can rave about you, but if a certain PAD or MD has hesitations for any reason or has a favorite, you're getting nailed.  I've been in the reviews, I've seen and heard it.  The culture and drinking fest is not optional.  You don't show up to enough of them, it is career suicide.  If you're in management and you don't show up, you're frowned upon.  These are great for networking, but honestly, it has turned into more of a role-call in a way.  Constantly shifting or moving standards to measure people.  Even when you think you've got it down, it can change based on someone's perceptions.  Look I loved my time for what it's worth, but there are MUCH better alternatives for smart people wanting to stretch themselves and do great work.  Many people here talk like they chose Slalom over McKinsey or other awesome startups or big players like Facebook or Apple or Boston Consulting Group.  The people here just are not there.

1569,Slalom,Good company for consultants that don't want to travel,2015-02-06,3.0,Anonymous,"Senior (Seattle/National) leadership cares about creating a great company.  As a billable consultant, you will most likely be assigned a local client.  Salaries are competitive+.  Smart people who focus on delighting the client will thrive.  You will be allowed work-life balance provided you don't want to grow into leadership.  There is currently a big emphasis on empowering and promoting women in a male-dominated industry.  The senior leadership is approachable and inclusive.  There are a lot of really great, caring people at Slalom, and some very smart ones too.  Financially, the company is stable and is big enough to weather ups and downs - if you are competent, you will have job security.  The company spends a lot of money promoting culture and their brand as a good place to work.","Slalom prioritizes hiring from big consultancies, in particular Accenture and Deloitte.  Two effects of this are that they frequently hire for that culture fit vs. competence; and there are a lot of fair-to-middling Big-X consultants that get managed out of those firms that land at Slalom.  A lot of the work is staff augmentation, non-strategic.  Getting people billable takes precedent over meaningful work.  Senior leadership is overwhelmingly from Accenture/Deloitte/EY etc., so if you are not from one of those firms you will most likely cap out if you want a career vs. a job. Slalom preaches diversity and inclusion from a background perspective, but currently their diversity initiatives are ""for Women.""  Most Slalom leaders expect you to buy into the Slalom Kool-Aid, so if you are looking for cool work but not a religious experience, your career path will be hindered.  Over the last 24 months, it felt like priority had shifted away from being the best consulting firm in the world to a quest to expand internationally and hit $1B in revenue, and if things have to be sacrificed to get there, so be it.

Oh - and benefits are far below industry average.  7 holidays, and 2 weeks leave which is inclusive of sick, vacation, whatever you need it for.  Recruiting will dazzle you with alternative models and funny math.  It often feels like you are working for a cheap accountant (for example, new consultants often get recycled laptops that are years into their depreciation cycle).

In summary - if you are an ex-Big X consultant that doesn't want to travel, it's a great place.  If you are from a niche tech firm, industry, etc., you will most likely find it very hard to advance beyond jr. leadership."

However, consultants see that once their peers are promoted to jobs with additional responsibilities, the promise of work left balance is broken. The mandatory billable hour requirements of leadership roles do not come even close to making up for the additional responsibilities, so people in leadership work many more hours than consultants.

They have a strong practices and have major business partners in a variety of industries,"It have be a little touch of go, pulling in long hours at times, turnover does happen more frequently than a company in industry, but that is the nature of the consulting business."
1588,Slalom,"Fun, hard working group, very serious about helping you excel",2014-12-10,5.0,Consultant,"I've been at this employer for a few months now and am still incredibly happy that I made the move. During the interview process I did a lot of due diligence around company reviews, asking questions of current employees, etc. and so far they have all proven to be true. Slalom is very focused on getting you to the next level, in whatever way makes sense for you - whether that's additional training, conferences, etc. the company from the start makes sure that you're focusing on looking for opportunities to grow.","I came from a large tech company, so the change in benefits is a bit of a bummer. 15 PTO days (combining sick and vacation) seems really low as a standard, especially for a company that excels in so many other areas."

1591,Slalom,Great leadership opportunities.  Veteran consultants who enjoy the local model.  Good culture.,2014-12-10,4.0,Consultant,"Good people, pay, benefits, and culture.  Career path opportunities have improved.  Local model is great for those tired of the plane travel.  Good choice for mid-career focused consultant looking for leadership position (bigger fish in a smaller pond.)","More established markets always appear better connected to the company.  Lots more younger, less experienced consultants (trying-to-consult) getting hired.  Just 'cuz your title says you are, doesn't make you one.  Still relatively unknown and often thought of as a staff aug firm."
1592,Slalom,Very happy with my decision to join Slalom!,2014-12-09,5.0,Anonymous,"I value working for a company where everyone has experience to bring to the table and a story to tell about the journey they have taken to find Slalom.  As part of the a growing market/office, I have enjoyed the entrepreneurial spirit with the backing of a national office.  I have really enjoyed being on smaller, quick delivery projects that add immediate value to our clients and look forward to growing into medium sized projects as our office grows and sells more business.

I love the group of people I work with!  Even when out at clients we stay connected with each other through social media, quarterly meetings, lunches, happy hours and others.",Vacation is only 3 weeks which is not that great.  401K match is terrible.
1593,Slalom,Company struggling with growth and direction,2014-12-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are so nice! Nearly everyone I met and worked with was just a nice person. This will most likely change as they continue to grow so quickly, but currently, it's just nice people to be around. The work-life balance is also a huge pro; there were times I worked nights and weekends, but I had a lot of flexibility. However, this is not across the board.","Some employees who were constantly forced to work nights and weekends threatened to quit. Management knows this is an issue but also didn't want to stand up for those employees to the client. Disheartening to know that the culture and values only go so far, when they definitely talk it up all the time. My department also had a lot of issues getting work, so there was a lot of downtime. However, unlike other consulting firms, my office didn't have bench projects, so non-client time meant not doing any work. For people who are paid hourly, this is a nightmare."
1594,Slalom,Great Consulting Gig,2014-12-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,No-travel consulting with awesome leadership and phenomenal growth.  Interesting projects.  Get to meet people from different consulting backgrounds.  The combination of management consulting and technical consulting makes it an exciting place to work.,Some work is not Project based.

Everybody is incredibly passionate about what they do and focused on delivering amazing value for our clients. In addition, I feel like I'm helping to grow something that has really exciting potential.","The environment can be ambiguous and incredibly fluid. Things change all the time, and for those of us here that change is exciting. You need to be comfortable (and truthfully energized) by that type of environment."

1598,Slalom,Best Place to Work,2014-11-18,5.0,Practice Area Director,"I have worked at Slalom for the past 8 years and continue to believe that it is one of the best companies in the US to work for, and the #1 consulting company to work for.  Over my time here I have experienced wonderful people, challenging opportunities, and great career growth.  I have had the opportunity to work with a number of different clients in a delivery capacity, and as my career has progressed at Slalom I had the opportunity to add people management, business development, practice development, and operational support to my job activities.  I would highly recommend anyone that is highly passionate and motivated and interested in consulting to look into this company.","One thing that I would caution folks is that Slalom is a work hard and play hard type of company.  It is fast paced, and brimming with entreprenurial-spirited individuals.  I know that sometimes this type of culture isn't for everyone."

1601,Slalom,"Good company, but reminds me of a frat club culture",2014-11-15,3.0,Consultant,"Great company, excellent pay/benefits and professional development.","Frat club type of culture. .  I loved the work but there has to be some sort of schmoozing for you to get ahead.  Managers will put consultants on jobs with no experience just to ensure they stay billable.  Not a good look for clients or helpful for the consultant.    Very social company where many had alcohol available.  Not a big drinker but if you are, you will love the social aspect of it.   I would never go back but could be that dream job for the right person."
1602,Slalom,Unleash your potential,2014-11-10,5.0,Practice Area Lead,"As a career consultant this is the first company I've worked at where I can see, feel, and know that everything I do (i) impacts my clients, (ii) impacts my company & practice, and (iii) allows me to truly own my career.","There is a healthy tension that exists between ""local market direction"" and ""national structure/strategy"". This can result in different markets pursuing the achievement of larger strategy in different ways. For people who want a highly structured environment - this creates a bit of uncertainty."
1603,Slalom,Best place I have ever worked,2014-11-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Care for the client and care for the consultant are constantly being balanced in a way that no one feels 2nd place.,"Benefits are consistent with smaller firms, which can be a difficult transition from Big 4 type PTO, healthcare, 401k, healthcare, etc."
1604,Slalom,"Over all ok, missing middle management vision - Dallas Office",2014-11-08,3.0,Consultant,"great culture, great smart people, small company feel at least for a while, great executive visions if it ever truly gets executed.","Career path is a joke! carrot and stick game and plenty of false promises, I cannot speak for every practice I was in the Application development practice.
General manager is a true believer of culture and work and life balance but this vision gets lost in transition to the consultants.
poor client and scope management that leads to lots of miscommunications, confusion and put consultants in bad situations."
1605,Slalom,DON'T Believe the hype!!! terrible company,2014-11-08,1.0,Consultant,"- ""smart"" HR, they know how to market themselves on social media to sell the company to potential employees. This is not really a pro to the employees, but i gotta give it to the HR for relentless marketing of the company culture(which is in reality non existent) in social.
- Some smart people in the company who stay in the company for very short time once they realize the reality","- terrible work culture. They sell false hope about work life balance, employee first, doing the right thing to the customers....all of this is a big fat lie! they hire people from big 4 with false promises.
    - NO travel- yeah right! they have a national team who travel almost 100% and the rest of the folks should be prepared to travel as soon as their current staff aug is over.
    - Work life balance: The company has literally ZERO experience in delivery. All they work on is 3-4 week strategy projects which fail miserably 90% of the time. If they do get lucky and land a delivery project then they hire a poor souls a ""developer"" and make them work like a donkey for 50-60hrsweek burn him out until he quits and then find new developer who fall for the same social marketing trap of the HR. The cycle continues.
    - No concept of quality, center of excellence or even assigning work based on a employees skillset: Are you a JAVA developer? No problem! they will make you work on a .NET development project with zero lead time to learn .NET. Do you have no idea about analytics? no problem! you will be a Tableau WIZ in 2 days on the job lol
 - Employee first culture: This is the biggest lie the company keeps preaching. If this is true why is everyone in the company only a few months old in the company? That is because attrition is crazy! Almost every new employee quits within first 6 months. 
-Quality of projects/clients: terrible projects! 90% of the work they do is staff aug....most of their clients and projects are local mom and pop stores, your corner caffe stores...they take up any work which comes their way....

Now lets talk about compensation and benefits:

- Compensation ""may"" look on par with industry but look closer!!!
- no 401k match for 1 year and 25% match after that....
- Healthcare costs are through the roof! over $500/month for medical/dental benefits for a family!!! i spend <$100 in my previous job for better health coverage!
- PTO policy is a joke. Only 15 PTO/year with NO sick leaves! 
- There are literally no other benefits apart from these terrible benefits."

They are a consulting company, but do not require travel as my prior employers have.  The focus is on the communities in which we live.  Flexible work schedules are available to employees who are interested in less than 40 hours of employment, which is key to my demographic.  It is a diverse and inclusive environment.","PTO time offered is less than with other employers, but I find that in my situation the flexible work arrangement compensates for this."

Additionally, they respect the employee's input in setting strategies and directions, and really seem more concerned about the health of the culture and the people than the finances of the company.","Too big of a secret.  I learned about Slalom through a friend, and was really impressed when I got to know them.  Since I have been here, I continue to introduce Slalom to my friends, and people I meet. It would be nice if when I met someone that actually knew of the company."

1614,Slalom,A new way to consulting.,2014-11-02,5.0,Manager,"You get what you put in. Encourages it's people to determine how fast and how much. Doesn't have traditional hierarchies and customs, but rather looks to redefine ""tradition"" in consulting. It's commitment to the culture and people ensure we don't become just a business. Still a growing company with great opportunities.","Still growing. Policies and structures are evolving. Although this is a national and now global firm, focus is on the local markets translating into more local opportunities."
1615,Slalom,Best consulting firm around,2014-11-01,5.0,Solution Principal,"Cool projects with clients both large and small across different industries. Company culture is great and remains important with many opportunities to connect with others. Leadership stresses consultant satisfaction.

There's a reason this team is growing our client base of the best companies and most game changing work -- it's Slalom's people and our culture.,"Slalom is a fast growing company and does not have the expensive infrastructure of the massive global firms. If you are looking to join a firm that has the hippest new benefit on the scene, Slalom is unlikely to have prioritized them over creating the best firm for core people development."

The culture Slalom fosters is incredibly unique.  With a focus on a core set of values, our people lead by example and with humility with a sincere effort to make a positive impact with our clients and our communities.  Finally - there is a great balance of making sure we are a sound, successful business that also makes sure we do not take ourselves too seriously - plenty of fun and great options such as our company paid retreats, sabbaticals, high energy quarterly meetings and social events.","The firm is experiencing a high level of growth - growing 35% annually for the last 10 years.  Slalom is not perfect and as we grow, we continue to need to make sure our growth does not take away the intimate people first culture here.  But - when things are bending a bit - it feels like we continue to get re-grounded into our principles.  Also - this is a great place for someone who enjoys the turns of a great journey - vs being in a predictable box."

2. The people- the team of people who I get to work with are amazing.  I value having the ability to work with smart, dedicated people who are fun and willing to assist new team members.
3. Culture- the company has a positive energy and it is enjoyable to be in the office.  I love playing shuffle board and having a drink with colleagues in our kitchen at the end of a hard day.

In any industry, for that matter.","If you're looking for someone to hold your hand in terms of career development, look elsewhere. Slalom is great at providing a framework for career growth, plenty of learning opportunities, and outlining what it thinks are the minimum success factors and proficiency levels to advance in your career, but if you need a company that will set the course for you and dictate a timeline in which you need to achieve growth, you won't find it at Slalom. At Slalom, the sky's the limit, but it's up to every consultant to seek out and pursue growth opportunities."

Strong vision for the future.
Really happy with the forethought the most senior leaders have with respect to the direction of the company.
Good project work mixed with some strategic staffing work.","Sometimes the long term vision for the strategy of the individual, project, office or company isn't well disseminated leading to a feeling of just being staffed in an individual contributor role.  As I've seen and learned more about the long term vision I better understand where I, my local and and the firm is headed it makes those assignments more understandable."
1627,Slalom,Excited about the future,2014-10-29,5.0,Client Service Lead,"Slalom has experienced tremendous growth over the years, but through it all our values truly stick. We are a company who truly lives our values vs. just writing them down and looking at them on a wall.  Do the right thing always!  Stay humble! Smile!

I am able to do interesting and innovative consulting work at meaningful clients, while also being involved in my children's lives, participate in my community and give back.  The breadth of services offered by Slalom makes our services relevant to almost any client, significantly opening the aperture of where we can add value.","While our organization is relatively flat, as we grow we are adding in certain process areas that can be cumbersome.  The good news is that our growth and expansion requires a greater level of process, the down side is that it feels less startup-like."
1629,Slalom,"Great culture, great people, and great work-life balance!",2014-10-29,5.0,Internal Operations,"Great culture and clear company goals and path. Consultants work where they live - no unwanted travel. Great company events every quarter including an annual retreat to a destination in Texas (+1s welcome!). Internal focus on career growth and training opportunities available. Fun and voluntary activities outside of the office (sports teams, book clubs, etc.). Lots of community involvement opportunities as well.","Although consultant paths are more clearly defined, Internal (operational roles) are not as clearly defined in the past. However, I've seen this change in the right direction as of late and look forward to seeing roles and paths more clearly defined."
1630,Slalom,Consulting the way it SHOULD be,2014-10-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Slalom has figured out the consulting model that satisfies both employees and clients.  An amazing culture that focuses first and foremost on doing the right thing is a rare find in consulting. This value creates collaboration rather than competition internally and builds major credibility with clients who understand we want to be true business partners, not just sell them a service or product they may or may not need.  Leaders are expected to put people first which creates a culture where everyone is seeking ways to improve and help each other rather than boost one's own career at the expense of others.","Growth spurts can occasionally put a stress on the culture as new hires need time to acclimate to the collaborative culture and shed some of the undesirable habits that may have led to success at other consulting firms.  PTO is also lower than other consulting firms, but the fact that average work weeks are much more reasonable than typical consulting firms helps to balance that out."
1631,Slalom,Slalom is one of those rare companies that truly challenges you to be better and provides the tools to do so.,2014-10-28,5.0,Business Development Executive,Entrepreneurial feel because of the access to leaders but the structure and vision to evolve into a larger company.  Firmly believes in their culture and mission and takes pride in hiring individuals desiring that culture.,Still a relatively lean organization so perks are not equivalent to some larger organizations.  Does not matter though.
1632,Slalom,"A company that really believes in its core values, and lives them every day.",2014-10-28,5.0,Client Service Leader,"Genuine desire to make the world a better place. Every senior leader int he organization has a personal belief that if you do the right thing, good stuff will happen.",Consulting involves dealing with all kinds of projects and clients. Some better than others. The real challenge is stepping up to the plate to turn any challenging situation into an opportunity to shine. Slalom is not a great place for those who just want a job and to be told what to do.
1633,Slalom,Make it your own,2014-10-28,5.0,Practice Area Lead,"I have been able to craft a career here to my own liking.  I saw things that needed to be done, did them, and the opportunities and rewards opened up before me.","For those used to large-firm consulting, it will take a while to adjust to the opportunities, the responsibilities and the scale of what's possible here."
1634,Slalom,"Freedom, autonomy and support",2014-10-28,5.0,Practice Area Lead,It's similar to working with your most ambitious friends on an idea that everyone believes in.,It's an opt-in culture - you get what you put it to the company. (is this really a con?)

The people are fun and supportive of me in both my personal and professional life.  The company is growing fast.","The company is growing fast and occasionally it is not keeping up with its own growth.  I used to know everyone, but now that is not possible.

1638,Slalom,People first culture through and through,2014-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I enjoy that Slalom provides employees with many opportunities to grow and expand your skills and experience. There is very little you can't do if you are a self-starter.,Being a flat and less prescriptive organization around career progression can find some people struggling with their own planning and progress.

- Work/life balance - Many companies may preach this but Slalom lives it.  Leadership is incredibly supportive of however much you want to get involved.  I love knowing that I can jump into as many extracurriculars as I want (highly advised - it's great!), or take time to myself, friends and family.
- The work - It's constantly changing and all what you make of it.  This is your time to dive in and get things done! - both at the clients and internally.
- The support - EVERYONE is supportive, collaborative, willing to help, willing to push you to develop out your cool ideas... can't say enough good things.","- Not as much PTO (vacation + sick) as I had at my past company.

The environment, culture, and leadership continue foster a very fun and diverse working environment while still proving how successful Slalom can be.","Slalom is still figuring some things out and perfecting its ""secret sauce"".  That means not everything is fully charted and some things are not yet perfect.

This shows in its emphasis on work/life balance, consultant feedback in the annual survey, and actions to take the feedback and implement change.  Obviously, compensation, benefits, and perks are important as well, but for me, at the end of the day, what makes me happy is to feel valued and like I'm making a difference.  This is what Slalom does well.","As with any consulting company, the downside of being a consultant is that your job requirements and location change regularly.  Slalom is no different here but they do work hard to make you feel as if you are part of a family so at least you have support during the change."

1660,Slalom,Slalom is a great place to build your career,2014-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I come from the technology/development side of the company, so my review will be more applicable to those people exploring a change within that space. 

I've been fortunate in my time at Slalom to be given complete ownership of my career as well as a great deal of autonomy. Slalom is a well-trusted partner to its clients within the Atlanta market, and we are usually given a lot of flexibility when it comes to defining architecture and making technical decisions. We also tend to be given control of entire solutions and rarely if ever have any staff augmentation roles.

Consultants are encouraged and supported to seek out professional development opportunities (classes, books, conferences, etc), so make sure that you want to continue learning when you join.

Culture is highly protected and valued at Slalom. In addition, the development practices have taken additional steps to protect culture by centralizing a lot of the work that is done. Typically, development projects out of Atlanta will be done leveraging a mix of time at the client site and working out of our offices. This allows the entire team (and team members on different projects) to work in the same space, share ideas/collateral, and interact throughout the day. This is a rare thing in consulting, and it has had a hugely positive impact on morale and feeling as though you are part of a team.","Slalom still struggles with finding ways to bring the office together that do not involve happy hours, partying, etc. It seems like Slalom was built on a bit of a ""frat"" mentality and that can turn some people off. I would like to see more opportunities for the families of Slalom consultants to get together to celebrate instead of just setting up events for spouses/spices/consultants.

Salaries and compensation are in line with the market, but I would like to see additional benefits added (more attractive PTO plans, additional 401k match, paternity leave, etc)"
1661,Slalom,Continues to live by the core values.,2014-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really is a great company.  Being private means not having to answer to every quarterly earnings demand.  Being small means not having onerous processes ""nor too many checkers checking checkers.""  Being present means having leadership connected to doing the right thing for the employees.  Being local means sidling up next to our clients, who are our neighbors, and working towards a common goal.","Still a young company so has some maturing to do around some areas of client management, specific career development, and sophistication of tools/assets."
1662,Slalom,"Surrounded by motivated, smart, and happy employees",2014-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"After 10+ years I am still as excited about working here as I was on day 1.  Slalom celebrates our people and we work as a team.  While we have offices all over the US and now in London, we consider ourselves ONE TEAM.  I am challenged everyday and continue to learn and grow in one of the most exciting fields there is out there.","Work on more competitive benefits around PTO and 401K match.  The investor program is amazing, but since it's not open to everyone, we need to look at other ways to bump up the benefits."

Hartford is a tough market but we offer something very unique in terms of our happy employees, top talent, and focus on doing what's right.",The 401K match is the one glaring inconsistency with Slalom's focus on people. I suspect that they will be addressing it soon to help ensure Slalom is just as competitive as other employers.

They stress ""always do the right thing."" Great team support, huge opportunities for growth if you want them (opt-in culture) and excellent work/life balance.",Slalom has an opt-in attitude which is what attracts a lot of people.  The opportunities are there if you want them.  Two challenges with that. (1) newer employees don't always get the Slalom culture and appear to struggle a bit on what is (or isn't) expected from them; (2) the career path opportunities change quite a bit as part of Slalom's tremendous growth.  Its hard to keep up with what those opportunities are.

- Management I can trust: I sincerely believe the New York management has my best interests in mind. The GM is thoughtful, smart, fun to be around, and a great motivator for the office. I have never worked in a place where the head of the office can both feel like a leader AND a friend. Meanwhile, the head of my group and my career counselor have me feeling like I could never find better support anywhere else. 

- I have been allowed to forge my own path. If you want to create something here and if it works for Slalom's business, you've got a match! This company will enable you to grow into the consultant or business manager you want to be.

1691,Slalom,"Great environment, happy people",2014-09-23,5.0,Management Consultant,"Compensation, training opportunities, work-life balance, perks, entrepreneurial spirit

Some of the same, great people from the big consulting firms, minus the hand-slapping for not understanding convoluted processes that I was never trained properly on. It is a safe place to learn and grow deep skills. Looking forward to working with a variety of clients instead of staying at the same place year after year. 

The environment is family oriented, and really supportive. It is easy to have a good time when you work with great people who are willing be to flexible and work together to achieve goals. 

Probably the most significant difference is how easy it has been to step up and work on all of those things I never got exposure to before, but wanted to. I guess that is the benefit of being at a smaller company in general and how they help you get the experience you want.",Breaking into a new market for Slalom... but that is the reason why I joined in the first place!
1692,Slalom,Private company that puts employees first,2014-09-22,3.0,Consultant,Smart people.  Promotes work/life balance.  Many extra activities outside of work to get involved with,"Not always enough work to go around.  Bench time if you are hired for specific skill, and no work available."
1693,Slalom,"Come work with hard working, passionate individuals",2014-09-19,4.0,Consultant,"Slalom has allowed me to have a sense of independence I enjoyed when self-employed, and at the same time given me the support, drive, and sense of community I have enjoyed about working at a company.  My experience with my team and management has been a very positive one, with honest interest from my boss on whether I am happy with my client, work and team, and a shared sense of responsibility for my career growth.  

Slalom has some great perks, such as the 4 week paid sabbatical once reached 3 years/6k billable hours, some nice training and self-education resources, and a great support network across the organization.

My experience at Slalom has been a positive one, with management very interactive, interested in retaining consultants and understanding what is and is not working around the office.  Slalom is very thoughtful in their hiring process, and therefore very invested in you and your happiness as an employee.","Not a large amount of paid time off; greater diversity within management is needed; while a lot of opportunities to participate in ""non-billable"" internal projects, business development, and ""fun"" office activities, often can become challenge to do all and balance with billable time."
1694,Slalom,Would work here again!,2014-09-18,4.0,Internal Employee,"Great company culture; senior management cares about its employees; fun benefits (annual retreat, prizes, social opportunities/activities); work with really smart people; great ""family"" feel; great values; fast paced and growth oriented company","A lot of focus is placed on developing the consultant (career development, compensation, bonus structure, etc) and not a lot of attention is given to employees who are internal to the company (non-consultant).  There aren't as many growth opportunities for non-consultants."
1695,Slalom,More concerned with staff augmentation than delivering great work,2014-09-18,3.0,Consultant,"Slalom's salary, bonus, professional development, and consultant sabbatical programs are very competitive and attractive. The corporate culture is very much like a fraternity—the positive of which is always a great Christmas party, an all-expense-paid trip (including spouses and spices) in the Spring, and quartet events and happy hours throughout the year.","The work environment is often very hostile and even abusive at times. Consultant successes are rarely recognized but even minor infractions and hearsay are given great volume in Slalom's negative-focuses review process. Several employees, myself included, have even endured personal attacks on our character and families as a result of perceived performance issues at work. Managers are instructed to downgrade employee ratings and peer-reviews are dismissed out of hand. The sales and leadership teams don't demonstrate a good understanding of much of the work they're selling—specifically user experience and custom development work—and tend to see all the practitioners of these disciplines as interchangeable despite their specializations. Much greater emphasis is given to ""butts-in-seats"" billable time than to the quality of the deliverables. Criticism and collaboration are often discouraged and the work, frankly, shows it. There are some incredibly talented people at Slalom that could be doing much better work in a more constructive and less hostile environment. The company is also driven by people who espouse, but do not live, work-life balance. The result is a difficult environment for employees with families or aiming to have families. There is also little or no room for career growth outside of the sales path."
1696,Slalom,TRIM THE FAT and pass it to the worker bees!,2014-09-16,3.0,Consultant,People are top notch and just plain fun and interesting.   I feel supported at my client and pushed to deliver great results.,"Internal folks are unaccounted for .  Consultants work their fingers off only to find that a few internal folks are paid 40 hours a week but don't work it yet are still reaping the benefits of the worker bees.  Let's live up to ""Always do Right.""   Sign-me up for full time pay where working part time is acceptable.  It's discouraging and makes me seek the smaller leaner firms.  Would hate to leave but I don't want my pay to be funding unproductive overhead.   Oh, are we really employee owned....I am an employee and don't see ownership."

No regrets, I am still thankful to this day that the amazing recruiters decided to reach out to me! I've been staffed on some good projects, new tech, impressive clients, and challenging tasks. I love being pushed professionally, and even a little personally, and the team in this Boston office delivers. The atmosphere is loaded with ""can-do"" with a topping of ""go for it"".

If you have the opportunity to join Slalom in any market, don't be stupid, you have to join.","Career paths are blurry right now, but if you know what you want, you can get it.

Interesting project.  Not just the typical bland enterprise application / staff aug. work you find at a lot of other firms.
Given opportunity to discover and become experienced in a range of technologies and not forced to be pigeon holed into one stack. 
Given honest and constructive reviews as part of career advancement.
Very smart and interesting people.  There's no sense of I have to be smarter than everyone else and have to show it off in order to get ahead.
No travel and I can be at home with my family.","Not entirely sure how career advancement works before moving up to leadership roles.  We have a pretty flat structure and don't have a sense of milestones to work towards before moving up to the next level.  That said, I don't feel like I'll be 'stuck' by any means.  I'm rather confident I'll be in a forward and upward position a year from now. The lack of structure here just might be jarring to someone expecting it."

Also nice to have the bench time pay as a fall back when you are in between projects.,"It is really important to vet every project that comes your way to verify the scope of work as well as the ability to deliver the work.

1704,Slalom,Great place to work,2014-08-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Slalom is a great company filled with brilliant people to work alongside.  They have a very strong company culture that focuses a lot on the individual - both from a career standpoint as well as work-life balance.,"Slalom's rich culture is focused on the consultants.  If you are in an internal / corporate position, not only do you not receive the same ""special treatment"" as the consultants', you also don't get paid as much, or valued by the company."
1705,Slalom,Best company I have been a part of,2014-08-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I see some sour grapes on this site because some people do not always get everything they want, but across the board, I have seen more people do amazing work than any company I've been involved with. The level of quality at this firm is amazingly high. To get noticed, your work must be truly exceptional and the culture is one that people are excited to show what they are capable of. Top performers are rewarded appropriately. Anyone who does outstanding work will be recognized. That sounds obvious, but it is amazing how many people blame external factors instead of focusing on their skills and contributions. People at this company help each other, even if they are not directly involved on the same team. Generally, they take time out for each other. I saw some complaints about career manager interaction. Contrary to what others have said, career managers are very involved with the performance of each person, even if they do not work with them individually on a team. Management is very tuned into individual performance even if they are not sitting next to every person every day. More often than not, it is the individual contributors who do not want to meet regularly, 1 on 1, or share their achievements. Managers are always open to sit down and talk, even if people want to talk to their manager's manager's manager etc. I have seen relatively junior people at the firm having lunch with top executives. They have a great open door policy. Also, social events offer some great room for people who would not otherwise meet, to cross-pollinate and discover new ways to help or be helped. If people do not love working here, it is doubtful they will love any healthy, challenging, quality work environment. If people prefer a slow, safe, simple job, they should work at a company that is done growing. We regularly get first place for 'best places to work' in almost every city where we have an office. The leadership here are the most intelligent, involved, and dedicated that I have seen. I would much rather see team budget maintain our culture than give slightly larger bonuses to people who are at the bottom of the bell curve. We survive and thrive based on our performance every day and cannot afford to make things more comfortable for the bottom of the bell curve, even as we grow.","As the firm grows, not everybody learns the same things at the same time, so it's more difficult for everyone to stay in sync and have the same understanding and visibility."
1706,Slalom,A wonderful vacation from industry,2014-08-19,5.0,Consultant,"This is my first time working for a company that spends money on its people.  Happy hours, company retreats, lunches and training.  I feel comfortable talking with anyone at the company, and there is a feeling that I set my career course and there's nothing keeping me from attaining any goal I set.  The local model works well, and the variable pay model, while risky if the bench happens, ensures that overtime work is paid work, which is refreshing coming from salaried industry.  There is a real commitment from the exec team and leadership at the local level to positive change and gaining feedback.","The Denver area is very large, so the local model can still lend itself to long commutes depending on where the project is.  The 401k match is terrible for a company that spends so much money on its employees elsewhere.  The vacation could be better, definitely.  There is some balance needed with regards to client sizes and their relative risk to the company."
1707,Slalom,Completely Agree with “Weak & Insecure Leadership Team” posting on 4/29/14 -- Couldn't have said it better myself,2014-08-05,1.0,Management Consultant,"Only pros are that if you can get on the right project and stay away from the office, you can work locally and take a break from high pressure work.  Good for a temporary reprieve from real work with real people and real clients.","When I read the current employee's review posted on 4/29/14, I felt as if I could have been the one who wrote that.  The Denver team is completely full of themselves and do not have the skills to back it up.  It's like a social country club of wanna-be's and I was so disappointed in my time there."
1708,Slalom,Kept the best parts of consulting and dropped the worst (i.e. travel!),2014-07-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- No travel! Unless you're on the national team, 100% local.  You can sleep in your own bed every night and actually have a life!
- Hardworking, passionate workforce who is dedicated to high quality work, but everyone really values their personal lives (you can work in consulting and still have a family and hobbies!).  This is driven from the top and expectations are set up front with clients to keep way more reasonable hours than the big firms
- Feels like you can truly ""be yourself"" - company cares about you as a person; diverse group of people but all with really solid experience (many Big 4)
- Collaborative/helpful workforce - very flat structure and no up or out model
- Proactive in continuous improvement - still young enough, you can play a part in shaping things, but every week you get asked to provide input or some new initiative is launching which demonstrates the maturity and strong investments being made (founds are still around and truly care)","- Must be very self-driven and able to work autonomously without a ton of direction - it's ""consulting for grown ups"", but this is not for everyone
- Heavy focus on technology projects (though not ERP implementations) - need to sell our ability to do even more larger transformation projects than we're already doing"

Every project I have been on has been a very high value, cutting edge project with a very cool client. I am never bored at work and generally enjoy the staffing. Slalom is also no travel.","The benefits are not that great at all. The healthcare packages are expensive for what they are. There is little paid time off, for instance, after 24 mo., you get 144 hours, but before that you only get two weeks. It should also be mentioned that PTO and sick days are combined in the same  hours set. The 401(k) is also weak in match with a bunch of requirements attached to it. There is also a big imbalance between the technology services and the business consulting groups when it comes to work-life balance. The IT projects  are usually over 40 hour weeks and recruiting can never seem to hire people fast enough to match growth."

It's not just geographic expansion, but capabilities as well. Over the past two years alone, Slalom has launched a Customer Engagement practice and a Digital practice.

The profit margin is very low, but the mark-up on consultants time is very high.  To some extent this is the fault of the customers, who are mostly boring and slow moving.

Think about that... do you want to join another Accenture?  Consultants overall are not as skilled as advertised.  Business Intelligence team is extremely weak, almost unable to staff.  We are still unable to staff technical resources on my project, so most consultants are on an island by themselves - taking all the heat from the client.  Little to no support from the weak management structure.","Weak & insecure leadership team.  Leadership team blames anyone but themselves, so be careful of this type of environment.  There is no clear view into pipeline and projects, nor project alignment to skill sets.
Management team - I've never worked any place where they are this insecure and closed off.
No vacation - any time off is taken from pay (doctor, sick time, family emergencies, etc.).  Awful.
Relatively low pay considering model.  Beware of variable model of pay, as bench time will lead to half pay and/or termination.  4-7% bonuses on average.  No pay raises.
Do you want to earn $40-50 an hour, have little to no chance at advancement and continually clean up after other weak consultants?  My advice - you deserve more than Slalom.  Don't believe the hype."

Everyone is a team player and supportive of each other so when a problem arises there are people lined up to help.","The projects you will encounter are not challenging unless they place you as team lead at a client, in which case navigating political waters and project management should be your strengths. It is expected of the consultant to grow their skill sets outside of the client work environment which is very difficult since 40% of one's bonus is based on extra curricular activities within Slalom. They also advertise an ""unlimited"" training budget, but that is very subjective."

Fantastic culture and interesting colleagues - not just people you can work with, but people you want to be friends with.
Transparent approachable leadership - met the top 5 leaders in the company within the first 2 months of joining and see them at least once a year.
Admirable values that respect the client and community - no billing unnecessarily, or volunteering services that aren't our strengths. Lots of emphasis on social giving and charities.
Fun events - from recurring office events to the awesome annual shindigs 
Small close-knit market - ability to help shape and build the team and get to know everyone.
Impressive growth trajectory as a company","Meaningful work - engagements tend to be high profile staff augmentation as the company works to grow exposure and move up market. (There are some teams working on case study worthy consulting work, but it's a minority of the company)
Limited client base - partially driven by the Hartford market, partially driven by the fact that we are still growing here (trending positive in the past 6 months)
Vacation is non-negotiable - however leadership is flexible in supporting consultant needs.
Lack of process/formalized career path - I think this is a positive, but some folks miss the opportunity of knowing the rigid steps they need to hit to climb the consulting ladder
Diversity of background - experience tends to be from consulting backgrounds, however, this has gotten much better in the past 6 months."

The Atlanta office built a Rube Goldberg machine to demonstrate their ability to effectively engineer a complex project based on vague requirements. This kind of amazing, creative collaboration was the primary reason I sought employment at Slalom. Slalom provides an open social network to communicate with employees nation-wide which is a wonderful tool for professional development and problem-solving.","Working in the New York Office was the most negative, counter-productive and mortifying work experience I've had in my 26-year career. The climate and ""leadership"" of the New York office is antithetical to the open social network, team collaboration, and integrity of the rest of the organization.

The management, in an effort to masquerade their incompetence, scapegoats individuals, hiding from colleagues and customers only occasionally to pop up with bizarre emails nitpicking random punctuation-related minutiae without offering clear constructive guidance as to expectations. Customers get about as much respect as employees: none.

For potential employees: Have you ever noticed how car dealers and other con-artists make an issue of trust and use the word honesty a lot? Honest people never have to make a point of basic decency in their conduct. Go look at Slalom New York's manager profiles and look for words like ""honest."" Now do the math."

Amazing people, fun dynamic culture, and committed to always doing the “right thing” for both clients and consultants. 

• Culture: The focus on recruiting not only industry leading talent but also fun, genuine, and diverse individuals is a huge part of Slalom’s success here. The culture is consistent across every Slalom market.
• Leadership: Approachable, transparent, and committed to practicing what they preach. You can be confident that your ideas and/or concerns are heard. Communication at this level is frequent and consistent. Despite how fast Slalom is growing, leadership manages to visit and engage every office as often as possible. They truly make it a point to know their people. 
• Work/Life Balance: Easy….you work hard with great people in a fun and flexible environment and are still able to enjoy your life! 
• Opportunity: Good mix of project/solution based work across a wide range of Business and IT service offerings. Even staff aug engagements are projects that really help our customers move the needle of their business.

The focus on people is also very, very real.  Slalom recognizes us as their greatest asset and reminds everyone of this focus on a very regular basis.  Great office events.  Did I mention the people?  The people are great.","A majority of the client work is focused on roles that would otherwise be considered staff augmentation work.

I saw a few other reviews, sounds like the complainers you get in big firms with people that don't cut the mustard. Bottom-line from what I have experienced is that Slalom cares about its people greatly and the work is strategic. I'm currently working on a project for a Multi Billion dollar company that is growing leaps and bounds and will triple in size in the next 24 months. They are growing by acquisition and I'm working on a team to do the core M&A and Organizational Design initiatives. I love it. Also the client is huge but still doesn't work with the Big 4! They don't want the mega deal sales style and have a consulting firm come in a create a dependency which is what Big 4 tend to do. This is their words, not mine. In fact, our major buyer at this client was from Accenture and won't go back to buy from them.

Anyway, I love the Slalom, I continue to learn and grow which is what the expectation was coming in. The culture is everything and more then I thought it would be. They hire very smart people and my leadership  is very open and honest about the business. Its nice to have that visibility where I didn't get that in my last firm.","Not a lot to mention. More vacation I guess but I find that since I'm now off the road, I have way more time to do the things I love to do. Its also a firm that I take a few days off here and there, work from home some Fridays or Monday so if someone was complaining about 3 weeks instead of 4; I think you actually get way more time at the end of the day at Slalom. Don't get me wrong, I get what people see on paper with 3 weeks, I take my week long vacations too. When I was on the road at my old company, I needed 5 weeks of vacation, reality was, I never got a chance to use it though."

This is a good place to get experience.,"Slalom Consulting is a very provincial company.  Every office is really its own mini-company.

They wanted to differentiate themselves by being a good place to do great consulting work. Unfortunately, they are turning into another carbon copy of Accenture and Deloitte without the research to back it up. Sloppy business development and staffing practices and univolved management.

Can work without traveling far.,"Management is not equipped to handle real growth, as they all appear to be former lifers in consulting and have very little business experience growing a 'business' not just a 'practice'.  The kindness here can kill you, literally.  You'll be given little direction, then you'll take initiative, but then the reward is minimal.  Then you'll ask for better direction and it is promised and not truly delivered.  Then you may join a variety of initiatives, but be penalized for not leading them.  

If you are not a complete end-to-end rockstar self starter and entrepreneur, you will not ascend here at all.  Some of the strongest and brightest folks here cannot move up, and there is never ever a good explanation, although the company touts their ability to help people succeed with 
transparency.  In multiple practices, you will almost never see more than 1 (if that!) consultants elevated into management from within the company.  Instead they take the easy way out and hire outside the company.  That is a clear indication of a lack of vision, mentoring, and understanding of how to grow people.  VERY few women leaders.

The talk here from day 1 is you will be challenged with great work and ""up and to the right"" challenges.  (think of that upper right gartner magic quadrant).  It just does not happen.  Great marketing, great discussions, fantastic quarterlies and culture mask a rather drab and uneventful work week at most clients.    To get a real understanding here, you need to talk to the bread and butter talented consultants.  Not the newbies or management.

Several critical accounts lost or are in peril.  The rap on Slalom used to be this was a dressed up staff aug shop.  It got better but recently it has reverted right back because there are no wins on strategic work, it is all vanilla work that less talented individuals can nail."

Knowing that I am being compared to market competition would be beneficial.

- The company is growing larger at a fast pace, especially in Chicago, so I fear that our culture and objectives will change and start to resemble those of former employers"
1808,Slalom,Great consulting company to work for,2013-02-11,5.0,Consultant,"They sell only local projects which means you virtually never have to travel. They emphasize work life balance which allows you to limit your hours to 40-45 per week if you want. Entrepreneurial culture--if you have a good idea, they will back you. You can also choose to be on the Hourly rather than salary plan which means you'll get paid for every hour you work (or you can purposely lower your hours below 40/week and it's all good).","As with most consulting company, you work at the client site so it's very difficult to project what part of town you'll be working in."
1809,Slalom,Good place to get some experience and move on,2013-02-09,2.0,,"1. Great work/life balance if you are not looking to advance your career and take home salary
2. Compensation is on par to just under par compared to industry average which I believe is fair if u are looking for 40 hr work weeks in management consulting
3. Most of senior leadership is very competitive and know what they are doing.
4. Open door policy. Most companies say it but very few actually implement it. Slalom has a hierarchical structure but otherwise has a very flat culture.
5. AMAZING Culture and consultants are good at what they do","1. Way too much investment in social activities. Agreed it promotes office culture but I feel it is detrimental in the long run cause it begins to appear like a frat type culture and seeing leadership drunk in the big events every 3 months makes Slalom look very unprofessional. Office in each region invests close to $1MM/year on such events and it makes you wonder if it makes more sense to actually give out an additional $5k in bonuses to  200 consultants (approx. # of consultants in one region)
2. Promotions are limited and if you do get promoted it's about a $5k jump in base salary so not much incentive to work harder for an additional 10 hours per week 
3. Your CM’s are there to basically just approve your monthly cell phone expense and weekly timesheets. Most of them don’t have a clue of the work you are doing at the client location since the CM is in most cases on a different client
4. Due to #3 above, the performance review process is broken. The client reviews your work and the CM basically goes over the review with you w/o having a clue of what you actually work on. The CM then assigns a star rating as per his observation of the client review. To me the CM is not qualified to provide a rating if the CM is clueless of your day to day activities
5. Benefits are below average – 12 days PTO (including sick days). 401k is not competitive and health benefits are mediocre. So basically if you want to get time off during the year, DONOT get sick
6. 80% work is staff augmentation and 20% is project based. Slalom likes to believe it’s the other way around but that is definitely not the case. 
7. To add to # 6 above, since most of the work is staff augmentation, it is very hard to justify rates of $150/hr at the client location. This impacts the consultant because if she is doing basic custom dev work on a project, it puts a lot of pressure on the consultant to justify such a high rate. Also consultant is reminded by the client several times that she is a very expensive resource. Have seen this in multiple clients with several Slalom resources."

If you enjoy consulting, but hate the Mon~Thurs travel, Slalom has a great local model that seems to work.","Client work:  unless you have cutting-edge skill-sets, your work will most likely be of the staff-aug variety.

Career progression:  slalom worked hard to develop a ""career development framework"", but it seemed to obfuscate career progressions more than streamline potential leaders to management.  Definitely a who-you-know kind of environment where playing nice with the in-crowd gets you quick rewards.

Compensation:  average comp with minimal bonuses"

Great benefits.
Amazing resources and support.","More PTO would be nice, but you can't complain too much when all the other areas are so well taken cared of."
1813,Slalom,Great Experience So Far,2013-01-07,5.0,Consultant,"Slalom has been a great switch from Accenture, though I loved it there, too. I've really enjoyed working with world-class clients with my team. Everyone lives in New York (or its environs) and I find that I have much more community here than I ever did at ACN. The work is ever-changing, and the management in the New York office is particularly empowering. I get the sense that I can have many goals and be supported by the office. 

During Hurricane Sandy, we got many emails to ensure everyone was safe and had offers for hotel rooms if we needed them. The community is becoming more diverse as we hire more people, and my colleagues really are excellent at what they do- I'm often impressed. I feel like I'm part of a group again- something I missed at a much larger firm. 

It's important at Slalom to be willing to make your own way. There is very little hand-holding here. That said, if you need support, you're always just an email or face-to-face conversation away from upper management.",Lack of PTO is a big problem and keeps good people from wanting to work here.
1814,Slalom,"Strongest, most positive culture I have ever worked in.",2012-12-26,5.0,Management,"People: smart, experienced, driven, cooperative, fun. Management is very innovative and thinks about people and long term. The result is the strongest, most positive culture I have ever worked in. 
The recruiting process was eye-opening: it was much more of a series of open conversations with managers, peers focused on how we could make it work for both Slalom and me instead of a one way ""tell us how you can work for us' approach. 
This two-way street has continued since I started working there as well: there are discussions around which clients and specific engagements make sense for Slalom, client and myself. Again: very refreshing compared to working for some of the big 4 where you would be told on a Friday which client you need to report to on Monday without asking for your opinion.","Both pro and con: there are many social events, which by itself is great, but even though attending them is not mandatory nor expected by management, your colleagues do attend them and form very strong bonds that way. You'd be missing out on that  by not attending, but this is a significant time commitment."

They are much more body shop than they are willing to admit, not a true ""consultancy"" as they pretend to both clients and candidates for employment.  Like all employers, they will throw you under the bus in a heart beat when you are vulnerable and not making them adequate margins, so don't get all into some warm fuzzy delusion that they are any different.  The middle management is also very inexperienced and immature in the way they run the business.  Not real pros.  Understand that you are entering an environment that is on a continuous sales cycle.

1852,Slalom,Tradeoff of Sorts,2012-03-25,3.0,,"- Fantastic work life balance
- Great culture
- Nice, fun-loving people
- Decent compensation","- Projects are poorly managed; problems at every level
- Very forgiving and nice (as opposed to cut-throat) culture has led to the accumulation of unmotivated (and in some cases, unqualified) people
- Management consulting work is peripheral to the firm's core IT solutions; this is frustrating if you are not interested in doing IT consulting
- Not a very conducive environment for professional development"

Pro who come mostly from big five firms
Performance is rewarded
Average of 10 years experience in most verticals","Vacation is limited (very common complaint)
Culture is very Accenture like
The flat structure is disappearing as the company grows"
1854,Slalom,"If you are smart, can work independently and are self-motivated, this is a great place to work.",2012-03-03,5.0,Consultant,"- Success is up to the employees.
- Slalom is growing and is not restrictive.
- Solid compensation.","- Slalom hires only strong consultants with at least 7 years of experience for a reason - you shouldn't expect to be coddled.  
- The company strategy is to go where the consultants want it to do.  That can be a bit unnerving if you are used to a solid vision of the markets that your company will be operating in."
1855,Slalom,Don't buy the hype,2012-02-29,1.0,,"They pay really well.
They have very supportive internal staff (for IT issues, HR issues, etc.).
They have some really fun company events (annual retreats, quarterlies, etc.).","There is no accountability and very little honesty.
They have ridiculously bad middle/upper management.
They are very political and slow to act.
They write horrible SOW's which come back and bite the consultants."
1856,Slalom,"Great People, Own your career as you see fit",2012-02-27,5.0,,"Great Company to work for. People here always respect each other and are great to work with. I've never worked for a company where I am as excited about moving the whole company forward as much as my own career. Great opportunities if you want them, the beauty of Slalom is you can move your career at the pace you want.","While it's a great place to work, the vacation given is not great. By expanding the amount of vacation given, the company would be almost perfect"
1857,Slalom,"It was a poor experience, well compensated but no opportunities for professional growth",2012-02-25,1.0,Management Consultant,"The work life balance is very good
The compensation is good
The work environment is very positive 
People are treated with respect","No opportunities for professional growth
Knowledge Management doesn't exist
The senior management is not very professional
The employees they keep are not necessarily ""A"" players"
1858,Slalom,Great work life balance,2012-02-20,5.0,,"Great coworkers and leadership, good compensation, awesome work life balance, love Vamoose and other social events, appreciate not having to travel","The vacation provided is very disappointing compared to other consulting companies, the first project I rolled onto I felt more like a contractor instead of a consultant, was stuck there for almost a year, however all of my projects after that have been great."
1859,Slalom,Fairytale beginning,2012-02-18,5.0,,"Very, very smart people.  The NY local office is packed full of the smartest people in the business.

Very entreprenurial.  All ideas for growing the business are welcome and the org provoides excellent support when you make a persuasive case for one or another initiative.

Local model means that you see your co-workers often and in varied situations.  You're not just a body biling hours at a client like other consulting firms do.

Many different technologies and business initiatives under way at any given time, shepherded by (always smart) SMEs.  Lots of cross-pollinization.","The only con is related to the local model.  It's so aggressivly local that the NY office is relatively isolated from other offices.  This is terrific on the one hand, since we have a free hand and control our own destiny.  On the other hand, there's a risk that we reinvent wheels which is not efficient.  I've only been there 3 months so far, so this ""isolation"" may well be an impression from an early NY office joiner.  I want to be clear that the isolation isn't a hard and fast rule by any means, just a natural consequence I believe of the strong emphasis on a local model."
1860,Slalom,They don't walk the walk about work life balance.  Middle management is largely inexperienced and need improvement.,2012-02-17,1.0,,Peers are competent.  Slalom works hard to provide opportunities to socialize with co-workers.,"Slalom doesn't support employees.  You are a billable resource and nothing more--regardless of Slalom's significant efforts to move up the ranks in ""best place to work"" polls like this."
1861,Slalom,Slalom is one company that truly gets that the employee is it's greatest resource.,2012-01-04,5.0,Consultant,"Local model that prevents the need to travel, but has the option to do so if desired.  Slalom is growing rapidly and looking for feedback on how best to do so.  Employees are very bright and the screening process is very stringent with a strong focus on cultural fit.","Lacks the benefits package of a Fortune 50 company, but I have faith that the winning model will get there."
1862,Slalom,Consultants come first,2012-01-02,5.0,,"Slalom puts a premium on consultant satisfaction and this approach clearly works in leading to client satisfaction due to the very high level of ""repeat buying."" You are encouraged to find your path and make things happen for yourself.",Reasons for rapid expansion are not widely understood.

1865,Slalom,Enjoyable experience but limited opportunities for growth and advancement due to the local model,2011-12-16,2.0,,Good people to work with - when it's going good it's going good - The local model helps establish a good team culture.,Because of the local model - there are limits to advancement opportunites.  Probably trying to do too much for the size and level of expertise typically available in each local office -
1866,Slalom,Fantastic employment experience,2011-12-15,5.0,,"The people are top rate, and exceptionally skilled.",The consulting industry is very fast-paced -- not for the faint of heart

- Fostering of the culture remains prioirty

- Growth pains
- Some deficiency in account management"
1868,Slalom,"Staff Augmentation, Conflicting Management Priorities, Communication Breakdown...",2011-12-15,2.0,Consultant,"Good people at the staff level
Company events are nice, but over the top in comparison with day-to-day culture
Some groups are doing interesting work","Staff augmentation focused, contracting firm calling itself a consulting organization
After a deal is sold, ""consultants"" are left without support
Difficult clients are retained at the expense of ""consultants""
Leaders are not invested in the technologies they represent
Chain of leadership has conflicting priorities
Communication is confusing to staffed ""consultant"", client, and team
Very much a clique culture
Variable pay model is pushed, but bench time makes it a bad deal for ""consultants""
Mediocre benefits
Managers focused on staffing, not growing the business
A contracting company would be a better choice"
1869,Slalom,A Company that Cares,2011-12-14,4.0,Consultant,"Upper management truly cares about each individual employee.  It is amazing that not only your general manager, but also the corporate level execs attend a ton of the local office's events.

Intelligent People!  I can't speak enough about the competence of my fellow co-workers.  They are amazing leaders in the field that offer you all the challenges you could desire in a job.

The company encourages and welcomes professional development.  It is great to be at an organization that values its employees and allows them to challenge themselves outside of the normal client work.

No Travel, which equates to a great work life balance.

The Dallas office has a ""Getting Naked"" policy, where integrity, honesty, and ethics runs deep.","Paid Time Off seems a bit sparse and was not negotiable.  
Career advancement is a bit confusing and tends to lack definition.
On-boarding was a bit lacking."
