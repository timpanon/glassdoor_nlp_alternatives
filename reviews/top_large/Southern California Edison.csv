Perfect place to ""ride it out"" with job stability and pretty good benefits. Great if you like repetitive work.","Filled with microaggressions, gaslighting, and passive-aggressiveness. They encourage you to ""come to work as yourself,"" but it's just a show. Most black people here are unhappy and unsure how to move forward. Their brand of diversity is to prop you up and make it look like they care while minimizing your voice and questioning your intelligence. The worst company culture I have been a part of in that regard. 

Other than that, it seems everything is about keeping the status quo. New ideas are meant with opposition, and good luck trying to move up."

If that executive retires or is moved to a different chain of command, you will become a target of some employees (some with five, ten, or more extended family members employed by SCE) who do not have good intentions.",I’ve never worked in such a horrible environment of lies and nastiness. Much of it came from women trying to get ahead at anyone’s expense. Senior managers gave subordinates and peers mean -spirited nicknames without any fear of reprisals. Others just spread lies and rumors about employees they felt threatened by or just didn’t like. Managers who have multiple ethics complaints filed against them continue to be employed for years and years while you scratch your head as they operate in a manner that slaps the company’s supposed culture in the face. Watch your back.

The company is working on becoming more diverse.,"Bad managers are tolerated and none of them are ever moved no matter how many complaints are submitted. Average to slightly below average pay. Annual pay raises are very small 2.5% - 3% tops within Human Resources and Talent Solutions. Very few growth possibilities in talent acquisition and advancement opportunities are based on who likes you instead of being based on experience, knowledge and competancy. Making any kind of complaint is frowned upon by multiple levels of managers and making suggestions to improve disfunctional processes is not welcomed. This is not an innovative talent acquisition group and that is probably true of the whole company."

73,Southern California Edison,Dead end job with no accountability,2021-12-28,1.0,Energy Advisor,The benefits are pretty good,"A culture pervades at SCE where because they are a monopoly there is hardly any accountability for anything. If they screw over their customers with 90 minute hold times or broken promises it doesn’t really matter because where else can they go? Tell 50 customers you will call them back and never do? Oh well moving on. Manager A helps Edison lose $30 million? Well because SCE gets their budget from the California Public Utilities Commission, and therefore SCE isn’t forced to make any cuts, Manager A can shift blame a bit and easily keep their job. Again, it all comes down to lack of accountability. Unfortunately this culture of lethargy and unaccountability that infects anyone who stays there long enough also colors how supervisors/managers treat their employees concerns. 

If you are going to work here in this position I recommend you play the game for a bit get a little experience and jump ship to something better as soon as you can (1 year or less). Your leaders would be fine if you kept the same dead end job for 25 years and the reason is not because they don’t care about your development it’s because the bureaucratic system at SCE is overwhelming, obtuse, disinterested and utterly incapable of seeing you as anything more than just another rep on the phone.

Avoid this job!"

124,Southern California Edison,Flexible Schedule & Manager Dependent Culture. Great Benefits,2021-08-13,5.0,Engineer,"In Engineering departments, all full-time engineers are salaried. Managers are flexible with start times between 6-9 am. Since engineers are salaried, they have the flexibility to go to a doctors appointment or run errands at will without having to make up the time. The expectation is if you are on top of your work you will not be micromanaged.

Excellent safety culture. Safety is Edison's #1 priority always.

Engineering Departments offer many developmental opportunities and genuinely want to see you grow and succeed.

SCE has an excellent internship program and the easiest way to get hired as a full-time engineer is to start as an intern and get converted to a full-time position.

Opportunities to move around. Engineers can apply to different departments and are often successful candidates. The company values having a breadth of experiences and understanding the intersectionality of the business and how all of the different departments, and the work they do, affect each other.

Great benefits. Many different options for healthcare. Vision and Dental included. Up to 12% employer contribution to 401k. Salaries are raised annually. Raises and bonuses are dependent on position and performance reviews.","Being salaried goes both ways. While engineers have the flexibility to step away for a while, unless they have meetings, when the occasional ""Drop-Everything"" task rolls in you will be expected to work until it is done, usually overtime is not approved. Across the company there is a lot of work and not enough people to do it. The executives and department heads are aware of this and continuously try to improve process efficiency instead of hiring more staff. Some engineering groups are ridiculously overworked, while others have incredibly manageable work loads.

While the Safety Culture is widespread, every team has its own unique culture. This is to be expected with any group of individuals with an array of personalities. Some teams are more toxic than others and it is largely dependent on the quality/experience of the manager over that team.

With all that said, SCE is a great company to work for and they really value their Engineers."

If you're not part of the cult and don't play games then you are treated as an outcast and eventually pushed out.

Most middle management can tell who's actually reliable, but for some reason upper management picks favorites that don't align with who's actually doing the heavy lifting.

There were so many complaints to HR about the culture of the Finance department over the years, and it only worsened over time. The turnover rate is ridiculous. If HR gave everyone a truly anonymous assessment of the leadership, they'd find a lot of feedback reflecting an extremely low employee morale (to put it nicely)."

Salaries not keeping pace with cost of living in SoCal.
Old fashioned - never trust your employees enough to let them work remotely - management philosophy. Only Covid was able to force a temporary change in this. You will be back in the office coughing on each other at the earliest opportunity. Otherwise, it will look as though managers have no one to manage. 
Constant reorgs and revolving layoffs - this is how they ""refresh"" the workforce.

309,Southern California Edison,OK,2020-08-12,3.0,Anonymous,"These are my own personal experiences, and your own experience may differ if you decide to join SCE. 

The focus on safety was amazing. With every meeting starting off with a safety moment and the massive investments into safety training was encouraging. If you think safety is important then take a closer look at SCE.

The focus on work-life balance was overall good. I never recall working past 45 hours in a given week and sometimes less than 40 hours.  Management was helpful in accommodating various personal situations so that employees don't feel overwhelmed. The work environment was collaborative and helpful. I never experienced someone pushing back if I needed help or had a question.

SCE is highly focused on sustainability, but more externally than internally. Although they don’t focus much on environmental sustainability within (e.g., buildings, transportation), they have made innovating a cleaner and safer energy grid a high priority with various investments in things such as distributed energy, covered conductors, and transportation electrification.

The pay was pretty good when considering the complexity and volume of work. Benefits were close to public sector offerings.

Humans need electricity and SCE has a natural monopolistic position to provide it within its fixed service territory.  As a result, most jobs were safe and there wasn't the added stress of competition.","SCE was riddled with subcultures. If you work in one BU such as Finance then move over to IT, you’ll experience very different cultures. You’ll wonder if you are working for the same company. I believe the root cause of this issue is attributed to two things: lack of connection of each team’s work to the company’s mission and managers who really shouldn’t be managers. As you know, managers can make or break your experience. Also, there’s a lack of continuity in carrying out the company’s values and competencies in everyday work. If you ask most SCE employees what are the values, they won’t know. It’s only important when it comes to annual reviews.

It was very challenging to be promoted or promote high performing employees. You had to find another higher-level job or rely on politics for promotions. This was unfortunate. Also, the hiring/interview process was highly subjective and not necessarily based on qualifications or skills, rather was based on “do I like this person” or “will this person give me a problem”. 

SCE did not do a very good job with budgeting or operational planning. Every year I would hear the term, “cost pressures”. This was because financial forecasts were poorly done. It was based on anecdotes from various managers and not so much on “what do we really need to get important work done” or ""what are highest priorities this year"". As a result, every year we had fire drills to find pennies to cut costs. Executives would tout no layoffs, but in reality, it was probably a financially prudent thing to do for long term gains. In sum, short term thinking when making decisions.

Other than the CEO and some VPs, executive leadership was lackluster. Either they rose up through favoritism, tenure, and some simply needed better communication skills. In all honesty, I wasn’t entirely sure what some did for the company.

The decision-making experience was risk-averse. Meetings after meetings to make sure everyone provided inputs. Lower level decision-making wasn't visibly encouraged as everything had to be vetted by management. I sometimes wondered why middle management even existed.

Although the company talked a lot about “customers”, I really felt that the true customer was the CPUC. Most important decisions went through attorneys. It was a very “compliance-focused” work environment. 

Please keep in mind that SCE is a monopoly without much “true” competition. They weren’t fighting for market share or customers. People need electricity."

Honestly.,"Good work life balance is possible, depending on both the manager and department... but usually requires very conscious political tactics to achieve.  (like heavy perception management).  

Layoffs have been a concern in recent years.  

The culture is difficult:  it's extremely weighted toward ""who you know"" - to get promotions especially; to get jobs - despite whether you already work there;  even to get positive performance reviews. Extremely political environment.   For some personalities, thriving in this kind of culture comes easily.  But know yourself!!  For others it's definitely a tough road.  

Accountability for your actions is low at Edison.  If you're trying to get away with being lazy - or not meeting your goals, maybe this will help you... but the real negative is that it's tough to feel like you're ever doing something that matters. (adding value).  Another consequence is that bad managers CAN still avoid accountability, which can be tough if you're the direct report."

The overall controllers group is largely consisted of folks who worked there for a long time but lacked the competency that you would expect from a Fortune 500 company. In recent years the management had launched various rounds of reorganizations and laid off some employees.

The company does not offer many opportunities for learning or career growth. Internal promotion is nearly impossible unless you have the connection to the upper middle management.

Benefits and work-life balance (for the most part) were stellar.","Take my experience with a grain of salt, as I trust I only saw a small part of the big picture: Part of the reason why I left was to get exposure to other industries/business models. I was stagnant in my position and tried feeling out project manager title jobs but got some feedback from the hiring managers that they wouldn't consider my project involvement or project management classes and my senior business analyst title as ""project manager experience,"" even though they liked me. They seemed to promote from within their own group or there was a lateral from elsewhere in the company. Additionally, around the time I left in 2015, there had been a lot of internal reorganization that made the work environment really negative. For the reasons above and other personal ones, I decided to look elsewhere."

In all, it's a great company, and if you have a chance to work here, you should absolutely grab it!","""Generalists"" are favored over experts for senior leadership roles which can lead to inexperienced leaders who may or may not have the appropriate subject matter expertise to manage specialized disciples. 

Additionally, in my opinion SCE has far too many middle managers (Manager and Senior Managers). I would recommend having more reports to a single manager and slimming the management ranks.  

One other challenge is the frequent rotation of Directors - these are people who have been earmarked for potential executive positions. While maybe a bit of an over generalization, from what I've seen,  each new Director is looking to make their mark, which can led to frequent changes in strategy and vision; and inefficiencies as a team will be on one trajectory and then forced to pivot with the change in leadership. 

SCE is also a multi-generational company, which has resulted in an uneven skill sets in some groups. Much of the older generation was part of the ""employment for life generation"" and haven't pushed to acquire the skills needed in the present market. I would recommend offering early retirement in order to slim bloated ranks and bring in fresh blood who are motivated, comfortable working within dynamic, agile environments, and have the most current skill sets. 

Additionally, promotions are very difficult to come by at SCE. A lot of very talented people have been locked into the same seniority role for a decade or more. In order to get a promotion you will almost always have to leave your current team or organization and move to another one."

The opportunities that were discussed in my interviews haven't materialized and I now understand why:  As senior (tenured believing) staff is against new ideas or embracing change, management is unable to incubate new ideas.  If you have to wait 20 years until anyone will listen to your ideas, those people with the new ideas will go somewhere else (or just give up and start ""pulling a paycheck"")."

428,Southern California Edison,IT is run by outsourcing,2018-08-12,1.0,Project Engineer/Solution Architect,A very few people in Enterprise Architecture know what they’re doing,"IT development is run by Infosys and TCS and they’ve entirely taken over operations. In 2015 SCE let go over 300 full time people and replaced them with Infosys and TCS, offshore companies. Since then IT’s budget has tripled and the quality of work done primarily by people in India has been severely lacking in quality while at the same time skyrocketing in costs. 
Two reorgs have enabled incompetent managers that have been there for life and essentially taken control away from the few people like myself in Enterprise Architecture that actually know what they’re doing.
I chose to leave before even having a new job because the toll it was taking on me severely impacted the quality of life and it pained me to see the wasteful practices of over spending and incompetence.

Are you contributing to the negative things you're describing or are you focused on the positive?"". Shortly there after as I was getting ready for bed I looked at myself in the mirror and realized how foolish I had been in my conversation with my daughter. I wasn't practicing what I had counseled my daughter nor what I encourage my co-workers to do, I had Hypocrite written all over my face because a few weeks ago I posted a review that was based on rumor & innuendo with unflattering and unprofessional comments about Edison and their Leadership. I have requested that post be retracted and offer my sincere apology to the company, their Leadership, current and retired employees. 
Pros: Edison; recognizes and celebrates diversity, encourages and provides hundreds of opportunities to give back to the communities in which we serve and live, provides training and professional development opportunities to all its employees, provides thousands of dollars in scholar to eligible  high school students in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM). In addition Edison has numerous Affinity Groups that offer the opportunity to connect and get involved. The electric utility industry has experienced exponential change over the past 10 years with more to come and Edison Leadership works tirelessly to ensure our Strategic Initiatives align with our changing industry. 
My challenge to all that use Glass Door to post reviews, is Edison or your current employer a 100% Perfect company? Probably not, every company has it's strengths and weaknesses and cannot be everything to everyone. It's what YOU do to advance the strengths and work to minimize the weaknesses that counts. Edison has been a great company/family to work for and they are interested in hiring the Best and the Brightest to Engineer, Construct a Maintain the electric grid well into the future and posting negative reviews isn't going to help recruit the caliber of talent needed.",Not a perfect company but the positives far outweigh the negatives.

In a company of 10,000+ employees (and a few thousand contractors), you're bound to find some friendly, smart, and like-minded people. And if you're really lucky, you'll find yourself working for a great manager - something that's actually rare.  The benefits (including 401k, pension, and pay), true to the reputation, are good. They're not GREAT, like they'd want you to believe, but they're solid. The most important thing about working at SCE, though, is that you'll learn to appreciate working at a good company when you find one, a place that has a healthy work environment, embraces positive leadership philosophy, and values its engaged and motivated workforce.","The company's structure and philosophies are outdated, but like any large company, change happens slowly. The struggle is that the leaders at the top are blind to the weaknesses in their failing leadership and while multiple grassroots movements are trying to save the company, they remain unrecognized and unsupported. Because the current system benefits the  leadership, important changes fail to be made because it would mean a loss of their privileges. The biggest day-to-day challenge of working at SCE, however, is the company's culture of mediocrity and lack of accountability. Keeping your head down and not making waves is a sure way to keep your job. Worse, instead of letting go of employees who fail to perform, these employees manage to stick around and, if things are bad enough, are just moved elsewhere in the company."

This was my 2nd job out of college so it gave me a great background and experience for future jobs.  I would have worked here my entire career if the plant had stayed open.

We had lots of regulatory problems that we were working through and improving upon.  Unfortunately managers who made calls on new equipment installation didn't do a good job and we wound up shutting down.  Prior to the shutdown they hired a lot of new people then 3 years later brought in new management to lay people off.  From what I've read about SCE in the news, lay-offs are a common thing and morale is pretty bad throughout the company.  They didn't do much to help us union guys find jobs within the company.

Employee engagement/satisfaction is relatively low and depending who you work for, you may not feel valued -- that being said, if you are self-motivated and look more to your own work for self satisfaction vs. getting it from others, things can work out well for you.  Good pay and benefits.","Siloes between organizations and competing priorities make it difficult to know where to focus or to get things done.  Changing environment, reductions in force have had an impact on many employees -- both those who have been let go and those who are still here."
685,Southern California Edison,Senior Project Manager,2016-07-14,1.0,Senior Project Manager,"Hard to find anything positive these days - seriously. The employee base wants to be engaged and energized, but continual job cuts, benefit cuts, demotions, and lack of commitment to employees as PEOPLE instead of NUMBERS kills all motivation. Company is trying to hire younger talent -- the only positive I see -- but even they feel no commitment.","Continual cost-cutting, loss of jobs, poor morale, chasing the benchmarks of other companies instead of creating our own strategy and energizing the employee base. Company is targeting longer-term employees for job cuts -- the ones who helped build the company. Younger employees getting promoted with little experience, causing havoc to themselves and those they lead."
686,Southern California Edison,Senior Project Manager,2016-07-13,1.0,Senior Project Manager,"Most existing employees are still dedicated to upholding the 100 year old SCE ideals of Good service, square dealing and courteous treatment. Unfortunately, upper management has long abandoned these qualities for ""lets F the employees and customers so we can line our pockets with more $$$""","Cost cutting to the point of no return, too many good people are being shown the door with no regard to the talent and experience being lost; just to save a few dollars compared to the young, green and inexperienced who they can pay less in salary and benefits. Layoffs are continuing with no end in sight. Employees completely demoralized as they wait to get severed, and severance benefits appear to get worse and worse with each consecutive go around. So sad to see a once great and respected part of SoCal life reduced to a joke. Check out SCE's Yelp ratings to see how customers view the company; not good is putting it lightly."

The senior leaders of the company don't live the values.  In every meeting with our most senior leader he never asked me how my work environment was and whether my leader was doing a good job.  I would have said my work environment was toxic but my leader was doing best job possible - needed more support.

The people that helped build a strong diverse company are being booted out for India based company and non American visa workers. Managers that remain are solely in it for themselves and building there own empires. Programs that fail miserably are made to look successful.

693,Southern California Edison,La La Land,2016-07-04,1.0,Supervisor,Above average pay with big trade offs.,"For the first two years I was very happy because I was so focused on getting promoted due my experience and post graduate education. I started seeing how other people were getting treated which was very poor and  is now  a continuing pattern. Union or non union it made no difference as to the poor treatment received. I was given  access to lay off transcripts  by management and was saddened to read that the first words out of the lay off specialist was "" your lay off has nothing to do with your work performance at SCE "" .  The VPs did not deny effort to lay off with little regard to service or education. I saw employees with Masters degrees and over thirty years of service get kicked to the trash can.  After I investigated I found the typical rational for large corps. was to increase  revenue and hide behind the Visa laws ( the legality is still be questioned ) . Once upon a time SCE was family now SCE is like a very dysfunctional family full of hate and discontent for others in the family.  The bottom line is that no only are the employees suffering but perhaps most important so are the customers."

Pay and benefits are changing for the worse though with small but consistent takeaways here and there.,"Multiple rounds of layoffs (""OpX"") of all non-field jobs have left employee morale broken with no trust in leadership. Many departments have went through 2 or 3 major layoff rounds in past 3-4 years with more to come and no real end in sight. Company is hiring overpriced external consulting companies (i.e. Bain and friends) and evaluating and outsourcing anything it can as that is the strategy-du-jour.

- Above-market salaries and benefits for level of responsibility
- Moving between organizational units/departments is encouraged
- Can be decent work/life balance in certain departments","- Senior leadership does not have the innate capabilities to develop a true vision to unify the company; they state mission objectives as a vision, such as providing safe, affordable, reasonably-priced power, but those have no emotional appeal.
- The past five years of ""operational excellence"" have been extremely poorly executed.  Instead of effectively analyzing the processes (of which there are many that are both ineffective and inefficient), they launched an initiative overload of re-orgs and head count reductions which just left fewer people to work with the same or slightly improved ineffective/inefficient processes which causes remaining employees to become extremely stressed.
- The company's stated values are Excellence, Integrity, Respect, Continuous Improvement and Teamwork.  Leadership does not always live these values.  Several senior managers who are well known for disrespectful/harsh styles remain in positions for years.

An example of their sometime Stepford-like culture: fairly cush, well-paying jobs means plenty of folks never leave, get paid well, don't do much, and whenever in group settings state their name and years with the company (e.g. Bob Harris, 27 years) which leads to fawning adulation when someone has a big number (41 years with the company!!!! - swoon....) which of course also means if you're a relatively new employee and have to preface any comment, question, or suggestion by saying ""George, 2 years), dismissive chuckles, condescending tones, and insincere consideration will likely follow.

Currently there is a lot of downsizing/out sourcing. Organization is focused on pushing customers to automated systems such as sce.com or auto automated phone system.

Operates at a very low efficiency level, a majority of IT has been outsourced which is completely a joke. Causing system down issues that normally are resolved in a couple of hours to last for days. 

I would recommend to stay away from the CCO organization, it is a black hold, no development opportunities.  Really no way out. Restrictions of a 2 year commitment when I originally took the job,

Management was caring and employee focused.  Customer care was always a top concern.  Leadership was sound and willing to take on a cause. My work group was a family-like team, not just coworkers. Pay was good, benefits were better and Work-Life balance was a priority.  It was a company where multiple generations worked hard and earned a good living.  We were proud of saying, 'I work for Southern California Edison'.

If you're looking for a career with Edison, look for something in T&D.  I'd wait a few years for Customer Service.","Over my last years with Edison, we learned it was safer to duck, cover and hold than to speak up.  Suck it up and hope for Friday.  Well compensated Senior leaders(Talking Heads) made many long presentations that meant so little to front line realities.  Loads of great theories provided by the ever-present consultants.  JD Powers stats caused us to follow examples of SMUD and Salt River (who?). We lost major battles for generation and Transmission & Distribution.  The Public Utilities Commission pushed us around. Decisions to buy bloated, unusable systems were justified by their extreme cost, rather than their effectiveness.  Compliance won out over employees and customers. 

Sadly, managers (formerly advocates) were emasculated to the point where it was pointless to bring issues to them.  They would need to spin issues to their superiors because it was better to sugar coat than speak the truth.  The SLT doesn't want to deal with real problems.  About the only way concerns were heard was if a customer would cut through the layers and write to or speak directly to a Senior employee.  Then all hell would break lose back down to the field employees.

Every couple years, the current consultant would recommend another big employee survey to check the pulse of the workforce.  Multiple emails, meetings and brochures would end in a 6 month consultant project to decipher the results.  What could it mean? How did this happen.  Look how good we are... Then we'd have the report summary and meetings to determine the next major program to roll out to address the exposed issues.  Rate Challenge, Journey to Great, ChopX... 

Pay and benefits are still good if you're willing to check your head and heart at the door."

-The benefits, for now, are  above average relative to other industries, but about on-par for the utility sector.  Very few places offer $1 for $1 401K matching in addition to a Cash Balance account, for example.  Studies I've seen say about 1 in 10 still do and that's dropping with each passing year. Med benefits are still good, relatively speaking.
-Still some ""old timers"" around that  you can learn from.  I appreciate and encourage youthful exuberance, but it typically lacks perspective and/or focus and you only get that from experience.  You need both in order to be a successful professional.   
-Still plenty of good people to go with promising new hires; many of the inept mid-managers have left.","-It's inaccurate to characterize it as a ""Great time to join SCE"".  I'm not an ""old timer"" but even if you are a contrarian and are unafraid to go left when others go right, I just can't endorse that characterization.  Let things settle a bit; then it might be a great time to join.
-""Drastic Changes"" as described by one reviewer; yes, that's accurate.  More accurate in some departments than others, but SCE (and the electric utility industry) is significantly changing.
-""OpX"" is referred to as ""Chop X"" internally among staff because of all the staffing reductions.  How many?  Compare the EIX Annual Reports from 2011-2014; that tells you how many employees we've cut."
843,Southern California Edison,Utility changing to meet new demands,2015-09-15,4.0,Individual Contributor,A large company with a lot of resources for employees and many career opportunities based on your knowledge and goals.  The core business units of this company have exciting changes ahead for those who are on board.,The utility industry is changing and many ingrained ways of working and the SCE culture must change for the utility to survive and remain relevant.  The company is focusing on operational excellence but the term has become a euphemism for layoffs so morale is suffering.  The business model of the future is vague and not well articulated for the general employee population.
844,Southern California Edison,"Marketing - Good for your wallet, bad for your career",2015-09-14,2.0,Marketing Analyst,"If you are the type of employee who wants to punch the clock, do what you're told and leave at 5 -- with no ambition to advance your career or do work that you're proud of - SCE may be a good fit. The employees who do best are the ones who genuinely don't care what they're working on, they're just happy to have a well-paying job with benefits.

It helps if you have an external reason to stay - like your kids' tuition or the need to pick your kids up before 6 or a kitchen remodel you otherwise couldn't afford. SCE pays above market value (probably $20K-$30K more than the average marketing-manager job), and most members of the team work banker's hours (8 - 5, with a long, leisurely lunch in between).","If marketing is what you do for a living, and you take pride in doing it well, proceed with extreme caution. Here are 7 things they won't tell you during your job interview:

1. SCE is a monopoly; the only thing that the company markets is its own programs, offerings and rate increases. The marketing department is really a marcom department with no ownership, oversight or say-so in the company website, social media or any digital channels. Your ""big campaign"" might be a boring, legalese-filled letter to customers that their rates are going up.

2. You won't actually do any marketing. Your job is to be the go-between. Management will tell you what to do; you will tell the agency what to do; you will shuffle content from the agency to dozens of internal stakeholders; you will make sure the agency gets paid on time. You will literally become a ""project manager,"" instead of a marketer. True story: the Marketing team was in a training class and had to guess what an acronym stood for. A roomful of marketers got stumped on C for creativity. Because Creativity is the first skillset that gets rusty when you walk through Edison's doors.

3. You will probably be brought in as an analyst, a title that has an almost secretarial connotation at SCE. You will do the exact same work as longtime employees who have a ""marketing project manager 1"" or ""marketing project manager 2"" title, you'll just get paid less and have almost no chance of achieving parity with your peers.

4. 90% of the work of the entire 20-person marketing department is carried on the shoulders of about 5 mid-career women who are never promoted or recognized. Nearly all of the group's scant promotions have gone to young men under age 35 - most of whom left the company shortly after their promotions. It is a career dead end of the most depressing order, especially if you work hard and were born with ladyparts. (While everyone else goes home at 4:59, the 5 workhorses of the Edison apocalypse stay late and grind away at the same old letters, emails, flyers and brochures.)

5. Get out that ""I love the 90s"" t-shirt, because you are now stuck in a world where direct mail rules, CAN-SPAM is a strange new law, and the Internet is an afterthought. Through no fault of your own, you will no longer be able to do BASIC digital marketing or follow BASIC best practices. SCE's IT infrastructure is in shambles, and no one has the vision, the knowledge or the desire to improve it.

6. Marketing sits in the Customer Programs  and Service (CP&S) organization, which is part of the Customer Service organization. CP&S is about to go through a layoff/reorg, and has been in a perpetual state of turmoil for the last 3 years or more. The company had a disastrous reorg in 2013, where employees were demoted and shuffled around willy-nilly. In 2014, the head of CP&S was terminated for an ""ethics violation."" And the fun continues into 2015 and 2016, with a new management team that was clearly brought in to clean house.

7. CP&S in general and Marketing in particular are treated as executive internships. They don't hire people who are great at Marketing to lead Marketing; SCE has so little respect for the function that they use it as a training ground for executives on their way up. 

And that's before you talk about the brain-numbing bureaucracy, the insipid ""safety moments,"" the lackluster middle managers, and a culture of kissing butt and backstabbing your peers.

In short, if you are bright, creative, ambitious, hardworking and passionate about marketing, SCE will feel like a death sentence. If all you want is a paycheck, you may be genuinely happy here."

In 2013, Executives in charge of the centralization of a previously distributed finance department created a mess. They severed many strong performers, selected a management team based upon favored but unqualified ""yes"" people (a.k.a. Lapdogs). Management choices were disastrous and less than two years later half of them were terminated. Recently, in July 2015, the Company has had to downsize the Finance Department again, severing about half the employees (70+) only to post jobs to hire 20 replacements, claiming the new hires are necessary because the fired employees lacked necessary soft skills (e.g., ability to agree with management, ability to work as part of a team). Remaining Finance employees are working crazy hours, morale is terrible, and ""survivors"" are looking for opportunities to leave."
858,Southern California Edison,The Good and Bad... Very Bad,2015-08-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,My immediate team is amazing to work with; lots of opportunity to get exposure (possibly because the workload is so high that any “qualified” set of hands will do); competitive compensation.,"SCE is facing serious problems – here’s the basics:

-  The electric industry, as it has been traditionally practiced, is currently being threatened (e.g., due to emerging technologies such as solar generation, local storage, etc.), and it is clear that drastic changes must take place in order to remain competitive, or even remain in existence. Note that SCE charges well above the national average per kWh, and the rate is going to keep increasing over time (while other technologies become more accessible, stable, cheaper, and have less of a negative impact on the environment)
-  Further, SCE is an infrastructure-based business, where they have moved almost entirely out of the energy generation space, and create revenue by “renting their wires” – much of this antiquated infrastructure is at its “due date” and needs to be replaced.
-  Given the above, SCE is being pulled in multiple competing directions, and they are unclear on how to best move forward. This company will not be successful unless industry-changing ideas are created, implemented, and begin to yield positive results now.

That said, these issues make for an extremely turbulent work environment – here are a couple of examples that SCE is currently experiencing: 

-  Constant and on-going large-scale layoffs
-  Constant changes in leadership
-  Constant changes in organizational goals and direction
-  Constant changes to what an employee’s job responsibilities may entail
-  Less resources -including human capital- to accomplish tasks

Accordingly, the culture is absolutely horrible, where:

-  Many employees fear they may lose their job any day (and those jumping ship to work at other organizations is becoming more regular)
-  Employee frustration and negativity is at an all-time high, significantly impacting the atmosphere of the work environment in an adverse fashion (both in corporate and in the field); many employees feel they are not being properly supported by leadership   
-  The workload is increasing by the second (or lots of re-work and project elimination after significant investment) 

Needless to say, extreme stress does not even begin to express the impact this has created for me and my family. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for employment."

SCE is bringing in workers from India but the new employees are at a higher educational level and skill set but get less money.

I was told that some employment Attorneys are licking their chops to get involved in some of the breaches in the lay off procedures . It seems that some of the laid off employees are getting cheated out of some money that they are due !

Work load, pressures, and stresses were very low at least while I was employed there. In the three years I worked for Edison, I think I put in one day of overtime. I can't even recall why I stayed late that day. The company, at least outward facing, stresses work-life balance, and it's evident in the work load.","The overall professional culture at SCE is very dysfunctional. The hierarchical structure, and there are A LOT of layers, is overt and does form separations of rank and position. In my opinion from observation is that relationships amongst its employees (managers or otherwise) seem to matter more than capabilities. The organization is very fat and slow in not just the head count of employees but the business processes which govern the work, the layers of bureaucratic red tape, and glad handing that needs to occur. Managers often are more concerned with empire building than keeping agile and effective, often back filling positions whether the head count is needed or not. While employed with SCE, I often had stints of time where I had very little to do. My work was very focused and didn't allow for much outside of my responsibilities. The work was not very rewarding. And at least in my department, there wasn't much offered for professional growth. Because of the nature of how SCE is funded, via state funding, it fosters an environment not focused on efficiency. Often it is beneficial to spend more because it provides a platform for when the GRC (General Rate Case) is developed to request more and more money from the state."

These opportunities can provide the fortunate experienced engineer with opportunities to develop additional and valuable expertise easily marketable throughout the US. These departments and opportunities are hard to find, however. So, you definitely need the advice from insiders there to identify the areas of opportunity that fit your plans.

Plan your employment there realistically not expecting continual employment. Nobody can offer this guarantee anymore with such a dynamically changing  environment.Get exposure to a variety of areas. However, you must press for continual reassignments and avoid getting stuck in just one area.

The next few years will present a good case study for observing if an old non competition-based, government protected monopoly type company can survive the threats of new 21st century technology (e.g. solar). If SCE does survive the anticipated loss of market share to alternative fuels, it will be a pattern for other Utilities to follow.","Rapid change sufficient to reduce costs quickly enough to avoid significant market share loss is not likely. Solar is advancing far too quickly and projected to provide much lower costs. When I was there even at SCE, Management was publicly lamenting about the inevitability of this. I understand that rates (cost/kWHr) are still increasing and no significant kWHr savings have been announced. It is a tough situation and something remarkable needs to happen soon. Solar technology is currently accelerating in its development increasing the challenge for SCE to reduce costs further than expected.

A significant portion of SCE technical expertise had to retire in 2014 to avoid substantial, financial impacts to their legacy retirement plans. This needed expertise is virtually impossible to replace so quickly without restructuring services. This will be a monumental challenge. I have even been approached regarding how this gap might get filled. The Universities are simply not graduating enough engineers and those coming on the market are getting snatched by more dynamic companies not threaten my market share loss challenges. It is understandably difficult to attract new and needed talent given the projected near future (< 5 years) cost driven market. Once SCE restructures itself, the situation may change. But again, this will be a significant challenge.

SCE is presently too siloed and this needs to change. Managers must be held accountable to demonstrate how they have effectively used OpX approaches to achieve verifiable cost savings and eliminate silo-related inefficiencies.

There seems to be too many management levels and inconsistencies in practice. A more consolidated and dynamic management structure is needed and levels of management reduced. More direct goals need to be established, published directly from the CEO. He should also demand his program goals' progress be reported and demonstrated throughout the year, holding all management levels accountable."

1. Work life balance is good in general depending on which department you are with.
2. Company promotes safety not that they love employees but they want to keep work loss comp low or zero... It is all numbers magic. It is good in a way for employees though.
3. Not very stressful if you know the lay of the land.
4. Some smart, hard working, intelligent people still survive and work there 
5. Average benefits, nothing great.
6. Some great managers and great people value other opinions, tries to bring in innovativeness and build mutual respect.","1. Politics, connections are the key for your growth and sustenance.
2. Very hierarchical and you will have to bow to your managers and superiors all the time otherwise you may be at risk with growth or even getting cut.
3. Too many meetings and redundant processes, very primitive thinking and if you question or challenge management or colleagues your credibility and rapport is ruined, management doesn't care too much about innovative thinking and when team members challenge certain things.
4. Safety practice is a overkill and head was spinning when I saw the extent of safety is forced on to employees and management wastes time and resources on it, it felt very silly and trivial literally to talk about staple pins and paper cuts causing injuries. Seriously, management should think that if you have hired smart people who can think and not autistic or mentally challenged, people know how to be safe for their own well being.  Management was openly challenged on ""How much is too much"" but was ignored and brushed away.
5. Lot of good people but know how to navigate and say yes, yes, yes to managers and complain on the back but they are the survivors and get promoted too.
6. Flexible work is depends on the managers and if they think it is ok to do it or not otherwise it is a bad word around here.
7. It is funny that whenever re-org happens favoritism and connections are the key words and the managers pets get promotions and the smart people who speak up or challenge processes will get into trouble.
8. Long timers through their weight around as if they own company and pull random names out of the hat to get attention or get the things their way or get nothing done so to speak.
9. Used to be a good stable place to work but the management has  company and hired people just for their growth and visibility. 
10. Last but not the least, if you are vocal and speak up in meetings whether it makes sense or not, gets management's attention and you are deemed a leader or a value addition to the group, I don't understand in what sense."

I still keep in touch with many former colleagues who often complain about how bad it's gotten and how they really don't enjoy their jobs there anymore.  Many are actively looking elsewhere for another position but keeping the Edison job to pay the bills.

Majority of the group was extremely intelligent and approachable. I really learned alot! Overall leadership of the group was great and definitely headed in the right direction as far creating a productive and forward looking work environment. As far as other internship offers I received, compensation was slightly better than average.","After re-org in January, I was placed under a new manager that was socially inept (background was in accounting so I didn't expect much).

Edison provides excellent health insurance benefits, 401k and pension, paid sick time and generous paid vacation, all major holidays off with pay, including the Friday after Thanksgiving! How many companies do that?!  I loved the 4-10 schedule, the all-inclusive environment, the ongoing training and self-improvement opportunities, and many other perks too numerous to mention.  I would still be there if they hadn't closed San Onofre.  Even when I lost my job they were generous and gave me a severance package and extended health insurance coverage.  I can say with all honesty that it was the best job I have ever had!!","Some of upper management liked to micromanage, and they took safety to the extreme.  For example, a couple of employees tripped and fell while talking on their cell phones, so the entire plant population was forbidden from walking while using their cell phones!  Also, minor injuries were blown completely out of proportion; i.e., several employees were stung by bees and were basically told that they could have somehow prevented it.  Not!"

Business Units are looking to restructure operations and are pursuing outsourcing strategies displacing long and dedicated US workforce with off-shore opportunities to cut costs.

Highly regulated NRC atmosphere creates unnecessary stress, don't you dare make any tiny mistake. Training was thorough and contained lots of very useful information but could be implemented better and be more focused on daily operations. Testing was used as a means of threatening job status if can't maintain 80% average. Management became more and more military like and didn't listen to lower peons. Union atmosphere was ridiculous, it's much better to work with the company more like adults and not squabble over ridiculous details. After 6 yrs working in a union I officially hate unions and think they are the cause of many problems in companies, though with a union you will get very good pay and benefits that may not even make any sense and can bring a company down into ruin."

Their contact center is also the dumping ground for managers that would have been bounced if SCE was run like a real business, Crap in Crap out.

Other than how I was treated after the hire of new management that blatantly favored ""their own"" employees, SCE allowed me to make unprecedented breakthroughs in my line of work that are widely recognized by cybersecurity professionals, worldwide and for which opportunities I shall be eternally grateful. Unfortunately, executive management is so detached from any perception of key IT practices that they have little notion of proper IT management methods and no one in a subordinate position are incentivized to point out problems. The recent (since the deadly  2012 shootings at the IT facility) Executive Open Forums and similar initiatives may create a communications bridge between staff and management that should eventually reap positive results, particularly for IT.","Extraordinarily prone to cliquish management styles leading to crass favoritism and subsequent punishment of the unfavored. E.g., Several ""Chairmen's Award"" recipients violate company stated values of behavior completely beyond the view of executive management. Current practices do not acknowledge to possibility of, let alone detect nor deter, sociopathic personalities.

Executive management perceives IT specialists as interchangeable with other non-IT roles. E.g., the stated policy for advancement has employees transferring to unrelated departments (i.e., utility industry 100 year traditional pre-IT ""cross training"" model) while IT specialists' career paths would not have them transferring even within IT.

Executive management perceives IT specialists as commodities and have no awareness of any extraordinary employee accomplishments unless the employee is ""favored"" by middle management which typically doesn't happen, as lower management levels fear being outshined by subordinates."

The morale is low and the tone of the office is indifference. There are too many project initiatives thus goals are rarely aligned and work is redundant across the company.

Very professional environment.","Entirety of business is under the thumb of various regulatory bodies, leading to a disjointed regulatory regime that company has to operate within.  This makes it very difficult for the company to execute general business.  Seemingly every interested party in regulatory proceedings take antagonistic view of company, including regulators, consequently most work is reactive rather than proactive.  Currently, senior management is under taking a significant internal push to lower electric rates by reducing overall company expenses which will, in the medium term, result in lower total compensation and harder work environment.  In addition, there is a too strong of a push to hire from certain demographics for management positions."
