The training for Southwest was an amazing experience in Dallas. I was there for 10 days and had a fantastic time.","It does have mandatory overtime if someone calls in sick or during busy peak seasons. Also, getting through the probationary time is difficult as you only have 3 points that can go on your record during your first 6 months.

The disconnect is very apparent from Corp HDQ to what's actually happening in cities.

Constant and Consistent staffing shortages lasted well over 5 years with empty promises and forced OT to cover their errors.

Two different airlines depending on which role you are hired into... If you're customer-facing they take excellent care of you with parties, food, and fun activities. If you work with baggage handling you're treated like less than dirt. You get none of what the customer-facing people get. You might get water on a hot day but will be written up for drinking it."

63,Southwest Airlines,Great Company!,2022-03-02,5.0,Assistant Manager of In Flight Crew Scheduling,Others will say the culture has changed and it has but it's not bad. The company does care about it's people and they do their best to take care of them as much as they can and still take care of the company in order to be profitable. I think people sometimes think the company should take care of it's employees first and foremost which is true most of the time but there are times where the company has to look out for the company in order to have longevity in order to continue to have employees. The world has changed through the years and we've had to adjust and so does the company. The company adapts to what's happening while some employees want it to stay the same.,Some of the employees can be a con. A lot can be negative but you have to stay above it all. I don't see many minorities in positions of leadership there but I know the company has made a commitment to help that.

If you would like to work more hours that is always available to you at the current time.","Less flexibility because they do not have the necessary staffing to manage the operation so a lot of mandatory overtime is being given out, which pays double time but gets exhausting. This leads to employees calling out sick and then management accusing you of not actually being sick but ""too soft."" Working with a lot of lazy coworkers who are looking to do as little work as possible and complain when asked to do the normal level of work. Management does not care about anything at this point so performance of all employees is terrible and morale is as low as ever.

223,Southwest Airlines,An amazing company - but whats most important to you?,2021-12-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I spent several years at SWA - before covid and during. The things you hear are 100% true. I don't feel the need to cover the positives extensively as that has been done everywhere. If you have the luck of interviewing or taking a job at SWA you will not regret it - it's an absolutely amazing company with incredible People, culture, and opportunity. BUT - be aware whats most important to you out of a job & company, and recognize that may change over time, as there are some drawbacks and no place is perfect.

1. Amazing People and culture 
2. Benefits are incredible - flight perks, 401k, profit sharing, etc. 
3. You will feel apart of the mission, and what a wonderful mission.
4. Stability - no layoffs even through covid.","1. The People and culture - while listed above, this can also create a very challenging environment. My department was a bit ""cliquish""and the Director tended to also have his favorites who were awarded projects and the recognition. Personal Ideas, improvements, and projects are encouraged, but only if it fits into the strategy box set by Leadership. If you tend to challenge the status quo you might find yourself a bit annoyed here and constantly having to ""disagree & commit"". Positivity, agreeance, and personal projects over innovation, high performance, and utility/cohesiveness. Also, poor performance tends to slip under the cracks and is never truly addressed.

2. Compensation - I have heard there have been improvements here, but SWA still falls on the lower end for many roles. They emphasize the benefits (which are great) but in a world where cash in hand is increasingly more important - their salaries miss the mark. This is also accentuated by the internal compensation philosophy and poor job architecture - which doesn't reward monetarily but by opportunity. ""We are going to promote you into a Manager role because you are doing amazing, but you don't have Manager experience so we are only going to adjust your salary by 5% and put you at the absolute bottom of an already low range which you will constantly be trying to recover from"". At the end of the day, it is a low-cost carrier and pay increases once you are in, are just not great. I received a 50% pay increase when I left and got a bigger raise in the first year than I got the entire time I worked at SWA..... 

3. Work-life balance - Feeling apart of a mission can be great. It can also throw WLB out of the window, and cause you to become emotionally involved when things are going great. SWA has a way of making work being heavily integrated into your life (which again is one of the pros - its alot of fun with great people who become friends/family) but it also can really stretch WLB. ""if this doesn't get done, I'm letting my customers (friends/family) down"". While Im sure it varies by department, my work/life balance disappeared for a while and I was working 10-12 hour days just to keep up with an unreasonable workload as I didn't want to let my customers down. Referring back to number 2. there was a real lack of awareness (potentially care) of the ridiculous workloads our Team was trying to manage.

4. Change - I almost didn't put this, as im sure People will discount me as the person who just hates change. Change is necessary, hard, and fantastic. I love progression and finding new ways of working and efficiencies. BUT - The strategy for my department was constantly changing to a point where it became difficult to get any thing done. My director had the tendency to chase the next shiny tool and buzz word, which left our Teams scrambling to make things work. Change for the sake of change, in too large of chunks, without a cohesive vision/strategy, and without the understanding of day to day tactical work is futile."
224,Southwest Airlines,Terrible Management and Fake Culture,2021-12-20,1.0,Financial Analyst,Free Flight Benefits for employees,"- The same corporate BS wrapped in a “happy culture” wrapping. Once you’re in, they treat you like a number.
- Very low pay compared to similiar positions with other airlines
- Terrible Mid level management (mine was a drunk who passed out at a holiday party and gave herself a black eye from her toilet)
- New “diversity” driven culture for hiring and promotions (non-white)
- I was asked several times to fudge numbers by management to make things “look right”
- “Good ole boy” system with many older employees hanging up on low level analyst."

226,Southwest Airlines,Good thing Gary is on his way out,2021-12-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Improving pay, WFH for technology employees, mostly low stress work environment.","'Masks don't do much, if anything' - Really? Let's get some pro-science leadership. Texas may be conservative, but the majority of America is not. Customers want to feel safe and flights - all this company nonsense about how our FAs can't show good hospitality with a mask on is bogus. FAs are for safety - first and foremost. As an airline, wee can't pick and choose what safety measures we do or don't enforce. Same goes for religious exemptions on the vaccine mandate, I do not have any faith that management will be strict in vetting those."

- Workgroups collaborate well; less interdepartmental politics than some places 
- Generally a fun and relaxed atmosphere","- Like most corporations, management is woke and place too much emphasis on DEI and kowtowing to the ESG gods; not very tolerant of those who have a divergent opinion; Sr. Leadership policies are often guided by ESG concerns over business outcomes
- SWA has a reputation for an employee-friendly culture, and they try hard to foster it, but sometimes they try too hard and it comes off as rote, contrived and inauthentic rather than an organic culture

369,Southwest Airlines,Not what you think it is.,2021-10-05,2.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),"Able to trade shifts with coworkers.
Flight benefits.
Work from home since Covid.
Unlimited working hours.","You can only be sick 5 times a year. 
Coworkers charge you big money to “swap” shifts with them in order to save pto time. There’s only overtime when the company assigns it otherwise you can work 1,000 hours and it’s all at your base rate. You fly for free but that’s if you can make the flight. Your up against paying passengers so peak season, weekends, holidays, very hard to get a seat. Your calls are monitored and they pick apart everything you say or don’t say. Customers are rude, demanding, call you everything under the sun. But be nice or you’ll loose your job. Software you work in is ancient and they put money into everything else other than what would make your job easier. You repeat the same exact thing day in and day out. If you aren’t able to pay someone your entire check and give up your second child most coworkers won’t help you out by working for you. You can then only use sick time 5 times a year. If you hit 7 times your in a hearing fighting for your job. Oh you pay union dues but they don’t help you do a thing. If you notice most of the great reviews on here are people who don’t work over the phone. They also live in a fantasy world where it’s all rainbows and butterflies. Who your supervisor is determines if your job is ten times harder than the passengers make it. The only room for “growth” is if your willing to move from a call center to the airport or relocate to Dallas where all the good paying positions are that do little to no work. Health coverage is cheap but that’s because you’ll have moderate out of pocket costs especially if you need vision. If it’s too busy which is mostly everyday they can mandate you to stay late or start early usually two hours on top of your schedule. So that can mean 8-12 hr days. Your only paid extra if they force you to work. Calls are back to back to back. Not even time to take a sip of water in between. And if you block a call from coming in your in trouble. Your a robot. Everyone from the airport tells passengers to call customer service and we can’t help if they can’t help. Morale is horrible since COVID. Severely understaffed. I could go on forever but hopefully you get the point."

Co-works are eager to help especially new employees.",Mandatory overtime is no fun. However sometimes you are able to get off early when you have MOT depending on seniority.
392,Southwest Airlines,"Great benefits, but mandatory overtime",2021-09-27,3.0,Ramp Agent,"-401k matches dollar for dollar at up to 9% of paycheck
-double pay for mandatory overtime
-low-costing health benefits with good coverage
-anual profit shares usually at least a few thousand dollars
-learn multiple functions, so not always doing the same thing
-MSP is a small station, so there's plenty of downtime to rest in between flights 
-well organized work system and helpful co-workers","-Mandatory overtime is the main drawback. It's assigned by seniority, so when you're new it will suck for a while. Depending on the busyness of the season or call-offs or flight delays, you may have to come in early, stay late, get forced to work your first day off and even have to work an additional shift in between your regular shifts (the last one is only if things are really bad). It will happen during winter and spring break, but it typically gets better after the first year, so I've heard (but MSP hasn't been hiring since Covid hit, so it's going to be a lot longer for me). The double pay is nice, but it's impossible to plan anything outside of work when you don't know for sure if you're going to have time off throughout the week. Again, it's only really bad during those busy seasons and it does get better (at least at MSP), but it can be incredibly frustrating. You either need to get shifts covered or trade shifts or call in sick and finesse the system when they're screwing you over too much.
-Senior agents who have it made constantly complain about stupid stuff while you're getting screwed over."

There is a really great feeling of family, no lay offs during COVID, and no paycuts which was amazing. People were still payed their bonuses during COVID and employees were first during this time of strife. Gary Kelly is honestly a wonderful CEO and man. He is an amazing example of what a leader is and how they should support their people during one of the worst periods of this company's history.

In addition, we have some pretty awesome flight benefits, a 9.3% 401k match, great health benefits, and a company where are literally retirement parties every other month. People who join this company stay at this company.","Operations is treated very differently from the departments who drive revenue. I would join Ops at your own risk (specifically Ground Ops and Tech Ops). Depending on the department you join, work life balance may not actually exist. I was in Ops strategy and was working close to 12 to 15 hour days extensively for weeks. In Ops, you have directors who are trying to make a name for themselves. Directors who essentially take the credit for the work of their team and present the work as their own and keep their reports in the closet. In Ops there is no exposure or growth for your career. If you are a hard worker, they will recognize this and manipulate you with compliments so that you don't ask for promotions. They may even give you reasons such as ""This is a very high performing team, even more high performing than other teams across the company so at this time we cannot promote you."" If you want to get promoted in Ops, you must be Caucasian and fit their idea of what a person of leadership should look like. There are minimal people of color in manager/director/Senior Management roles. 

If you want to go and become something at Southwest, your best bet is to work on the Revenue/Commercial side of the business. The Ops side is toxic and people will step on you to get ahead. People do not have a work life balance, you will not get to showcase your work, and even if you do, you will be set up for failure. DO NOT JOIN OPS."

- Insurance coverage is great - low cost to employee and covers most things
- Fun place to work","- Promotions are based on favoritism, not performance. The same people get recognized, while others who are performing at higher levels are overlooked
- Promotions are also based on arbitrary years of experience - employees who have been there for years but perform poorly are rewarded with promotions, while high performers with fewer years are not promoted
- If being compensated for performance is important to you, SWA is not the company for you. 
- Pay is under market, which makes it difficult to live near work in Dallas
- We are constantly told how ""lucky"" we are to work here. However, other companies offer much better benefits (albeit, without the flight benefits). It often feels like the culture is manufactured as a way to ignore issues. For example, when employees brought up pay issues, we were told that because we have profitsharing and 401k match we have lower pay
- No tuition reimbursement
- There is a culture of ignoring issues and being afraid of negative feedback, which leaves issues unaddressed and allows low performers to continue to grow despite being unproductive"

Yes! they can extend your shift if you’re part-time. Management have their cliques and are very messy. There’s no confidentiality regardless of how big or small your issue may be. So, be prepared for everyone to know your business good or bad. Due to the micromanaged environment you will be questioned about any and everything. This may not be the case in all locations as I’m sure the culture may vary from center to center. I don’t feel it’s uniform or consistent across the company.

Last manager they hired two years ago came from repair station with a chip on his shoulder and an ax to grind with the mechanics. Not good. Forget about all the glowing reviews you read about this company. Most of them coerced, that is to say, non-contract employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement are forced to write and post positive reviews. Southwest is all smoke and mirrors. All the fun and sunshine and rainbows and daffodils you hear about at Southwest is nothing but PR department propaganda. It's all LIES."

696,Southwest Airlines,Psychological Nightmare,2021-04-20,1.0,In Flight Crew Scheduler,Free flying. Work is not difficult.,"No one outside of the department really understands the job, so people who can help improve the department don’t really know what to look for.

It feels like a little nightmarish sometimes. Like those movies where people are forced to believe something that isn’t true if they want to stay in a good place. The work environment can be toxic at times. Management does things like have a town hall meeting, but they alter the questions that are submitted and don’t allow the employees to speak or ask follow-up questions. New requirements have been added like making up hours and taking away holiday pay. We’re expected to show up to work 15 to 30 minutes early, but that time is not counted toward our hours. 

We were told we had to make up hours but weren’t made aware of exactly how many until a quarter into the calendar year. So, we’ll have to make up those hours during months when most holidays occur.

There are a lot of rules that are made up, and we have to go along with it. Rules affecting trading abilities, requesting time off, and attendance.

I feel like I left my job and expected to receive everything that Southwest promises. This particular department offers the opposite. Once you get in, you can’t just leave or you can’t support your family.

I feel like the nepotism mentioned in other reviews is true.

Yes, it is diverse. Management knows the exact percentage of people in the department who fall under a protected category. But it feels like once you’re in here, it isn’t so inclusive for all groups.

When new people visit, people are advised to act differently. I feel like that is what gets people in. But once you’re here, the environment changes.

Given a 1 because you get lots of money, but my conscience doesn’t feel so great some days."

Job security. Great 401k and flight benefits. CEO is fantastic!,"Horrible micromanagement. Lack of forward thinking and does not promote thought leadership. Innovation is stifling. Mostly legacy systems with no real push for anything beyond mediocrity. Senior Leaders and Middle Management have extremely poor execution. The old famous culture that Herb built,  is quickly becoming diluted by new outside Leadership that does not for core values. The organization is run by a “ghost” CIO, whom takes very good care of her friends. 

I’ve personally witnessed many unethical and toxic traits by Leadership. They do not value ideas or new technology, they’re extremely behind in the times and have zero willingness to adapt. The company is ran by an “old school buddy system” and lacks a real vision. None of the Leadership have any technical expertise or acumen and have zero emphasis on uplifting skills or helping employees grow. They pride themselves on accountability and “servant leadership”, but actions prove otherwise. Work is not stimulating and it’s the most passive aggressive enviornment I have seen in my career. If you want to explore SWA, I believe there are great Leaders and People in operations, crew, and other business support area - but technology is an absolute mess."

You either have to have a second job or a wealthy spouse &/or retirement fund in order to make ends meet financially. Must join union after hiring on (but very little union representation until you have completed 7 mo probation; and even then it feels like an ongoing struggle between management and union). If you need time off or are sick and you don't have vacation/sick time to draw from (and you won't for approx first six months) it's on you to trade, give away or pay a coworker to take your shift. If you refuse mandatory overtime, you receive ""points and occurrences"" which can potentially affect your ability for future promotions.

It felt like I was in an abusive relationship, now that I look back on it. It was friendly and smiling, popular, charming.  My hiring manager told me all the things that they were excited to have me bring to the table. 

I got evaluations from my management with this feedback: ""Don't ask questions"" ""Don't talk so directly."" After pointing out a flawed logic saying, ""my argument is"" I was angrily interrupted by ""it's not an argument.""

I've seen two women in upper management suddenly retire from working to raise their kids when they were in the middle  of their careers. 

There are managers that have been filling a desk for a decade or more. 

I have a lot of stories that seem unbelievable compared to their image. They spend years making decisions because no one wants to take responsibility if something doesn't work.  People don't grow in skills and if you do, they aren't paying for it. They don't pay market rate if you aren't in a union. Flying free is stressful for even one person and much more so trying to take anyone with you. 

The casual dress code is a way to distinguish those who have any power and those that don't.  

The jobs you had before are ""prior life"" and not your professional experience. 

Just know that this is not where you get professional success. 

It feels like daycare in different ways. One week you're complaining about the sick kids in conference rooms and the next you're having to ask your boss, repeatedly, to not startle you on purpose. 

My favorite story, my boss is telling me about his last meeting; ""she just comes in with all this high energy and big words. I mean, she bloviates all over the place""... as he said, bloviating all over the place,  ""she reminds me a lot like you. """

1224,Southwest Airlines,Are you a vampire?,2020-01-07,1.0,Customer Service Agent,"I came to Southwest with so much excitement and so much respect. Finally, a company I could work for that had a reputation for treating it's employees great. When I went in for my interview I let them know my greatest asset was my positive attitude and that I would work very hard for them if hired. Everything leading up to training in Dallas was perfect. They flew us to a People department and overwhelmed us with love, letting us know how fortunate we were to work for such a great company while explaining our benefits. Amidst the glow, individual contracts were set out in front of us, with the base pay and the union who had negotiated it. I couldn't have felt more proud of myself for landing this job. I then returned to the station where I trained for about a month with someone, after which I went to the training headquarters in Dallas for three weeks of paid training. All the moments I spent there were wonderful. There was free coffee everywhere, and they put us up in a nice hotel and gave us food cards. It was heaven, and again I felt lucky and so proud to work for Southwest Airlines. I cannot express how great the Corporate culture is. The benefits you receive, as well as the welcome you get, are the main and only highlights of this job. However, once you return from Dallas, the reality sets in: something is not as it seems. This really is too good to be true.","A week after I returned from Dallas, I had completed my training and finally began a probationary period of 6 months. During this time you begin your union contract and bid for a shift. Per the contract: Southwest employees cannot decline mandatory overtime, call in sick, or come to work late. If you do, you receive an occurrence. Three occurrences and you are terminated. During this time it became perfectly clear that I was an employee number. Nothing more. 60 hour weeks were commonplace.
Imagine: Your shift is Wednesday through Sunday 3pm - 11:30pm. On Wednesday you work your regular shift, but clock out late due to delays: 3pm - 1:30am (10 hours). However, you are assigned mandatory overtime (remember you cannot decline this without being fired) for 2 hours after you get off at 3:45am - 11:45am. You then work from 3pm - 11:30pm the same day. Imagine that this happens 2 times a week, every week. That is the reality of Southwest Airlines. Throughout my probationary period this was VERY common, and again happened at least 2 times a week. The most I had to work was 81 hours in one week, four 16 hour shifts back to back, and then a regular 8 hour shift on one of my days off. It's not the type of work that is the problem, it is the amount of work.
Upon asking union leaders and management, their responses were, and I quote VERBATIM: If you don't like it, maybe this job isn't for you. Once completing your probationary period, which is rare as people literally fall asleep on the job and are fired, or break down from the mental stress of staying awake for 2 days straight, you can decline the overtime. Even then, 16 hour days are a common occurrence, as is mandatory overtime. The IAM union contract states that for every refusal of mandatory overtime, you accrue half a point (.5). If you accrue 9 points, you are subject to termination. In the single month after my probation I accrued 5 points by simply declining overtime. Per the contract, it takes 3 months for just 2 points to drop from your record, during which time you cannot be late, call in sick without a doctors note, or decline ANY overtime. As it stands, my weeks are never less than 50 hours. NEVER.
This amount of work results in huge employee burnout. I recently spoke with someone at Headquarters in Dallas who said, ""Right now we have a high turnover rate for customer service and we are trying to figure out why.""

I cannot in good conscious recommend this job to anyone that values their sanity."

Either hold it until your break or take a ding on your ""schedule adherence"" metric . Every missed minute counts against you. You are expected to routinely troubleshoot our badly-coded reservations system while maintaining a good average call time. Calls are nonstop. You don't have an answer button, the calls just come right in one after another. I know my coworkers faces but not their names. I would transfer to a different department but I've called out sick more than 3 times due to overwhelming anxiety and depression this job gives me.  They wonder why they have an attendance problem. We use a hodge podge of outdated and ineffective programs, making this job infinitely harder than it should be.

Lots of room to move into supervisor positions. However, if you are at a smaller station, there's less opportunity.","If you're starting new, you'll be at the bottom of the seniority list. This seniority list determines nearly everything about your work schedule. If you're new, don't expect to get weekends off or preferable start times with your work.

Also you will be the first to get mandatory overtime. It can be difficult to schedule things sometimes. 

The pay starts off very low with union rules. Depending on what city you live, it may be difficult to live on as a full time job. Lots of people pick up shifts and overtime in order to make a little extra. Pay will grow with time."

If you have a bad attitude or don't want to provide excellent customer service, this is the wrong company for you.  I've worked at 2 other airlines and Southwest is exceptional in treating customers and employees as a high priority.  Southwest is not a perfect company but they try.  If you have perfect attendance all year, you will receive a $1000.  If you have perfect attendance from July to July you receive 2 extra paid holidays.  The supervisors and managers thank you for coming in and being at work, there's hugging involved, they show appreciation.  You are empowered to help passengers versus other airlines you get in trouble for helping passengers.  Flight benefits enable me to fly every month which I ordinarily would not be doing.  There's alot of schedule trading with fellow employees, which enables me to have 3 days off every week.

Great flight and health benefits, matching 401k, and opportunities to work up.","This is a long review, but I hope you take the time to read it. I began my interest in the airline industry as young as 8 years old. I'm actually an aspiring airline pilot in flight school. I guess you could consider me a Southwest ""Super-Fan."" I truly love the company, and what it was founded upon. In my high school marketing classes, I did many projects on the SWA model, and Herb Kelleher. When I became of age, I actually began my airline career at the other Dallas based airline as a ramp agent. The life there wasn't always glamorous, but I learned a lot, had fun, and earned the respect of management.  Loved the atmosphere, but my heart and passion was always at Southwest. It's where I wanted to start, but they weren't hiring in Nashville for the longest time. After 8 months at my other airline, Southwest finally had a Ramp Agent position opening in BNA. I gladly applied, and was a full time employee within a month. The training process was lengthy, but helpful. I caught on quickly as I had prior ramp experience. All new hires are flown to Dallas, TX for a week of classroom training. I had my own hotel room, prepaid card for food, and was welcomed to an inviting culture. My new hire class consisted of 5 ramp agents. We spent a week there, and came back to Nashville for a few weeks to wrap up OJT. I picked up my bid on the ramp, and was finally on my way. Life on the ramp isn't always ideal. You can face terrible weather, extended hours due to delayed flights, short staffing, physical and demanding work, it all may have a personality change on you. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of great days as well. You may only work 3-4 flights in a full time shift. You'll have a great, helpful crew on your gate, on-time flights, sunny at 80 degrees weather, and even a few smiles from your managers. Unfortunately, I didn't have too many great days at Southwest.  99% of new hire ramp agents in Nashville are assigned to a night/closing shift. To many, it's probably the worst shift to have. I personally believe they purposely give this shift to new hires to see if they have what it takes. A typical closing shift is 5pm-1:30AM with Tuesday and Wednesday off. Of course when you gain more seniority, you'll be able to pick a more ideal shift, with hours and days off that suit you best. The night shift in Nashville was terrible. I wish I could have started off on mornings. There is a huge difference between the morning and night shift in BNA. Mornings have the likable managers, better co-workers, and the ability to the enjoy the rest of your day when you clock out. Everyone has their preferences, but I personally would have liked to clock out at noon, and spend my time with friends and family in the evenings. Night shift in Nashville wasn't ideal. Management was never in a good mood, and always was looking to nail someone for some type of violation. Managers love being petty. There were plenty of great workers written up for very questionable reasons. This is where the union dues are worth it. Sadly, when you're on the 6 month probation, you are not protected by the union. No matter if you work days or nights, be on your best behavior, show up on time, and don't question anything at Southwest. Trust no one. It's every man for himself. Coming from another airline with ramp experience, I can personally say a lot of the ramp procedures at Southwest are ridiculous. Tail Stands? Bin Shields? It's 2019, and they're still using a ton of paper. They may seem like little things, but it's just another thing that I found unnecessary that could cause damage or injury.  They just added strain to the job. If you are committed to nothing but working, and don't wanna see your family, Southwest is a fantastic place to work. I am not being sarcastic. The overtime is double pay, and allowed me to bring home some nice paychecks. I was always willing to help a co-worker if they needed a shift covered. However, I did miss a lot of personal events, and was bothered by that. It happens often in the airline industry. The mandatory over-time can be crazy, as you could work 19 hours, and then be expected to be back at the airport within 5 hours. I knew many guys who set up mattresses in their cars, or in the break room. The Mandatory over time will screw you a good amount of times. Like I said, it's great money, but you no longer have a personal life. Your kid could be in the hospital dying, but they don't care. You better show up to work. The probation period is rough on the ramp. Management is watching you like a hawk, and I hope you have a strong immune system as well. You honestly don't have room to be sick during this period. They'll hire someone who doesn't get sick. You have 3 strikes in probation. Just be careful, show up early, remain healthy, don't complain, and you'll do just fine. Have the flu? That's too bad. May seem much and unrealistic to some people, but welcome to Southwest. The culture aspect is what Southwest advertises on. That culture is no longer there. Southwest is trying to be like every other airline. They've been successful for nearly 50 years; because they were different. There is no family bond, most employees complain constantly if anything. I had more fun at my other airline honestly. Southwest used to have a game room in Nashville, but they got rid of that course. Rampers used to play basketball during down time, but that was taken away as well. Nashville's station manager was never seen. I don't think he knows more than 20 names. BNA is a top 10 station for Southwest, and it seems poorly ran to me. Working for Southwest was not some life changing experience like they make it seem to be. Managers and the not ideal shifts made me leave Southwest. You could say me not liking the shifts given to someone with little seniority is on me, but I never planned to make a career out of the ramp. At my other airline, they were quite flexible with picking a shift, and when you needed a day off, it wasn't a huge deal. Call out at Southwest, and it seems like you're on the hit list from management. Ramp managers in BNA, more specifically during nights, were lacking leadership skills. Never felt appreciated, and you were almost afraid to talk to them because they'd either extend you, or have you do some ridiculous task. I touched on it earlier, but the management is seriously out to get you. Especially on probation. Don't annoy them, and do as you are told. Some senior guys have lost their jobs because they got under the skin of a supervisor. They don't mind terminating someone with seniority so they can bring some new guy in, and pay him less. It is not a laid back atmosphere at Southwest. From unions, to uptight management, it can get pretty interesting. I'm curious how things are at smaller stations, but the experience in Nashville was not what Southwest was originally about. Southwest is slowly but surely becoming like every other airline, and viewing employees as just numbers, and not great people who have made their company successful. If you are wanting to make a career out of the ramp, Southwest is a good place to be. Put your time in, suffer through the terrible shifts early on, earn respect from managers, don't complain, and you'll make a good life for yourself. The benefits are good, and you can't go wrong with the top out pay. After 10 years, you can make nearly 40 dollars and hour as a ramp agent. Not bad for just slinging some bags around. Take that, and the double pay over-time, you can retire by 40. If I didn't want to be a pilot, I would have put my time in at Southwest and worked my way up. It's just the crazy schedule at SWA didn't even allow me to build hours as a student pilot. Take the fact that the shifts Southwest had took me away from my social life was not ideal either. If I had put my time in, gained seniority that would allow me better shifts, things like social life wouldn't have been as big of an issue. There are guys who have been there 10 years with weekends off, top out pay, regular 9-5 hours, living well at Southwest. It was just a rocky road to get to that point for those folks. That's why I have emphasized, if you put your time in, it's a great job. It beats many other professions if you ask me. Southwest is experiencing a culture change, and growing pains. I found it annoying how Southwest tried to hide it's flaws with all these false narratives like its a fun place to work, when the atmosphere is like everyone's else. It's all nonsense. Don't drink the Kool-Aid! Southwest isn't all that. Despite some of the issues I had here, I wish I could have stuck around. I know times change, but I truly have a passion for the company. I was just disappointed how things really were at this company. There are good people at Southwest. It's just I wasn't committed to working terrible hours, dealing with up-tight management and policies that I found a bit extreme. I recently returned to my previous airline which suits my situation the best. I have my beloved morning shift right out hire, weekends off, and a much more laid back atmosphere. I'm glad to be back. I took a pay, and benefit cut, but it was worth it for this aspiring airline pilot. I'll be off the ramp soon enough."

1367,Southwest Airlines,"Great Company, Poor Ground Operation",2019-06-14,3.0,Ramp Agent,"Medical Benefits, 401k, and the vast resources Southwest gives to help it's people grow their careers in the company.","Among the large airlines, Southwest runs the most unsafe and technologically insufficient Ground Operation in the industry. Ramp Agents can be forced, through company mandated overtime or voluntary, to work well over a 16 hour double, into working more than 24 hours continuously. I've heard about people working more than that. This is worsened by the fact that the standard number of flights an agent works in one shift is between 6 to 8. Well above the workloads of other airlines, and the OJI's prove it. The culture displayed at Headquarters does not extend to their Ground Operation, in most cases. 

The safety of the worker is clearly not a priority. While the higher workload reduces costs for the company and increases profit sharing, FAA and Ground Ops Manual procedures are consistently violated at all levels.

It's so bad now that Junior leadership (Supervisors), have to be hired off of the street with no prior experience. This even includes their Emerging Leadership Program.

Southwest is the only Airline which makes its employees pay for parking."

-Short hours are awesome. You can usually get your work done in an hour and management doesn't notice or care if you work 6 hour days. 
-It's very easy to stand out if you know your stuff","-Red tape is very annoying. They have arbitrary experience requirements for promotions which leads to less deserving/lower performing people being promoted over those with less experience.
-The only negative of free flights is that SWA lacks some of the desired international destinations that other carriers have and flying out of Love Field can be tricky because it's not a true ""hub"" like other airlines have
-Very low base pay compared to other industries. Like, comically low. 
-No negative feedback is ever provided so everyone thinks they're doing great when they're not. No room to grow when everything is sunshine and rainbows all the time.

Asked if they prefer quality over quantity and after I asked that question in a meeting I was labeled as an employee with a bad attitude.  Basically worked with a lot of uneducated catty women.

I think Southwest is probably as great as they say, provided that you join any organization other than Technology.","I want to be respectful in stating the cons, but I also need to be honest. The fact is I've never been this frustrated at a job before. The worst offenders, in my view:

- Poor infrastructure, sometimes down/unreliable or giving unpredictable results. 

- Rule by fear mgmt culture that attempts to increase productivity from technical teams by pushing people harder instead of, you know, fixing problems and addressing resource allocation issues. 

- Heavily silo'd access, meaning you will be heavily dependent upon other teams to help you do everything from A to Z. 

- Attempting to run ""agile"" software delivery on top of support tasks with days-long fulfillment periods. 

- Heavy reliance on cheaper/commoditized labor that, in my experience, only completes requests correctly maybe 70% of the time. 

- Heavy process, generally speaking, but relatively poor documentation to accompany it, requiring everyone including tech staff to spend tons of time in meetings."

Travel benefits and company events and entertainment are about the only pro's with working in this specific department. But you don't have even close to the level of flexibility in requesting time off as other departments do. So you barely enjoy travel perks.","Specifically to the SOS department, they force you to adhere to overly restrictive work policies that don't exist in other departments. Management is clickish and show bias to their favorites. When you try to apply for new positions in other departments to get out of the wreck hole, management blocks it in their review if your not one of their favorites. They enforce policies different with different people. Most of the company has some flexibility in the work, able to go to the restroom when they need, or get water or food, or even take time off. Not SOS. You have 30 min schedule breaks. You can't go to the restroom when you need or you could get penalized. Your only allowed one 30 min lunch break and two 15 min breaks your entire 8 hour shift. So if you need to go to restroom or get water outside of that, you get penalized. You can never volunteer for company events or committees because this department doesn't allow you the flexibility in your schedule to participate during work hours.

1442,Southwest Airlines,You can really feel the Luv!,2019-02-10,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"Everyone is so sweet and loving. Everyone lives by the golden rule. The pace is slower and leaders take your work life balance into account. The company is legendary and we have such an amazing history and culture. We do some really cool stuff and we are true to who we are. Even our CEO says the employees are #1. It's a feedback and continuous improvement culture. There are always some fun things going on. So free flights, fun environment, cool people, those are the big things.","Base pay is a little low since they have a 9.3% 401k match and a profit sharing that averages 9-10%. That's it. Everything else is sweet. But hey, you can always chase the dollar."

The company takes very good care of its employees.  Benefits are great.","While some employees are wonderful, kind people, others are obnoxious, unwelcoming and downright nasty.  It boggles the mind that they occupy customer contact positions.
Some supervisors are fantastic.  Others are not helpful at all but rather intimidating.  They see their jobs as watching you and waiting for you to screw up."
1447,Southwest Airlines,Purchasing in Technology,2019-02-08,5.0,Category Manager,"Benefits, 401k, Culture, Paternity/Maternity leave",Increased pay would be helpful compared to the industry role.
1448,Southwest Airlines,Great company,2019-02-08,5.0,Flight Attendant,They care about they’re employees and its a fun company overall . They pay very well and our work trips are the most productive in the industry. No minimum or maximum number of hours required so you can work as much or as little as you want ( as long as you cover the shifts you don’t want ).,In order to make money in the beginning you will be gone a lot; so if you have a family you will need a great support system.

1450,Southwest Airlines,Great Place to work,2019-02-04,4.0,Yield Analyst,"Culture is awesome. Lots of fun events throughout the year. Very family oriented atmosphere. Flight benefits are great. Generally not expected to bring work home. Very stress free environment. Benefits package is great. Profit sharing is great, 401k match is unheard of at 9.3%, and stock purchase plan is great.","My only complaint is that no matter how good you are at your current job, if you do not meet the work experience requirement, you will not get the job. This makes it discouraging to give it your all and try to get promoted quickly knowing that no matter what you do there is that time requirement"
1451,Southwest Airlines,"Great Culture, Little Pay",2019-02-01,5.0,Ground Operations Manager,Great company culture with great benefits,Culture can't out weigh poor pay for the expectation of the role. They should compliment each other.
1452,Southwest Airlines,Great company to work for,2019-01-30,5.0,Customer Service & Support,Corporate has a sense of humor & looks out for its employees as well as the customers. A golden rule mentality!,"Sometimes there's mandatory overtime, but they make you aware of that going in."
1453,Southwest Airlines,A Great Job If You Can Get Past The Cons,2019-01-27,4.0,Ramp Agent,"Good pay rates if you can stick it out for a few years.  It starts on the low side, but after the five year mark you start to make a decent wage.  Currently tops out at about $32 per hour, which is good for an entry level job with no prerequisites. 

Benefits are good.  Health, Vision and Dental coverage.  Free flights on standby.  They have a point based system where you can purchase gift cards and other goods for having perfect attendance which is awarded monthly.  

Good values for a company that is ultimately out to make a profit.  Stable, good set of ethics, have not seen any layoffs in the 4 1/2 years I've worked.  

Very physical job.  If you like working outdoors and keeping active, this is a great option.

Strong Union.  Probably one of the strongest I've worked with.  Pretty good at negotiating contracts, and they are good at keeping people from getting screwed over by a supervisor with a chip on their shoulder.  I've seen lots of folks who were fired for whatever reason get their jobs back, and they tend to give good advice when you aren't sure of a policy.","Very physically demanding.  If you aren't in shape, or have issues with health, this might not be for you.  You'll stacking bags in a bin, on your knees, trying to move bags that can way up to 99 pounds and freight that can get up to 200+.

You're subject to whatever weather comes your way.  Where I work, we get everything from rain, to high wind, to severe storms, to snow.  Temperatures can get to either extreme from -20 to 105+, and the conditions of the ramp go anywhere from a sheet of ice to being like standing on an oven.  Consider the weather in your area and ask yourself if you can handle working in those conditions daily.

Seniority based, with many stations having staff that have been around for 15+ years.  Depending on the station, some of the smaller ones will undoubtedly be hard to get the hours you want.  On top of that, mandatory OT is issued by seniority starting at the bottom, so if you wind up in a very senior station, expect to get hit up very frequently with forced overtime.

While the Management at headquarters generally have good values, this does not quite apply to the management of the station you work at.  Expect to see the same things you would see in most jobs, with supervisors that just hate you and hate the world, and administration that is just plain incompetent from time to time.  Many of the supervisor staff come off the streets directly into their job and have no experience in actual ramp activities.  There is a very strong Us vs. Them mentality, at least in my station.

Monthly bids for your weekly schedule occur every month or bi-monthly, depending on your station.  All of it is done through paper.  Have to plan your vacations around it to ensure you don't miss the week a bid rolls out, or have a bid on file that you know you can hold."

- Takes care of their employees.
- Great benefits.
- Free flights are nice.
- Lots of opportunity to move laterally.
- Salaries are competitive.","- All software development is guided by architects, who ivory tower every problem and have not written software in decades.
- Design by committee is everywhere.
- Everything is done in a silo. Nobody communicates.
- Management can't seem to figure out what it wants to do.
- LOTS of politics; every manager and director seems to have a beef with the others. This even continues down to ground-level employees, so backbiting is constant.
- I have no idea why the QA organization exists. It does not seem to provide any value."

- High 401K matching

- Little to no diversity in the company, especially in upper management. Look at all Directors and above at SWA. Only 10% would be minorities. 
- Lots of DRAMA - Feels like high school sometimes, but worse.
- Racial FAVORITISM is very evident. Opportunities given to favorites in the team. 
- Career path and criteria for promotion constantly changing and most times not even followed.
- You need to brown nose and kiss up to managers to get promoted. 
- SWA only wants conservative, bubbly, outgoing employees. Quiet ones will be pushed to the corner.  
- Full flights nowadays, so hard to non-rev. Not worth the hassle."

The acceptance rate is very low. However, Southwest is still a business. As much as they want to put their people first, they have to make business-savvy decisions, and sometimes that comes at a cost. You might wait forever trying to get in, whether you're just applying or whether you're a contractor.

Profit Sharing
401k Match
Brand Awareness
People spend a ton of time socializing and having“fun” - if that appeals to you 
Flexible schedule
You can fly for free if you don’t mind the standby gamble 
Inspiring CEO
From a customer perspective, they always do the right thing and go above and beyond","Tenure valued over competency
Hired for “fun loving attitude” over ability to do the job/be a top performer  
Underperforming senior leaders are not held accountable 
Critical feedback goes seemingly unnoticed and unactioned 
Typical to have 3-4 Directors per year 
Senior Leaders are treated as generalists and given responsibility in areas for which they are unqualified and often disinterested 
Focus on fun leads to organizational laziness and mediocre performance
Low performers are passed along versus being performance managed 
The morale of the headquarters facility is very low with the exception of the  college hires
No growth path for HiPo talent and no retention strategy
Large scale organizational changes are frequent, communicated poorly and generally unsuccessful 
People pretend to like one another and use that to promote “a world class culture.” Its no different than anywhere else. The politics, while present in all organizations, are especially rampant here
Roles are often changed without consulting the affected employees in advance. 
Different pay scales for the same role exist throughout the company. Often times a decrease in pay must be accepted in order to make a lateral move to a different area
Preselection of candidates is the norm yet full interview processes take place wasting the time and energy of candidates. Word gets out frequently about who has gotten a role before the job itself has even been posted
Spans and layers are wildly different. Managers running director level scope and vice versa is not uncommon (spans and layers issue)"

The site is being investigated  for improper use of vouchers as well as several other allegations which is being discussed among employees that should not know this information. I resigned due to the dishonesty and unprofessionalism at the station. Be prepared to basically be hazed by senior agents and treated poorly, I was constantly told I was at their mercy and at the bottom of the totem pole. I was told on more than one occasion I was disposable by supervisors. Nothing is private so be prepared for everyone to know personal things about you. Unfortunately it is the culture of the organization and very hard to separate yourself from. The station was very short staffed due to increased turnover rate from agents.  You are forced to be extended in and out for you shift. some agents having less than four hours of rest period.

In my opinion, the only reason more employees haven't started leaving and seeking better opportunities is financial reasons. Yes, Southwest is competitive with their economic and benefit packages. But money isn't everything, and SWA were believed to have everything years ago. Biggest faults as the company grew was failing to follow through and hold employees accountable at all levels.

(Some Parts) The Culture","Mandatory Overtime. I’ve worked 42 hour shifts before because the company kept placing Mandatory shifts and extensions on me.

No outside life. The free flights are great if you can actually get any time off, and I unless you’ve been there for 5 years, that’s really hard to do. 

Unions. You win some with it, and you lose some with it. With the way management is anymore at SWA (which is sad because it used to be so great) it’s hard to ratify any contracts. The company tries to low ball its employees in every area including OJI (On the Job Injury) to “cut costs” but turns up billions of dollars worth of profits. There’s this saying, “Southwest loves to kill us with all these hours, but hates paying when we finally do die.” Back to the union, it creates lazy senior agents that blame everything on the junior agents. Then no matter how well you do, you’ll still get the same pay raises as that person that does nothing, so there’s no incentive to work hard. You can work 42 hour shifts plus because of the collective bargaining agreement. Don’t get injured on the job because you’ll get screwed over in Transition Duty. Finally, if you’re just starting, enjoy the next 4 years of living paycheck to paycheck unless you want to work 70-80 hours a week, because DT is taxed at 40% so it’s a lose, lose situation.

Culture. Now, the company in certain stations does a good job, and Dallas is amazing. But if you’re stuck in a senior station, have fun returning to high school. False rumors, clicks, and two faced backstabbers will be your work environment."

In my department last month we had 3 people quit and one person lose his mind because of workplace stress, he was escorted out by police. When the new larger 737-800's came in they added more flights with longer destinations and more passengers. Did southwest give us more trucks and workers? No! They made further cuts on staffing per shift. I always wondered why southwest had such high ratings for workers because they didnt survey my department! A whole bunch of great ratings from flight attendants. Let me explain. We do about 10x more work than your average inflight crew member. Considering i do 12 flights a day they do 5(maybe). Everything they use i also handle at some point (x2). Then you look at staffing. Theres 1.5 or 2 flight attendants for every 1 provo agent, again doubling the workload by comparison (x4). Not to mention i also have to drive a truck in between airplanes all day. Then restock that same messed up truck every few flights. Again putting everything anyone sees on the plane back on the truck to do it all over again (x8). Not to mention theres no provo in half the cities we fly, again doubling the work for those flights (10x) 

So theres my one star rating to even out the 1000 five star ratings from inflight lol."

The benefits are incredible--including flight benefits for my spouse, my parents, and myself on SWA and other airlines. Not to mention the 401(k) match and ProfitSharing add about 25% to my salary. Combine that with paying less than $20 a month for family insurance and the various other benefits--the total compensation package is truly outstanding.

- Colleagues are generally friendly and caring. 
- You can move around into different roles and departments easily. 
- Great standby travel with Southwest Airlines and other Airlines. 
- Good 401K match and profitsharing
- You are celebrated for anniversaries, birthdays and our people really look out for each other when something happens in their life
- The first few years there are great!","- New Employees are compensated for the current market, yet tenured Employees don't ever match that level of compensation
- Decisions are made slowly, it feels like you have to please everyone to get a ""yes"" to move forward
- Close to ZERO diversity at the mid-level Manager and Senior Leader level. It is still the ""old boys club"" mentality, and D&I doesn't change that. 
- Management promotes ""yes"" people, friends, people who they identify with, rather than the most qualified
- Everything has to have a positive spin, bringing up issues/risks you get called ""negative"", despite the fact that the CEO has asked us to challenge each other, this has not trickled down to VP/mid-level management levels
- Hold people accountable - just because they have been there for 20 years, it doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to people not delivering on projects, or completing their work. There are a lot of people coming from other states and organizations where the laid back job ethic was unacceptable.
- Often feels like there is no support from your own Leaders, because they don't want it to look like they have any issues in their group"

Everyone is friendly and you are able to build friendships. Overall I'm happy with Southwest and I'm excited to LGA grow as a station. SWA always gives you an opportunity to grow and actually start a career no matter where you started. I've heard great stories of people like me who started as Ramp Agents and became Station Managers. Everyone within the system is easily accessible and are always willing to lend a helping hand. Also, the company works hand in hand with our Union which is a strong union and hardly are ever at odds with each other. That definitely makes our jobs easier.","At LGA there is a lot of constant construction going on. Construction means detours and a lot of traffic. Luckily, I live within a 5 mile radius of the station and it isn't so bad for me. If you drive, finding parking is usually easy to find, but it'll take you 15-20 mins to walk to the airport. One of the only few cons I could think of. If you live nearby, I wouldn't worry too much about the constant changes because of construction."

I know the unions are having their beef with leadership, but I have nothing but kind words for Mr. Kelly. A few outsiders have infiltrated the top and some of their value judgments don't seem to align with the true Southwest of old, but there's more than enough star power to keep the party going.","No need to belabor it, especially with new tech coming online in the next couple years, but some of the systems are way overdue for an upgrade. I don't think Southwest ever envisioned getting this big and we've definitely stretched our capabilities to the breaking point. Travel nowadays goes glove-in-hand with technology and that could mean rapid obsolescence if we don't get our stuff together. Solid tech is a service to our Employees and our Customers."

So over a few months I made a few mistakes and then they said we no longer need my services at southwest. I explained my situation again and told them
What happened. They didn't care at all. Then I told them I will lose my home and car if they let me go and they didn't care. So basically when I started I was honest as could be and kept them in the loop, so now because of them and not caring I will lose everything my car my house everything. What they did was illegal you cannot terminate anyone not in the right state of mind. Especially when you have Doctor letters saying your not in the right state of mind.

But if you didn't fit the mole of what they deemed to be their ideal employee type. You would soon be subjected to negative and bias opinionated scrutiny.

I loved my summer with Southwest because the people I met everyday truly cared what meetings and events I observed throughout the day in order to optimize my time at work and my future career. Even as an intern, I had networking opportunities with executives within Flight Operations. I was blown away at the caring attitude of every single employee I met all summer. There's not very many companies in the world today that could be said about!

They will go out of their way to help those in less than ideal situations. Additionally, the work can be very challenging at times, leading to a sense of accomplishment once completed.","There is a tremendous amount of disconnect at Headquarters, mostly driven by an overly political corporate office. Departments are created with a complete lack of planning, leading to a lack of role clarity. The People responsible for completing the work are left confused and frustrated, all while middle managers pursue agendas of self promotion. Emphasis is placed on completing tasks immediately instead of completing tasks correctly. All of this occurs while hiding behind a facade of placing Employees first, above all else, including external customers."

This company really cares about their Employees and do everything they can to making it a great place to work! The deck parties, department celebrations, and Rallies are just a few of the awesome things we celebrate. The flight benefits are a pretty awesome perk too! The internship was one of the best experiences of my life, I met some of my best lifelong friends during my time as an intern. The Campus Reach team really knows how to make everyone feel welcome and we were treated as though we were a full time employee. The experience I gained as an intern helped lead me to the current position I have now with Southwest. I would highly recommend the internship program to anyone!",I really can't think of any :)

It was a great experience and a great team to work with. Although there were no openings in my degree field the company was expanding country wide. As an intern I was able to apply for a job internally and landed a full time gig in the field at the airport. No, I'm not utilizing my degree however, I am gaining the operational experience my intern supervisor has encouraged me to obtain. Southwest has been one of the biggest blessings so far. I am able to be myself and enjoy what I do. The travel perks are not that bad either.",For me there are no cons. I'm living in my third city since I graduated college in 2014 and can thank SWA for the enjoyable ride.

2. Leadership is dedicated to both Employees and the Company. Herb said it best that Employees come first. If you make your Employees happy, that'll resonate to Customer satisfaction. Most Leadership continues to carry on Herb's philosophy and is genuinely interested in your well-being as an Employee.

3. The culture here is unmatched! You really have to experience it to believe it.","Turnover is low here, so it can be difficult to move around/up to different positions. Additionally, it's difficult to get hired to work at Southwest; it's equally as competitive to move around once you're within the Company."
2269,Southwest Airlines,Employment Intern,2016-03-09,5.0,,"The culture at SWA is absolutely AMAZING. Southwest serves others in an intentional manner and pursues excellence always. The company has a relentless passion for people, and it was a joy to be an intern here.","Can take a while to hear back regarding your status once you've applied, but that's because there's so many applications that have to be reviewed."

2275,Southwest Airlines,Internship,2016-03-01,5.0,Intern,Amazing opportunity. I learned so much every day and worked as if I was part of the team. Southwest invests deeply in ensuring that their interns are treated exceptionally well and have great experiences.,They don't offer full-time positions to interns that aren't graduated yet. The only way you can get hired in a good Southwest job out of college is if you graduate and then do an internship.
2276,Southwest Airlines,Operations agent,2016-03-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Free flight benefits and discounted with other carriers.  Flexible work schedule.  Great profit sharing and 401k match.,Low starting wage and undesirable work hours when new.

2285,Southwest Airlines,Technology Contract to Full-Time,2016-02-24,4.0,Senior Analyst,"Work-life balance is actually practiced here.  My experience with previous technology companies, was that if a deadline was going to be missed, the staff was expected to put in the extra time.  I've actually heard management say the following here: ""if we're going to miss the deadline, let's quantify the impact and communicate it"".  There is a real sense of not killing yourself to meet arbitrary deadlines here.  Fun is part of the culture and family time is valued.  
401k benefits are great and so are retirement options.  As an employee, I feel recognized by management for doing great work.","Converting from contract to full-time is more difficult than coming in off the street for a full-time position.  Contractors are not treated the same as employees in many aspects.  Much of the appraised culture is not shared - even news and announcements don't get distributed down to contractors. Upper management does not appreciate the contributions of contractors as a permanent resource.  Contractors are viewed as easily replaceable.

As a full-time employee, vacation and pay are about average (or slightly below average when compared to truly competitive companies).  Flight benefits are over-valued since you fly standby and load factors are high (which is great for profits though!)."

He is still around, but no longer has much influence over the culture. Particularly in I.T., the culture is being eradicated.

After working on projects and then leaving, I was yearning for an opportunity to see the change through and really make a difference in one place.  I definitely found that with Southwest Airlines.  While I believe my subject matter knowledge is respected by others, I also believe that I have grown significantly by learning from my peers in other departments.  I believe my skill set has expanded greatly with knowledge of an operation that you can only acquire by living in an organization for a period of time.  I have now been with Southwest Airlines for 10 years, and I'm so thankful I get to work for such a fantastic company with great values that match my own.  Plus, I get to work with wonderful people!

-Bullying

I was an administrative coordinator which meant that I supported directors. The vice presidents were above the directors, and their assistants are called executive assistants. These girls were absolutely awful. There is so much bullying and politics. It's insane. My time with Southwest ended with an HR investigation. Your directors will not support you because the executive assistants ""control their bosses"". I was also told that it's a ""class system"" by one of my directors. I would highly recommend the company, but would not recommend an admin coordinator role. Get more experience and wait for an executive assistant opening."

You will be sent to Dallas for a week for training they will give you a food allotment and hotel for your self they will sell it to you that southwest is a great company and when you leave you will really believe it.","-----MANDATORY OVERTIME------
For me this was a deal breaker. It sounds great at first like i get paid double time to work my normal job heck ya! So my first week after my initial training my schedule was Wednesday thru Sunday 1PM to 9PM with mon tue off it sounds straight forward and great but... They LOVE to extend you and they will do it everyday. If your off time was at 9PM thats when you make plans with your loved ones but then they will extend you 3.7 hours after your end time everyday. And they will tell you during the last 30 mins or less during your shift that you have to stay. 

And I mentioned that I had Mon and Tue off thats a lie you will be mandatory on your first day off of every week guaranteed no questions asked. They will tell you on you last shift before your days off that you will have to come in on your day off to help fill holes... So thats great but like I said above you will have to work an extra 3.7 hours on top of that shift because thats something you do on every shift. 

------Management-------
Management is poor at your location they let you know that your just a number they will remind you anytime your tired that there are thousands of applicants out there waiting for this job and they can fire you in a second and it wouldn't affect them at all. 

And a few minor things that I didnt know before i started 

-This is a union job you will have to pay union dues
-Forced overtime is a killer on my paychecks so far I have had (49,55,43, and 51 hours of mandatory overtime. Great for money but its such a physical job be ready for the toll on your body
-Seniority based company, you will start at the bottom of the roster there is about 200 employees at my location. And shifts, time off, and jobs are given out this way, the guy thats been there the longest gets to choose his job first than the second guy ect ect... so new hires will get last pick on everything for the first 10 years or so before your seniority starts kicking in."

The employees are super nice and the flight benefits are great.,"The cons of working at Southwest Airlines are: the work is hard. Lifting heavy weight, being in the weather, and the pay is really low. In California, Freight Agents start off at $10.63 an hour and move up to $11 after 6 months. But still, who can live off of 22K a year?"

Generally you'll be treated well unless you're educated, then you're either put on a pedestal or vilified. First, the majority of people are uneducated and will treat you differently if you have any sort of post-high school education. Second is the management. In my experience the management treated rampers poorly, ranging from poor/non-exist leadership to trying to deny payment of overtime and benefits. Third is the job itself. You work long hours (8+) on an irregular schedule for not a lot of money. You are also asked to do A LOT. Two people, TWO, are expected to do all the tasks required to turn an aircraft in 30 minutes, which is free from reason in my opinion. All these together make a very unpleasant experience. 

One last point, Southwest cuts costs in very annoying placed which cause a lot of inconveniences. One example is paper bidding. You don't bid for shifts electronically at SWA, you have to fill out a 500+ entry piece of paper. Another example is you have to manually keep track of the amount of bags you load into what bins; you don't have an electronic scanner. Bottom line, SWA cutting costs inconveniences the employees SIGNIFICANTLY."

There is occasional mandatory overtime, but the SWA pays the Agents double time when you are required to work when you were planning to be off. However, that is one of the questions you are asked when you apply. SWA does more with less, but that allows SWA to profitable. It allows the employees to get 401k match, and great health benefits.

The benefits package is awesome. The company, on a whole, still believes in ""feel good company culture"" activities. Time on (working a schedule so you have every other Friday off) is definitely appreciated.","Soooo...yeah, then there's the Technology department. Leadership often does not listen, value, or respect the opinions/ideas/thoughts of the individual contributors on their teams. Leadership often talks about being ""transparent"", and stresses the value of ""communication"", but those are just the latest HR buzzwords and there is no true action behind those words. There is definitely a good ole boy network within the management structure in Technology at Southwest, and if you're not ""in with the clique"", then you're going to have a difficult time. There are a number of highly skilled people within Technology who are seriously being underutilized and overworked. 

This company is still operating as if it is a small airline, but it's not, so people are working ridiculous hours IN THE OFFICE and the work life balance is quickly flying out of the window. Management does not seem to appreciate the number of hours their staff puts in to ensure stability within Technology. Then you have the ""lifers"" - those that know that better exists outside of SWA, but they've invested so much time here that it's more beneficial for them to stay until retirement. 

Couple the rampant politics and selfish leadership with the lack of 21st century ""amenities"" for technology employees (working remotely, up to date technology, decent pay) and you have a recipe for disaster. It's only a matter of time."

2388,Southwest Airlines,Senior Analyst,2015-10-21,3.0,Senior Analyst,"Southwest Airlines is a great company, with good executive leadership. CEOs and SVPs are top notch, in my opinion. There are many opportunities to do really good high impact work at a lower level. Managers/Sr. Managers/Directors at other airlines do work that Senior Analysts/Business Consultants do at Southwest, which is awesome. Also, if you want to move around and try different departments, it's totally do-able. There is something for everybody at SWA. Exit opportunities are great because other companies know you are ready to do a much higher level work so you can hit the ground running as soon as you get there. Culture is also pretty solid, relative to other companies. Solid resume builder overall.","Director - Manager level of leadership on a scale of 1-5, is somewhere between 2 and 3. Definitely an old boys club, and they have each other's back, even when they know that they are wrong....maybe if there were more women/people of color at the Manager/director level, this is a problem that wouldn't happen.  There is no diversity in professional services departments, at any level (from analyst to senior Director), and no affinity groups to act as a support system. SWA just really isn't great at developing talent in general, especially talent under 30, SWA leaders (at the manger director level) are more focussed on their own careers than developing a pipeline of leaders.  This could be a larger People Department issue, not necessarily just departmental issues at SWA. There is a Diversity and Inclusion department that's more focussed on making sure everyone gets along and tolerates each other (everybody sing kumbaya! this is somewhat important, i'll admit), when they should, in my opinion be more focused on recruiting, retaining and developing top minority (I'm including women in this conversation) talent (this is much more important, i think). Should probably start looking into, ""I wonder why latina woman X started the same day as man Y and has had stellar reviews but can't seem to push past the XXX level when man Y has with east"" That's when they're really doing the work that moves diversity forward. Women are definitely much more impacted by the lack of diversity at the top than underrepresented minorities (So few URMs at SWA you can't really even measure how much they're missing out on opportunities, kinda unfortunate)There is a reason why there are no underrepresented minorities in leadership (outside of the operation) at SWA and it could be related to a lack of opportunity available, potentially generated by leadership's bias in views of performance, or just a general non-preference if I had to guess. The talent is/was there, and they/we are flourishing at companies with similar caliber brands (American Airlines, Microsoft, Google, top tier consulting firms etc. -- most of which have affinity groups) . The Southwest Brand is STRONG, get some years of experience, and once you hit that ceiling, another company will be happy to use that skill-set."

The company supports the communities it services with air travel and not only promotes charitable giving and volunteer service, but makes it easy to do so as an employee.","The only downside is that many workgroups at Southwest are represented by unions which push for archaic work rules that make it difficult to quickly adapt to our rapidly-changing environment. I am currently in a workgroup that is not represented by a union, and I like it that way. I was in a union workgroup with Southwest for the first 3 years of my career.

2412,Southwest Airlines,Quirky and Out of Touch,2015-09-18,3.0,Various,Good benefits but get expensive if wanting family benefits; excellent 401K and company match especially for an airline; very safety-conscious company.,"Very high attrition; beyond plagued with employee sick calls in virtually every department.  I've never seen a company function on the day-to-day with mandatory overtime.  Some folks truly have zero quality of life.  Some get addicted to the money and get burnt out; others are consistently forced to stay after their shifts or report on their first day off or mandated to stay double shifts.  Most certainly not a way of life for the long term for most.  
Severely antiquated technology and processes.  Company does not adequately budget for technology development and is playing catch-up with improvements that are slow to materialize.
Severely underpaid on virtually all levels of non-unionized workforce.  Company relies on brand name and company culture to excite applicants, but uses antiquated pay scale system for compensation.  Money is without a doubt a taboo topic and pay raises are bare minimum (2-3% for most non-union employees.)
Ultra limited advancement opportunities.  Simply put, there are no jobs to move up to!  Work is ultra redundant and requires zero thinking.  
Headquarters is located in Dallas where greatest possibility of switching positions exists.  If coming from unionized position, it is entirely possible to be taking a pay cut.
Sometimes coined a 'shoestring operation,' as company often has a very amateur approach on new processes or destinations.  Most definitely an expert in trying to 'reinvent the wheel,' often to its own detriment that adds to inefficiencies and wasteful spending.  For instance, when company took delivery of 737-800 aircraft, it redesigned galleys that make zero sense, added mini carts that are of course not used now due to impracticality for single-aisle aircraft, and in 2016 will be redesigned because they did not work from the get-go.  Operationally-speaking, company has been attempting to transition from point-to-point to a hybrid of hub-and-spoke and point-to-point.  Sometimes, it feels like company tries to fit a round peg into a square hole.  Minor adjustments in things like ground time, airplane swapping, decreasing and increasing airplane turn times, etc., continue to propel day-to-day and at the same time conflict with existing work rules in respective employee groups leading to disgruntled workforce, operational inefficiencies, and loss of productivity."
2413,Southwest Airlines,Completely overrated,2015-09-18,2.0,Ramp Agent,"The pay is ""eventually"" worth it.... Flight benefits if you can find an open flight due to southwest policy on over booking and no assigned seats. Mandatory overtime is double pay. The ability to pick up and give away shifts. Health benefits","The ""all big one happy family"" theme dies once you leave headquarters. Starting pay is horrible. It's the only airline with  2 people per flight to load and unload the planes. They are a growing company but still base everything like staffing and turn times on 1970 concepts and passenger loads. Some Older entitled workers treat new hires like crap. The employees already past probation will take their sweet time because they know they can't hey in trouble meanwhile YOUR job is on the line.  The union is pitiful and WEAK!! They've been ""negotiating"" for 4 years with no end in sight."
2414,Southwest Airlines,Ops,2015-09-17,4.0,,"Good benefits.  Great 401k match, profit sharing, free flights.",Intense labor.  Outdoor conditions mean it can get rough.
2415,Southwest Airlines,Not all what it's hyped up to be...,2015-09-16,1.0,Operations Agent,"Pay is good, but not great in today's competitive environment.  Health benefits are wonderful.  Free flights if there are open seats of course, but SWA has so many fare sales that it's almost impossible at times.  Coworkers are great and the only thing that'll keep you going.","Where should I start?  Excessive mando....you will work way more hours/shifts against your will and there is nothing that you can do about it except have bad letters put in your record and wait to be fired or quit.  It's always short staffed, even if they hire employees, by the time those people are trained and working which takes weeks to months, everybody else is so burnt out and have either transferred, quit, calling out sick, or gone on OJI, so then you are short staffed again....just a revolving cycle and its worst during late spring, thru summer, and early fall.
Be prepared to work on your first day off against your will.  You can be forced to stay until the last flight lands, let's just say for this example which is very realistic its landing at 1 AM, then you can be forced to come back and start work at 5 AM, and expected to work that shift at 100% and make no mistakes or accidents.
Supervisors are constantly stepping down on the system to a regular agent giving up all of there seniority because they are scared they are going to be fired or lose there job.
Micro-managing.....you will be constantly watched for every little thing you do.  It's one thing if you screw up and make big mistakes all the time, but to miss little tiny things that everybody does everyday isn't a big deal, but it will be made a big deal of so get ready to get disciplined because you forgot to add one bag to your paperwork.
I wouldn't recommend this company to anybody as to there are many other ones that are way better to choose from today.  This job use to be for people who wanted great careers and to build up for retirement; however, today this company is only good as a temporary job for someone looking to build up some quick cash as to you will be constantly working all the time and will not have much time for your home life."

Everyone who works here loves it and we all get along like one big family. When you are off duty you rarely have to think about work and can really enjoy your time off. This is a job for extroverts who love to travel and serve others.","Being away 3 days a week requires a good support system at home if you have children. A trusted nanny or reliable family member is a must. Also, we only get paid for the time in the air so all that ground time tidying the aircraft and boarding passengers is a gift of your time to the company. And flight delays usually don't earn you any extra money either."

It often takes 30 minutes and two different agents to process simple changes around the glitches that our res system always encounters. So much time is lost searching through 3 different ineffective programs for simple information, or ""unglitching"" reservations. 

Every minute of our day is monitored and scheduled, so if you have to take an extra bathroom break, you're dinged on your compliance metric. They expect us to feel the LUV, when exactly are we supposed to do that? 

We made a huge profit the pat few years but we continue to squeeze every last drop out of our People and the morale reflects this accordingly.

We were shown during training in Dallas that Southwest is such a great, fun place to work. That all went out the window once we got to our workspace. Fun is on our own time, and after working a 12 hour day everyday, I'm too tired. We all are. 
Advancement is limited in this company unless you're willing to move to a different city every couple of years."

They always celebrate their people.,"You really have to decide what's important to you when working here. If money and the opportunity to move up is important, then this is not the place to work. You are bound to a department for AT LEAST a year and a half. So many people want to work there that IF a spot opens up at that point, you're competing with hundreds of other people. Trust me when I tel you that the chance to move up is nearly impossible. Airlines have super thin margins so the pay also is incredibly low. Also, you will barley ever get hired based on your talent. You will get hired on your personality. That's how they do things. It keeps the culture in check but keeps innovation at a stand still. Southwest has so many older people and it's time to get young innovators in there that can compete with the rest."

You make great money because you are worked day and night almost around the clock. No sign of a break anywhere. Everyday you come to work you are frightened you will not have a job at the end of the day. Supervisors are overworked and stressed well. Many times I've walked in the supervisors office only to find them crying wondering if today was the day they'd get let go from this WONDERFUL company they've worked for 10, 15, & 20 years.

If I was in my 20's or 30's, just starting out, it would have been great.  However, in my 50's, the starting salary was very low, the job I was in was a union job, and so we were at the bottom of the totem pole; we had mandatory overtime almost every day this summer.  Very, very rigid, and it did not feel like the management cared at all about you.  They barely even acknowledged the new group's presence.

2441,Southwest Airlines,Overworked and Under Appreciated,2015-08-22,2.0,Customer Service Agent,"I came to Southwest with so much excitement and so much respect. Finally, a company I could work for that had a reputation for treating it's employees great. When I went in for my interview I let them know my greatest asset was my positive attitude and that I would work very hard for them if hired. Everything leading up to training in Dallas was perfect. They flew us to a People department and overwhelmed us with love, letting us know how fortunate we were to work for such a great company while explaining our benefits. Amidst the glow, individual contracts were set out in front of us, with the base pay and the union who had negotiated it. I couldn't have felt more proud of myself for landing this job. I then returned to the station where I trained for about a month with someone, after which I went to the training headquarters in Dallas for three weeks of paid training. All the moments I spent there were wonderful. There was free coffee everywhere, and they put us up in a nice hotel and gave us food cards. It was heaven, and again I felt lucky and so proud to work for Southwest Airlines. I cannot express how great the Corporate culture is. The benefits you receive, as well as the welcome you get, are the main and only highlights of this job. However, once you return from Dallas, the reality sets in: something is not as it seems. This really is too good to be true.","A week after I returned from Dallas, I had completed my training and finally began a probationary period of 6 months. During this time you begin your union contract and bid for a shift. Per the contract: Southwest employees cannot decline mandatory overtime, call in sick, or come to work late. If you do, you receive an occurrence. Three occurrences and you are terminated. During this time it became perfectly clear that I was an employee number. Nothing more. 60 hour weeks were commonplace.
  Imagine: Your shift is Wednesday through Sunday 3pm - 11:30pm. On Wednesday you work your regular shift, but clock out late due to delays: 3pm - 1:30am (10 hours). However, you are assigned mandatory overtime (remember you cannot decline this without being fired) for 2 hours after you get off at 3:45am - 11:45am. You then work from 3pm - 11:30pm the same day. Imagine that this happens 2 times a week, every week. That is the reality of Southwest Airlines. Throughout my probationary period this was VERY common, and again happened at least 2 times a week. The most I had to work was 81 hours in one week, four 16 hour shifts back to back, and then a regular 8 hour shift on one of my days off. It's not the type of work that is the problem, it is the amount of work.
  Upon asking union leaders and management, their responses were, and I quote VERBATIM: If you don't like it, maybe this job isn't for you. Once completing your probationary period, which is rare as people literally fall asleep on the job and are fired, or break down from the mental stress of staying awake for 2 days straight, you can decline the overtime. Even then, 16 hour days are a common occurrence, as is mandatory overtime. The IAM union contract states that for every refusal of mandatory overtime, you accrue half a point (.5). If you accrue 9 points, you are subject to termination. In the single month after my probation I accrued 5 points by simply declining overtime. Per the contract, it takes 3 months for just 2 points to drop from your record, during which time you cannot be late, call in sick without a doctors note, or decline ANY overtime. As it stands, my weeks are never less than 50 hours. NEVER.
  This amount of work results in huge employee burnout. I recently spoke with someone at Headquarters in Dallas who said, ""Right now we have a high turnover rate for customer service and we are trying to figure out why.""

I cannot in good conscious recommend this job to anyone that values their sanity."

I dreaded going to work. Morale was low due to being treated like children.  You were not allowed to sit where you wanted. You had to sit in what they called zones. Hard work was not appreciated. All the supervisors cared about was how many rental cards you booked and how many people you transferd over to the credit card company.  Call center reps don't truly have the freedom to assist customers because they are only supposed to be on a call for 300 seconds which is not responsible when you are trying to provide good customer service which includes booking a flight, helping to research travel funds, booking cars and pushing the Rapid Rewards credit card. Then when they say no tell them why they need to upgrade, why they need the rental car and why they need the credit card.
Also, they are ridiculous about attendance. I  couldn't get my shift covered and missed my 
grandmothers funeral so I wouldn't get an 
occurrence because as a single mom I needed the job. A co- worker went into labor but was told she was not able to leave until her paperwork was done or she would get an occurrence."

You can trade shifts with people, work a double shift, or give shifts away.","My experience at Southwest only lasted 1 month unfortunately. In baseball it's 3 strikes and you're out. However at Southwest Airlines, it's 1 strike and you're out. If you violate 1 huge safety rule, you're gone, that's it no more second chances. And this is exactly what happened to me. Be aware of jet blast from an airplane! Long story short I let a car go by while the engines of the airplane were turned on, which is why I got fired. If you don't like short deadlines, and aren't very good with handling stress and pressure then this isn't for you. You have to get your planes out on time, that's just how this business works.

- Communication is rough. There seems to be a lot going on behind closed doors, but very little communication about what exactly it is.
- Timelines tend to be unrealistic and there seems to be no support when trying to fix them. As a result, outdated solutions tend to be built purely because that's what the timeline allowed for.

2524,Southwest Airlines,Company in transition,2015-05-16,3.0,Operations/Cargo Agent,"The current contracts for ground operations (ticket counter, ramp, cargo, operations) are pretty good. After 11 years or so you make $27 an hour, you have 4 weeks paid vacation, 10 floating paid holidays plus 2 set paid holidays, 1 paid sick day per month that can be saved up to a very large number of days in a bank (forget the exact number), matching 401k, profit sharing, and really good health insurance.","A few years ago the company was ran by an amazing man; Herb Kelleher. He actually gave a crap about the employees. He was replaced by the CFO when he retired. All Gary Kelly gives a crap about is $$$. The once great culture of Southwest Airlines is dead. The idea that management and employees were a team is dead. The ramp, ops, and cargo contract has been under negotiations for 4 years with no end in sight. The company makes record profits every quarter; but management wants concessions from the workforce. I fear Gary is trying to follow in the footsteps of the infamous Frank Lorenzo. The future may not be bright for Southwest. Hire on at your own risk.

Besides the dim future there are some more immediate cons. When you start you will work nights, weekends, and every holiday. You will be given mandatory overtime out the wazoo. Its not uncommon to work until 1or 2 am. and then be required to come back at 4 or 5 am. due to ridiculously low staffing quotas. They will work you until you become ill from exhaustion; then they will gripe when you call in sick. Of course the supervisors will be sitting in their office drinking coffee with their feet propped up when they tell you how lazy you are for calling off."

In Technology at HDQ, it's a different story. Employees have been there for over 20 years and have not made it past Manager level. They know very little about industry standards and resist change. Very cut throat politics.....be nice to your face and stab you in the back! Not the SWA culture that is advertised. That is just how the employees deal with each other. If you as an employee do not perform, you are moved from group to group until you quit or retire. 

Contractors are like minions who are overworked and under appreciated. As a contractor,  be prepared  to do chores for the employees totally outside your job description. Unless you are with professional services, you are SOL. You will either get divorced (if married), sleep at the wheel due to exhaustion or get really sick. I have seen all three happen during my tenure here.

Perks... flying free, making my own schedule, having 18 days off a month, touring all the city's on layover's, making a decent salary and working with great people. Southwest Airlines is an outstanding company to work for.",Commuting. SWA does not have a crew base in L.A. so I commute to OAK and that can get a little stressful at times also being JA'd which means you think your finished for the day and your told you have to fly one more leg. And for New Flight Attendants working all the holidays and being based away from your family.  But all this is just part of the job.
2623,Southwest Airlines,LUV the Company,2014-10-21,5.0,Customer Relations Specialist,At this Company I have felt valued as an Employee. The work hours are flexible. The benefits are FANTASTIC.

They train you in Dallas that the company is all about LUV! Maybe in Dallas, but once you head back to your station ( airport) it's the complete opposite. Probation is absolutely too long! They'll write you up for anything. They rather see you fail than to succeed. This company is an absolute JOKE !"

2631,Southwest Airlines,a growing company that believes in its People,2014-10-07,4.0,Ramp Agent,"Senior leadership has the company and employees' best interests at heart, which cannot be said for very many airlines. At most airlines the bottom line comes first. I believe there are numerous opportunities for growth within my current department and others.","Southwest does not pay for employee parking for non-managers. I was shocked to learn this, as at the other airlines I worked for parking was paid for. There are some morale problems between frontline employees and managers but that is typical for a large station."

2633,Southwest Airlines,new to the company and for the most part nothing but great things to say so far,2014-10-01,5.0,CSA,"this being my introduction into the airline industry, I'm very grateful that I entered with Southwest. Comparing employee morale, company culture, and unique corporate relationship with employees it seems there's no better place to be.  Travel benefits are amazing, countless agreements with other airlines plus of course free SA travel on SWA. Flexibility to pretty much get whichever days off you need with the help of shift trading (although what you have to do/ work to get that day off can be brutal). Excellent training for a newbie such as myself to help me feel confident in such a high stress and challenging environment. Floating holiday paid day off every month (except nov dec) adds to flexibility.  Mandatory overtime can be tough but compensation is great... double time. Supervisors encouraging and there when you need them to help. So far, company/ station acknowledges when you've handled a difficult task and recognizes you for it.","Mandatory overtime can be very tough and rampant depending how staffed your station is. Mandatory overtime'd into 16 hour+ shifts sometimes. Not enough employees in the gate areas at times, leaving one person dealing with chaotic situations and mobs. Ill fitting/ poor uniforms."
2634,Southwest Airlines,It's not the same LUV based airline it was 10 years ago...not for customers or for employees..,2014-10-01,3.0,Customer Service Agent,"Excellent Benefits, great people to work with..that's all great","Southwest performance has declined dramatically over the last few years and the customers are noticing it and don't like the idea of becoming like the ""other airlines"""
2635,Southwest Airlines,Outsourcing is the answer,2014-10-01,2.0,Software Engineer,Excellent benefits package as well as nice perks that come from working for an airline.,"All software development is being outsourced. In order to keep saying the outsourcing isn't causing layoffs, they just make conditions so bad that people quit. If the people don't quit then they get set up for failure and are fired when they inevitably do fail."

2644,Southwest Airlines,"loved company, hated department",2014-09-02,1.0,Attendance & Leave,The best thing is Free flights,the worst thing is terrible work/life balance
2645,Southwest Airlines,"Great pay, terrible everything else",2014-09-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay (it's higher here than anywhere I've seen),"Where to begin?
-Half of those employed have been there 7-20 years, the other half is brand new. The ones that have been there a long time are quite set in their inefficient, detrimental-to-the-company-and-coworkers ways. The brand new (2 or less years) employees are so frustrated with this place that they often leave with or without another job lined up.
-Department is flat. Over 50 people report to the same supervisor. Very little feedback or direction from management. And when they need something, you have to drop everything you're doing, regardless of what it is, to provide them with information. Likely information you'd normally need time to research to give an accurate answer.
-Time-On policy is supposed to allow you to work 44 hours one week and 36 the next so you can get a Friday off. If you're sick or take a vacation day, you cannot take this Friday off, regardless of the fact that, that sick day or vacation day was worth 8-9 hours of work.
-Very disgruntled and/or comfortable employees throughout. Seem to feel like it's okay to speak to coworkers as if they're unintelligent or crazy for wanting to do ""best practice."" I was actually told to tell the customer (nearly all our customers are fellow non technical employees) ""too bad"" (but in less pc terms) that they didn't have access to an application that was business related. They were unwilling to determine a company approved application to serve that business related function. Smiles, laughter, and ""too bad"" was the response. It makes me ashamed to work here.
-You're essentially on call 24/7. Most production work is done 1-4 a.m. on Saturdays. No cell phone stipend. Only contractors get overtime and it is straight time.
-Speaking with superiors about work overload resulted in unhelpful and unsympathetic words and no action
I could go on for days."

2653,Southwest Airlines,Unionism!,2014-08-13,3.0,Flight Attendant,Flexibility and generous wages. Especially for what you do. The customers are more than accommodating if you show interest. See many new places and new people.,"Senior union members are like a vacuum. Always sucking on those around them and actually believe they earned it. It takes forever to get off of working weekends. There is no mandatory retirement. So, it gets very Stael. Average age of the work group is in the 50 year range. their is a disincentive to leave the protection of your union. so get used to doing the same-thing."

2655,Southwest Airlines,At one time great...but not anymore.,2014-08-10,2.0,Operations Agent,Can trade hours/shifts as much as you want; flexibility to travel for free if there are any open seats; can relocate to other departments or stations,"Leadership is terrible...improperly trained or off the street (supervisors); corporate leadership is cheap trying not to give raises & short staffing the company in many departments & stations.  Employees are overworked especially if they have junior seniority.  Work/life balance is terrible...you literally don't have a life because you are always working.  Scheduled hours don't mean anything because right when you think you're about to leave & go home...you have been ""mandoed"" to work more hours or a whole shift which puts you into a double now...spending anywhere from 17-21 hours at work without leaving.  Oh yeah....and you think you have two days off....NOPE!  You always get mandoed to work on your first day off so now you only get one day off a week.  And if you refuse the mando...the company wants to terminate you so that they can most likely in the future replace you with cheaper labor."
2656,Southwest Airlines,My experience at SWA has been constant additions to my job duty without proper training nor pay increase.,2014-08-09,3.0,Customer Service Agent,"The best reason to work for SWA is the flexibility of hours. You can work as much or as little as you wish. Flight benefits, if you are lucky to find an open seat, and have the extra cash to travel.","Personal growth is extremely limited unless you are well liked by leadership and/or are willing to constantly relocate to different stations. The leadership within the stations are improperly trained, at times lazy and cannot think outside the box. Company values have drastically changed, once praised for having a unique personality and vision, now we must follow policy and procedure or but subjected to verbal and written warnings."

2674,Southwest Airlines,The best to place to work!,2014-06-18,5.0,Director,"Great people and benefits.  9.3% 401K match, 6.2% profit sharing contribution in 2013, minimal co-pay on health insurance, and attendance rewards program.  Anyone who has worked somewhere else and come to SWA understands the stark difference, and so often I see people leave for ""greener grass"" only to beg us to take them back.",I haven't found any cons to working for SWA. Perhaps because the planes are often full of customers it's a little difficult to fly for free.  How can you complain with industry leading pay and 42 consecutive years of profits!
2675,Southwest Airlines,Descending....,2014-06-13,3.0,Flight Attendant,Good pay and benefits....flexible schedule.,"Management has become a huge disappointment!!  It was better 10 years ago, but things have gotten worse over the years.  You have to constantly  watch your back, and feel like you're out flying on your own.  If you need help or advice you don't have the help of supervisors to back you up.  Usually because they don't have the knowledge (most never being flight attendants before) , or the caring heart to reach out and be there for you when you really need them.  Southwest used to be the LUV Airline....I don't find that to be true anymore.  So many angry, upset work groups, and it's only getting worse.  Very sad to see what SW has become in just the short time I've been here."

They don't care if a new employee is in a car accident, spouse has a heart attack, child in the hospital, if you aren't at work or late it is counted against you and you can lose your job no matter how great of an employee you were.

Salary is OK but below average.","Southwest Airlines is becoming Outsource Airlines, at least for the Technology area at headquarters. Leadership is poor and they are putting the final nails in the coffin of the SWA culture. They only pay lip service to supporting their employees.  Perks have disappeared rapidly over the late couple years.  They ask for feedback and when it is all negative, they inform you that they are telling you to do it and not asking (so why ask for feedback in the first place). They say they are moving to industry standards but only cherry pick the part of ""standards"" they want to enforce and ignore the other factors that go along with it that makes it work for other companies.  SWA is fast becoming an industry follower and not a leader.  The principals in the book about SWA, ""Nuts!"", is being thrown out the window and it's not for the better."

Not only do you and your family fly for free on SWA, you also get many other discounted travel options including free or very discounted flights on other airlines. The culture at SWA is the best among airlines, though this is starting to fade. Health benefits are great, and they offer a company match 401K, stock discounts, and profit sharing.","The odd hours were unbearable. Be prepared to work at any hour of the day, and any day of the year including weekends and holidays. The odd hours were not confined to bad weather situations either. There was always a customer service agent at work from the hours of 4am-1am each day, these were simply normal hours. Mandatory overtime is rampant, especially during busy times, which often means working 12 hour days instead of just 8, and often having to work on you days off. Aside from the hours, the whole nature of the job is often a negative experience. You are the person who directly needs to handle people who are upset about missed flights, or missing bags. Rarely is an encounter like this a pleasant one. Career advancement is limited in satellite cities."

I was only there 6 months, the 401k was great, pass benefits, and health benefits.",I read about backstabbing on here in some of the other reviews.  That is interesting because I worked there over 20 years ago and that was the case back then.  When you start out and you are the junior agent working a morning shift you had to stay if someone decided not to show up for work that day and it happened more than you would think that it would.  You stayed until they found a replacement.
2730,Southwest Airlines,Good and Bad experience on both ramp and inflight LAS/PHX/OAK,2013-12-05,3.0,Ramp Agent Then Flight Attendant,"Worked for SWA for 2 years. Loved the free flights and the pay was reasonable, the work kept me fit and I saw lots of the country. I'm also a private pilot and I love being around airplanes anyway. My husband and I flew to the UK twice in two months as we only  had to pay the taxes. ($75 each) The ability to fly anywhere (albeit space available) was the most valuable thing to me. I used it very often; might feel like lunch in Oakland or dinner in San Diego or go visit the zoo, it was like catching a bus. The opportunities to advance were certainly there. I moved from the ramp to Inflight (flight attendant) within 14 months. Pay went up dramatically, afforded more opportunities.","Bullies on the ramp and in the air, backstabbing, you could never really tell who was your friend. On the ramp I was physically assaulted by a work colleague, threatened by another and yet management chose to ignore it. Filed an IR each time and was told ""just stay out of his way"" Lots of dead wood, folks who shouldn't be there and don't want to work. Newbies get worked hard, put on gates with the undesirables and the mandatory overtime was awful. Cargo was also not treated well; ""Caution live fish"" or ""Fragile"" meant dump it off the baggage loader upside down. Inflight was better in certain  ways, but if you are stuck with the crew from hell, those three days are miserable. Also an FA can be away from home 4 nights out of each week, that was too much for me. Got tired of reheated hotel food, string cheese and ramen noodles. Late arrivals in New Hampshire in winter while waiting for the crew bus which was invariably late was never fun. But my main issue was the mistrust between employees. They say ""talk it out, don't write it up"" but watch out for your supposed best buddy. They might just be filing a report on you."

The people that work there are also extremely kind and are great people to see every day. They hold events weekly which really help boost company morale and company drive. Having the ability to travel to a new city every weekend is as good as it sounds and I would recommend this company for anyone who likes to travel around.,"It's in Dallas which is not a city I like so much. The congestion matched with the ridiculous heat make for a odd summer. Being from this east coast, I thought that I knew what traffic was. Dallas redefines that. However, the food there is quite good and there are 10000000 burger places to choose from."

Ability to move about the company (country). Growth options in many departments and fields from within. Excellent flight & travel benefits. HDQ host several career and developmental classes in Dallas. Could not imagine leaving this company. If you are very focused, determined and diligent, you can retire from here very well.","When in 'Agent positions' (Union positions), incentives for excellent work are lacking as normal for union positions. Granted, most all positions are very well compensated, but incentive to strive to be the best is low. 

Some of the people in Mid-level leadership could work on rewarding people on doing a great job instead of over analyzing every detail when something is incomplete. Mind you, that is not everyone. 

Everyone needs to step it up on all levels to aknowledge when people go above and beyond like so many do.

Honestly, there isn't really any CONs in my book."

They have gotten more into a mode of you have to provide they details to your boss, who has to convey it to their boss, who has to be able to answer all the tough questions for which they are not thoroughly prepared.

Asinine and silly responsibilities, as well as continual degradation from management staff.
Supervisor briefings daily, that resulted in threats from management on a near daily basis at my station. Watched a large number of colleagues get terminated to make room for the Airtran merger. When Southwest says they never lay off, they're being honest. They fully take advantage of non-Union employees however."
2772,Southwest Airlines,"Horrible, Hellish-Nightmare of an Experience with Southwest Airlines",2013-05-20,1.0,Customer Representative,"Great Health Benefits, Travel Benefits (standby only)","Schedule Changes monthly and is Seniority Based, Flight benefits are Standby and hard to come by. Most often you are bumped from flights if you don't travel in the AM, Management style is Micro-managing, Lots of senior employees BACK BITE, or run to management. Also, Union is of little help. Everything changes so frequently, and Company Barely train employees. When you start, you are trained over 10 percent of what you actually do, which is 90 percent of things. Management is over critical of your work. Company makes you feel they are DOING YOU A FAVOR, when they hire you because of the thousands of applicants that apply and are denied, plus the offering of possible free flights (which are STANDBY) and not guaranteed. Highly stressful environment. The ambulance always showed up weekly to wheel sick folks out of there. Company built a sick room for those sick. Most people around you were old and young sick individuals. Very mean Team leaders. Open door policy implemented, but you are MARKED if you use. Company tries too hard to PLEASE customers, which comes back to bite them. Now they change that, leading to droves of calls involving angry customers wanting free goodies, and always wanting to speak to a manager. Phone calls almost always involve a problem. When hired, company tried to ACT like everybody is so NICE and Positive.  Different story when you get hired. Negative atmosphere. Horrible 
experience! Salary is very low for all the work you do. People are paid more at 7-Eleven."

2774,Southwest Airlines,The luv is gone.,2013-05-05,1.0,Design Specialist,I cherish the wonderful friends I've made in the past. The true Southwest Airlines coworkers are the best.,"Recently, with the AirTran merger SWA employees are being forced to follow AirTran's culture, which is based on manipulation, intimidation, and fear. AirTran employees are assigned by their boss to spy on Southwest workers as to when they arrive, leave the office, and even length of time for bathroom breaks. Scare tactics are used by the boss to make Southwest employees feel their jobs are on the line everyday. Working overtime with no compensation is not only unappreciated, but questioned by management as if the employee is to blame. In other words, management will try to fire you no matter how hard or smart you work. You can be a superstar or hero at the office, but still lose your job for taking too much EARNED vacation time. It makes no sense. As someone else has mentioned, Southwest Airlines has never had any layoffs. However, what's hidden is the many number of great workers who have been fired, forced to retire, or forced to quit."

2785,Southwest Airlines,Incredible Morale,2013-03-19,4.0,Ops,I have never seen another workplace with more captivated people than at Southwest.  Everyone absolutely loves the company.,Office could use updating in terms of office space
2786,Southwest Airlines,SWA treats me like a person not a number,2013-03-18,5.0,Analyst,"Employee morale high, lots of employee social events, volunteering outside the company for a cause is encouraged.  Management very in tune to their employees overall.  Open door policy for managers, can contact them or meet with them no matter your level or status.  Management knows you by name which surprised me.  Allow volunteer meeting to happen during work hours.  Have deck parties every week for employees sponsored by a new department each week.  Big employee pep rally each Spring off campas include food and beverages.  Provide positive feedback to employees in the form of kick tails which are entered into a drawing each quarter for prizes.  For the size of the company the communication is great, they lay out where we are financially where most companies are hush hush.  They involve employees in making changes, if there is an issue within the company that needs resolved they will usually enlist ideas from employees as possible solutions.  
Career advancement in the company is good but for new employees it may take several years because during the interview process they do look at seniority of the applicants even interval positions.","Only thing I see since I have been there is when we brought Air Tran onboard some of their people were put in management positions but they did not have the SWA mentality.  So you had employees that had been managed in a certain style and it changed overnight in some cases with the new AT personnel.  AT is more stringent and follow a fine line.  Some do not understand the servants heart mentality and do not promote volunteering.  The only other issue I see is SWA i behind in technology, so computer sytems have trouble maintaining the amount of business we have.  They also have been growing and are trying to rebuild headquarters to sustain new people and AT people and have greatly reduced work space sizes because of it.  Work space can be very claustrophobic, lots of noise and foot traffic within work spaces even in areas that should be quiet.  Instead of trying to fit more people into smaller spaces they need to broaden their horizons and try to push for certain positions to be worked remotely.  There are many that could do that but then you would need the technology to sustain that."

2797,Southwest Airlines,It was a great place to work.,2013-01-02,4.0,,Family atmosphere and made lasting friendships.,Too many managers.   Managers need to listern to the agents.
2798,Southwest Airlines,Southwest...... a company on the way down.,2012-12-23,2.0,Supervisor,"I will say first and foremost the health/medical benefits are supreme. looking at the number of employees you can see why they get such a great deal. Having worked for other corporations the medical insurance with Southwest is very reasonably priced. 
I would say flight benefits....but it seems that every time you want to fly the flights fill up, If you like living out of a carry-on, can be flexible enough to change your travel plans and never really PLAN anything then the free flights are right up your alley. If you're like most folks who would at least like to reserve a hotel room in the city to which you are trying to fly.......prepare yourself to fly in the ""off season"". In that case be prepared for typhoons, hurricanes, and snow storms. 
I do however like the ability to fly non-revenue on other airlines, and at reduced rates internationally. There is something to be said for flying round trip from the USA to China for under $300. 
The pay - while the highest of the industry (so reported???) is still very dependant upon job and classification. I think they would do better to pay their lower and middle management a more competitive wage. The entry level pay seems low, but after a short time it increases rapidly.
If dressing up for holidays (and halloween) is your thing, you will love this company. They do like to get into the season...whatever the season may be. 
Most of the people you work with will become lifelong friends, there is an environment that fosters care for each other. You will need to work together to meet or exceed goals.","I have seen way to many people get promoted to positions that FAR exceed thier skills and/or abilities. This is one of my biggest problems with Southwest & AirTran. Its all in who you know. It seems hard work and dedication is often overlooked, to get promoted you need to be a drinking buddy or college frat brother. Southwest is an analog airline in a digital age. I worked for Airtran until we were purchased by Southwest. Airtran was a much more ""advanced"" company from an IT/computer standpoint. Southwest is still handing out pencils and sharpners to its supervisors. Its a very ""mother-may-I"" system. Exceptional work ethic will only get you more hours to ""prove"" yourself worthy, while you watch slackers get away with fraud and get promoted before you because of my previous statement. If you every want to move up past the supervisor level, you will need to move to Dallas. Thats the part they dont tell you. If moving from where you currently live is not an option for you, plan on being a career supervisor.
The touchy - feely positive employee atmosphere they talk about hides a very dark secret. Its only that way as long as you follow the plan (even if its wrong), as soon as you begin to think outside the box, or suggest ideas that actually make sense and work well in the industry and other large corporations you get treated very poorly, and all that warm and fuzzy goes away. You MUST drink the cool-aid to stay in good graces with upper management or face becoming an outsider. 
The unions - of which there are 11, while they may have thier place, be prepared to see people who make $20+ an hour and will not lift a finger to help thier co-workers, always get away with something and should have been fired years ago, every company has a few employees like this, but it seems Southwest breeds them! They are like a cancer on the organization. As such so much time is spent AND WASTED on issues that should be a non-issue for a company that has been in business for 40 years and now sits atop of the industry. 
Overtime....while we all like to work a little and make some extra cash, at some point it gets ludicris to force your staff to work mandatory overtime because of staffing and call-out issues. Everyone knows there is a problem but upper management will not force change to correct it. Its actually hard to get fired...unless you just dont come to work. Then if that happens, just call your shop steward and we'll see you back at work in a week. 
Instead of empowering the workforce to cross-train, and cross utilize, or even assist with mundane tasks they will hire someone to do one thing and only one thing. Example = if your job is to push this red button, dont touch the green one. Even if your ar qualified and have 20 years of experience pushing the green one, dont touch it. We will hire someone else to do it. From a supervisor standpoint, they create far to much ""busy work"". Instead of being able to actually supervise you will spend most of your day completeing mundane and meaningless ""audits"" with a pencil, remember its an analog airline in a digital age. They do not allow you to think, or trust you to think for yourself. You have to fill out an audit just to make sure there is nothing askew with certian area of the operation. Because you are not adept enough to correct the issues, you have to report it and have someone fly in from Dallas to tell you how to do it ""the Southwest way""."

Motivated, driven, and smart IT people will probably not last long as they will know better and get better external offers.  However average and even below average non-driven employees do well at SW.  IT mgt is poor to average.   
Another interesting IT trait at SW is that the industry methods don't apply; it's the SW way or no way.  They want to be like the industry, but aren't always willing to listen or change.
Firedrills on production outages are a constant norm.  Real root cause analysis and fixes are not correctly implemented.

Return customers are used to communicating with friendly, knowledgeable people when they call and do not start the interaction with negative expectation.","Call center leaders are constantly trying to get around the guidelines about evaluations and rules. It is almost always necessary to include a union rep when meeting with a team leader. They pretend ignorance of the union agreement and are encouraged to do so by call center management and leaders in Dallas. The result is an adversarial relationship with a ""leader"" who is supposedly there to encourage and train reps. The customers who call are often difficult and sometimes demeaning, so it is discouraging not to be supported by those we should be able to expect to be helpful. They add stress to our day instead of the opposite."

2854,Southwest Airlines,A thrilling opportunity!,2012-03-05,5.0,Ramp Agent,"The best reason bar none to work for this company is the people!

While the starting pay may not be the greatest, there is ample room to grow and the pay steps further along up the line are a nice incentive to put in the time.","As stated above, the starting rate for most entry level positions is rather low. Also, the sometimes hectic rotating schedule could be a turn off for those seeking a steady, regular hours type position. In my opinion, that is the nature of the industry, not necessarily a con against the company. YMMV"
