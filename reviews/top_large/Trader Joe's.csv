You'll probably make friends","-Experience may vary based on Captains and Mates. Company does not do enough to reprimand bad management, as such morale can be greatly affected.
-Some managers like to micromanage, managerial training is not sufficient to help them grow as leaders instead of task accomplishers
-Growth within the company is almost nonexistant. More managers get hired externally than promoted from within. Not enough stores opening for there to be a lot of spots for growth. Corporate HQ very small with few job opportunities. 
-Weekends can be mandatory
-No extra benefits for being a Section Leader (Manager)
-Stores are sometimes too small for the volume of business they are doing, goods are understocked at times and even then the refrigerator can be filled to the brim with back stock that can be unsafe to navigate."

The job is simple and I like how we rotate what position we are in every hour.,"Unequal pay, and can be taxing on the body. A male coworker who got hired after me told me he got hired making $2 more than me and we both had the same experience. He said he told our manager he wouldn’t except anything less than $18 and the manager went with that. In my interview the manager told me he starts everyone at $16 so that was pretty disappointing to hear. I also have had several very painful shoulder injuries since working here. It involves a lot of repetitive lifting especially if you open or close. Another flaw, at least in my store, there are no breaks besides your 30 if you work a 7-8 hour shift."

170,Trader Joe's,Company really doesn't care,2022-03-09,1.0,Crew Member,Mates and Captain MAY be cool if you're lucky and get a good location,"The company does a lot of smoke and mirrors, ""yeah we're cool we pay a competitive rate and lowered our health insurance hours."" Sure, you can work 28 hours a week to get health insurance, but that means you can't miss more than four days a week and if you do you're scrambling to make it up. How if you're working an internship? Or a second job and they don't provide health insurance? Or you can't afford out of pocket? There are so many conditions upon which the company's supposed generosity and kindness to crew completely fall apart. The pay is competitive, but is it adequate overall? How if you live in a city with an increasing cost of living? I live in Brooklyn, have worked there for four years and make 20/hr. Could that cover my living expenses? Of course, I need a new job obviously, but can I afford to work less to make more financial risks to find a better job with the rent being so high and needing health care? 

They also recently changed 401 k contributions and even Mates are upset. The company got rid of hazard pay, but we're still masks, and why are we wearing masks? Because there's a virus that's killed nearly 1 million people in this country alone. Even though there is a vaccine, people can still catch covid when vaccinated. The severity varies, but that's besides the point. It's still a HAZARD so we should still be getting hazard pay. And how if someone has family members who can't get vaccinated because of pre existing health conditions? They should just be doomed to dying by covid? It's not a hazard for us to potentially bring covid home to our FAMILIES??? I wonder how many crew members who lost family members because they brought it home and weren't aware before masks were implemented because there was a time in the pandemic where we didn't think masks worked, and stores were telling crew members to not wear masks or gloves to not scare the customers. Oh but the company says, ""no bureaucracy. every store makes its own rules."" That's awfully convienent, isn't it? The company doesn't have to take any responsibility then. Well, if the stores make their own rules, do they make their own rules about health insurance? Attendance? How long you have to work to still be considered an employee? Whether you can take a paid leave of absence? No? Then the company is bureaucratic. 

Captains will tell you the company can't afford to give everyone hazard pay. Really? A company that's worth billions of dollars owned by a family that's worth billions of dollars and keeps opening up stores and all the costs entailed with that all around the country can't afford to pay its workers more? Can't afford to increase the pay of veteran workers in conjunction with increased pay offers for new employees? Really? 1 millions seconds is 11.5 days. 1 billion seconds is 31.5 years. Really? They can't afford it? That's not true. It's a bold face lie. 

It's stuff like that and the company has this insane anti-union rhetoric where they'll say union dues are like hundreds of dollars a month. Are you kidding me? It's like twenty bucks. 

Also, this is just a wacky fact you can find easily on wikipedia, but the company is owned by Aldi's, who is owned by the Albrecht family, who were Nazis in WW2 and you know, it's funny. I once asked why there weren't ever any hannukah decorations in our store and my captain told me the company didn't want to recognize any religious holiday, despite there being obvious Christmas decorations. Huh, kinda weird yeah?

This is a company that LIES it lies to its crew, captains, and mates who without it the company wouldn't exist. But it lies on the preface that they know we are expendable. At the end of the day the negligence and passive cruelty is enacted on the fact that we are expendable and they know if we get fired, quiet, get seriously hurt, they can replace us.

The company prides itself on diversity by hiring black mates and captains. Ok, but the majority of your crew is black and brown people. And we've already discussed pay and health care make it difficult to pursue greater opportunities. The scholarship the company offers is meager. So if you put marginalized people in positions of power within the company but don't do anything to MEANINGFULLY improve the living conditions of your marginalized employees, do you really care? No. 

The PR team for this company is bullish and uses intentionally vague language like, ""our employees are diverse, pay is competitive, each store makes its own rules, our health insurance is great,"" and rely on the fact that journalists don't care enough to actually scrutinize what they're saying. Which is sad, because it doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination to see that this company believes in only one thing and that's the almighty dollar."

- Culturally and Identity responsible.

It's basically a Pass/Fail system and you can only receive the caped amount when it comes to compensation.
- If you let them, they will work you to the bone. If you have a driven work ethic, they will use that and never think twice about you burning out. Stay away if you are a ""Grinder"", you'd be better off with a job that rewards that work ethic.
- Most ppl say the benefits, but to be honest its, it's just a bit better then the next retail/grocery store. Does not live up to real world standards.
- The fake""corporate care""s and is your friend kool-aid you are expected to ingest and believe in. They have shown their colors by making record profits these past two years and still want to slowly take away the ""Great"" benefits and 401k matching, just to make even more money."

-Most customers are pretty nice, appreciate first-hand knowledge I share about product attributes
-Benefits are standard, and the 401-k is nice to have available.","-new rules mean there's a cap on how much you can earn, so if you do well enough to get a raise every 6 months during the review cycles, just know that eventually that will top out and you'll only get the review, no more $. Unless you want to become a mate.
-If you want to transfer, there is now a ""range"" which may result in a reduction to your current hourly rate. Moving from a high-rent area to a small suburb in another state may eliminate any wage gain you thought you might be getting moving to a location with a more affordable cost of living."

Out of the 7 mates (managers) that worked at my location, I can honestly say only one of them actually had integrity. There was zero professionalism, it was like a bunch of adults acting like they were in high school again. This company really needs to work on treating employees equally. The favoritism affected people's schedules, their duties during the day, and overall taking initiative for disciplinary action when it was needed. The managers catered to the employees who were with the company for the longest. Additionally managers hung out with employees outside of work which also just perpetuated the issues."

- Corporate decisions during the pandemic led to massive numbers of preventable, crew illness and some deaths
- CEO would rather nickle and dime the staff to make himself richer
- The company used to have a promote from within viewpoint, so now store level management is full of poorly educated white men who are complacent, lazy, and often sexist and racist. They are not trained as managers but act like tiny dictators. 
- Most stores have lost MANY of their mid ""career"" crew (the 3-7 year veterans) because the company pays new hires more. This will result in a long term deficit of people who were trained to care and work within the TJ system. The longer term veterans can't leave because while they feel trapped at a capped out wage, they feel like they can't do better."

386,Trader Joe's,Great to learn but not a forever job,2022-01-27,2.0,Assistant Manager,"You learn a lot about all aspects of the store
You strengthen your communication skills
You strengthen leadership skills 
Your day is busy and never the same
You learn to excel in customer service","Your experience and learning is dependent on if your captain likes you or your regional likes you. That can change quickly and without warning.
Demanding hours that are not flexible and not ideal for anyone with a family. 9 hour shifts that are in a waterfall without much flexibility. If you ask for flexibility it's marked against you as not working for the store needs.
Not a lot of opportunity to seek out professional development. You get two classes from TJ University and that's it. Seeking other development is looked down upon, especially if you ask for time off.
Promotions are made souly on if you are well liked by the captain and regional. I worked with great Mates who were never going to get a store just because the upper management didn't like them and crew didn't find them ""cool enough"".
Your review and promotions are heavily dependent in the crew reviews which becomes a popularity contest. If you have rules or boundaries and hold everyone accountable by them you'll get marked down from the crew. Some mates let things slide and some don't. This leads to inconsistencies among the management which can't be fixed. 
Most importantly, every mate gets told they are a shining star and will get their promotion but it's not true. It's a well hidden fact that some will never be promoted and there's no reason other than your just not liked enough. This in return causes a toxic environment among the management team. Everyone is looking out for their promotion and don't collaborate, share responsibility, or support each other.
Even though your management your required to work as a crew member for whatever the need is. Which in itself is a good idea to build morale and learn. However, that comes first before your management responsibilities and they don't allow overtime for catching up on those responsibilities. It's a damned if you do damnded if you don't scenario that you can't win.
You aren't allowed to be honest and tell crew when they're not performing and when they want promotions. You're never allowed to say ""you aren't being seen for a promtion"" because it's all a popularity game. There's no reason other than if you're liked by captain and regional for promotion to mate. It's hard to give hope to 90% when you know that it's not going to happen."

Honestly some of the the most hardworking, kindest people I've ever worked with.","Where do I start? I fell a long way down the ladder of holding this company in my highest esteem. I started six years ago and carried the core values in my wallet on a laminated card. I loved this company. I had a selfie with the ceo and sent the VP of operations a personalized coffee mug. When I left last November I've never felt so devalued. They transfer problems around - so if another manager sexually harasses someone - transferred. Many captains have been with the company forever and are problems but they keep them because it is too hard to fire people - transfer! During the pandemic I've never worked so hard and protected my crew and the customers. I put my life on the line for all of them - we struggled with chemical management- conflicting information from corporate about what sanitizers to use - meanwhile my crew got burns to their hands, using chemicals which were meant for surfaces rather than hands. We had to manage crazy maskless antivaxxers - one who I had to call the police 12! Times and corporate told me to ""just do a citizens arrest"" instead of me begging to get a restraining order, also the police were begging us to get a restraining order - but corporate wouldn't support that (the optics!). I finally had enough when a fellow manager got transferred to another store after the second time of being accused (and found guilty) of sexual harassment. He got to keep his pay and was demoted. He made more than me and it to be demoted - because it's just way too hard to fire someone. This company used to be full of integrity (number one core value) but they don't care about their employees - they care about the bottom line. $$$ and their image. Ask anyone who works there right now and they will confirm all of this."

Overall, it's fun to have the discretion to do whatever it takes to make the customer happy.","Raises and bonuses are based on reviews from staff that basically act as popularity contests not actual tests of management skills. Managers are afraid to rub staff the wrong way or question them due to fear of getting a bad review. If you like to hold a high performance standard and enforce the rules, you will definitely get a bad review. 

It is also stressful when there is up to 8 different mates with 8 different ways of managing. You get alot of ""well, so and so said I could"" or ""So and So never asks us to do that"" ""So and so lets me take extra breaks"" etc etc etc."

I got transferred when I was promoted to a smaller store. I won’t name the store as I don’t want to speak ill of it since crew and Mate team were great but the management was lead by ego.

Most did, but my second location didn't because management were mean and money hungry.","I worked at two different locations in the same city. At the first one, the mates and captains were kind, funny, chill, and amiable. At the second one, the mates and captain were awkward, fake, and rude. There's generally comraderie amongst the crew regardless of the mates and captains, but if yours were horrendous like mine were, they may make it so you can hardly talk to your coworkers without getting in trouble. My advice is to shop at the location you wish to work for and ask the crew that's ringing you up if this is a good location to work at; avoid asking older employees because they've most likely been there for 10-15 years and have no plans to move up or leave the company and are extremely loyal to people who genuinely just see them as work horses. Ask young people. The younger the better.

 We had our captain and mates bragging about sales during a PANDEMIC while we, the crew, were the ones interacting with customers, soothing their panic, trying to gently tell them to give us 6ft distance, and more. Like, of course sales were good, it's a grocery store operating during a pandemic where people are scared for their health, their lives, their jobs, and their futures. Not really the time to be gloating.

We also were told we couldn't wear GLOVES, let alone masks, until well into the pandemic. We were told we couldn't come in if we wanted to wear masks or gloves, and this is information you can look up. They also tried to suppress information about employees getting COVID until they couldn't anymore (AKA, until it was too obvious to ignore how many crew members were missing/out sick). 

Also, for women, watch out for male upper management who want to, uh, blur the lines between what's appropriate and what's inappropriate in work relationships."

546,Trader Joe's,Went from cool job to depressing and greedy and mismanaged,2022-01-05,1.0,Crew Member,Generally your coworkers are nice when they don’t have to compete for hours. Store discount and food is pretty good. Used to have decent benefits but have gone downhill and are more difficult to keep and receive.,"Trader Joe’s has taken a tumble the last few years and if you sit and read through many recent reviews on various sites you’ll see the same phrases repeated like bad management, favoritism, sexism and racism! All very true! Of course not all management across all stores can be bad but those who are more recently being promoted up the chain especially to captain seem to do so through that favoritism & sexism more and more! And once you are placed in a management position it’s hard to be fired, you can do no wrong no matter how many complaints they get! As long as these new captains cut labor cut insurance and keep hiring at starting wage keeping them $$$ rolling in nothing else matters. 

Some more proof of change and not for the better, five years ago if you walked into almost any Trader Joe’s (unless just opened?) and asked how long all the employees had been with the company it seemed everyone kept this job and many would say years! When I first started the majority had been with the store since opening or even before transferring from elsewhere which was a comforting feeling like you have something stable. They also put more energy and effort into training because hey it’s for the long haul. That is not the case today I dare you walk into any Trader Joe’s and ask employees, more and more are new hires mostly because the changes have become unbearable. 

Another reoccurring statement you hear is not getting paid for extra work which is incredibly true! You have section leaders and order writers that don’t have any benefits other than more work and possibly more stable hours but even that is in question. If your desire is to move up in the company then I supposed that is expected of you to try your hand at the orders, yet there are many I’ve seen that are great at their job so continue to be made/asked to be an order writer some that even do desire to move up in the company but hey back to that favoritism will never be promoted. There have been several times at my store recently it was difficult to find people to be order writers for this reason. And since you can’t force a crew member to take on an order they were hiring more newbies (while simultaneously cutting hours and claiming not enough work to go around??) just to write the orders which has led to some serious under and over ordering of products due to inexperience or lack of care.

Now COVIDWISE. The store briefly had hazard pay and we’re more lenient on absences due to sickness. Yet that’s all gone! All the while more crew are sick than ever and still coming to work even when ill because they can’t afford not to with the little hours they are getting not to mention trying to keep insurance since that’s a balancing act all on your own. They have taken down all plexiglass and all forms of covid precautions including not enforcing masks. Another thing that was bothersome early on in the pandemic Trader Joe’s was one of the last companies/ grocery stores who did anything about covid even though majority of employees were voicing concern. They seem like a more liberal and inclusive company but that is no longer true. Corporate corporate corporate is the new name of the game.

Another thing about management. There are some that are always gone! The benefits you get at the top in terms of paid time AR and more are very generous. At my store current captain is on “vacation” at least once a month for days or weeks at a time! And when you have newer mates they don’t want to make decisions or don’t feel comfortable a lot more falls through the cracks. I know majority of the mates are frustrated by this but are afraid to speak up and especially when making the schedule captain has final say and reviews the schedule so it’s hard to work with crew on any changes when the person who gives the okay is gone for 10 days at a time frequently! I don’t get how this works and is okay??

There’s so much more that could be said. But truth is if they don’t make some major changes soon nobody will recognize Trader Joe’s as the friendly great products great Custer service and great values small neighborhood community driven store. Even as a customer in my store or others the vibe the customer service and that special something that made shopping a unique fun time is gone. I know grocery stores and the service industry in general are not the most fun to be right now but go in to any of the 6 competing grocery stores down the road and I’m greeted with more smiles and better energy than any Trader Joe’s right now and that just makes me sad as it was a stand out working there. 

And to all those writing 5star reviews recently; I know you feel grateful to have a job and some security and it may be better than your last awful job but they are anti union anti change just like most in charge in this world today are feeding you just enough to stay “happy” or feel desired or accepted when in reality you don’t matter to them. I had a captain tell me and overhear say to others more than once “well sorry if that bothers you…sorry you think we should be helping more…sorry can’t give more hours…sorry I know it’s frustrating… but in the end I can always hire new people the company has a good reputation we will always find someone to do it some newbie to hire the company will always be fine no matter how many of you have issue. “

This mentality needs to go!"

- They allow a very flexible schedule with consistent hours and regular days off, are very understanding and generous with unpaid time off, and allow a moderate amount of paid time off. It is an amazing schedule for a retail job.
- It /can/ be stress free if you make it that way.","- There is a very strange dichotomy between shifts. Morning crew (4:30am-1pm) is extremely conservative. The evening crew (2-10PM) is mostly college kids and is much more liberal. I've had some problems with the morning crew being racist, misogynist, and creepy AF.
- Management can be apathetic. If you're a rigid person with high standards it can be difficult to accept how laid back they are. For example, I wrote the order for one section and on my days off they assigned people to the section that I had big problems with and I was unable to get them to change.
- Maybe this is a service industry thing but sexual misconduct and misogyny is rampant. In the year I've been there, multiple supervisors and crewmembers have been fired for sexual misconduct. I reported several incidents to the general manager and it was ignored because it turns out that he's a personal friend of the person I reported. Out of the ~30 female coworkers I'm friends with, every single one has complained of sexual harassment from other coworkers and customers.
- This is a very physical job. I've had to start physical therapy to deal with the back pain sustained from working here. Thankfully the benefits cover everything but the $20 copay."

642,Trader Joe's,In a league of their own,2021-12-09,5.0,Crew Member,You get a raise twice a year. Anywhere from .65c to 1.00 dollar as long as you meet expectations. The company understands the value of their employees which lends to a general feeling of happiness amongst crew members. Managers are very understanding an will work with your circumstances and make every effort to accommodate so that you are happy. Crew members are not micromanaged which lends to a sense of worth and pride.,I cant think of any cons. If you work hard and have a great attitude it will be recognized here. Any negative experience came at the hands of a rude customer and not internally.

645,Trader Joe's,Not worth it,2021-12-09,3.0,Materials Manager,"Trader Joe's has a very friendly atmosphere. The store I worked at was fast-paced but fun. The health insurance offered is better than what I've seen anywhere else, particularly the low cost of coverage for spouse/dependents.","The pay structure is rigid and outdated, and raises barely cover the rise of inflation (if they do at all). As a crew member, you are guaranteed $1.20-$1.50 raise per year unless you royally mess up. As a mate, even if you work extremely hard all year, it is extremely rare to get a $2 raise. The pay is simply not worth the extra stress and responsibilities that come with the position."

I'm no longer an employee and as a customer, I'm not greeted often and employees are engaged more in personal dialect between themselves rather than customer-focused. This is part of the reason I left. I used to love coming to work because it felt like family, and eventually it started to feel like just a job. This influence came directly from management and it was very clear their focus changed. Managers changed from acting like mentors to acting like a boss. I'm from California and remember when Trader Joe's was fun, and I used to feel like the company cared about me as a person. It's just not the same anymore."

725,Trader Joe's,Trader Joe's- Good as long as you don't take on too much responsibility,2021-11-20,3.0,Crew Member,"Flexibility, great benefits and overall as much responsibility as you'd like. Raises every 6 moths that are pretty easy to get as long as you're punctual and don't have any write ups. Store culture greatly depends on your region/captain management but in my experience TJs is pretty good at hiring cool, friendly people who make work enjoyable.
This is a great option for people who have other responsibilities. Once you've been hired and proven to be reliable, they're usually really accommodating with any schedule changes and time off requests as long as they're submitted prior to scheduling.","Roles with significantly more responsibility, skill and effort are not reflected in pay. So someone in charge of ordering for a section, directly contributing to store sales does not get paid more than someone who does the bare minimum. And in some cases, may even be getting paid less since Traders has a tendency to hire in new crew members at ""competitive rates"". 
So a 17 year old in high school who works a few days a weeks in some cases may get paid more an hour than someone who's been with the company for 5+ years and writes an order. This is dependent on region and captain, but something that has been an issue since I've started with the company.

The only real benefits of taking on order writing responsibilities is 1) part of the path if you're interested in be coming a mate 2) broaden your TJs skills to apply to better jobs 3) possibly strengthening your chances of qualifying for a yearly bonus that's a few hundred dollars (if you have a large order/are well liked)"

""Family atmosphere"" is great until it's not; many workers and managers pretend to care for each other but then turn on one another if work is interfered with even slightly. Concurrently, managers will claim to be understanding of whatever situations influence your work in the moment, then punish you for those same things when reviews come around. 
Additionally, that family does not maintain much stability: Captains rotate often, mates move often (many times because of the captain's preference), and crew transfer a lot as well, you can find yourself working with a whole new ""family"" every year. 
While there are many ways to rise within the company, there are also smaller ways to get bigger roles within the position you are at (ie writing the order for a section(s) in the store), however they do not increase your pay for taking on these roles; in short, it is very easy to find yourself overpaid and underworked in that job.
The pay makes it tolerable to a limit but they know how to push you far beyond whatever you thought that limit originally was."

The crew members there are the only thing that kept me with the company for 6 years. Literally, truly, and honestly.","I was subject to managers who were ultimately discriminatory to my disability, race, and gender. It took 2 weeks to put in my ADA accommodation requests because my captain went on vacation and then personally blamed me for not taking care of the papers I handed to her. Another manager would repeatedly push me, shove things out of my hand, or make things harder to reach. I had to ask him not to because of neuropathy pain MULTIPLE times until I had to bring it up to his manager.

I spent 8 months being harassed by a male customer and management only intervened when the same man followed two female customers all around the store AND THEN to their car. 

A coworker who sexually harassed me and SEVERAL other women at the Sammamish store was unable to be fired because ""the store is so small we decided to handle it internally...which led us to not have any paperwork."" Ultimately the harasser was transferred to another Trader Joe's where he was then FIRED by the manager there for sexually harassing female coworkers.

Dozens on dozens of unfiled incident reports. Customers who repeatedly come in to sexually harass us or say racist remarks are not banned from shopping since ""they never directed those words AT you"".

Mishandling of labor hours. Over the course of a year we'd be asked to come in hours later, take 45-90 minute lunches or more, and would often leave between 12am to 2am because of how poorly the staffing and labor hours were. Our closing shifts would start at 3pm and we'd stay well past 12am most nights.

At a sister store the management chose to WRITE UP a crew member for a no-call no-show. The same crew member who attempted suicide. My dear friend who tried to intervene in the obvious disgusting issue faced HORRIFIC retaliation to the point of panic attacks.

The company and especially the managers at store level have favorites and are very very open with the kind of communication they give off that reinforces this. A personal gift I gave one of the managers who did treat me with kindness at the Sammamish store ended up having the gift scribbled on with permanent marker and then thrown away by two different managers.

I would be reprimanded on the sales floor in front of customers and coworkers and was repeatedly gaslit of company policies I'd explain to customers with a specific manager. I would have to reconfirm with the manager above him that I was indeed correct and to continue what I was initially doing and what I was trained to what company policy stands.

Additionally MULTIPLE STORES had captains FAILING to adhere to ANY cleaning procedures. This left many crew members feeling left vulnerable and unfortunately with no company guidance many developed rashes due to misuse of cleaning products."

1275,Trader Joe's,Mate position/assistant manager,2021-07-26,3.0,Materials Manager,"Good benefits, fun community of people to work with. Good job if you can handle working what’s called a, “waterfall schedule” and are okay with never having weekend days off.","Lack of support for their mid-level management. Low wages and inexperienced leaders in a region that’s hemorrhaging leadership faster than they can fill. Crew will always take priority in wages and support, especially post covid-19. Exhausting schedule burns people out. Very little work life balance as a leader for this company."
1276,Trader Joe's,Good job to have when going to school.,2021-07-26,4.0,Section Leader,Treats their employees right. Cultivates a community atmosphere. Adjusts with my school hours.,Working on the weekends is a must.

-benefits and biannual pay raise 
-easy job that requires zero brain cells 
- you get multiple breaks, some even required 
-opportunity for growth","Although it seems like a fairly easy job, where you never get bored, you sure will get overwhelmed. If you’re an introvert or have social anxiety don’t even think about applying. The customers are extremely demanding (more than at a usual grocery store) because of the expectations that the company itself places on the employees. That being said, you will face rude customers, customers who will come and harass you on the job (yes, even sexually), and the managers (mates) will not care. The only thing they do care about is nagging you about bathroom breaks and hanging out with each other at “the bridge” so much that even they themselves get in trouble with the “captain”. Super draining job"

1280,Trader Joe's,Goal focused,2021-07-25,5.0,Crew Member,"Variety of activities, friendly co-workers and management and schedule is very flexible. Easy going dress code and the customers are typically very pleasant.","The possibility for growth is definitely there but you have to get lucky, be liked within the management role and have the captain of the store really push for you to get promoted. No real schedule for this to happen, as its usually sudden."

-Can work PT (minimum 28 hrs/wk) and maintain insurance eligibility
-401k with yearly 10% company contribution
-Scheduling and transfer flexibility pending good performance
-Work keeps you physically active and social. It's often stressful but preferable to soul-crushing, sedentary office work in a lot of ways
-If you work with the right group of people, it can be fun and you'll feel supported, like part of a team","-Typical corporate retail pitfalls: small but impactful number of rude, entitled, and clueless customers; catty store politics and co-workers drunk on tiny amounts of power; high turnover means good systems are rarely in place for long; etc.
-Decentralized leadership structure/lean staffing at store level means HR always keeps you at an arms length. Sometimes it's unclear who's in charge during uncertain times
-Corporate was slow to implement COVID safety measures and quick to phase them out, and quick to reprimand crew who spoke up. (Plus they sent an anti-union letter out to employees in the middle of the pandemic despite there being no formal threat--a sign of where their real intentions lie)
-Few opportunities for advancement, and the ones that are available are rarely attractive unless you have a clear path to becoming a store manager
-Culture/co-workers/customers vary *a lot* from store to store--best to do some investigating before applying
-Work can be physically demanding. If you sustain even a minor injury you may be forced to rely on limited STD"

1291,Trader Joe's,Fun Place If The Mates Are Good,2021-07-22,3.0,Crew Member,"I had some much fun working here until the pandemic hit. The only real issue I had was how the store handled sexual harassment - male crew members could hit on their female crew members as long as it was only mildly suggestive and get away with ""unprofessional behavior"". You basically had to physically touch someone to be considered sexual harassment, and they was definitely a gray area of making women uncomfortable and some mates looking the other way.",A manager got fired for sexual harassment a year into my TJs career - yikes.

Your crew (co-workers) are there to help you, and it is very easy to make lifelong friends. The camaraderie levels are high, and you will be able to laugh and feel at ease amongst your co-workers. There is also a discount on all of the delicious food that surrounds you, and in some states on the alcohol as well. The best part is that crew members are encouraged to be as well-versed on the products as possible, so expect frequent (and free) crew tastings when new products are released.","In my personal experience, Trader Joe's HR department does not handle internal cases of racism responsibly. Two of my fellow Black woman crew members were racially harassed by another, non-Black crew member, and when these incidents were reported, not only were no actions taken against the racist crew member, but the women were told to not speak of it. The racist crew member then received a raise. In another incident, a crew member was sexually harassed by a new crew member, and when she reported it to our Mates and Captain, they asked him if he did sexually harass her, and when he said no, they dropped the matter entirely. When my fellow crew member asked that she not be scheduled with him anymore, they agreed but continually scheduled her with him repeatedly. The matter was never resolved, never reported, and she felt unsafe and disregarded. When I approached my Captain and told him I needed to take one day on the weekends off (one of the store's busier days but not the busiest) for my mental and physical health, instead of compromising or accommodating my needs, my Captain told me that I needed to honor my initial availability, and that if I needed to take a day off, to consider ""moving on."" This was his not-so-kind way of saying that my needs were of no importance to him, and that I was disposable. Not only this, but his insistence that I needed to ""honor my initial availability"" went against their promise of flexible scheduling, and other crew members who were able to change their availability frequently. All of these matters could have been a result of my location's managers (some of who were the most supportive, kind, and reassuring humans I have ever met, others who were not)--but reports of racism, sexism, etc. that were perpetrated by crew members, mates, and Captains alike were repeatedly ignored by HR. While Trader Joe's crew are diverse, protection against marginalization is not a rule."

- One of the most enjoyable company cultures I've been in. The company gives a damn.
- They donate their food that's close to expiring instead of throwing it away, and it feels good doing that on your shift. 
- Our store let us (excluding register hour) have micro-breaks if we were feeling stressed where we can just cool down and grab a coffee for a bit. Self-care is important.
- Trader Joe's discount for all TJ stores :3 
- Customizable clothing colors and different shirt types. Able to actually express myself at work a lot more. (very long sleeved, sweater/etc)","- You may have to work nighttime shifts, though there can be some shift flexibility and they work with you.
- Still face the slow burnout of working a register but it was never PAINFUL like a lot of the other jobs I've had where they would literally make us upsell at the register.
- Can be great as a job and even a long-term job, but best to pick up a skilled trade as a full career."

Decent health, vision, and dental insurance

Sufficient Paid Time Off","Management is often callous and disorganized 

Corporate refused to take management and crew safety seriously during the start of the pandemic, and this is emblematic of the company's attitude towards those who work the ground floor.

1417,Trader Joe's,Amazing company,2021-06-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Better than any other grocery store. Everyone gets health benefits as long as you average 30 hrs a week. They also have a great 401k that they contribute to as well at the end of the year. They pay better than other retailers, by a lot! They usually give a lot of hours (from my experiences) though unless you are a mate you are technically classified as part time. Despite the part time classification, I typically work five, 8 hr shifts. This comes just short of 40 hrs a week once you subtract lunches, it’s pretty close to full time and good enough for me! Plenty of room for growth as well if you work hard and the culture is to be helpful and supportive of each other with little drama; I’ve found this to be true across both locations I’ve worked at.","Few and far between. The only con I can think of is that they do look for people who can work early mornings, late nights, and weekends (due to delivery schedules). Mid day, 9-5ish shifts are coveted but you can always use paid time off (which you accumulate as you work) to get a needed day/night off."

Your coworkers are more aptly described as fellow soldiers in the trenches, so there's a certain solidarity or at least understanding that such environments predictably create.","Bizarre yet transparent attitude towards workers organizing. This place does not care about you, but central to their brand identity is ""Universal Likeability"" -- Less of a con, and more to demystify; it's not all rainbows and heel clicking, in fact, it's the marketing campaign you're buying into, whether customer or employee. The nonstop way-above-grocery-average hustle borne of their corporate world envied retail business model keeps folk's heads down and concerned about what they're doing when they're off work. Any malaise or poor management is covered up by the grind. It's a boring vortex, but you signed up knowing it was a jobby-job to make ends meet. Good luck."
1485,Trader Joe's,"Not as great a company as others say, but it isn't all bad, and crew is generally friendly!",2021-06-09,3.0,Crew Member,"-Kind, mostly accepting, mostly friendly employees and managers
-Never really had any beef with the managers specifically although I've heard horror stories from other tj's locations
-Relaxed environment for the most part, just a lot of responsibilities to get done in short order - all day, every day","-Lots more cons than pros, speaking solely for my case

-I'm happy I quit a few years back, but in hindsight i should say that it wasn't as good as I thought it was when I first got hired, and it wasn't QUITE as bad as I thought it was before I quit and moved jobs

-Anxiety inducing amounts of shoppers at once most days, esp on weekends and other peak times

-Holidays are actual hell because they have so many seasonal products that customers can't find elsewhere - rude customers are always a thing in grocery stores, esp at Thanksgiving/all of December

-Sometimes crew members talk about other crew to mates, in my store about petty things, and since management is pretty good about trying their best to take care of employees interpersonally at least, the managers/other crew will essentially get more into your personal business than i find necessary (i.e. the ""We're a family, not just coworkers"" bull is rampant at Trader Joe's but not all stores or management are going to know how to facilitate that idea into reality)


-The environment is relaxed and they try to make things feel laid back, but y'all........ it's still a grocery store job

-Don't buy into the fact that one of the company values is ""No Beauracracy."" It's an absolute joke amongst long standing crew that TJ's is just as beauracratic as any other retail company whose main focus is making and saving money while saving face with the public, instead of mostly focusing on the people they employ

They (corporate/general managers/managers/etc) look after the company's dollar first and foremost. 

They did not/do not have a unified expectation across states and stores in terms of covid prevention and guidelines

Now (6/9/21) they are allowing vaxxed crew to go unmasked in stores during working hours, and have stopped turning maskless customers away at the door, regardless of their stated (but obviously not proven) vaccination status

They just dropped ""Thank you Pay"" which was the extra money on top of their hourlys that stuck around for a while during covid, and they also have changed rules regarding employee discounts and some things changed with benefits this year, but I am not privy to that info

Please proceed with caution, but even with all the negatives, I enjoyed parts of my time at the company, mostly thanks to peers/coworkers"

1593,Trader Joe's,A Great Place to Work,2021-05-12,5.0,Crew Member,"Trader Joe's is a fun, rewarding place to work. There's a good team atmosphere - everyone does everything, from receiving deliveries to ringing up customers to getting carts to stocking shelves. It's not the typical low-morale retail atmosphere, because you're expected to do excellent work, and you're rewarded for doing it. That means you're working with motivated people, which is a lot more fun.

The work itself is varied and interesting - you work every section of the store, though your schedule and the delivery schedule make a big difference to what you get most exposure to. I mostly did mornings, and that's when we received our wet (refrigerated) and frozen deliveries, so that's what I majored in. There's also a nice mix of people work and project work - you're doing customer service, but also working on getting sections stocked. I enjoyed doing early shifts (usually 5am-1pm or thereabouts), because it meant the first half of my day was focused on putting a section together, and then the second half was about making people happy. Trader Joe's is really customer focused, and the products are excellent, so you really do get to make people's days. That's always fun.

And the pay is good.","You usually need to be able to work very early, very late, or possibly both. You also need to be able to work in a fast-paced environment, especially around the holidays. It's physically demanding - be prepared to haul some pallets, lift heavy boxes, and load and unload full carts of groceries quickly while making pleasant chit-chat with the customer. All that takes a toll on your body. You also need to be able to handle extremely cold conditions if it's your turn to do a frozen pull - you'll be in that walk-in freezer for a while."

But it puts the wants of the individual customer over the well-being of the crew members, and while they definitely care about us, it is upsetting that our management seems to be expected to hold this line instead of being able to keep out anti maskers who put us at a greater risk for infection.

The manager’s are also very understanding and willing to work with you.,The only downside is adjusting to everything and memorizing certain things. Along with dealing with annoying customers just like any job.
1798,Trader Joe's,"Loving company that hires great people, Confusing Management Styles are the only true downfall.",2021-03-24,4.0,Signmaker,"If you love being active 100% of your day and don't mind putting in hard work, TJs is a fantastic work place.
-Caring Community
-Supportive Management
-Will work with you to meet needs in regards to transfers, scheduling, and any help you could ever ask of them.
-Sweet business model means eating great new interesting foods all the time for free and getting to turn others onto items that are so good are strange that they'll come back and hug you for the effort.","My store had 7 Mates (Supervisors basically) and 1 Captain (Store Manager). The mates alternated their schedules with our hour-block rotating schedules and no one mate is in charge of any one department. This leads to a lot of redundancy and a lot of ""who knows?"" As an employee I felt caught in a whirlwind at times, with one mate passing me and telling me to stock in the wine section, then once I start stocking my first box of wine a different mate will walk by and ask me to put the case I'm working on back in the back and just focus on fronting the section. This means I spent 10 minutes going to grab the case, bringing it to the floor, helping a customer, unboxing the wine, put one bottle on the shelf, then have to close the box, return to back, walk all the way back to the section, and then resume work. This happens multiple times an HOUR, 8 -10 hours DAILY, and you're looking at hundreds of times in a week sometimes. 

The good news: they seemed to be working on it and actively were seeking opinions, criticism on the structure, and looking for new ways to solve it. Of every job I've worked, they have been the most open to new ideas and improvements from each and every Crew member. 

So with all said and done, if you can be a good drone and pivot quickly, there are no cons. 
Even if that box of wine doesn't get stocked, you know at the end of the day that you are valued and did exactly what you were told. They never hesitate to let you know how important you are and that you're doing great work despite any confusion or wild holiday hours."

1815,Trader Joe's,My coworkers are like family,2021-03-20,5.0,Crew Member,"The reason why you always see happy Crew Members at Trader Joe's is attributed to several things. First of all, there is a multi-part interview process, which determines whether they are positive, hard-working, and customer-service driven. Second, we get awesome benefits for retail. Third, I have found management to be really supportive and they try hard to do right by us and the community. 

Crew Members are caring people, and we care for each other every day. Working in retail will bring any group of people closer, but when you have such kind people in that environment, they become family. I have met some of my very best friends through work. Every store is different, but I have been in three different ones and my experiences have been overwhelmingly positive. The Mates have always cared about me. Once I was having somewhat of a bad day and I thought I was doing a great job of covering it. One of the Mates noticed and asked if I was alright, then told me I was welcome to go home early if I needed to, which I deeply appreciated. I was perfectly capable of working, but they made it clear that my mental health mattered more to them than those last few hours of work. I have always felt seen and encouraged to speak up if I need anything at all. 

Being a somewhat shy and timid person at my core, I have become more confident, more disciplined, and more passionate about the joy of food and how it plays a large role in our lives. My customer service skills are really sharp, as they encourage you to see each customer and their needs. Many customers will not notice the things we do to take care of them, but it's alright because I have always felt taken care of by the Mates and Captain. Every day I am thanked by them for doing my job, and that makes a big difference in my motivation to come in each day and improve. I was recently ""bestowed"" with a section of my very own to keep up and order for, and I am having the time of my life.

I have never felt so close to my coworkers in any other job I've had. I have best friends of all ages, of all backgrounds, even all levels of education (we have some in high school as well as people with doctorates!) It would not be easy for me to leave, and the pandemic has only made us closer.","I recognize not everyone has had this positive experience that I have had, and my speaking out about the positives is not intended to invalidate those. I recognize that there are toxic people in every business environment, and American corporations are corrupt. Trader Joe's is no exception, and they have made mistakes in the way they run things. However, I believe they are a huge step in the right direction in comparison with their competitors. I think they try to do the right thing and are therefore pushed by their community to continue improving more than other corporations that show no interest in improving. Again, I think it's important to recognize the good they do in the context of the capitalist culture we exist in. Of course, this doesn't mean we shouldn't demand improvement; I think it just needs to be aimed at this American culture more than Trader Joe's. Just my two cents."

1969,Trader Joe's,Amazing Company,2021-02-16,5.0,Crew Member,"This is hands down the best company I've ever worked for. All managers are promoted from within and don't get to their positions without being hardworking, charismatic, amicable people. All my fellow crew members are uniquely interesting in their own right and overwhelmingly friendly, many are also quite accomplished and working at TJs as more or less a retirement gig. The pay is excellent as well, I was started at $16 an hour and they just raised our covid hazard pay to $4 an hour meaning I'm already making 20/hr plus full benefits working at a grocery store.

There's a reason Trader Joe's employees seem almost abnormally happy, it's because we are. This company treats us well and we do our best for it in return.",I sat here for ten minutes and couldn't think of a single thing.
1970,Trader Joe's,"Was great, became TOXIC! All depends on the captain.",2021-02-16,3.0,Crew Member,"They have great full benefits, raises twice a year, coworkers become your family, and if management is good, it’s the best company to work for.","I wish I listened to all the veterans who said “jump ship” when we heard we were getting this notoriously known, god-awful captain. Amazing employees transferred out by the dozens...mates were even super worried and nervous. When the new captain came, they changed everything in the store...from the layout (like thirty times), the signage (to bland and generic), the spirit ( everything that gave our backroom personality was thrown away), she got rid of the closer’s opportunity to purchase five items in five minutes at close, listening to one ear bud after close, literally every bit of happiness, enjoyment, and morale have been so crushed and removed, it’s sickening. It is literally day and night from what I happily loved two years ago. Everyone is bitter and it is such a shame one person can destroy something that was so wonderful and efficient, and a place where we all took such pride in our jobs and as a community. So sad."

Great Benefits","Hours can be long

1986,Trader Joe's,"Decent -good pay, health insurance, Toxic, profits-over respect and safety, anti-worker culture",2021-02-12,2.0,Crew Member,"-My coworkers are honestly great. Many of them. There are of course some awful people

-Pay is very good for retail, and as long as you do what is a very easy job, you get a raise twice a year

-Provided you qualify (30 hours average a week, working a minimum number months), you can get very good health insurance. Main reason I applied

-Casual attitude between workers (crew) and bosses (mates, captain)

-I do like many of my bosses interpersonally, despite them being awful managers and genuinely shady

-Sometimes, if you're lucky, mgmt will be flexible with your schedule","-Mgmt expects you to be an abuse sponge; when irate customers go off on you, you are blamed and suspected. This is especially bad during covid, when customers do not follow basic safety measures and take it personally when you ask them to cover their noses with masks, stand in designated safe areas, etc. I have been blamed for customers being extremely toxic in response to me asking them, politely, to follow safety guidelines, and after they go and yell at mgmt for ten minutes, mates/captain massage their widdle baby egos and actually reward them by giving them gift cards! No customer is seen as too unruly to be beyond treating like a special snowflake. In fact, the more toxic they get, the more mgmt will do everything they can to try and secure their continued business- and then tell you its your fault they kirked on you. Infuriating and degrading does not begin to describe how this makes me feel

-Company refuses to draw firm boundaries with customers violating safety measures. They even write it off with their creepy internal jargon, saying enforcing measures is ""anti-eloha"" (see: unfriendly). From the top down there is an unwillingness to confront problem customers and do everything possible to ensure everyone's safety during the pandemic. Children are allowed in without masks. Mates refuse to enforce proper mask wearing. Mgmt can punish you if you enforce safety guidelines in a way unreasonable customers find unfriendly (see: some people will inherently be offended by you asking them to do the bare minimum to protect both of you)

-Inconsistent communication from mgmt. You will hear a different think from each mate and your captain. Unclear if they are making it all up on the fly, incompetent at communicating, or both

-Mgmt are experts at paying lip service- they will tell you what you want to hear, but never take any meaningful action. They use this same gift for appeasement to deal with customers who are outrageously disrespectful to crew, and even them

-Very anti-union policies. I know of people at my store who have gotten fired for mentioning unions. Anti-union letters have been sent out. It is illegal to fire for organizing but this law is meaningless when unenforced, and trader joes is a billion dollar giant, crushing in the crib the chance of low income workers organizing actual power so they can truly advocate for themselves and have the leverage to truly control their workplace. Deeply, deeply immoral that tj's supports this, even if it is something most companies do in the anti-union reality of american politics

-Opaque, shady, and dishonest in communications about covid. Confirmed infections are sometimes hidden, manner of transmission is stated as being outside the store when it may well be in the store. Calculations are made to protect the company legally through omission or straight up not informing crew of infections, rather than be fully transparent"

Captains are aloof and only care about profit and what corporate is pressuring. The regional managers are downright oppressive. Sexual harassment is a running theme at every TJs I’ve worked at.

Most stores have a very tight knit group of closers/morning people, and there is a lot of playing favorites for both. While the core values of Trader Joes are great and if you get your foot in the door it can be an easy fun job, I've heard and noticed not every store carries that same basic value.

- Enough variety in the job to keep it interesting
- learn plenty of transferrable skills in customer service
- Ability to transfer to other stores anywhere in the country as long as company needs are met
- ladder is climbable, but it takes time","- Overwhelming feeling like you are a Cog in a machine, as nice as they want to make that machine looks (part of the reality in working in entry-level work in grocery or retail.) Particularly when not many customers are in the store and you feel like are wasting half the day moving stuff on the shelves around that other grocery store chains already have innovated around.
- During the pandemic, they were reluctant to enforce rules regarding customers wearing masks simply because they were afraid of customer violence, but a lack of thought was given to enforcement measures that are common at other high traffic facilities (i.e. basic staffed security to handle unruly or mentally unstable customers). This is extra embarrassing considering the store is located next to a popular heroin dealing and dosing spot for Portland's Homeless. This unfortunately unnecessarily risked the lives of employees, many of which who were elderly and had compromised immune systems KNOWN to management. Glass was not even in the store until April or May.
- A frustrating lack of motivation to update store technology to improve the customer experience that is already common practice at it's main competitor in the area, Whole Foods, which is located 1 block down from the Trader Joe's Location."

2704,Trader Joe's,"A solid, safe, dand friendly company to work for!",2020-07-09,5.0,Crew Member,"This is a quality company that does much to maintain its values of integrity to both customers and employees. The ""Mates"" (managers) and ""Captian"" (Head Managers) are consistently quality individuals who know how to do their job, communicate well with others and bring a wonderful attitude to the stores. 

I have worked at 4 different store locataions over an 8 year period. Except for the occasional ""people pleaser"" or ""power hungry"" managers -- which are very few and far between-- the whole of the crew desires to do a good job, make customers smile and create a welcoming community. 

The benefits that this company offers to even part-time employees, is incredible considering the current situation of our economy. Full dental, vision, and medical benefits, Paid time off, and regular performance reviews make this a solid and respectable company to work for.

A wonderfully flexible schedule! great for students and parents!","The job as a whole can be very tedious depending on the time of day that you work. This IS a grocery store so you will be doing, simple, remedial, and predictable tasks, day in and day out. The upside to these tasks is that you can generally do the type of work that you enjoy. You WONT get stuck in one area (say the ""meat department"") all day, every day. 

Just like any company, the reviews are... somewhat made up. You have to keep in mind that you dont just have one or two bosses to please, you have (depending on the store size) 8-10 bosses. Every single one of them has their own personalities, character and perspective. SO while you may do a realy good job in the opinion of one person, another may see only your flaws. Often, reviews all have the same comments as to ""how you can improve"". Basically to some degree, the bosses comments have to be made up and then put into an average score which becomes your review score. 

Either way, its pretty easy to get a ""full raise"". Just do a good job, be nice to customers and others. If you screw that up, the bosses will notice and they will tell you."

2722,Trader Joe's,Most Underrated Place to Work!,2020-06-23,5.0,Crew Member,Trader Joe's has a great foundation built around customer experience. Scheduling is super flexible and there are shifts that start as early as 5am and later shifts that end around 11pm. Right now we get a $0.75 raise every 6 months ($1.50/yr) which isn't bad for a grocery store. There's equal opportunity to grow within the company as well.,"There are usually 80+ employees for each store so not every crew member will have the best work ethic.

2726,Trader Joe's,"Awful, highly partial management",2020-06-19,1.0,Crew Member,Benefits are good and hours are Flexible,"It's a good place to shop as a customer but not if you're working here.
This company is not for people with aspirations or the capacity to do more. It's a menial job unless you're a store manager.  Those advertised values are just an advertisement. 

While I threw my back working here, I asked a mate for help and it was made a huge deal that I asked for help. I'm not making this up! Your work will have zero value if you fail to be a part of the group/s or you tried to ask for any help.

Mates - assistant managers encourage creating groups and protecting their interests- I was told this by a female mate who is part of the group.

I was threatened termination because I Iodge a complaint against their friends. Instead of following up on it, I was targeted. Written up with misleading, false accusations multiple times. There is no transparency in the company. The atmosphere is awful and unhappy.

Retaliatory behaviors by Mates such as writing up with made-up stuff, having their group gang up, denial of service, harassment by constant following in the store and in the backroom, actively encouraging their group to go against one person - I've had other crew members warn me about this

Dump the entire workload which is physical work, on a few people while their own group hangs out, chats, ignores customers, ignores lines at the register, makes food, take food home and so on

Overall, mates - assistant managers are a horror show here. Unless you're a part of their group or don't resist their behavior, you would do ok."

But, it's been a few years since I've worked there, so it's probably changed. In the past, it was more manageable, but my last year it was a bit rough. I was seasonal though, it seems like pay and scheduling is better for full-time employees."
2746,Trader Joe's,Incredible people and good pay,2020-05-27,5.0,Crew Member,Management is extremely understanding of personal issues and their kindness helps to promote hard work from their employees. The pay is better than comparable positions at most other grocery stores and the work environment is really enjoyable. There are also plenty of opportunities to get promoted.,The only real negative is the physically intense work lifting heavy items to prepare the store for opening and close. This should be expected at basically every grocery store job unless you are confined solely to the register. Trader Joe's rotates employees' responsibilities by the hour so that you do a little bit of everything. Managers are also often rotated between stores which can be a very sad experience for crew members because of the close relationship they develop with their employees.

I've been able to clock-in and work with my best friends for the last several years, no matter where I've transferred to. Hating your coworkers will not be a problem. Even if there are people you don't get along with, they feel like family. You'll be ushered into an accepting, caring, supportive work environment that carries over into your everyday life outside of the job and will always be grateful for it.","Because the company is still privately owned, each store is subject to be run slightly differently, and with relatively little pressure to conform to a national, or even regional standard. There's very little direct accountability for general managers, assistant managers, or regional managers who exhibit poor behavior. I have never seen genuine, long-term improvement come from upstream reviews. Store managers who've made life a living hell for their crew have gone on to open new stores virtually unscathed, hiring on entirely new crews who have no idea how poorly they're being treated compared to those working at other stores and have no experience with other store managers to compare with their current supervisor. You can transfer to a different store if you don't like your location's management style, but it can take upwards of weeks to months to secure a position in the area you're trying to work out of. Still a great company to work for, but when a bad apple slips through the cracks, it can take forever to get back to a joyful work experience."

Even if 6/7 managers think you're a hard worker, if the 1 manager who writes the schedule thinks you aren't, they'll cut your hours. One of their core values is ""no bureaucracy"", but that isn't really true. Management makes the decisions. Crew members are not involved. If a manager has been with the store for a long time, complaints against them won't be taken seriously. Small discount; you get a 10% discount on everything."

Along with harassment from a crew member. Trader Joe’s has a anti-harassment policy but these people are so sneaky. The company’s core values are a joke compared to the things that the mates and long time crew members do. I honestly wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there. Often times I’ve heard that it was the location I’ve worked at which was 779. Many other crew members explained to me that other Trader Joe’s are not like that at all.

2821,Trader Joe's,Don't believe the hype,2020-02-27,1.0,Crew Member,"Health insurance, Dental insurance, Grocery Discount, No education required","Poor management, Poor training, unfair treatment, not friendly to ADA workers, new workers get a higher starting pay then older workers by dollars an hour. It has created an environment where it seems Trader Joe's in general wants to increase their turn over and not keep older employees. I came from a much higher paying job with over 5 years experience in grocery and biology, then two years later new employees are being hired on with no experience for over two dollars more then I was started at. This company isn't as good as it seems, they pick favorites and never give good workers compliments. Certain workers get the option to do what they want while other workers are scheduled more time cleaning, and on registers, super visors aren't held responsible for the lack of respect they give their own workers. The complete and utter lack of training is appalling, new workers have no idea what they are doing, and it is the personal belief of the super vision and management that it falls to the crew members to do this not the people making more and setting the standards. Unless you are married or have children your schedule is the least prioritized and other people get better schedule times simply based on politics. The turn over at this store has become alarming, the new management seems to want to fire as many people as possible despite complete lack of respect. You can't work over 37.5 hours a week, and when its the summer your hours get reduced randomly, despite never calling in sick and constantly covering for other coworkers that always call in sick."

First month when I started I was threatened by an employee! My managers were obnoxious and they lacked manager skills as well emphatic skills! They crated some fake crew members puppets  in order to menage control over other employees! 


I worked for 647 Store in Old Town,  Alexandria!

I called out for my manager for braking the rules of the store as well I called out a crew member who lacked ethical values which were conflicting Trader Joe's values!

Captain got involved in supporting the manager of the store....

Working for trader joe's over all was a traumatic experience as well key people were quite fake which was terrible to be part of that store...

I am glad I am no longer part of that environment as they lack all types of skills!

Not kiss up and be their yes-man, which is how they want you to act and will be rude to you if you're not.  They asked if I could cover an extra shift once and I said I think so, but I'll have to check with my husband and get back to you later and they said that's fine. When I called and said that I couldn't due to him having our shared car at that time, they were very frustrated and accusatorial. Just overall rude and poor management.

As a part-time worker, you're only offered dental and vision versus regular health care. Though they say there's no bureaucracy and they want crew members to be themselves, they're now enforcing a strict dress code where you're not even allowed to wear the stickers they give out to kids, they're crazy about you clocking out exactly on time  (but of course you can clock in early) and, the captains and mates are given yearly bonuses that don't trickle down at all."

It's also a fun atmosphere.. the vast majority of the mates (managers) are fun and easy-going as well.  You have to bust your tail (it's not easy) but I can't ever remember a time where I felt stressed.  Benefits are very competitive (probably best in industry).  Supportive environment with shadowing of other crew members.  I never felt alone and had lots of support from existing management and crew.   Management usually flexible on time-off, as long as requested in advance.   Member discount.  Tastings of the food, even beer/wine.","Plan to work Sundays.

People - my coworkers have been some of my greatest and most understanding friends. They are in the same shoes as you are, so they get a lot of the things you go through in your life at TJ's.","Pay - new hires are paid more than employees that have been with the company for years. It's ridiculous. When minimum wage goes up, your current employees should get a bump - not just new hires.
Management - the mates and captains are hit-or-miss. A lot of times it seems like they weren't crew members for a long time, so they can't empathize with what their employees experience. Some of the managers are great! But I've seen good ones become controlling, or play favorites, or care WAY too much about their jobs. At the end of the day, it's a grocery store."

Super benefits. 
I learned a lot, I love how much they invest in product knowledge.
The customers are great. I know people gripe, but people love TJ’s so much and it can be really fun to talk about the products with them. 
You get to give away flowers to people and those small gestures can make their day. It’s awesome! 
GREAT products. I love this company for its products and values. 
You're encouraged to give your honest opinion to customers, even if you don't like a particular product. 
You get breaks and always are on the clock for a conversation with a manager or a tasting. 
The tastings rock. 
The general attitude is really good. I have some mixed feelings about my experience, but I still love this company overall.","Harder on women, boys’ club mentality among management. I remember the female manager often cut out of things. It was sad because she was cool. 
I was never given a warning then suddenly denied a raise at a review, was humiliated and disappointed with no opportunity to change the situation until it was already too late. Felt set up to fail without any chance to explain the miscommunications that led to their decision, most of which were very minor. 
Sometimes you feel like a human-robot built to stock and smile. 
Really weird about giving a sick day to see a doctor. I was sternly warned to get a note for doing it... once?! As an adult? Really? 
I was happier after I left. A lot happier. 
Hard on the back. Protect your back if you work here! 
Mentally difficult, you speak to customers all day and while it's often fun, it can also be draining. 
Best in a bad industry. 
The benefits are based on average hours so when that burnout strikes, and it will, you have to make tough choices. 
There’s a lot of people at the bottom so you find people spending many years without a promotion. I don’t recommend being one of them if you have any other talents."

3012,Trader Joe's,Corporate profits at the expense of employee safety.,2019-09-05,2.0,Crew,"Health insurance is good once you figure out how to navigate it (TJ's insurance provider will be changing in October 2019, so I can't speak to that coverage yet). 
Regularly scheduled raises. 
Consistent schedule if you've been at your store for a while.  
Store closed three days per year: Christmas Day, New Years Day, and Thanksgiving.","Safety is not enforced at the store level and not encouraged in any meaningful way by corporate. Crew works in unsafe conditions because it would be too expensive to repair them. The company consistently prioritizes keeping the store open for business over worker safety. Contests are held to see how long a store can go without any injury, which results in people not reporting their injuries. No action is taken to address safety concerns (unless you count vague speeches that we should act safely), so the same injuries keep happening. If people are injured on the job, employee must spend several days without pay, traveling to an understaffed and incompetent urgent care clinic to get cleared for work again. I have many coworkers who got injured while they did their best to work safely in a dangerous environment, and not one of them felt supported by the company (either in terms of physical safety or financial stability) at any point. An injury ends up serving as a warning to find a new job, before you sustain an injury that you can't recover from (like coworkers stuck on medical leave because TJ's isn't finding them treatment in a timely manner). Registers and shopping carts are designed in a way that maximizes employee strain and injury, but corporate doesn't think it's a problem because it encourages customers to spend more. Most employees have unreported injuries due to repetitive strain, and management's solution is a vague ""stretch throughout the day!""

Scheduled raises are not guaranteed. Corporate limits how much each store can pay in wages, which means employees are fighting against each other to see who will get a living wage. The company raise schedule can be changed at any time, as can the amount. I have seen the amount subtly decrease for everyone without notice (while still advertising the old amount to new hires). The frequency has decreased from what it used to be, but not in my time there. It feels like it's only a matter of time before they drop it to a yearly raise without increasing the amount.

Overtime used to be acceptable in reasonable circumstances, but now results in disciplinary action that can affect whether or not you get your raise - even if it's one minute over.

No holiday pay for holidays when the store is open. For the three holidays the store is closed, you lose your wages for that day. If you don't want to lose wages, you have to use your vacation/sick pay for a holiday that you might not even celebrate.

Vacation pay is sick pay, so people are forced to work ill if they want to take vacation. 

Discount is so negligible that customers think you're making a joke.

Food waste at a store level is massive. Maintaining the cold chain (keeping cold food cold, keeping frozen food frozen) is more of a wish than a habit.

Follows customer requests to a fault - if enough customers request a boycott of an ingredient, the store will validate unfounded claims by catering to them. If customers think an ingredient is dangerous, TJ's will pretend that it is, and will select less healthy, more expensive, more dangerous, more environmentally damaging options. Instead of educating, TJ's encourages and validates anti-science movements to collect short term profits at the expense of others."

Laid back but hard working: they don't micro manage or get anal about anything, they WANT you to have a good time at work.

This company promotes women, and doesn't tolerate sexual harassment in the store.

Working here taught me SO much about how to give really good customer service, which has helped me in my career a lot.","Physically demanding work that inevitably leads to injuries/pains, and if you're not on TJ's insurance (working part time) there's not a lot of help for that.  not many benefits for PT workers.

3038,Trader Joe's,Company Coasting on Reputation and Previously Progressive Policies,2019-08-22,2.0,Crew Member,The atmosphere is upbeat and I enjoyed the majority of my coworkers. Customers are generally in a good mood and treat you with more respect than other service industry jobs. TJs does a good job breaking up your tasks so you are not stuck doing the same mundane thing for an entire shift.,"While my experiences might be more a  testament to my local TJs (Overland Park, KS), I was extremely disappointed in my time at TJs. The wages are no longer competitive and I was consistently denied opportunities for pay raises. When I was hired I was under the impression that I would receive regular wage increases, however management is under no obligation to hand out raises and will only do so if you are in ""the top 10%"" of employees. During the last round of reviews at my store several hardworking and consistent employees were denied raises.

Furthermore, management seems to be coasting on the reputation of the company as an exciting and progressive work atmosphere rather than actually working to uphold this reputation. They demand a whole lot from their employees and give very little (if anything in return). In the year and a half I worked there I was denied two different vacation requests even though I submitted them well in advanced (over a month and a half). And when I had a family emergency the mates I spoke with were unemphatic and denied me opportunity to leave. 

Bottom line, if you are the type of person who can make it at TJs (you have a strong and energetic work ethic, and can consistently come to work with a glowing attitude) you will find other companies that will value your work more. At TJs you are not going to feel like you are good enough and will have to really fight to get, what should be basic and readily available, wage increases."
3039,Trader Joe's,Great Job for Students,2019-08-21,4.0,Crew Member,"- First of all, the pay is nice relative to the responsibility. In my region, we are given bi-annual reviews with the potential for raises after each review. Not sure how that compares to other locations, but its nice to know that as long as a crew member continues to perform well and meet expectations they can expect a decent pay increase each year.

- Second, I really, really like my fellow crew members. Again, this varies from location to location, but my TJ's store is close to a college which means we have a young and lively crew. I've made many lasting friendships during my time at TJ's.

- Third, given that we hire a lot of college aged crew members, the captain and mates at my store are all very considerate and accommodating of school schedules. It makes the school/work balance a little easier.

I know much of this info only seems relevant to my store in particular, and it is in some senses, but what I'm trying to convey is that the culture at each TJ's is slightly different and is molded by the community. So if you like a young working environment, look for a TJ's near a college or university. If you like something a little more mature, look for a TJ's in an established suburban community perhaps. The size and the culture of each TJ's scales and adapts to the community it serves (hence the ""neighborhood"" part of the TJ's tagline). From my experience, TJ's is not a cookie-cutter grocer like some other larger national chains.","- Every mate's management style is different which means every working day is slightly different. Some mates micro-manage. Others expect you to figure things out for yourself. If you like consistent structure you may find this to be an annoyance. 

- Communication between mates and crew is sometimes lacking which is frustrating."

With that level of respect its no surprise that everyone works hard is responsible and cares for both crew and customers.,"There isn't alot of motivation to move into management or become a section leader as there  are few financial incentives to take on so much more responsibility.

3158,Trader Joe's,Good Employer,2019-05-20,5.0,Crew Member/Sign Artist,"• Relatively flexible scheduling
• Most management is done at store level – high store autonomy
• For sign artists, creativity usually indulged and encouraged
• Regularly scheduled pay raises
• Knowledge of products highly encouraged – food & wine tastings!","• Pay raises are fixed amount set by corporate – no bonuses 
• High store autonomy can be a nightmare when poor store management is in place
• Store management is switched out occasionally, meaning you could never get too attached to a manager that you liked
• Hours and resources are devoted to the shift they are most needed, meaning competent workers sometimes have to take on more work, where mediocre workers are saddling less of the burden because more manpower is assigned to their shifts."

3166,Trader Joe's,needs improvement,2019-05-13,3.0,Mate,Great people work here.  The customers are really awesome too.  There is freedom to be artistic and influential.,"The mate hours are horrendous.  We have no flexibility and the turnaround time is 9-11 hours.  A lot of mates commute 45 min or more.  The worst part is understaffing.  We are expected to somehow provide exceptional service yet we don't have enough crew members to stock the shelves and ring customers up much less provide carry outs and actually HELMS(what's that-doesn't happen).  Store trucks come at 8 pm and we are supposed to get the load worked before 11 pm.  Here is what happens, the mates feel pressured to get it done so they work so fast that they break their backs, literally.  All of this and I earn less than a lot of crew members.  It's not worth it and I'm looking for another job."
3167,Trader Joe's,good for college students or if you need anything while you find something better,2019-05-10,3.0,Crew Member,"they have flexible schedules.  anywhere from 3 am to midnight. you can pick how many days and hours you want to work. the store i worked at had some great employees. find your clique and hang out after work. it was a high volume store which was good for me. the time goes by faster and with over 100 employees you didn't have to see the same 5 people all the time. the work is mainly breaking down deliveries, stocking shelves, cleaning, running register and trying to please picky customers. if you click with the manager you might have an opportunity to be promoted. of the 3 managers i worked for 2 were great. medical benefits if you average over 30 hours weekly. eligible for raises  every 6 months.  the company kicks in 10% of your annual pay into your 401k.","the company used to be more generous with their employees. they are cutting into all the benefits. they used to contribute 15% of your annual pay into your 401k. you used to get raises every 3 months. you would qualify for medical working 20 hours a week. they no longer allow employees to clock in overtime so as not to pay time and a half. trust me when i say the company is not hurting. the location i worked at alone made over a million dollars a week in sales. the company carries no debt like their competitors; no share holders to appease. it's a simple cash cow for the german family that bought it from the original ""joe"" while they slowly squeeze the employees.
if you are a hard worker the supervisors will lean harder on you to make up for the lazy employees. if you get hurt on the job you'll be sent to a quack that will give you meds and rush you back before you are totally healed. i saw this happen to a unfortunate number of hard working employees. if your manager doesn't like you they can deny you raises while they give the lazy butt kissers raises, sundays off, and promotions. i had one awful manager (out of the 3) who was a control freak, always over your shoulder, would play favorites, and would not give me my deserved raises using arbitrary excuses like needing to see more ""wow!"" He must have thought we were on Broadway instead of bagging groceries."

The opportunity to sample items, bake/make special breakfasts for the morning huddle and the commraderie that comes with working there. Additionally, I believe in their products and how they produce the groceries/products at such reasonable prices.","Staff - fellow coworkers would make the shifts uncomfortable. The company loves diversity and the unique, which is probably how I got the job there, however, some of the hired employees can make your work environment uncomfortable, aggressive, lazy, and the like. Management does not do a good job motivating employees and it is not easy to discuss issues with management because it is supposed to be a happy and fun environment."
3203,Trader Joe's,Amazing company to work for,2019-04-11,5.0,Crew Member,"This company really cares about the crewmembers. The training is extensive and you really do get to feeling like you’re part of a family. The work is not difficult but it is very physical. I have found this to be excellent for me because it gets me moving around. One of the best things I love about the job is that you never stay in one place very long. You might be at the register for an hour, and then your stocking shelves for an hour, and then you’re in the wine room for an hour. That keeps you from getting bored In one section. The pace is fast-moving. The benefits package is amazing, I think it’s the best benefits I’ve had at any job. The entire reason I came to work at Trader Joe’s was to provide insurance for my family and it’s been worth it.","The only cons I can think of, are during the downtimes in business such as January or August, getting the hours you want can be more challenging. If you’re willing to be flexible with your schedule and be open more hours and pick up shifts for other people you can still get the hours you want to easily."
3204,Trader Joe's,"Great people, difficult management",2019-04-11,3.0,Crew Member,The people you work with are what make the job worth it. Job security as the company sales are growing rapidly.,"The job is physically demanding and scheduling is difficult. There is no really growth opportunity here. With sales increasing rapidly, it seems as though management can't handle the busy/stressful times and takes it out on crew members (sales associate if you will). There is rarely positive feedback which is defeating when you work very hard to bring success to the overall goal. If you haven't been with the company long, good luck. They play favorites and it is difficult to get hard work noticed and appreciated."

--One must work like a dog for management to even consider granting you enough hours to qualify for health insurance; even then, it often is not granted.
--Not surprising for retail, dishonesty and favoritism is blatant and the order of the day among the management
--Again, not surprising for retail, the degree to which employees are expected to be debased on a daily basis by customers is completely out of step with the level of pay
--Essentially zero support from management with regard to abusive behavior toward employees on the part of customers; I've seen more than one person terminated as a result of fraudulent and spiteful calls to corporate.  Customers often simply lie just to get people fired--and it often works.
--Ridiculous expectations on the part of management; I've actually been present when people have been written up for not saying hello or not smiling when a member of management first arrives at work for the day.
--Promotions are mostly granted in accordance with favoritism or mysterious metrics that are never, and I mean never, explained.
--Health insurance is offered above a certain average number of hours, but this is often quite difficult to sustain, even for superb employees.  During every summertime lull in business, nearly everyone receiving health insurance through Trader Joe's is positively terrified of losing it.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is not truthful.
--Not by any stretch of the imagination a meritocracy.  Bizarrely, it is often the very worst employees, in terms of attendance, ethic, and willingness to work hard and learn new things, who are promoted."

3236,Trader Joe's,"Fun, Friendly Crew; But, compromising benefits and wage increases.",2019-03-18,3.0,Crew Member,"The company truly considers integrity and positivity when employing its staff, so you will generally enjoy who you work with. Free tastings and food samples are routinely given as a benefit for staff. There is an efficient order within each store, however, is it typical for each store to have a laid back vibe.","If you are late more than 15% of the time, you will NOT get a raise. I was told that I am one of the ""star""  top performing employees, but due to being late, I was not granted a raise, not even a smaller percentage of a raise. They are overly strict about this, which is not fair, nor does it reflect care and consideration for hard-working employees.  I was told by my store Captain that they literally can not give a raise to everyone, so they deliberately choose a fixed number of people who do not get a raise. Clearly, their more focused on numbers and not the individual. Additionally, I never received a warning or any helpful feedback prior to receiving my reviews."

3241,Trader Joe's,Straight Up Just a Great Job to Have,2019-03-12,5.0,Crew Member,"Wages and Benefits are amazing; your prescriptions are nominal or free and they offer spousal coverage.
You're always doing different things throughout your shift, so you never feel bogged down by one task.
Your managers (Mates) are going to be some of the most level-headed, chill people you will ever encounter.
The routine review cycle is great; they get to review you, and you get to review the Mates. This keeps things transparent and awesome.
Routine raises every 6 months. EVERY. 6 months. Unless you really do something bad!
None of the customers are rude--they love to shop at Trader Joes and they love to have your help.
Your coworkers are gonna be mixed bag, but for the most part, you will always find 2-3 people that are just ""your"" kind of people.
Free food, crew tastings and crew events all of the time! BBQ's, days at the park, etc.
They empower you to pick up an order and take charge of a portion of the store if that's what you'd like to do.","Initially, it's not great to be stuck in the 3PM-11PM shift--it's late, and you're tired.
Alternatively, it's not great to be in the 4AM-12PM shift--it's too damn early, and you're tired.
I feel like there has to be a better system than the entire load showing up at 4PM and then piece-meal breaking it down on the floor.
Why all Trader Joe's break rooms so tiny? Probably not universal!
Not loving the ""Trade Jose/Trader Ming"" kind of racial profiling on the package--should probably update that."

3248,Trader Joe's,Great place to work!,2019-03-05,5.0,Crew Member,"Great coworkers, positive atmosphere, and great pay and benefits (full medical, dental, and vision available if you accumulate over a certain number of hours each 6 months, averaging out to be over 30 hours/week). We also get a 10% discount off of everything we buy, free samples/snacks on a regular basis, free meals/tastings several times a year, and a $50 gift card each year. The mates and captain all get together each 6 months to create a review for each employee (with the potential for a raise). Additionally, we have opportunities to rate the mates and captain, so they have an added incentive to treat us fairly/be nice to us, as well. We are provided with pretty flexible scheduling, since we use an app that allows us, to some extent, to select our own availability for scheduling each week. When I started working there, I was a little apprehensive about requesting days off fairly often (due to my kids' busy schedules and activities); but the person who schedules told me that it is no problem at all. He said that they want us ""to have a good work/life balance."" How many employers say that - AND really mean it? They are very flexible. On a few occasions, I have even told them on a Thursday, for example, that I had tickets for an event on that upcoming Saturday, and that I would have trouble making it in for my 6 pm shift. I said that I could be sure to safely be there by 8 pm. They said, ""No problem. We'll just change the schedule and put you down for 8 pm."" I mean, they have told me that I work hard and don't abuse the system. But I am saying that if you are fair with them, they are genuinely more than fair with us. Also, they move us around a lot - meaning that we don't often have to work in one position for very long at a time. They try to not have us on the register for more than an hour or two at a time. This is helpful to our bodies and to our minds to not be so repetitive with one task for prolonged periods. I also love the kind of liberal, hippie atmosphere!","The work on the night crew is really quite strenuous - more than a lot of people would imagine. And we work till 2 am (or a little later). This is actually a pro for me, but I realize that it would be a con for a lot of people. Also, our store is extremely busy. So while we have customers in the store, it is non-stop. Also, when the customers leave and we are re-stocking the store, it is also fairly busy and non-stop. We do listen to music and chat a bit, but we have to stay pretty focused and keep it moving!"
3249,Trader Joe's,Busiest store in town!,2019-03-04,4.0,Crew Member,"I work at one of the busiest TJ locations in the midwest.  I chose TJ as a second job because I love the interesting products, and that I get to tap into my hospitality background to make memorable experiences for our customers.  Our store is a well oiled machine, with a genuinely caring Captain, and a bunch of hard working mates.  Some of these previous reviews make me sad, because our management team is wonderful and appreciative of the staffs work ethic.  I like that the job is physically demanding and that the Mates (and Captain!) often work along side of you. Like, they would never ask you to do something that they personally wouldn’t do.  I obviously don’t see this job from a Mates perspective though... and I don’t think I would do well with 4 am shifts since I am not a morning person.  Still, I love working at Trader Joe’s and hope to work for the corporate office someday!","Hard to find shift coverage because there’s is no good way to access the daily schedule and people phone numbers.  Ok starting pay.  Some of the shirts fit weird.... like the T-shirt’s are pretty short, and the arms on some (not all!) long sleeve shirts are dumb and baggy.  Others fit perfectly."

3252,Trader Joe's,TJ’s is AMAZING,2019-03-02,5.0,Crew Member,"This company has it dialed in and I’ve never worked for anyone who comes close.  From the Captain to the Crew Members, I was welcomed warmly and felt comfortable from Day 1.  Our Captain and Mates are all able to work hard and have fun at the same time, and they are happy to jump in and do the same tasks as crew members.  What I’m trying to say is there is a true team feel, that we are all in it together.  No sense of someone looking down on you or over your shoulder.  You are expected to perform at a high level, which is easy to do because you are constantly shown gratitude and respect from the Captain, Mates and fellow Crew members.  It’s a feeling of family there.","The work is very physical and can take some getting used to.  The great thing is that we rotate from one task to another, typically each hour, which helps.  But be prepared for an adjustment period and some sore muscles!  Not as many hours as I’d hoped for during the slower season, but if you can be flexible, there are usually shifts you can pick up."

I've always been incredibly proud to be a part of this company. If you're a foodie, you can't help but love the products, and it's always exciting to share that with the customers. It's what makes TJ's so fun! The company cares a great deal about taking care of their employees- we are well-compensated when it comes to pay, benefits and time off.","The hours can definitely be taxing as they vary from the start of the week to the end. Often times you feel spread thin, and many stores are chronically understaffed, which makes for a somewhat stressful work environment.  This is physically demanding job as well. Over time, your body will pay for the work you do each day. Though there are opportunities for advancement, they are very limited, and you must know that you will probably be committing yourself to a physically demanding job for your entire career."

Productivity is said to be the most valuable metric but reliable measurements are not taken. The perception of a ""metric"" is valued so rumor and heresay are an axe over the head of the unpopular worker."

If confront management about it they will deny everything. They will say you need to open up your availability to more nights and weekends but it's all lip service.

- Store structure was reoriented in a way that creates redundancies in operation 
- Some stores operate under a blue team or red team philosophy with no numbered register assignments and no clear-cut idea of primary versus non-primary status, we need structure at the registers to ensure everyone pulls their weight and to reduce uncertainty in assignment which creates inefficiency .
- Your tenured crew   built the business to the current level, and many work tirelessly for their stores, yet after working hard and earning a raise twice annually for years  many of your best employees face a wage-cap with no hope of progressing further.
- Promotions of any sort are very difficult to obtain if you start as a Crewmember, in my store less than a third of leadership was promoted from within.
- Relevant to above Merchant position was an excellent vehicle to reward and retain the most dedicated Crew."

For the most part, it seems like the brunt of that physicality is put upon the crew members. The company is also growing quickly leading to a sense of disconnect between crew members and management.

3313,Trader Joe's,TJs in NY is probably worse than in other regions,2019-01-20,3.0,Crew Member,Flexible schedule. Friendly crew members. Cute children coming in with their parents and seeing their eyes light up when you give them stickers. If you are competent and reliable supervisors will quickly begin to offer you opportunities to take on more responsibility.,"Poor communication between supervisors. Frequent sexual harassment from male customers, poor response from store captain about concerns. Captain refuses to ban a customer who is known to sexually harass every woman who works there. 
The opportunity to take on more responsibility in the store does not come with a raise in pay. Not very motivating. Someone who is a section leader is paid the same as a slacker person. 
TJ's makes a big deal about how often it promotes from within, however when crew members are promoted to mates, they only get a $1 raise (at least in NYC). The only real pay increase they get is from the increased hours, but they are doing so much more work and taking on so much stress. Meanwhile, when they hire mates from outside of TJ's, they are able to negotiate their salary and are able to start at a much higher salary, a salary that you would have to work at TJ's for at least a decade to be able to earn through raises. Most mates seem perpetually exhausted and stressed to the max. This is not the way to hold onto quality people! It is demoralizing to know that your peer is making more money than you ever will for the same exact job, when they actually start the job with much less knowledge of our products, customers, and culture. If you don't compensate them more fairly, they will leave as soon as they can to get another job with their new management experience. I am not a mate, but this strikes me as wildly unfair and also an unwise management policy. I have known many mates who stepped down and went back to being a crew member because the insane stress was not worth the measly increase in pay."

They bring quality and ethical practices to every aspect of the company! Also great benefits.","Unfortunately due to developing physical injuries I had to quit. Unknowingly I applied and got hired at one of the busiest stores in the U.S., a busy store in San Diego. And I started during their busy season and went from not working at all for several years to all of a sudden working 40 hours a week at a very physical job. So it did not last for me as I became injured right away. Pretty much every single minute of your 8-hour shift is on your feet, lots of heavy lifting, unloading the delivery trucks, stocking shelves of all heights (some very high where you need a step ladder, and some very low where you will be kneeling and bending down), ringing up customers (which is harder than it sounds), all of my friends would say what about just ringing up  items and being a cashier would that be better for you? Well imagine you are  1,000 times a day grabbing  a 3 lb  bottle of wine or a  gallon of milk,  or large bottle of olive oil,  or all the other heavy things that are in a grocery store. Over and over and over thousands of times a day and then once you pack up a bag you have to lift a possibly 20 lb. bag into their cart over and over and over all day long, so it's not as easy as it sounds, or collecting carts from the parking lot. Also, the shifts were all nights and weekends which is when all of my friends were free and all of the fun events happen, so my social life went from very fulfilling and satisfying before working at Trader Joe's to literally zero when I was working at Trader Joes. If you are newer you can expect to work ALL nights and weekends, as that is when most people shop and that's when they need their employees to be available. The lucky ones are the people that actually have day shifts and/or get to work just during the week, but you usually have to work several years at a location to get an ideal schedule. Unfortunatley I couldn't last that long due to my injuries."

The mates at my store seem to find any reason to act like you're not doing your job. Which will, in effect, cut your hours.

Management will lie to you and claim it's because of your availability, your performance, etc etc etc. Yet you'll see employees who've been hired less then 2 months getting full-time with the exact hours/availability you wanted to have BEFORE they even showed up.

Empty promises.

Told one thing, but another will happen. I was convinced by numerous mates and the captain that January is slow but February will pick up..... I'm still only scheduled 3 days a week.

They have this stupid bartering idea where if you don't have enough hours, well you just better wait for someone to offer up theirs because it ""will happen"". If it doesn't, well, you're out of luck."

3394,Trader Joe's,Crew member,2018-10-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"benefits, salary, free gym membership, amazing products, the definition of “Trader Joe’s culture “","Management: Huge amount of Favoritism amongst management and their crew members which leads to certain (many) employees feeling sense of entitlement and therefore feel it is ok treat others unkindly.  I don’t believe anyone is ever written up for the way they talk to each other. There is such an extreme negativity amongst many crew members, especially in the morning hours.  Lastly, there is absolutely ZERO positive reinforcement. You could really go above and beyond with excellent customer service or do an outstanding job on the product team... we may collectively all get a “thanks for a great morning” line but the people that go above and beyond or just does an excellent job at what they are doing  never get acknowledged... Especially when there are so many lazy workers.  Unfortunately,  this can be a rough store to work in... lots of employee issues. Inappropriate conduct between managers and Crew members are very common. Some managers are good friends with employees and have shared inappropriate and personal  information with them regarding other employees.. 

Management  just took down all the beautiful artwork our incredibly talented artist made by hand that made this store desirable and unique - a true “neighborhood “ store! It just lacks a lot of personality now. Such a shame... 

This used to be a nice place to work."

I’ve explained what I’m very good, but that doesn’t matter, I’m great at frozen, refrigerator section, cold pro, etc. but all I end up doing is the three things I don’t like, fresh, dry pro, and register all day. Working 8-1/2 hour shifts WILL burn you out. I’m failing some classes at school just because I’m working all from starting at 5 am or working midnight shift and doing very physical work, and you’ll feel sleep deprived. The other thing is that were always very low on employees, meaning theres always too much work and not enough people making the job very stressful. Last thing is that sometimes the wrong people get their own sections, making it much more difficult to work those sections because they over think everything. They add their own rules of how they want things done which takes up so much time. I think they do this partially to get that feeling their a manager. Last thing is that there is a very limited opportunity to become a mate and move up in the store unless your young or a minority."

- 10% discount on groceries
- The work is quite easy and you don't have to take on additional responsibility unless you want to, or if you want to become a mate (manager).

Working until 1 or 2 is rough if you are not a night owl.
- The paycheck pays the bills, but there isn't much you can do to make extra money because  overtime is rarely allowed and they only schedule 35 hours.
- The physical nature of the work means that it's very likely that if you stay for a long time you'll get an injury. The job consist mostly of stocking shelves and ringing up customers, both of which put repetitive strain on your body."

It's also a fast paced work environment where learning is strongly encouraged (which is good, because there is an endless amount to learn) and there is true sense of camaraderie in the crew. ""Everyone does everything"" there, meaning you will absolutely spend some time on the cash register and stocking shelves- but, the company is generous in allowing you time to pursue your areas of interest as well. If you like flowers, you can quickly work your way into ""owning"" the section. The infectious upbeat attitude of the store makes the time pass quickly and conversations with customers fun. (most of us love talking about food, and are quick about opening products for our customers to sample...)

They have great benefits and competitive pay,","We are told that ""the Captain runs the ship"",  that Trader Joe's is an ""inverted pyramid"", that the ""crew is empowered to make decisions"" (for merchandising, decorating, celebrating.... etc), BUT (this is only MY opinion) our RVP is  kind of a nitpicky authoritarian, who was hired in from a megacorporation a couple years ago, and walks all over our Captain. The RVP likes to give VERY subjective feedback to the store and ""suggests"" changes that don't serve to improve sales, but do a great job at irritating the crew.

There is not a lot of good energy between the store's crew/managers and the RVP.
Everyone who transfers from another region says they just don't understand what's going on here. It doesn't feel like Trader Joe's.

Hours can sometimes get cut during the slow seasons-  if you have placed yourself in a position where you are really valuable to the store (leading the demo team, writing a major order), your hours will be the last to get cut- but it can and does still happen.

A crew member who has been with the company for 15 years is not guaranteed hours and can suddenly risk losing their benefits due to something that is completely out of their control. 

The crew has been suggested that we COMPLETELY open our availability (... from 5AM to 11PM, 7 days a week) in order to avoid losing hours. Choose one: Sleep schedule -or- health insurance.

Also, I can't draw, but I do know for a fact that the company DISGUSTINGLY underpays some extremely talented and hardworking sign painters. Not every store hires exceptional talent, but the ones that do start at minimum wage. There is no ""sign artist"" position, but exceptional goals, responsibilities, and demands are placed upon those who choose to paint signs, which only seem to become greater each year- as the company puts out more flyers, more instagram, ads, more online newsletters, then demands that the store represent and support these with signage, while simultaneously pushing to trim away as much sign-making time as possible. The result? The signage has moved away from being fun and creative to... plain and monotonous, employing mostly buzz words and marketing jargon handed down from the higher-ups. It's sucking the life out of one of the most eclectic, exciting things about visiting Trader Joe's."

* reviews 2x/year, 4% raise possible. Cap is $25/hr.
* can transfer to another store (even in another state) and your current wage travels with you.
* standard benefits, including free gym membership (as long as you average 30hrs/week)
* dental coverage is marginal; I've had better in other companies.
* Mentorship means 6 Crew (about) are assigned to each of the Mates, so you have a go-to person for questions. I didn't find this out until my 4th month, from another Crew member.
* Teen program allows 17  year olds to work, with limitations; great first job, seeing how other people respond to you, learning to be proactive.
* Older workers don't seem to lift the heaviest boxes, but oftentimes seem to connect with customers on more things, have shared life experiences?
* 10% discount on anything.","A bit of a boot camp at times, discouraged from talking with co-workers during downtime, mistakes pointed out more often than praise is given. Learn by doing, no real training, so sometimes the same activity is described three different ways and you can't guess the ""best practices.""
* It appears managers are regularly, and sometimes suddenly, assigned to other stores, which must explain why there's no coaching nor feedback.
* Dayforce, the online HR system, could use improvement. It's not easily learned, and the mobile app lacks some basic features, but it works."

Nothing that you do is ever good enough, promotions are all but impossible, and the products are not even slightly compelling. Unless you want a job that's easy and surrounded by products for people who can't cook from scratch, stay far away from this company. If you went to college and expect to use your education towards tackling complex problems, writing reports, making presentations, and doing anything requiring more than a junior high level education, this is not the place for you. The lack of challenge makes this job stressful, and the general public will never take you as an equal because you won't be compensated fairly, most of your coworkers are morons, and you wear a t-shirt and plastic name tag to work."

3539,Trader Joe's,Pretty Good!,2018-06-17,4.0,Crew Member,"Let's be real, working retail can suck. However, Trader Joe's makes it actually fun and bearable. Keep in mind every store is different, but this was my experience working there for over a year:

Pros:
- The mates and my captain helped create a fun environment and truly cared about the crew
- It's a flexible job depending on your store needs and who does the scheduling
- The customer is not always right, and Trader Joe's understands this. They understand that employees are their number one customers and they treat them as such. I felt valued and like I had backup/support if there was a crazy customer complaint or something
- There was a huddle at each shift, where we could taste new products, try different pairings, and get updated on what's going on as far as the store and company news
- You get a 10% discount, which isn't that great, but it's better than nothing
- Medical insurance and dental insurance if you work so many hours
- 401K, semi-annual reviews (with raises), and annual bonuses
- Trader Joe's pays their employees a pretty fair wage. I worked in LA and they raised the minimum wage ahead of time to stay competitive and to retain good staff, which was really appreciated. I was considering quitting around that time simply because I couldn't afford the high cost of living, but after that I was able to stay.
- People stay here long-term. I had multiple co-workers (crew members at that) that had been with the company 10+ years. That says something about the company, especially with retail, which has a high turnover rate.
- They're good at hiring the right people. 
- The variety keeps the job interesting. I couldn't imagine being on register all day. I enjoyed being able to switch throughout the day.","- This is a hard job, physically and emotionally. You're on your feet all day, bending, twisting, and lifting. I was constantly sore, even though I'm young and workout, and lots of people had some nagging injuries. I couldn't imagine doing this for the long term. Plus, rude and difficult customers can get you down, but I would say the majority of customers are good people.
- Small carts (not sure if every store has them?) were awful. You had to bend down to unload the bottom rack and every crew member hated them.
- No employee wifi, which is... weird. Starbucks has free wifi. Why can't the break room? Not all of us have unlimited data... and I'm not even watching videos, just trying to read on my break.
- Customers take advantage of the return policy. I appreciate the policy, but it's too lenient in certain aspects. I watched customers buy flowers for an event and then return them the next day, or return them a month later after they're all dead. I also saw a lady break a bottle of wine and return it for full refund (wtf? how is that our fault?). 
- Mates get transferred. In some respects, I really like this, but it can also be hard since just as you're getting close to a mate, they get moved to another store. My store went through 5 mates in a year. But almost every mate is fantastic -- I only had an issue with one
- The annual survey for crew is great, but I wish it was semi-annual just like our reviews
- If you're on demo, god bless your heart. Some customers think it's their free dinner."

The crew are generally easy to work with. The captains are not micro managers,Cons the work is very taxing I know 2 mates with permanent back problems and others with knee and various work related injuries. If you have a background in management throw it out the window you are not a manager here you basically are a crew member that has keys. The schedule is terrible I have not had a weekend day off since working here. I close mostly which is 2 pm to 12am. So hanging out with my family is tough. As a Mate you have to tip toe around performance issues with the crew you have no power period. They can run to the captain and make you look bad or worst case scenario get you fired also how the crew rates you directly ties in to your annual raise. A lot of people say this is a great company to work for but I don’t agree I do not recommend

The company gives tons of lip service to awesome policies of rotating you every two hours so that you are never stuck on the same task for more than two hours at a time. This is ONLY lip service... You WILL be on the register for 6.5 to 7 hours straight and when you tell your manager you need a break and to be rotated you will be treated like a owned piece of Trader Joe's property and told NO. You will be promised great communication and no bureaucracy. You will experience horrible communication and excessive bureaucracy. You will be mistreated by management if you ask for them to back up their policies and don't expect to have their support when you end up injured. 
The manager I talked to when I was injured told me that there were no guarantee that they'd  accommodate me in any way. When i did go to the doctor, they sent me there without the proper form. When I drove back to get it I was begrudgingly given a blank unsigned form. I had to ask twice to have it filled out and signed. I was then handed a blank form with the managers signature and no other info filled out on the form. They DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU!

3558,Trader Joe's,Best place to work in Retail/Grocery,2018-05-24,4.0,Crew,"Amazing, quirky co-workers, pay & benefits, company culture and values",Attracts some bougie customers who don't understand the values and culture of Trader Joe's (this is NOT Whole Foods!). My particular Trader Joe's has sub-par culture and terrible management but this is not representative of the company as a whole. Also seems like any complaints to HR from my store have had backhanded results. Any employee who has complained so far has been fired for reasons that others would not have been fired.

3561,Trader Joe's,Great co-workers but unfair pay,2018-05-23,3.0,Crew Member,"- Co-Workers are always friendly and nice.
- Free food
- Generally a nicer batch of customers compared to other retail stores.","- Due to minimum wage increases, new hires that I was training (with less experience than me) were making more than me when I had worked there for two years. After asking management for a raise, they blew me off. The same happened with many of my other co-workers."
3562,Trader Joe's,I have to be honest...,2018-05-23,2.0,Crew Member,"The food items are good and you get a 10% discount. You are not stuck at a desk. You get to see the public, so if you're friendly this might be a pro. You will be active. If you have to go to an appointment, you can switch with someone.","You'll get hurt, and you'll get hurt again. Then, you'll get hurt again. Be willing to accept major wear and tear on your body due to extreme expectations compared to other grocery stores and not fully recovering physically for a nonprofessional hourly wage. Also, don't count on getting the medical insurance. They can keep your hours just below the required level and then you're out of luck, no matter what they said when they hired you. The corporate office has a remarkable lack of ethics. I never thought they would be like that when I was simply a loyal customer. I've seen too many coworkers treated badly to explain away what goes on there. I'm fortunate to be built like an ox and to be young enough to recover quickly, but I've seen older people forced to do things when they said they could not safely do them, and they've been seriously hurt. Something is seriously messed up about that.  Basically, the stronger and faster get treated better than the hardworking and generally fit people who are not quite as strong or who are older and therefore have to be more careful. Sometimes it seems like management is trying to use up and then force out anyone who is not an athlete even if they work hard and are great with customers. Use 'em up, and throw 'em out. I've talked to older workers at other stores, and not all stores do that. Some give the older workers the less physically taxing work, but, for some reason, my store and some other stores just beat the living daylights out of them. If my mom worked here, I'd offer to support her rather than having her here because it would be only a matter of time before she was badly injured and TJ's would be claiming that it never happened and calling her a liar, mocking her, with management statements to back them up. It's disgusting. I'll be looking for another job soon. I just can't stand to see what they do to people. Yes, some enjoy it, but they are supposed to consider everyone's physical abilities and set limits on what they ask people to do. There is enough variety of work that they could do that. They also don't discipline employees who violate privacy and behavior standards. If an employee is a favorite of management, they can treat you like crap, ask you questions employers are not supposed to ask, gossip about you with false statements, etc. with no ramifications. As far as I know, everyone seems to like me. I smile a lot, work hard, and never complain. But, I'm more than fed up with this place. Enough is enough. As for career opportunities, a few will make it to management and make decent money, but they could make as much elsewhere without risking injuries and having to lie to keep injured workers from getting temporary income and medical help when they need it. It's not worth it for most."

3575,Trader Joe's,Great Job,2018-05-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pays well, friendly staff, benefits, fast pace","Fluctuating hours, long days on your feet"
3576,Trader Joe's,Crew Member,2018-05-14,3.0,Crew Member,"Good Pay. I started at $14.00 an hour. They have a system that you can trade off your shift  with anyone and be off or pick up another shift. You post your shift electronically online through whats called DayForce HCM. As long as you do not go 30 days without working, you can basically give away your shift as long as someone else commits to your shift. You can change your shift hours every week as long as management approves it. There's at least close to 150 to 200 people working in each Trader Joe's location (look in the cons section for the reason for all those employees working in each location).  The customers are really nice, and so are the employees. The culture at Trader Joe's is a good one, everyone majority of the times are in a good mood. You can taste test any foods in the store, as Trader Joe's wants the employees to be able to tell customers how the products in the store taste. The hours they operate are 4:00 am to 12:00 midnight, sometimes they have overnight hours if the delivery trucks come in late. They have a system called WOW customers, meaning if you feel a customers needs extra attention, you an give them a product for FREE! You just have to make it's scanned in the register and given to management.","Get ready to work VERY HARD! I mean HARD LABOR!!! BACK BREAKING labor. You will be required to lift and carry very heavy  boxes , stock shelves, pack groceries at the register. The physical labor is non-stop, sweat factoring. I am not kidding you, you will be physically tired after your shift. Avoid at all cost to work any hours beyond 4 hours each shift. The 8 hour shifts are brutal. Trader Joe's offers no safety back brace or belts for it's employees which I find to be wrong. Twice a day if not three times a day huge trucks come to delivery products which employees have to removed from what's called a pallet. Look  up what a pallet is and that'S what you will have to unload every time the truck comes in.  Management are usually at the bridge (basically customer service center) and some goof around a lot there (if you don't believe me go to a Trader Joe's and observe for yourself). You also have to clean the restrooms. If you have back problems DO NOT work at Trader Joe's. If you have a good back, expect to get a back injury which when you do they will tell you that the job description stated lifting.  The reason they have so many people working in each location is to spread out the physical work, but that doesn't work because the turn over rate is very high. Once people realize theirs back are messing up, then quit. Those who stick around, work very little hours a month."

Our captain was really good at identifying people's strengths and allowing crew members to get creative at doing their jobs.

Super high energy environment and it can be draining at the end of a day, or after you've done it for years.

Some of my co-workers were particularly funny and interesting folks, because Joe's is a slightly off-mainstream brand and attracts that. Management was a mixed bag, but at their best some of the Mates were very good fun and down to earth.","Because pay is ok and benefits are good, there are a lot of workers here who think they've hit the jackpot in life by landing a grocery store job with health insurance. That can make for limited interations if you are someone who finds your life outside of the store more interesting. Some crew members were little too positive to be true which often made me feel like I was working at a grocery store in Stepford. The crew members who were the most interesting usually moved on to better things as soon as they could. 

As with any retail job, management favors the meek, the uncomplaining, and the workaholics. Negativity about the job is not tolerated, even though it is frequently justified. 

Store was often understaffed, even during recurring local events and holidays when data from previous years should have made it easy for management to not be caught out."

Performance reviews are incredibly subjective and can easily be biased based on people's personal opinions of you.  It's easy to be overlooked if you are not one of the ""popular"" people, even if  you perform better and are more consistent and reliable than other crew members."
3594,Trader Joe's,Charlottesville  store is phenominal,2018-04-26,5.0,Crew Member,"In my 25 years in retail management I have never been with a company or crew like the one in Charlottesville,VA. The manager and every one of his management team legitimately have fun while giving excellent customer service to customers, managing the store and all its deliveries, training to staff, and managing new hires like me. All this with a smile. This starts with the manager. He's been there for a few years and I cant say enough about him and what he has built as a team over there. He's phenomenal. The fact that he's been doing this a while and comes to work smiling, shaking hands and talking to the crew and customers after years of this, means that he knows his stuff thoroughly. It shows in morale. He knows how to manage and has built a team he is comfortable with, because they do what he does when he isn't there. You don't see that in retail very often, if ever.

The entire staff functions like a well oiled machine. They come running out of the woodwork like roaches when a bell rings, just to open a register or help a customer as fast as possible. They know their jobs and everyone does it well, willingly and with a great attitude. The moral there is unbelievable. All 90 of them get along great. I don't know when I have ever been around any company like that. They all treated me great as a new hire and taught me everything I needed to know. I can honestly call any one of them a friend.

I just left the Trader Joe's in Charlottesville, but it was only for personal reasons with changes to to my home life schedules with kids, etc. not for anything they did. I was there for a month and every day I was blown away by something about the company and /or the crew.",None I can think of.

If you haven’t been working here that long and someone else pretty much dedicated their career to be a long lasting Trader Joe’s employee then you’re SOL. Managers will speak down to you as if you are a nobody. They expect you to bow down whenever they “have a talk” with you. I hated the captain here. He was such a hypocrite and sexist. That’s probably why he got transferred within a 6 months period of being here. It’s so hard to get into this company. You need to know so many connections just to get a call for an interview. A 15 minute break doesn’t exist at the Encino Trader Joe’s. If you clock in too early for your break; you get a write up but it’s ok if you arrive late to work several times if you’re favorited by a certain manager. Trust, this place is a circus. On top of that, the customers are completely rude. This is ENCINO, all of the rich and famous come to this store. So not only are you being treated like you’re worthless but the CUSTOMERS demand you to wait on them hand and foot and if you don’t, guess who they go run and tell? The managers. So you don’t benefit in any situation here. This place will break you mentally. No matter how strong you may think you are. 
Not only that but they hire kids legit teenagers that are still in high school who can’t work that many hours, that can’t be cashiers, that’s can’t stock, etc because they are limited from school and/or their parents to do minimal work so that puts more hours with others who already work full time and have a family or go to school.

Oh, and you basically have to pretend you're happy all the time. The schedule is also very terrible. One day you'll work 9am-5pm to open the next day at 5am, which basically means 3 hours of free time before you have to go to sleep. So your entire sleep structure is destroyed.

Growing pains abound.,2018-01-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"TJ's has some of the best benefits without a union commitment for any retailer of its kind. It has a competitive base pay, a 401k that is second to none and, in my state, some of the best medical benefits at half the cost of your hard-earned pre-tax dollars as other places. The scheduling varies from store to store but, over the years, they have been very flexible and accommodating. The crew can vary as well but, it is usually a light-hearted atmosphere, and most stores are like a second family, taking care of one another in times of hardship. The best boss I ever had was at my first store. Not because he was trying to make friends but, because he was fair, and had a back bone. Although just one of the many bonuses to working at Trader Joe's, trying products, and having an opinion on them is pivotal, and each crew member is encouraged to open products (with approval) and taste them for themselves. There are frequent in-store, educational tastings, and even more frequently, free-for-alls in the breakroom. Trader Joe's used to hire only intelligent, qualified, common-sense laden individuals that promoted the store as a brand, and they have carried the stores for many years. I'm sure this is the case in more competitive areas. Many stores, with lower turnover rates, still have this core staff employed. I highly recommend this job for those completing college coursework, and plan on transitioning into the corporate world upon degree completion. The experience of dealing with a diverse clientele is really only second to the medical industry. People need medical care, and people have to eat!","As a TJ's ""long-timer"", I have watched this company grow from about 100 stores to over 400, and it is not immune to growing pains.  With a small home office on both the East and the West coast, the demand for corporate assistance and intervention, in stores, is beyond what the company is capable of handling. Many cases of misconduct go unresolved. Pay raises are fewer, and the internal feedback is limited to those times. Continued education and training do not exist at my current store. The size of your region will severely limit your options for upward mobility unless you are willing to move. Training for supervisory positions, unless adamantly monitored by you WITH your captain's support, do not move along at the speed at which they were intended to, and you can fall behind in training for years. Trader Joe's has gotten stale, and is now subscribing to the same corporate rigmarole as much of the Western workforce has."

A 10% discount on food
Every hour you are rotated on what you do, so it makes the work day go faster. 
Dental/Medical insurance, 401K, and even a gym membership","People often say the reason they want to apply is because it seems like a ""fun place to work."" Reading the reviews, you would think employees are in a cult and wear their TJ's shirts on their days off. But here is the reality: 
•	You are expected to lift. A lot. Heavy bags and boxes. And be on your feet for 8 hours. You are often sore at the end of the say because it is a workout physically and emotionally. 
•	You will have about 3 interviews for a position that pays slightly above minimum wage. 
•	While the few remaining veterans talk about how great the store used to be (25% discount, 4 raises/year, more of a 2nd family), no one talks about how great it is. 
•	What once may have been a team/family is now every person for themselves, with sycophants rewarded for their flirtation and flattery, while hard work goes unnoticed. A few people left in frustration for this very reason. 
•	Each store is different. One reviewer had managers that would accommodate your schedule for, say, finals. Our store was rigid when someone wanted to change from 12am to 11pm (""that's why we hired you"") while giving new hires the early shift that was requested.  
•	Tastings were once a regular thing so you could talk about the products, available for much of the day. Then they stopped doing them. They were brought back only because crew complained. Now we have them once a week (maybe) and can sample food - for about 5 minutes, eat-it-and-beat-it style.  Outside of that, we are expected to know a constantly changing stock by buying it ourselves from the low wages we make.  
•	The turnover is surprisingly high – as low as a few days, on average, about 3-6 months. I have even seen a number of mates leave in a very short time, and a couple that are already saying that they are looking for other work, because the scheduling leaves little work/life balance. 
•	Here is the kicker: At least 2 new hires have complained about the coldness of some of the staff. To this day, there are about 10% of the staff that have never even acknowledged me, made eye contact with me,  nor said hello to me once. I have no idea how they got a job here."

I was hired in as a manager 5 years ago.  They advertised a very clear management structure and a path to advancement.  Then shortly after I was hired, wiped it away.   The managers are now eligible for smaller raises than the crew are.  They restructure every year or to and it keeps getting worse.  This last restructure involved the mid level managers losing their overtime.  We all have families and mortgages and this was a huge pay cut.  Losing our OT also affects out year end 401k contribution as it is based on hours worked.  and speaking of, the company slashed the 401k contribution a few years ago.  They also used Obamacare as an excuse to cut insurance for many crew.  I have seen crew members have to go without health care because the store didn't schedule them enough hours to qualify."

3790,Trader Joe's,"Very good job with supportive management, but certainly has its challenges",2017-10-22,4.0,Crew Member,"Overall, I've been very happy with my position at TJ's primarily because of the fun, supportive work environment and really fair pay. I had no prior experience in retail, but they started me off at $11.50 an hour, which is certainly not bad for a grocery store! Every six months, there's an opportunity for a pay raise if you get positive reviews from management and don't have any negative write-ups. In turn, the managers' own pay also depends on our reviews of them, so it's a very fair system that, for the most part, I think encourages everyone to treat one another with respect. Also, the mates (our managers) feed us a lot of delicious food for free, partly so that we can expand our knowledge about the store's products, but also just because they're thoughtful and nice!

This is certainly a job that keeps you on your feet, which I actually quite like! I don't enjoy all of the roles that we have to play in the store, but,  I love that the job generally keeps me active and moving around all day. However, if you tire easily or can't do heavy lifting, then there are also quite a few positions around the store that aren't quite as labor-intensive. 

Scheduling can sometimes be an issue too, but there isn't necessarily much that can be done on that front. I am almost always on closing shifts and often work weekends since that's the time when the store needs workers the most, but this schedule makes it incredibly difficult to find time to hang out with friends. I do think the mates are understanding about this, though. They try to vary the schedule a bit so that you get some reasonable free time. And, of course, they're generally flexible and try to accommodate your preferences whenever possible.","At the end of the day, it's a retail job, so you get a lot of retail problems, most of which stem from difficult customers as opposed to the company itself. The difficulty of the clientele can vary widely from store to store, so the degree and frequency of difficulty may be relatively high or low depending on the location. I suppose the store where I work falls somewhere in the middle, though there are certainly days when it feels like all of the worst people decide to come in at once. 

There are two main things about the company itself that actually really bother me. First, I don't like how secretive it can be about the sources of its products. I just wish there were a bit more transparency with respect to information about suppliers. And second, I absolutely hate how much excessive packaging there is for so many of the products and the lack of a more comprehensive vision of environmental stewardship and sustainability. It is absolutely absurd that the store I work for, which has been around for over a decade, only just recently got a large recycling bin. And even with it there, I still see my own coworkers routinely throwing recyclable plastic bottles and aluminum cans into the trash. Additionally, I don't think that the cups at the demo station used to serve food and beverages are recyclable, nor am I certain that they are sustainably sourced. If at the very least the cups were made of a plant-based plastic, I wouldn't be quite so annoyed with how much they contribute to the waste the store produces. At least the cardboard and most of the plastic wrapping from packages is recycled, but the ideal would be to not even have so much of it in the first place by simply reducing the unnecessary quantities used to package the products."

-Micromanaging, usually done by the subpar managers or the people that don't do anything and think that's something
-One of the few places (or only) that makes you raise a paddle to call a customer to your register. On top of that you'll have some managers tell you to have your paddles up every 2-3 seconds (usually the ones who micro manage).

You may get more cashier time than other staff whether you like it or not. There's a certain amount of cronyism in the workplace. People can transfer to and from other stores and quite often the new crew will get section leader time ahead of you and the coveted dry produce time where you basically stand around and arrange fruit in pretty stacks over cleaning restrooms. Only one half hour lunch, no small government mandated breaks, I don't know why. I was at an extremely busy store where a small break would have been welcome."

Everyone always comments that the employees at TJ's seem so happy and that's because we are! We are treated with respect by the management and we get reviews every 6 months that (if you have a good work ethic and relationship with the other employees/mates) could result in a raise every 6 months.,Don't have too many cons..

Central managers are so secretive as to be paranoid.  Virtually no give and take with lower level employees.  Bad long-term employees are tolerated, even though they are rudderless, create no added value and are abusive.  Nepotism and connections with management are rampant.  Love you or hate you type of environment.  ""Merit"" aren't, you are backed into whatever statistic management wants for the overall company.  Career paths are not mentored or encouraged.

TJ's tries their best to hire people that get along with others on their team rather than hiring for skill. Tasks are rotated throughout the day so you don't get stuck working register for a whole shift. People at my store are great.","Worst thing is an unpredictable schedule. Even if you're hired full time, you'll lose hours once in a while when business is slow. Also medical concerns are not always taken seriously."
3919,Trader Joe's,Great place to work,2017-07-21,5.0,Crew Member,"YMMV, but the Trader Joes I work at has a receptive and capable management team, great co-workers, and a good customer base. This job is solid for people looking to start a career, or just in between stages in their life. solid benefits, decent starting pay, and a chance for a raise that generally falls between .55 and .75 cents every 6 months. I think the cap is around twenty-something dollars an hour as of 2017, but as you move up on the pay scale their expectations for your performance will rise, and that raise is not guaranteed.","It can be tough as a part timer to maintain any sort of consistent schedule and get the number of hours you'd like when you'd like, which true pretty much everywhere. There really aren't any glaring cons to working here."

3926,Trader Joe's,A Good Place to Work,2017-07-13,5.0,Crew Member,"You aren't doing the same job all day (you switch between cashiering, stocking, cleaning, etc.), pays well, benefits, laid-back work environment, discount, tasty free food, generally serves a more friendly and educated customer (compared to other grocery store chains I have worked in).","Weird hours - Depending on which store you work at you may not have a set weekly schedule or sometimes get ""turn-around"" shifts where you work until 11 PM and then have to be back at the store at 4/5 AM. It can be difficult to develop a consistent sleep schedule or make plans outside of work."
3927,Trader Joe's,No place is perfect but...,2017-07-12,4.0,Crew Member,"- The Pay: Starting pay is generally above minimum wage, especially in places like LA or NY. Every 6 mos there is an opportunity for a raise. Pay cap $25 and even then there is an annual cost of living raise. 
- Benefits: 401k, vision/dental for part time (+ medical for full time), paid vacation, ....
- Transfer Stores: NOT a guarantee but depending on availability, your performance its possible to move almost anywhere in the country and keep your pay/benefits, ect.  
- Growing Within the Company: Highly encouraged and easy to do. BA or higher means access to corporate jobs.
- Flexibility: Depending on your store management the job is very easy going regarding scheduling. Great for students.","It is what it is. The job as far as within the store is concerned does not change. It will always be the same products, the same customers, the same spills, ect. Nothing is perfect. Some managers are great. Some are not. Some stores are extremely high business others are the slowest in the company. 
If you have plan coming in its a great stepping stone to other things ie. finishing school, perusing other career options while still being able to pay the bills, ect. but unless you truly love working customer service (with all the difficulty that comes with it) this isn't a place to get comfortable at, which is easy to do.  Don't let money keep you doing something that isn't what you want out of life. Again the lettuce isn't changing."

Sometimes hard to get things done when management is loathe to actually manage staff.
3933,Trader Joe's,Pros and Cons to company structure,2017-07-05,4.0,Crew Member,"Everyone who works with Trader Joe's is original and brings an interesting background to the team. We have tastings and regularly open food to try for customers and ourselves. Unlike other grocery stores you won't be stuck on a register your entire shift (however if you're not a hard worker on the floor you may spend more time as a cashier than desired). There are two raises every year which are decent (often .65) and currently if you are exceptional you can receive a bonus every other review ($500 taxed comes out to $300). The insurance is why most people work at TJ's, you cannot beat it. We pay $45 (single independent) per paycheck for amazing benefits. Free gym, $20 copay, free therapy (Lord knows we need it). If you show initiative you could be a section leader and order product for the store and really make it your own. Scheduling is fairly flexible and the customers are typically very nice. The flat structure means that there is crew, mates, and a captain. Often you find that you have as much power as the mates which can be empowering to encourage your coworkers to do better or take initiative to start projects. They are encouraging if you want to be on the ""mate track"".","Many of the pros to TJ's are also their cons. The flat structure means that there is a lot of blurred lines as far as responsibilities. Often I feel that tasks and duties that are more suited for a mate can be put on the crew due to laziness or incompetence. Many mates are incompetent and the crew suffers as a result, most likely the hard workers who continue working while the lazy crew take it easy in the back. Because the company prides ""fairness"", you will receive the same bonus as everyone else (who gets their bonus). If you come to work on time with a smile you will receive the same bonus as the crew who order for sections, come in early for planned cleanings, and remerch your sections to increase sales. Additionally, being a section leader can be stressful when you do not get the support from your mates and crew that you need (again, you're not being paid extra to do this). It can be frustrating because you cannot change the fact that those crew that are capped out are making more than you and they do nothing. Communication is a huge issue, the mates do not communicate unless it's gossip.  If you want to move up, the captain may lead you on and say that your time is coming, but it's not. They just want you to continue to work hard and keep up morale. Going to the captain is hit or miss. It is the most effective way to express your concerns but you often will not know what came of it, if anything. Who stays and who goes it largely based on your popularity. If you and another crew did the same thing, but you are consistently cheerful and they can often be moody, they will be let go."

The early-morning shifts you're definitely going to work harder and it's a lot more physical. A lot of younger kids work at night because of school etc.
3956,Trader Joe's,Good opportunity in retail!,2017-06-09,4.0,Crew Member & Section Leader,"Working here was generally a great experience. The best part was that many of the fellow Crew Members and Mates are friendly. I consider 75% of the Crew I worked with as an extended family! Lifelong friends can be made here! The interaction is great, whether with peers or the friendly customers. The pay here is good for retail, though you will be working very hard for that money, as this job is very physically intensive. The rotation of tasks throughout the day is great, and the Management is usually flexible with your schedule; helpful if you're in school. Other perks include the annual bonus, 401k plan, 10% discount, and nearly endless amount of food samples.","Keep in mind that this is retail, so it can get very hectic on weekends, holidays, and right before snowstorms! This also means that while there are many nice customers, there are a share of them who are either angry, very demanding, inattentive, rude, oblivious, etc. This location is a very popular store, and the parking lot gets crazy at times. Be careful crossing the parking lot-Don't expect cars to stop, and many will be speeding. Cart runs are fun on comfortable, sunny days, but you will also have them on cold, hot, rainy, and snowy days, too. While they are generally flexible with your schedule, be prepared to work nearly every weekend. Sometimes, turnover is as little as 10 hours, meaning you can work until Midnight, and then have to come in 10 AM the next morning, for example. 

That being said, the pros outweigh the cons. You definitely have to be a good person who works hard; though also be mentally strong to deal with the challenges of retail. If you have those traits, you will do great here, and be rewarded by good pay for the sector, fun times at work, and lifelong friends."

After graduating college I knew I needed a backup job in case I couldn't find anything in my field right away. Working at Trader Joe's was a great choice while interning at the other places. 
For a retail job, the pay was very good. Employees get a 10% percent discount on their groceries. The work environment was fun and for the most part you get friendly customers.

Not too much diversity at the mate (management) or captain (supervisor) level but it is slowly improving
Customers are always right while workers lack representation and backing. There have been instances where customers were out of line and rude to workers but when brought to the attention of managers the matter wasn't addressed and workers were not represented. There wasn't even a huddle on how we can prevent these situations from happening. The good thing is that these situations do not happen often (but a fair amount of times where it should be addressed). Some managers and supervisors will address situations like this and back workers but that's if you are lucky to have one or two managers that have dignity and empathy, and are just as concerned about workers as they are customers and Trader Joes as a whole."

Be careful though, many of your coworker are lazy. Albeit, they are for the most part nice and funny if you buy into their thing. Generally though everyone is pretty laid back.

Met some lifelong best friends (very thankful for that).
Flexible hours (that is, if they schedule you at all).","I was with Trader Joe's long enough to know what it USED to be like. Believe me, I LOVED my job for a long time. However, in recent years, Trader Joe's has demonstrated that they no longer care about their employees or the core values that they traditionally have held in high regard. ""Integrity,"" ""No Bureaucracy,"" ""Neighborhood Grocery Store"" - PFFFT, what a joke.

Of course much of the employee experience stems from the specific management team you are currently working with, but the company as a whole has gone way downhill as far as showing appreciation for their hard-working crew. Benefits and bonuses have decreased, and the current review process is unfair and subjective (it is now an all-or-nothing system vs. the sliding scale it used to be).

Communication between managers and feedback towards crewmembers is essentially nonexistent. Therefore, you quite likely will have no idea what might come up in your biannual review (oftentimes things that aren't even true). It also all depends on if the mate writing your review likes you or not. And of course there is no way to ""prove"" that any falsities in your performance reviews are untrue. Management's word against yours. It is so heartbreaking and discouraging to be told you are doing a terrible job, without having ANY indication you were doing anything wrong the entire time you had been working so hard. They have absolutely no hesitations in throwing you under the bus.

When you try to talk with managers, they pretend to listen, but never attempt to make any actual changes. Many of them are clearly only looking out for themselves. On the same note, they have an employee satisfaction survey, but nothing ever comes of it and it is never spoken about again. I always wondered if they even bother reading them. Absolutely no accountability at any level.

Training is a joke. You can and will be reprimanded for doing something wrong when you were never actually taught the correct way.

Hours get cut for veteran crewmembers while they continue to hire rounds and rounds of new people. So disrespectful for people who worked for years to earn the shifts that they rely on to survive. Turnover used to be very minimal, but just continues to increase - that should really tell you something.

They used to foster the individuality and quirkiness of their crewmembers, which was part of the whole fun Trader Joe's shopping experience. Customers loved it. But it is clearly not what they are going for anymore, as many of the ""old timers"" (crew AND management) have been forced out to make way for the new way of doing things. Hopefully they will be able to find hoards of painfully boring yes-men to fit the profile they are apparently looking for now. They're going to have a lot of spots to fill from all of the veteran crewmembers they've alienated and pushed out of the company. Have fun working for a bunch of spineless corporate shills.

Favoritism and sexism also run rampant in every store I've worked in. Typical Boys Club in most stores.

The company has changed tremendously in the last 4-5 years, and unfortunately not for the better. As they continue to expand, it is clear that Trader Joe's is becoming just like every other miserable national grocery store chain.

This used to be a company that I could see myself working at forever, but after almost 8 years I left the company with a very unpleasant taste in my mouth. Such a shame when all I ever did was sing the highest praises of my job and the company I had been with for a large portion of my life. I took a large paycut in order to rid my life of an emotionally abusive employer and grueling physical labor, and to be honest, I'm making the same now as I was at Trader Joe's because at least I get 40 hours a week at my new job.

Please read the other critical reviews. I promise they are not lying. There are so many others, many of whom were with the company as long as or longer than me, who have had the same experiences I have."

Crew members do  a little of everything from artwork, stocking, writing orders, cashiering, and demo station. Great benefits!","Very, very physical job. I can't say it enough: it's an exhausting job. You will be breaking down pallets at an extremely quick pace lifting 50 pound bags of potatoes, four gallons of milk at a time, cases of jarred items, ect... You do it over and over and over again. You can never be quick enough, because there are always call outs and limited staff. They are always calling on you to do more with less people. Your hours are not guaranteed so during slow times of the year you might be only working 3-4 days a week. Mate positions are even more exhausting. They work 47.5 hours a week (10 hour days) on a waterfall schedule. They start the week closing the store staying until 11:00pm and then by the end of the week are opening the store starting at 4:00am. It's a rough life and very, very unfriendly for those who have a family. If you add a commute onto the 10 hour workday, you are gone all week without anytime for taking care of yourself or your family. And the earnings are not that great when you start out and your raise is only one time a year instead of two like the crew. The crew actually gets a bigger pay raise than the Mates. You can be making less than crew members, but have a ton more responsibilities. They really need to start this position hourly wage at the top of the crew range. TJ's has a very hard time filling these Mate positions, or keeping Mates due to the nature of the job and the pay structure. People burn out very quickly."

-You can get a raise every six months. It's not guaranteed but it's pretty easy to get...Just do the work and be nice. Don't call out or show up late all the time.
-Dental and vision available if you work 3-days a week. Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield if you work 30hrs a week. You can accomplish this by working 5 days a week or 4 days and picking up someone's shift every now and then. You can also work at night and stay late to reach the total number of hours required during a measurement period (every 6 months).
-Since there are over 200ppl working there you have a good chance of working the schedule you want. Some people like to work early in the morning. Others like to work at night. Many have 2nd jobs, school and/or other obligations. 
-The managers are really positive for the most part. When you start they're patient and understanding. As long as you do your best, they're cool.
-Your co-workers end up being like a family. There are some really good people you will work with. 
-TJs contributes the equivalent of 10% of what you earn to a 401K. You don't have to match it. They do it on their own. It just takes about 6yrs for it to fully vest.","-It can be really, REALLY exhausting. You'll be lifting heavy boxes of apples and jars of sauces and gallons of milk. Even the older crew in their 50s and 60s hustle. We work even harder when the store is closed. In the morning we’re scrambling to get ½ the store packed out before we open and at night we’re scrambling to get the other ½ of the store packed out so we’re not there after 2-3am.
-If you want to earn more money, the only way to do it is to become a manager (mate). Crew members train new people and write orders for different sections of the store but receive no extra pay for it. Writing an order is a huge responsibility as it can mean not enough kale or too much that ends up going bad. It can directly affect the profitability of the store.
-Speaking of mates, if you become one, you'll be expected to work 10hr shifts, will be bounced to different stores sometimes on a day’s notice and if you close at night, you'll have to stay until everything is completed no matter what.
-Which brings me to another issue. If you close at night and have to leave at your designated time, the mates won't say anything but will be disappointed if you don't finish your section...Why? Because they'll have to do it.
-There's no human resources department. At the Brooklyn (Court St.) Store there are around 250 employees working there. The general manager (Captain) is your judge and jury. He can fire you at will. Fortunately he's pretty cool so you won't have to worry about walking on eggshells. Still, it would be nice to have an HR Dept. for sexual harassment, racism and inappropriate behavior issues that arise.
-For example, there's a person who has been writing the order for one of our most important sections for years. He calls his female co-workers, “baby” and “honey” instead of their names and has a macho attitude when talking to the guys. He’s a hard worker but many people don’t like to work in this section because of it including me. The captain, however, has an incentive to keep him in that capacity; it’s better for the store’s profitability. The worker has no incentive to change his behavior. He’s been in that same position for years and the captain is supposed to change the roles of the employees so no one person does the same thing and nothing else. I don't want to say anything because I have no faith that my concerns will remain anonymous."

First I have been shopping at Trader Joe's since the 80's. So it goes without saying I love the products. BUT I love Trader Joe's strictly as a customer. Working for Trader Joe's is HELL!!!! SPARE YOURSELF DON'T DO IT. Management is the most disorganized, dumb people I have ever met in my life. I am not exaggerating! Management is comical. It is a complete monopoly. I worked there 4, close to 5 years. I was in line to get my promotion (finally) after years of hard work and dedication. First to arrive, last to leave,  you get where I'm going. I was a model employee, yet management decides to renege on my promotion offer. Why you ask? Well management, my ""Captain"" as we call them is a man and decided that he would promote a girl with only 1 year experience over me. Strictly because he liked the way she look. I'm talking sexual harassment level. The ""Captain"" is a creep. I am a man of standards, he is not. Just goes to show you how messed up Trader Joe's is by giving this guy the highest level ""in store job."" Management lies to cover things up, throws you under the bus, and overall works you like a dog! Also its just not a good place to work. Hiring process is a nightmare. Seriously they act like there the FBI, get real it'a a GROCERY STORE. Why the need for so many interviews (5 in total). Just ridiculous, it happened to me and my colleagues. Just my experience with the Palmdale Trader Joe's. AGAIN love the store as a customer, but despise it as a employee. Oh well I put in my 2 weeks notice and jumped ship to a different job.

If you aren't fun and personable, then don't apply cause you will not get hired, or the crew will eat you alive.","Physically demanding and exhausting. Most people I have worked with have had a lot of work related injuries which led to surgeries. Night shifts can be rough, but with a good crew, they can help the time fly by. Managers can be frustrating to work with, especially the ones who micro manage. A lot of them don't seem to care about the crew and they just want the work done. But they also have a lot of pressure to do well. If you become a manager ( a mate) then be prepared not to have a life outside of work. It's nearly impossible to get fired there, but if they don't like you, they will make work a living hell for you. To the point where you quit or do something to get fired. Also be prepared to deal with a huge variety of customers. Some of them are great, and I have made a few friends. But other shoppers can be cruel and mean, and really brings the moral down. Each store has it pros and cons, it really just depends where you live. Also, since the pay is really good, a lot of people are stuck there. Most people started working there in college, but realized that they make more money there then they would at a job in there degree field. So just be careful if you don't want this to be your life long career."

Sure, they pay more than most manual labor jobs ($13) but you are doing $20 an hour work for it.  Your shifts and days of the week are constantly changing and can range from 5am to 12 am (although they do ask for some parameters from you in the beginning) and definitely weekends.   
     You empty the shopping carts, bag up the items and lift all the bags back into the carts.  That alone is different than any other supermarket.  But, in addition, you also have to stock the shelves (which can entail lifting really heavy boxes) at a pretty fast pace and go out in all types of weather to gather shopping carts.  It is A LOT.  You do all of this every day as you are constantly moving every hour or two to a different area .   
     There are about 5 ‘mates’ with the Hawaiian shirts on any one shift with about 20-30 ‘crew’.  So, the ratio is about 1/5:  almost like day care (apt analogy).   So, as you move from place to place, a mate is there to check you in and basically watch you.  And, they have a lot to say to pick at your performance.  So, if you like a job with absolutely no independence and love being micro-managed, this is the place for you.
     And, did I mention medical?  Their website alludes to the fact you can get medical while only working 28 hrs/ wk.  I was clear to mention at my interview that I would like to qualify.  Thinking back, I should have known that that was a pipe dream as no one even acknowledged that that was a possibility.  It would be easy to attain during the holidays (before you are eligible) when I was scheduled for 38 hrs/wk. However, after the holiday rush, I am sure that is why I was let go while they retained most of the other seasonals, none of whom wanted medical coverage.  Why pay out for medical when they can keep a high school kid?   
     So, don’t believe all their California, kaisen, touchy-feely nonsense.  That only has to do with how you treat the customers, not how they treat employees.   They are a corporation, just like FedEX, and watch their bottom line just as ruthlessly.   Am I bitter, you bet.  I quit another job hoping to get medical, worked like a dog and their reason for not retaining me was ‘we are going in a different direction’.  Even when I asked for clarification, they repeated that phrase, which doesn’t even seem to apply in this situation.   So even though glassdoor says it is a great place to work, I didn’t drink the kool-aid and am offering a more realistic perspective."

Benefits are great!,"The hardest part of being a Mate is the roller coaster ride regarding your schedule. It's nearly impossible to have a consistent schedule which makes it difficult for work/life balance. After being with the company nearly 9 years I'm beginning to feel very burnt out on all levels: mentally, emotionally, physically. I am not a parent yet, but would like to be someday.

4107,Trader Joe's,Crew member,2017-02-04,4.0,F/T Crew Member,The best managers I have ever worked for. Enjoyed working with fellow employees and helping customers. Fast-paced environment so shifts go by quickly.,The pay is low for the labor intensity of being a crew member. Quite a bit of repetitive work so can wear on your body.
4108,Trader Joe's,Would Recommend!,2017-02-01,4.0,Section Leader,"Positive energy, variety in tasks, transparency between management/staff. General low-stress work environment -- you go, you work, you smile, you chat with customers, you go home. Hard to be bored or lonely there. Management worked to accommodate everyone's scheduling needs as much as possible. They provided plenty of skills-learning opportunities, such as section leadership and demonstration giving. Some of the mates were amazing and made you want to work your butt off for them. The customer base is lovely and getting to know regulars and watch their kids grow up is pretty sweet.","They do not pay extra for section leadership (although being a section leader may incentivize them to give you a general raise.) Some of the mates were not great (micro-managing, passive-aggression, short-tempered.) They expect a high level of engagement/prioritization from all their employees, despite the fact that they know that many of their employees are working 3 jobs, parents, students, etc. They had different standards for different employees (re: if a top employee was having an off day, they'd get a lot more flack than a poorer employee usually gets.) Their starting wages were fairly arbitrary and uneven, it just depended on who happened to hire you, which is frustrating. They would often start you at a pretty low salary."
4109,Trader Joe's,Former Crew Member,2017-02-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice team members and company culture,"There was a little bit of favoritism, but not too bad."
4110,Trader Joe's,CREW MEMBER,2017-02-01,4.0,Crew Member,"Crew members are considered part-time, that being said I work 37.5 hours a week on average and have a regular schedule with two days off in a row during the week. I work Sat. & Sun.the health insurance is extremely affordable if you maintain 30 hours + per week on average. 

We get good correspondence from the CEO and a gift card  ( up to $50) once or twice a year to thank us for good results.

If you are lucky enough to have a good store manager the ship sails well, the mates are in line and behaving well. If you do not have a good store manager it can become toxic and take a long time to be resolved, but YOU HAVE A VOICE it WILL BE RESOLVED. HR listens, regional managers listen. 

Trader Joe's is authentic about their customer experience promise. 

If you are older there is no where to ""grow"" financially. You get a 60 cent pay increase every six months. I have been with Trader Joe's 4.5 years and make less than $15. per hour still. But if I do my job it will increase by $1.20 each year. Capped at $24. I think. It will take me 8 years to get there. 

If you have lots of restaurant or grocery experience and are young enough and flexible with commuting or moving and up for the daily physical challenge and large crew members numbers to manage  (65-140) you can be a mate and make much better pay, and one day a Captain (store manager). If you are over 50 when you join Trader Joe's - 
those options don't exist in reality, at least at my store.","It is a highly repetitive job which almost always= injuries (muscle strain or worse) which means missed work and using up the precious little Absence Reserve time allotted. It would be great if the A/R were greater or there were additional sick days with pay. 

There are to many chiefs - These are the mates (assistant managers) making most of the payroll. They work 50 hours a week (10 is overtime). Crew members at my store get no weekend differential or holiday pay."
4111,Trader Joe's,"Hard work, but great place!",2017-01-31,5.0,Crew Member,"Depending on the store, the team makes its a fun and great environment. Management team, for the most part, genuinely cares for the well being of the crew member. Tastings and samples are a great way the company keeps the staff intrigued in their products. Management acknowledges the hard workers and are compensated with a nice raise. Very flexible scheduling!","The work can be quite demanding. If one doesn't stretch, the repetitiveness of the work can strain the body. At times, depending on the store size, coolers and back area can be very small so having to look for a specific product can be a hassle. Newer managers can forget the human ethic of the job, and can at times feels too corporate."

The biggest con of Trader Joe's is their denial to deal with real issues. If a serious issue comes up it is constantly downplayed. This includes forms of harassment, I experienced a sexual harassment seminar that was a complete joke and seemed to make both male and female employees more uncomfortable (Crew does have high respect for one another and most times harassment isn't an issue).

So many people complain about dealing with customers in other retail places but I can honestly say our customers are special. Benefits and wage are very livable as well. Full medical after 30hrs for your whole family is 216/mo with a low deductible! Pay is very livable,(negotiate with them), raises every six months and 10% retirement contribution! Also vacation pay accruals as soon as you start. Also you can be a fitbit champion, average 5 miles each shift.","It is a very physical job, prepare to frequently lift 40lb boxes in sometimes precarious fashion. Also tons of walking (which I think is great), and the whole shift is spent on your feet (I love it but some might not be able to handle). If you get hired here buy the best shoes you can, you will not regret it!

Don't make a career out of it unless that is your only goal.","Quite a lot actually. I say this with the understanding that there are probably some decent Trader Joe stores out there but my experience at West Hollywood California was a mixed bag. No consistency to management, which is the norm apparently, favoritism from the managers to certain crew members, constantly cutting peoples hours, over hiring so crew has less days a week to work and an over abundance of captains who have a spotty record at best with the company who continue to have careers with no apparent discipline from the company.

Great benefits, laid-back (for the most part) management, and a great rotation system keeps the job from feeling too redundant. Also, depending on your Captain (store manager) the music will either put you to sleep or have you jamming out. My offer was around what most of my previous jobs paid me, but they apparently don't start everyone above $10/hr by default. The offer was very fair based on my previous experience. They will feed you in some way...everyday. lol","Some employees are very passive-aggressive. 

Some of the management come off as though they aren't fully-qualified for their positions.

4293,Trader Joe's,Adopting the corporate greed model,2016-09-06,1.0,,A small employee discount. Customers often enjoy shopping in the store.,"I've worked for this company for many years as a crew member. Unfortunately,  nepotism has always been an element for the employees to be aware of. I was lucky to be on the good side of management for many years but that changed with a new store manager and a management team that followed suit. Many employees in my store have experienced unfair and biased reviews, especially the older employees. Lot's of decent employees fired or ""encouraged"" to leave the company so as to move in newer, younger cheaper employees. I've also watched decent employees go for years without a raise because they did good jobs but were not in the ""favored"" circle with management. It used to be the employees were genuinely happy at the stores, but now the smiles and small talk are there due to fear. Checkout counters have been minimized to increase intimacy with customers but to cut down on ergonomics and safety for both employees and customers. It used to be employees strengths were considered when placing them in different departments of the store, but this has fallen by the wayside in the name of cross training. So if you want to feel special this is not the place unless you become managements little star by sacrificing your sanity to do everything imaginable in the store. A new atmosphere of competition has also been set up so expect to fight like a pigeon for what little hours are tossed down from management. The scheduling system is on the dayforce app and employees can now forget about any personal considerations when it comes to their schedule and hours. Your sick pay will be bundled with your vacation pay as ""absence reserve"" so if you get sick...forget about that vacation you had planned. Employees are encouraged to even donate their absence reserve to employees who experience hardships. Really? I would think this company could dig a little deeper themselves to help employees in need. An insult to pawn it off their ""peasants"". This company uses the term ""Kaizen"" to to represent their values. Sorry to say this has proven to me to not be the case."

The company treats its employees respectfully, and they do a good job of keeping the work varied so you're not doing the same thing for eight hours.

Trader Joe's is still one of the best places to work retail...however, that is changing.","Health Insurance. Sorry, TJ's, but you messed that one up big time. We all once qualified for healthcare at 20 hours average per week. That changed about 2 1/2 years ago when the requirement was moved to 30 hours per week. For those of us who work in slower markets or who have summer slow downs, it has meant that we can no longer depend on your company for our livelihood. Employees that want to work 30 hours can't due to slower business and as a result are pushed out of the insurance and into the marketplace which for my family will cost twice as much as it does through the company for comparable insurance.

Scheduling has changed drastically over the last 2 years. It is no longer based on a mixture of availability and merit. It is now based 100% on availability. If you have a child, if you have responsibilities, if you are married, you can't be available 100% of the time. It's impossible. So, if that's your deal, you won't get hours. Only people with 100% availability get enough hours to live or qualify for insurance. Over a two year period, my hours scheduled have been cut in half, despite glowing reviews and raises. My availability was actually lower the previous year when I was getting more hours. I opened it up even more and got half the hours. I have no indication from management that my work is nothing other than exemplary. I'm only told that my availability is ""limited."" I've worked in retail before and my availability while not wide open is not ""limited."""

Only have health insurance with full-time employment, and in order to have full-time employment guaranteed, must usually open up your schedule to be available 24/7. Long-tenured crew at most stores (most crew members have worked for the company for 8 to 10 years or more) means that there is fierce competition to rise into mgmt.; you will have to wait 5 years or more to have a chance to be promoted to mgr.

AMAZING customers, and I mean amazing. Truly keeps you coming back to work and that all is apart of the culture of why the specialty grocer -- Trader Joe's is unique.

Our personal connections we build not only within our store and community but also the extent that our CEO goes to let us know how appreciated we are for helping to remain rated at the top. Each store counts and matters, each employee is valued is how these simple personalized messages to the crew. This is huge and matters because if makes it feel like a family.","Management can be frustrating and hard to communicate with despite it all teamwork is important and hiring the right team is something my store did well. Although, when trying to merge these personalities together advise against gossip and keep harmony often management does not make the effort to truly resolve the underlying issues together. So the uncomfortable or lack of respect between co-workers can remain and continue to fester. 

Lack of ability to really move forward and keep Trader Joe's as a long term career choice. Salary cap when I started was $3 above my pay rate I started with which was, in my humble opinion, especially looking back at all the hard work I dedicated myself to...was honestly too low of a starting point.

HR is a nightmare. Most of the time, you do not feel like they are working to help you understand even the simple benefits and support you in other ways. Often feel as if you got nowhere and not worth calling them in the first place--and that is not the purpose of HR."

Since I was hired in October I am technically part-time but work 40 hours and have great health benefits including free gym membership, counseling, and small co-pays for doctor visits. The full-timers get reviews by the crew and switch stores frequently ensuring you never, ever have anything but an unsupportive manager. Hours are plentiful and flexible. Many of the crew have been working at Trader Joe's for over 20 years. We have seven values that we go by and we measure ourselves by how we live up to those values. Almost anything a customers asks, we can say ""yes"" and take time to help them. I feel supported both by management and by the company (the company provides lots of communication, access, and info to Crew on a weekly basis). It is truly an honor to work here.",I would say the only cons are if you move up to management. You have a rotating schedule and you have to switch stores frequently.

Friendly atmosphere that encourages individuality.,"If you work in a busy metro area, your work/life balance can suffer. The physical labor can take a toll on your body if you don't take care.

4418,Trader Joe's,Was great for me,2016-05-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Best thing about working at Trader Joes was my coworkers and their willingness to work around my school schedule. I worked at TJ's through my B.A. and M.A. and there was never a problem adjusting my schedule. When I needed some extra time to study they were quite accommodating as well. Overall the pay was decent given that I had no experience working in a market prior to getting hired. There were regular raises (so long as you had a good review which isn't hard). In the end I would recommend it to anyone over any other market. I've heard some horror stories about other places, and I just get weird vibes from the environment at a Von's or Stater Brothers.","Biggest disappointment was the ability to move up in the company. I spent 8 years at the company and voiced my interest in going into management. They seemed excited to give me information on it at first, but there was no follow-through. If they didn't think I was up for it that's fine, but it would have been nice to be told that rather than encouraged then have it never be brought up again. The management structure also changed not long before I left which made it difficult on some of the long-time managers/full-timers. This also limited the opportunities for advancement by eliminating a large number of positions. Still, it was a good company to work for."

Either way they will be rotated out at some point.

-Customer base. Although sometimes needy, most customers are very knowledgeable about TJs products and share an enthusiasm with the crew when new products come out. TJs customers go out of their way to shop here a lot of the time, which creates a more positive environment than say having customers who just see grocery shopping as a chore. 
-10% discount on all products is more than fair. It's kind of fun asking for a three bell when visiting a store out of the area or state. Usually stirs up a fun conversation. 
-You get out what you put in. Many employers run their business strictly on seniority or on who you know. Sure there is favoritism here like anywhere else. But if you're willing to give complete open availability, push yourself to accept new challenges like being a section leader even though it doesn't come with a raise and is much more responsibility, and you're patient and willing to do whatever is needed, opportunities to advance will arise. 
-Starting pay and availability of hours weekly is significantly better than what is the norm in the retail and service industry today. While most jobs will want to start you around $9 an hour, and you'd be lucky to average 20-25 hours a week, the opportunity at TJs far exceeds that.","-Very little, if any training for new hires. I came in with over a decade of experience in the grocery business, but for those who it is their first job or are new to the business, I could see things being very overwhelming. 
-Safety training and culture, including food safety. Stores and back rooms are VERY cramped, sometimes to a dangerous level. I understand maximizing square footage to profit levels, but when stores that were built to handle $100k in sales a WEEK, and are now pushing $700k a week, something has to give. Lots of heavy lifting and little or no training on proper techniques. Back room coolers are often stuffed to the brim, and most of the crew finds it acceptable to just push a table of perishable product out into a room temperature warehouse for longer than is safe or recommended. Even when breaking down deliveries, stacks of fresh, highly perishable salads and dips can often sit untouched on racks on the sales floor for several hours. 
-Management styles. Starting off new at Trader Joe's often feels more like joining a fraternity rather than a job. Full timers will often heckle and have inappropriate comments. I wouldn't go so far as to call it harassment, because it's not, but not always the most professional. Some times this can lighten up the mood, other times it leaves one puzzled as to where they really stand. 
-Supply chain. TOS. TOS. TOS. Discontinued. Product ordering caps. Most customers and employees are used to this song and dance, but it's tough disappointing customers on the daily due to product supply issues. 
-There's a clear divide between externally hired management, and those that are promoted from within. Eventually it's all a wash, and I do not envy those hired as mates from outside the company. You are walking into an emotionally charged, intense situation. Crew members are passionate for the most part about what they do, and it is not easy being the stranger walking in the door. I do envy though the starting pay of most externally hired mates."

Because we hire a broad range of diverse, engaging people, there are no better people to work with. People generally work hard, are friendly, and uplift and support one another. 

The benefits are pretty wonderful considering it's a grocery store.","I am a Mate, or Full-Timer. There is absolutely no way around it: Trader Joe's will take up every waking moment of your life. You work 50 hours a week and are expected to run every aspect of the store, from breaking down pallets, copious amounts of admin, HR... All while smiling and showing no signs of frustration and giving every customer a perfect experience. 

You will have no life. When you finally get a day off... Which will most likely be in the middle of the week... You'll want to sleep all day. Your second day off you will do your chores, errands, etc, and if you're lucky, maybe a friend will be up for dinner or something. Nothing too crazy though, because for everyone else, it's a week night. You'll go back to work the next day feeling like a social loser, still tired, and ready to repeat the process. 

You will get injured. It's only a matter of when. Every single person I know who works at Trader Joe's for any length of time will have back problems, repetitive motion injuries, especially us Mates who are typically responsible for breaking down the load every day. 

Your friends will NOT understand your schedule, and slowly you'll be written off as a social option because you are ALWAYS working... Or at least always working when they're off. 

If you are coming in from the outside and starting out as a Mate, you might receive a decent wage. If you're like me and you're promoted from within, your wage will be a laughable slap in the face for the amount of work you do and the amount of BS you put up with every day. With a smile on your face, of course. 

You'll be caught up in it all at first. You'll drink the Kool-aid. But slowly, over time, you'll see exactly why I've become bitter about Trader Joe's and cringe when I hear people say things like ""Oh I hear it's such a great place to work! Everyone is so nice!!! Yay rainbows and unicorns and butterflies!!"" Blerggggg."

You receive a performance review every 6 months which determines your raises. Company hires based on personality, so it is always a fun work environment","You are evaluated based more on personality than work ethic. Depending on your store, management turnover is pretty high."
4516,Trader Joe's,Best Job I've Ever Had,2016-02-05,5.0,Crew Member,"Trader Joe's is a company that actually cares about its crew members. I know, I know, we've all heard that before about other companies, but Trader Joe's is different. A Trader Joe's crew member will never feel like just another drone working under uncaring management; instead, they will be treated like human beings with opinions and ideas. Trader Joe's is all about the idea that success starts from the ground, which means making sure that the crew members are happy.

Schedules, which are required to be posted two weeks in advance, can be flexible; if you have a situation that makes you absolutely unable to work at certain times or on certain days, Trader Joe's will work with you. On top of that, Trader Joe's uses a program called Dayforce, which you can access on a store kiosk, your home computer, or through the app on your smartphone. It makes certain tasks, including looking at your schedule, approving your timecard, requesting days off or shift changes/swaps, changing your availability, and much more, easy!

Trader Joe's offers great health insurance benefits to its crew members depending on the number of hours you work during a certain period of time. To get full coverage for medical, dental, and vision, you must work 780 hours during the allotted period, but smaller plans are offered if a crew member cannot work all of those 780 hours.

Trader Joe's is also not a minimum-wage job; when I started in 2013, the average starting salary was $10/hour, and has only gone up since then. Additionally, Trader Joe's holds biannual reviews of all its crew members with an opportunity to receive a raise of up to 60 cents per review, so overall you have the possibility of receiving $1.20 raise per year, giving crew members a great incentive to stay on with the company long-term.

On top of all that, I just like going to work every day. I know that when I get there, I'm going to be treated like a human being. I know I can joke around with the mates (key-holding managers) and the captain (store manager). I know I'm going to make someone's day. I know that when I go to work, I'm wanted there and appreciated there. It's hard to put the feeling into words without cliches... We're a family, of sorts. We care about each other and want to see each other succeed.

Trader Joe's has given me the opportunity to make some really great friends and have some great experiences. I love working for Trader Joe's; it's a company I'm proud of being a part of and one that I can really get behind.","If you want to move up in the world of Trader Joe's (e.g., promotion from crew member to mate aka manager), you have to transfer to a different location for training (though you absolutely could transfer back if that store had an open slot for a mate). This proves to be highly inconvenient for mate-hopefuls when the nearest store to transfer to is an hour or more away. The two closest stores to my current store are both an hour and a half away from where I live. The pay raise, honestly, isn't worth it when I'd have to drive an hour and a half to get there, work the typical ten hour shift that mates work, and then drive an hour and a half to go home. I'd be spending thirteen hours a day on this job, and that's assuming I only worked ten hours. I don't feel I'd be able to give TJ's my all if I'm constantly exhausted."

Health insurance if you work 30+ hours a week
Some managers are honest and hard-working","Used to enjoy working here but not anymore. It used to be that managers or ""mates"" would actually be a valuable part of the team and actually help the crew accomplish the daily and nightly tasks. Now there are too many of them, as if everyone needs a babysitter, and half of them stand around doing literally nothing when they could be doing their job. Instead they will stare at crew members making sure they work fast enough or walk around like prison guards barking orders. They seem to think they get paid to ""manage"" and ""watch"" but actually they are supposed to be essential for the functioning of the store! The mates at my store are so entitled and have no idea that some mates around the country in other stores actually do work. People think they make yearly salaries but they are actually just hourly employees who are scheduled more than 40 hours a week, so they make overtime pay every week. It must be some legal loophole so they aren't salaried. 

Human resources is basically blasphemy, so if anything happens that would normally involve input or mediation from human resources a crew member is left to fend for themselves. If a crew member chooses to speak up about a serious problem, say involving harassment or mistreatment, they will be ignored and left to feel helpless. You either have to go to management, who may be against you considering the prevalence of favoritism, or quit. 

The people who actually like working for this company are brainwashed. They have no idea how little the company cares for them. The company is expanding everyday yet benefits, raises, and whatever left of the original company culture is diminishing. Everyday I'm spoken to like a child when I've been with the company a very long time, longer than some of the managers. This may seem like it can happen in any retail environment but trust me, there is something very very different and sinister about the way this company handles itself. It won't even prove that all of its products are non-GMO, yet still makes the claim! And the crew members and customers just believe this lie blindly!  Think twice before you get sucked into the supposed perfection of Trader Joes."

It takes too long, sometimes, to weed these people out."
4550,Trader Joe's,Experience dependent upon management,2016-01-15,3.0,Crew Member,Some of the best co-workers around. You don't end up doing the same exact thing everyday.,"The captain can make or break the whole experience. A lot of work, a lot going on. It's easy to be over-looked, and under-appreciated."
4551,Trader Joe's,I loved working here!,2016-01-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing co workers, fun managers, great food, built up my muscles!","Repetitive day, didn't really give me much a chance to grow in the company, and when you finally do get promoted, you would have been with the company for at least 5 years."
4552,Trader Joe's,Crew,2016-01-13,3.0,Crew Member,"Good work place, dedicated staff and perhaps a better than average pay. Good work standards and rotation of job dutues","Some what rigid, and little interest or hesitation in accepting new approaches to new ideas."
4553,Trader Joe's,Great company to work for!!,2016-01-13,4.0,Crew Member/Section Leader,"Fun Hippy work environment! People are always friendly, and outgoing. They encourage store tastings so you know what to tell customers about specific products. I work full time and get great insurance(Blue Cross). If you've worked a certain amount of hours you can qualify for 401K. Once you opt to get insurance they send you a ""fit card"" which is basically a card you can use to go to any area gyms that acknowledge it, in other words a free gym membership. L.A. Fitness were I live accepts it so I basically have free access to their gyms. Occasionally Depending on how well TJ's is doing that year the company rewards ALL of its employees. Last year(2015) all of us got $25 TJ's gift cards at the end of the year, and they also did it in 2014. Also employees get 10% discounts on anything in the store. The Company heavily promotes from within(check cons as well on this topic). Depending on the ""Captain""(store manager) they may arrange company outings and parties. My store's captain took everyone who opt'd to go, to Dave and Busters. Everyone does everything, and everyone does the same task which is great for your resume(see cons). Meaning you WILL be a cashier, you WILL stock, you WILL bag, you WILL get carts from outside, you WILL clean, you WILL consistently lift heavy and light boxes, you WILL use pallet jacks(if you know how, its not hard), you WILL greet customers, etc. etc. All of this will happen at different times and may or may not happen everyday, but expect it because it WILL happen. The company may alter tasks for certain individuals with special needs. If you have been in a car accident and have a bad back they wont have you lifting heavy things. My store had a person who was hard of hearing so they altered their routine and put up signs for customers to let them know this person was deaf, as well as buying a sign language book so all of us can learn and communicate to them. All in all its a great company to work for, not too many companies give raises every 6 months, and not too many companies respect their employees. I love it so give it a try! Or at least give the food a try!
~Tj's Crab State","Depending on store location hours can vary even if you are a section leader. I helped open a store in Houston, TX. and in a month I was a section leader. Texas is supposed to be the second largest market for Trader Joe's, with California of course being number one. When I Started I was working 37.5 hours a week but since it was new a new market area, our store was a little slow so they cut all hours to employees except mates to between 27-32 hours a week, some under-performing people were even cut to one day a week. I now work in Maryland and as a section leader, guaranteed 37.5 Hours. So it depends on were your store is located and how much business they generate. Trader Joe's gets two trucks a day, one in the morning and one at night. So you may have to be at work as early as 4 A.M. and the latest 12 midnight, although depending on the load you may leave at 12:30 A.M. ""Mates""(supervisors) work 10 hours or more a day, and have descending schedules. So if they work 4am-2pm on Monday, Then Tuesday they may work 6am-4pm, and Wednesday 8am-6pm and so forth and may restart the next week. So there really is no set steady schedule for them. The company encourages promotions from within. While it's not impossible to get hired as a ""Mate"" if you have the exp. of course, but it is a-lot harder and more challenging because, TJ's is cautious of hiring someone from another company. Lets say for example someone from Walmart who may want to come in and run and implement things like they did in walmart, they strive to be different. Everyone does everything, so if you like to be a cashier but don't like to stock this isnt the job for you, if you dont like lifting boxes this isnt the job for you. ABSOLUTELY NO OVERTIME! For anyone but mates and higher ups. Boxes and cardboard drying up my skin, boooooo :-(."

4562,Trader Joe's,Wouldn't work there again.,2016-01-07,2.0,Crew Member,"- Interesting customers and co-workers, though your store will vary (obviously). I made a lot of friends here quickly, and still have some of them years later. The customers are mostly cool, also.

- Good benefits, though I hear they have gotten not-as-good since I left. The insurance was excellent, offered to all employees, and only cost something like $50/month (has since increased substantially). The retirement plan was unheard-of, and unmatched by any other employer I've encountered: 15.4% of your earnings were deposited in a mutual fund every year, with no contributions on your part. NONE. That's a 15.4% bonus squirrelled away for you annually. 

- Depending on what area of the store you have, the work can be really easy. Possibly mindless, if that's your thing.

- Management was fairly liberal with the free stuff. Maybe it was some free beer, maybe a few pizzas showed up at lunchtime. Also, there was a Christmas party most years, which was nice.

-............the more I think about it, the nicer that 15.4% was. It merits another mention.","- Store 'leadership' was an absolute farce. There wasn't a single person at any point that I looked to as an example of how I should conduct myself. Most of the ""full-timers"" (as supervisory staff is called) had apparently never held a job where they had to lead people. It showed. They were just people who wore different shirts, had access to the safe, and got paid way more. Speaking of...

- While it's cool that TJ's pays well, when the next person up from you is getting paid more than twice what you are, the inequality is too much. It's impossible for management and staff to relate to each other when one lives in the richest suburb in town, and the other can barely afford meals.

- Is 10% the best you can do for a discount? From a multi-billion dollar company? When a good number of employees qualify for SNAP?

- Expect to be moved between departments often, and without asking you if it's ok. One day you'l be getting carts and stocking wine, the next you'll be working frozen and ringing up groceries. 

- Lots of standing, lots of lifting, lots of walking. Plus you'll work in the freezer and probably the parking lots finding carts. Bring a coat everyday.

- The schedule is all over. One week it'll be mornings, the next you'll be there til midnight. Change your availability to not work a day? They'll cut your hours."

So that's good for morale AND productivity. The crew is amazing.

The number one value is Integrity and they need to change that because they have none. They make changes to raises and benefits and let the employees find out about it as opposed to telling them. The benefits went down from when I started and even after I left. I wouldn't rely on them. One of my previous bosses actually said we were not to pass on applicants with disabilities. So many horrible HR issues went on but with HR only in California, it was always one sided and in favor of the store manager. I was smart enough to not speak up because I saw everyones careers ending around me that did. Thankful I was able to get out and wish I had done it sooner. As a manager the hours were gruelling and work-life balance does not exist! Job advancement is limited with only mate or captain positions. There isn't a goal to work torwards.

Coworkers are usually friendly. Mates can be cool. Get paid to taste wine and food.,"The squeeze from up high can be felt trickling down all the way to the new hires. I have seen a trend in my tenure here. Employees are having their benefits cuts, premiums on insurance raise, hours are being cut and becoming less flexible (which mostly affects students or employees with children). You can feel the half-heartedness in the Captains and Mates as they implement new rules from Coprorate which usually compromise efficiency upon implementation. Captains are becoming reluctant to hire new staff and are forbidden from allowing overtime, so the employees are being bullied to pick up the pace which leads to more injuries. The fewer hours people get, the more in-house theft increases. It's getting to the point where crew is suspicious of earth other, killing cooperation and moral.

No matter how hard you work, or have corrected issues there is not a word of appreciation for hard work and loyal service. Management uses punishment tactics rather than a motivational skills. 

One can be blacklisted by management and past on to future managers so there is never any clean slate. Managers appear to no nothing about management skills when it comes to motivation and helping crew succeed with expectations; it's all about trying to use whatever they can to degrade crew in reviews. 

People with good management skills don't last in Trader Joe's. Managers with no educational background move up the ranks who don't even like people!!! I can't stress that one enough. 

Too much favoritism. To little engaging and caring is shown for crew. I've worked with mates who have not initiated a hello or seldom do for years of working with them. I've worked for Trader Joe's for a VERY long time and see LOTS of poor morale and it's mostly caused by management and their lack of management and people skills.

There have been friendly relationships between regional managers and store managers that have led to special treatment regarding minor emotional abuse of employees. It's the best grocery store you could work for, but apart from some of the level headed assistant managers, I hate the management system as a whole."
4654,Trader Joe's,The Wordy Shipmate,2015-10-20,3.0,Part Time Crew Member,"The real pros of this company are that, for a newcomer, its a great place to feel warm. You meet great, creative people, forming friendships you never knew you wanted. You get pretty decent benefits after a short period of time, and its a fun place to work. Not to mention, the pay is not bad at all for a young, part-time worker.","I have been with the company for 3 years now. Once you form a friendship with your coworkers and learn to love the idea of working at a truly unique grocery store, you start to see through the facade. The intentions of the company are great, but it really starts to feel shady after a while. Pay rates vary for the ""lifers"" and for full-time management in an unfair manner. I work, and have worked with some great people who do very little work (or none at all) for nearly twice what I make now, just because they have been there longer. The company also has a policy that, if you decide to transfer out of state, they wont match your pay to wherever it is you go. For example, if you move from a suburb of Virginia to New York City, you'll have three years worth of raises and decent pay in Virginia, but you'll get to New York and realize the employees who started yesterday make more than you, and the company will not adjust your pay, despite the time you have spent with the company."
4655,Trader Joe's,Best. Job. Ever.,2015-10-20,5.0,Section Leader,"If you qualify for the Insurance - which is only $60 a month - you get: Free gym membership to nearly any gym (multiple gyms if you choose), free dental, free vision, and excellent coverage by Anthem. 

You get a raise every December and every July - this will vary on your location, but at my store we have received 65 cent raises every 6 months. You also get a bonus in January that is 5% of what you made throughout the year. The company offers commuter benefits, as well as family counseling and therapy sessions. They provide the uniforms (and they're not ugly either). Comfortable hoodies and pullovers, long sleeve and short sleeve t shirts in an array of colors. You will never go hungry-they feed you like a king. The company donates all 'spoiled' food that they discard, rather than throw it away. My store donated $400,000 to the local charity we work with last year. Lastly, you can move up in the company, and quick.","If you have any sort of physical injury or any part of you becomes sore easily or quickly this is not for you. They pay extremely well and have the best benefits I have ever seen, but they really put your body to the test. Lifting really heavy things is common, constant movement ( I do about 18,000 steps at work a day), and varying hours that can start as early as 5am, or a shift that leads into 2am. Hours are also not consistent. No guarantee you'll have 30 or 40 hrs every week."
4656,Trader Joe's,Trader Joe's Culture is changing and not in a good way,2015-10-15,1.0,,Good food and most of my co-workers were really cool. I used to work for Safeway and it was lightyears better than that.,The cons definitely outweigh the pros. This is a physically-demanding job so if you don't like standing on your feet for a long period of time or lifting up heavy objects then the job isn't for you. I started about three years back as a deckhand (bagger and cart wrangler) and then worked my way up to a cashier and overall a more involved role in the store. I could definitely see the culture change and probably the biggest change myself and other workers saw was the company cutting back on benefits. And this was a real head scratcher because the company is making more money than they ever had so I'm guessing they are reducing benefits to cut back on spending therefore increasing profit. I also was thrown under the bus a lot of the time and slanderous rumors were thrown around often at me for no apparent reason. Even though most people were cool deep down a lot of them do not like their job because they don't get paid a lot and their bodies hurt and they are struggling to make ends meet with their dismal salary. That is why it is best to get a college degree and shoot for the stars instead of sticking with complacency and repetitious retail jobs like Trader Joe's. It is best to always be careful who you are around because there are about 90 other workers and saying one thing could spread like wildfire. Also do not ever let your performance review tell you that you aren't a good worker it is just a piece of paper and management has to think of at least one flaw in your work. Since I am in college it was a good part-time job but I strongly do not recommend it as a full-time job. Get a degree and look for a higher calling.

I've meet two of my best friends after working at Trader Joe's.","I applied and was hired at TJ's in 2009. I originally loved my job, the store, and my managers.  However, in 2011 Trader Joe's underwent a major restructuring and changed their business model and direction entirely.  Merit based raises were replaced by set raises, that are awarded on a pass/fail evaluation. (So one weakness, area for improvement, or in some cases a difference of opinion with management, is all it takes to ""not meet expectations"" and not get a raise.) Opportunities for advancement were plentiful before the restructuring; now, they barely exist.  Our time off requests were limited to 2-3 months out, ensuring that there was more dialogue concerning time off. The current system requires at least a months notice, but if you wait that long you'll never get the time off, which evolved into everyone requesting time off months (sometimes 4-5) in advance to ensure approval. The pay is lacking for section leaders or anyone with additional work and responsibility. Under the merit based system, team leaders were compensated for writing orders, section maintenance, cleaning, displays, training, installing standards, and being model employees. Now, you get nothing for being a section leader. Regarding the shifts, I'm almost certain most crew members have shift work disorder because of the lack of consistency in scheduling. This is especially true for Mates ( asst. managers.) If you're lucky, have put in your dues, or happen to be buddy-buddy with the schedule maker (one of the mates,) you'll get the hours and shifts you want.  There is widespread favoritism, by Captains (GMs) and especially the Mates. (Don't ever make the schedule writer angry.). But the main con to working for Trader Joe's now is that the original culture and atmosphere that made it such an amazing place to work is gone.  Dan Bane is a profit driven, bottom line kind of CEO.  He has changed the direction of company immensely and in the process has destroyed the great culture of the company.  In my opinion, and in my store, morale is at an all time low. Many employees are leaving the company, ( 8 in the past 4 months, 7 having 5 + yrs of experience.) As a crew we evaluate our Mates and Captain once a year, for two years in a row we have given our management team the worst reviews in store history. Our Captain's review was the worst in his 20+ yrs at TJ's. Mostly all having to do with new changes to the company and their failures introducing said changes to the crew. All in all, for new employees that didn't know or experience TJ's in its heyday it should be fine, you'll work hard and have a little fun. For those that know better, it's been a sad disintegration of what was once an amazing company and job opportunity."

Employees who do actually work hard are required to do the work of two people. There is never enough coverage. Skimpy payroll budgets mean things don't get done. Lots of favoritism. Shifts are often so close together there is no chance of eating and sleeping properly in between. Constantly changing management, lack of communication causes constant confusion.

The job is fast-paced and with constant movement there is never time to get bored.  Employee food tastings make it possible to try many products which is great.,"Free dental and vision insurance is offered, but this is only if you work less than an average of 29 hours per week.  Full-time employees have to pay for medical insurance coverage to get the same option, so if you do not need medical coverage.....you are out of luck for dental and vision.  No one seemed to know this except for HR.  

Provide safe lifting/ergonomic trainings.  Many people talk about being extremely sore or hurt due to the heavy physical work flow.

One issue can cause denial of the minimal 6 month raise, even though your overall performance has been consistent and you have given it your all.  Either you ""pass"" your review or you do not....no middle ground.  People talk about calling in sick due to not getting requested time off, etc., and still get raises.

4780,Trader Joe's,"A good place to work, if you are willing to work very, very hard",2015-07-27,4.0,Crew Member,"Competitive wages for retail. If you consistently perform well, you can make a good wage at the company. If you are with the company for many  years, you can do quite well. Many crew members have been with the company for 10+ years, which is a good sign.

Most stores are open a very wide range of hours, many start as early as 4:30 AM and are open as late as 12 AM. Competitive raises and performance reviews for eligible crew members are currently offered on a twice-yearly basis. Great for students and people looking to work nights and weekends!

Assistant Managers (""mates"") make good to excellent wages for working retail, with 10 hours of mandatory overtime a week.  Most managers, especially at well-established stores, are knowledgable, friendly, and have been with the company for many years.  

Coworkers are friendly and fun to work with. Management is approachable and most ""Captains"" have been with the company for 5+ years, many started out as ""Crew"".

If you are scheduled enough hours to obtain health benefits, they are quite generous and affordable for the quality of care offered. Dental and vision are offered with fewer hours required. 

Paid time off accumulates based on the hours you work and you can use it (mostly) at your discretion. There are no blackout dates, and it can be used for illness or vacation.

Transferring: It is possible to transfer to other Trader Joe's locations. It is not unheard of to have a crew member transfer to another store within a large city, or even to transfer across the country. There are requirements and limitations, of course, but it is a cool perk if you are looking for a change of scenery and want to stay with the company. I have many coworkers who have transferred to or from my store.","High turnover in some stores. However, in some stores, crew members have been with the company for 10-20 years.

Management is constantly changing the ""rules"" for how to work, usually resulting in doing the same job twice or in having safety-improving tools being off-limits during open hours. Often back-breaking labor with minimal tools for safe lifting. Age is no barrier to the physically demanding work...whether you are 17 or 60, you are expected to break down pallets and carry heavy boxes. 

Everyone works a variety of shifts, often with as little as 8 hours between shifts (ie: 3P-11P one day and 6A-2P the following day). Assistant Managers have set schedules, but few crew members are given the luxury of a set, predictable schedule. Childcare and family life are hard to manage with the schedule, unless you have a partner with a supremely flexible job. Difficult to budget during ""slow"" months, as weekly hours may vary from 16 to 35 hours per week.

Some managers are fantastic, while others are lackluster. There is a high occurrence of transfers amongst management at the various stores in an area. This means that assistant management of the store is often changing like musical chairs. Usually assistant managers don't have a say as to where they are transferred or how often, which can be difficult for them and for the crew. Favoritism is a problem at most stores. Some crew members can get away with anything, while others are constantly being watched. If you are a manager's ""favorite"" you usually have it pretty easy. If you are not outgoing or have trouble getting along with everyone, this may not be the right job for you.

Some stores understaff to make sales and budget numbers look better. This results in an already overworked staff getting exhausted, especially during night shifts."

4784,Trader Joe's,Give everything that you can give,2015-07-26,3.0,Mate,Some fellow crew members can make it fun because we are all in this together. The stores are relatively small compared to a regular grocery store.,"I am a mate and pretty much have given my livelihood to this company. I've worked every weekend (unless requested off) for the last 10 years. If you have a family you will have very little involvement with it and if you are wanting a family you will never have an opportunity to create one. 10 hour days are not that bad but it's the times of the day you work. 2pm-12am or 3am-1pm all in the same week. So not much of a life outside of the store. The worst part of this job is the job itself, which is also sometimes referred to as a ""career"" here but we all know being a grocery store employee is not a career."
4785,Trader Joe's,Crew Member Experience,2015-07-26,4.0,Crew Member,"Healthcare and benefits, potential pay raise every six months, opportunities for feedback to management, flexible hierarchy wherein one may gain more responsibility, flexible hours.","Given the reputation of Trader Joe's as a 'small neighborhood supermarket' of sorts, there are very high expectations from both management and customers regarding customer service. Also, there are a lot of aspects of this company culture that are very much ingrained into employees."
4786,Trader Joe's,Avoid this company,2015-07-24,1.0,Crew Member,"Customers are ""fans"" and tend to be very freindly and nice.  Co workers are usually fun to work with, but keep in mind that many say they work there only because there's no drug testing policy.","Each store has a quota of people to dump from insurace per quarter.  To do that they over-hire and manipulate hours.  If it were a fair process it would be one thing.  But most of the best employees and people who ""make things happen"" get hours cut to one day a week if the DayForce software targets them as being next to go off of insurance.  Each store has a core group of employees who've baby-sat managers kids, sold them drugs, or are personal freinds.  Those people consistently get all the shifts they want AND what hours they chose to work..  Everyone else is regarded as disposeable and managerment can care less about their value to the company."
4787,Trader Joe's,The Old Grey Mare Aint What She Used To Be,2015-07-23,2.0,Part Time Crew Member,"You get to be in an environment of fast paced work and customer service. The customers themselves are educated and interesting to be around, as well as to learn from. You learn much about healthy eating and clean food sourcing for your health and the health of your family. I spent over 12 years with the company most of which were fun and stimulating. good benefits, retirement plan, accumulated reserve time (sick days or vacation you chose). Most people are fun to work with. Lots of food and wine to sample, drink, and taste. Getting drunk on wine and beer at work for free.","It is a private company, so there is little to no transparency in regards to fairness. If you ever need to appeal a decision or accusation, you will see 0 documentation against you. When I started with the company management was very active in helping with all aspects of the store side by side with the part-time crew members. The company went as so far as to let you sign into your shift by hand on your time card, the trust level was unheard of. Times are a changing at the ""NEW"" Trader Joe's you are not trusted, you are not a value, you are not cherished for your customer service knowledge or care. The crew itself is now being hired for their looks and not their drive or knowledge of grocery or food in general... think Abercrombie and Fitch of grocery stores. It is trendy to work for TJs now, so the company is into heavy turnover and promoting unsuccessful young inexperienced crew members into mate positions (lower in store management). They have also been head hunting ""talented"" managers from other companies that are not from the same retail category  e.g. home depot, lane bryant. The managers are not a part of the culture that has been Trader Joe's, they are cut throat ladder climbers willing to step on anyone,kiss derriere  to superiors, coddle lazy work ethic, enjoy high school social behaviors and do things even if they know them to be wrong. I witnessed many flagrant abuses that were rewarded again and again. Sexual misconduct, drugs, absent from store regularly, captains on injury then leaving the store without leadership, and I go on. The review process is inconsistent and is used to cut out employees (expensive). Management is rotated so often they are like tourists, they come in act like they own you and the store, then they leave their mess for you to clean up with notes for the next set of managers filled with fact less opinion. They are not offering hours that any normal family based person can maintain, as well as not offering enough hours to get the benefits package I mentioned as a Pro, so great for college kid. This is not the job you have been told you are getting, unless you transition to a mate position. good luck."

4839,Trader Joe's,Becoming more corporate,2015-06-16,3.0,Crew Member,"The environment is definitely what I love about Tjs. All the employees have this team effort mindset which makes the day a lot easier. I've worked for this company as a Crew Member for 8 years. Which means we are trained to do everything from cleaning, stocking, cashiering etc. Raises are every 6 months and are easy to get if you just follow directions. They cap out at $21.50 now, I believe. 10% employee discount. The opportunity to have weekly food and wine tastings.",It's customer service so it can be mentally draining. And breaking down palet's will be hard on your body in the long run trust me! The managers at times speak at you instead og to you. The Captain always acts nice but is only looking at you like a number and thinking of ways to get more work out of you without correct compensation.The company is also taking a more corporate approach looking at numbers and how to squeeze one more profit out of us. I feel we no longer embody the neighborhood grocery store. With the addition of Obamacare TJS decided to mess with our health care benefits and make us eligible for medical benefits if were worked an average of 30 hrs a week instead of the previous 20. This hurt a lot of college students who were attending school fulltime. They blamed the change on Obamacare  but in reality they just wanted to save money.
4840,Trader Joe's,Trader Joe's Best of Retail Jobs- Crew Member,2015-06-16,4.0,Crew Member,"Trader Joe's really treats their crew members well. There was always lots of free food. Demo make breakfast and dinner for the crew everyday, plus wine & beer tastings at least once a week. 
Pay is higher than any any other retail store for crew and they offer about $1.00 a year in raises.
Good benefits for 30 hours of more per week.
Company gives employees a chance to voice their opinion with yearly surveys.
Great atmosphere. Fun. Co-workers are really great people.
Captains can be really cool. They like to hire easy going people that match the vibe at TJ's.
Some stores work with your schedule while others do not. It just depends on the management.
I really enjoyed this job and my co-workers were great! Met some awesome people.","It's retail. Customers were generally very nice, but once in awhile you have to deal with the crazy customers. Hours are all over the place, especially for management who work at least one turn around shift a week (close at 10:00 at night only to be back early morning 4-6:00 am). I think those types of schedules should be illegal. Seriously messes with your body. 
IT""S AN INCREDIBLY PHYSICAL JOB! If you work the morning shifts your body, especially your back gets worked. Loads of back injuries from young to old people. I am nursing a back injury now. Breaking down pallets day after day can really take it's toll. Plus you have to do it quickly in order to have the store ready for customers. When the store cuts back hours, there are fewer workers but the work load is the same. Injuries are way too common because you have to do things very quickly with fewer workers, leaving less time to lift things the right way. 
Management is kind of a mess right now. Mates that are hired from the outside make close to 2 times the amount as those who are promoted from within the company. So those who have proven themselves to be exceptional workers by working their way up the ladder end up making far, far less money than those who are hired from Walmart and Target. It causes a lot of turn over in the management positions. Lots of Mates step down to crew members or go on to higher paying management jobs elsewhere. This problem could go away if TJ's would pay all incoming managers the same and be more transparent reguarding pay. Why not pay all starting Mates the same and at least start them at the top of the crew member scale? Seriously pay them enough so they don't have to have another job to survive. It's hard enough to work that crazy 50 hour a week schedule with the crazy hours. At least pay them for it!"

Work is fun and fast-paced so hours go by quickly. Opportunities for advancement.,Management can have a tendency to pick favorites. They prefer people who are willing to advance in the company and stay with them long term. Work is VERY physical and pretty much non-stop so it can get pretty exhausting. Store is small and crowded so getting around can be a little annoying and overwhelming.
4848,Trader Joe's,Trader Joes Employee experience,2015-06-10,4.0,Crew Member,It is a lucrative company that offers excellent health benefits to those who average 30+ hrs a week. Its fun and feels more like a party than working lol. Raises usually happen every six months and are for a decent amount verses .35 a year,However it is still very low in pay in regards to someone who has a family to support or isn't living at home with parents who pay most the bills. Guess you can negotiate so it varies per person. The hours are all over the place and can be tough if you have a family. You can talk with managers and get hours within your availability however the less availability the less ours given and the less pay made.

 The company is good the store I work at is the problem.","My trader Joes has to be the worst store I have ever worked in. The crew is horrible, the management is horrible, and I am desperately looking to transfer like NOW. When I started working at trader Joes almost a year ago it was not so bad. I really liked the company but after a while things went from bad to worst. My caption doesn’t like anything; it took him almost a year to finally get a banana stand. He does not interact with the crew, 90 percent of the times it seems like he has no clue what he’s doing or he will stand in the store and watch crew members BUT will not tell them what they are doing  wrong instead he will tell a mate who THEN will tell the crew member what they did wrong. The store has the potential be a great store but the management suck so bad it will never happen. My caption just recently started interacting with the crew but only after the reviews. 

The whole store acts as if they are in high school crewmembers telling on other crewmembers instead of doing their job and focusing on the customers.  Mates stepping in and pulling people to the side saying, ”Well so and so said this” I feel its so high school. There’s also WAY too much drama at this store (but I think that’s at every job). Sometimes I just want to come to work and do my job without being sucked into drama or picking up the stack because someone is always calling out. There’s no diversity in this store either. 

I feel underappreciated most of the time. Once you work a section and your good at it YOUR STUCK IN THAT SECTION. I cant tell you how many times I worked produce everyday, every morning, I break down 6,7 sometimes 8 pallets by myself because some crewmembers spend half the day talking and are barely productive. I don’t mind working produce it just a little variety would be nice. The mates at my store talking about getting me out of produce so I can be a more well rounded crewmember but it has yet to happen."

When everyone communicates, honestly, and everyone is working productively, things go a lot smoother. The supervisors are usually awesome in many ways, some way more then others. Even they turn against each other often times","Lots of secrecy, and back stabbing, that includes management. Often times management creates a such a strong division between the employees by playing into blatant favoritism and this creates a somewhat hostile working environment. Also, when it comes time for the once every 6 months review, management looks and searches for any little reason to not give employees a $.60 raise. This lasts for an entire 6 months. For instance an employee can be a very strong and productive worker, but maybe has one small area of needing improvement, that employee won't get the raise for at least another 6 months. A lot of this has to do with keeping payroll and store cost down so the higher up management receive their large bonuses. On top of their already 6 figure salary. When employees are not feeling as if they are valued for all their hard work, it will eventually show in the quality of work and dedication. Also many new employees are getting hired at least $1 and up more then many employees who have worked there for years, simply because minimum wage went up so hiring wage goes up, but should existing wages go up as well to reflect the difference"

You start your work week by working 2pm to 12am.  The next day you start  a little earlier, like 12pm to 10pm, and each day after you start a little earlier and earlier.  On the last day of your week you work 5am to 3pm.  So in 5 days you go from starting at 2:00 in the afternoon to starting at 5:00 in the morning.

Every two hours everyone changes posts; dairy, cashier, loading dock, etc... I liked this because I did not get bored and it gave me the opportunity to learn about all aspects of the business and how this and all retail stores are run. I also loved the employee discount. The prices are already very reasonable and with the discount I bought all my groceries there. As far as the merchandise goes we had the opportunity to sample different food and beverage products and even had employee wine tastings to help us be able to sell wines to the customers. I like pretty much everything they sell the foods and snacks are tasty and a lot are natural and or organic. Loooove the snacks and chocolate covered everything also great deals on wine and adult beverage as well as great variety of soft drinks and juices. Everyone was nice to me and worked as a team. Management also provided a nice dinner for employees working on Thanksgiving so we all had a chance to eat and socialize before or after our shift so we didn't feel we were missing out working on the holiday which I didn't mind anyways because get paid overtime. I was hired for seasonal only that is the only reason I did not stay on.",I liked pretty much everything about working there. It was low stress and fun. Only drawback is salary.

- the crew becomes like your family, as you really spend more time with these people than your actual family 
- at my store, being a hard worker gets you recognized 
- being recognized as a hard, productive worker gets you a chance to own a section and write an order for that particular section 
- the management at every particular store is very different, so if you don't like your current management, there's chances to relocate and love your job much more 
- amazing benefits; great but you'll definitely work for them
- chances to relocate almost anywhere in the United States, as there are so many stores and many more opening up every year","- the mates at my particular store tend to mistrust crew members pretty often, not allowing them to talk while they work or do what they'd like to to their owned sections
- owning a section does not mean a pay raise, so basically this means much more work and stress for the same pay (or technically, the normal two flat rate raises per year) 
- this job requires constant physical labor, very rough on the body after a while 
- if you're not planning on becoming part of the management team, this job is pretty much dead-end
- for the amount of daily physical labor that is required, the pay is less than adequate
- availability must be completely open for you to get hours, this means that there is almost no time for a social/personal/school life
- during the slow season, hours can and will be tremendously cut and the management at my store uses silly excuses to explain why YOUR particular hours have been reduced 
- you must work 30 or more hours a week to receive benefits; if you have your hours cut, you can easily lose those benefits 
- customers can be extremely over bearing 
- favoritism is very apparent, nobody at my store has been horribly mistreated, however, I've heard of that being the case at other stores 
- sexism is very apparent; almost every male that I work with gets paid more than most females, even if they haven't worked for the company as long 
- the work days are pretty long and strenuous, 8 hours of straight physical labor isn't good for the body or mind 
- you will absolutely not work a set schedule, sometimes you'll work a shift starting at 5:00 am and the next day you'll be scheduled at 3:00 pm until 11:00 pm and then the next day you'll have to come in at 10:00 am and work until 6:00 pm."

They have their favorites and it's becoming very frustratingly obvious. To be working so hard, and feeling so proud of yourself- but still consistantly told you're not doing a good job really gets to you after awhile. Especially when other mates are congradating you on your great work that day. To me, I know I'm not doing anything wrong. So I'm not mad at myself, I'm angry with how they are able to do this. I know I'm not the only one this is happening to at my store, which is sad to me that other people are going thru it as well. Now; I don't ( and didn't ever ) see myself working at Trader Joes for the rest of my life, that being said, I was super excited to sign up for the experience that I had heard about working there, and all the fun that would come out of it. My captain once told me that this job isn't rocket science then proceeding to basically call me ( for lack of a better term ) stupid for the rest of the 15 minute meeting, which ended with a final warning due to an issue that was a mistake and not even a big deal AT ALL. I had never been in trouble before so a final warning made no sense to me. Over time my hours decreased even though I had been working very hard only to go un-noticed. I'm very disappointed with how I am treated and thinking of taking it to corporate.

There are extremely dedicated employees who go above and beyond their duties to make sure the store is in the best shape it could be in.","I have seen this company go from what I considered a role model to other companies to being just one of the many rather than one of the few, as it used to be. Their ever- expanding market has created many different rules about your daily job that makes it impossible to properly communicate with one another. Due to the new healthcare system, you must work 30 hours versus the previous 20 to receive health insurance. Just about every other person hired at this particular store are southern baptists. Our captain has turned a blind eye to the tension this creates in the work environment. I have seen maybe four people of color hired during the time I've been employed there. Every single one of them has left eventually. There were about 70 people who opened our store and three years later there are about ten original hires left. I've heard other stores do not have near as high of a turnover rate as ours.

Our store captain puts his personal views before the company's, by hiring mostly young religious white males (or their wives, or both), who receive better treatment than the older employees, and the female employees.

The mates at this particular store are so miserable and it is a reflection of poor guidance from the captain. They're not properly trained, therefore crew members aren't properly trained. All of the original mates that opened our store have left (ten of them) to work at a different store because they knew months into the job that they were in no way going to receive a recommendation to move up in the company by this captain.

If I were to write this review when I first started the job, it would have gone much, much differently. Many crew members who couldn't get an issue resolved by our captain took it to our regional director, who also turned a blind eye to their array of concerns. 

I worked with a gay man who came out as transgender two years into the job. As soon as she came out, her reviews were bad, her hours were cut, and the treatment from our management changed toward her. Prior to that, her reviews were always perfect. This is one of the many examples as to why Trader Joe's will either get worse, or if they start listening, REALLY listening, it could get better."

Her boss, the COO, let her ruin peoples life's / careers due to her outbursts and intimidation tactics. Her staff won't even participate in meeting discussions, afraid they will get fired if they speak up. 
* IT is a mess and the last priority for TJ. No disaster recovery, all software is out of version, and the IT VP is creating a smoke and mirror environment where everyone is frightened and knows he says one thing and does another. Very calculated killer, and willing to do anything to make himself look better while crushing others.   
* Dan walks around the open / cubical environment with his hands in his pockets, finds 2 people discussing an important issue and says ""Do you know why conference rooms were invented?""
* Office furniture is old, falling apart and chairs are back killers and dust is built up every where creating an unhealthy environment
* Conference rooms on the executive side are ""unaccessible"" for meetings because they are next to the executives - and there are not enough conference rooms. Lots of meetings are held outside. If the TJ University is in session, then there is no where to meet. 
* Scheduling Conf rooms is straight out of the 1950's. No integration with Outlook, per Dan. A binder with 3 months worth of dates for all the rooms is kept in the lobby. A complete waste of time and inefficient for all involved, again, upper management's head in the clouds not caring about how this impacts productivity. 
* TJ prides itself on not adding headcount, but adding more work to the people. This creates a lopsided work/life balance, frustration and a feeling of upper management being out of touch. 
* Complacency is rampant. No one cares, no one wants to give any suggestions, and most of the people have been employed for 20+ years and are so out of touch with the outside world, it is a throw back in time. 
* Annual ""anonymous"" gallop survey for the main office not favorable. Dan called all Managers together and told them ""If you don't like it hear, the door is over there, go ahead and leave now"". Very telling - and self describes the culture Dan and his inner circle create."

4959,Trader Joe's,I worked here for six months while looking for a job in my field. Fantastic short-term gig for me.,2015-03-11,4.0,Crew Member,"1) Fantastic benefits
2) Managements treat employees very well
3) Coworkers are a lot of fun
4) The work changes a lot during the day. You're on register for one hour, then working product, then helping customers. The lack of monotony made it so much better.","1) It's a grocery store
2) Not a very data-oriented company
3) Very uphill battle to gain new skills. It's on you to bug management for new training/opportunities."

If you are a hard worker and want to stay in the retail business you can work yourself up to management. Health insurance, 10% employee discount, retirement contribution, and free gym membership.","Shifts can be early, mid or late shifts between 5 am to 11 pm. Heavy lifting and being on your feet all day long is sometimes very tiring, but worth it because you will be in good shape after a couple of month."

Opportunities to advance.
Flexible hours and opportunities to transfer nationwide.","Stores are completely in control of the ""captain"", so you better hope you have a good one.

No room for a home or social life."

Insurance is really cheap for the employees.
401k plan.
10% employee discount
company minimum wage is $10.00 and hour",All the captains are given pretty much free reign over their store so they can either make a store really enjoyable or a nightmare. Unfortunately this store is a nightmare. Mates are encouraged to be degrading and micromanage. People are often rewarded and promoted by sucking up or gossiping about fellow crew members. You can meet some really awesome upbeat people here but you unfortunately can't trust anyone. Very hard to have your ideas heard or valued. Hours aren't very good if you want to have a personal life.
4964,Trader Joe's,"Fun, But Physically Taxing",2015-03-09,4.0,Crew Member,"- Great benefits (medical, dental, optical if you work 30+hrs/wk consistently; retirement)

4966,Trader Joe's,Overall a good job but prepare to work hard. Expectations are high and there is always pressure to get the job done.,2015-03-05,4.0,F/T Crew Member,"Many of the customers are die-hard fans of Trader Joe's, they love the store, they love the crew, and they show it. 

There is always something good at demo and as long as the employee isn't busy or needed elsewhere and it isn't too busy at the demo station (also depending on how long the prep is for the product being demoed), there is generally a chance during the day to give the demo a try.

Relevant to the previous, since customer satisfaction and product knowledge are so important, there are often bi-weekly if not weekly food tastings, as well as less frequent beer and/or wine tastings as well as other opportunities to try products you haven't tried before or are new.  

Very tight knit crews. There are of course egos, but crew members working together for the common good is part of Trader Joe's core ethos so the crew will always pull together to get the task done when needed.","Not really a con but you will work hard, very hard, and there is a lot of pressure to get your assigned task done, even if it means working all the way up to the eight hour limit after time for lunch is deducted.  Also, a lot of lifting and awkward movements with boxes/items is expected and required for the job.

As stated above, there are egos among both the crew members and the mates (assistant managers) which lead to difficulties. In addition, there is often a lot of inconsistency as to how policies are implemented from mate to mate, not to mention how strictly they are adhered to."

Benefits are decent if you work long enough. Fellow crew members are usually interesting people, and most stores are made up of friends.","Pay rate is barely enough to live on but to much to quit, locks you in. A lot is expected of you and it is very customer-first, the company will not take your side. The upper management and human resources department are nightmares to deal with."

4970,Trader Joe's,The hardest job I ever had.,2015-02-27,2.0,F/T Crew Member,Most employees super nice and always willing to help answer customer questions. Always food in the break room for all to eat. High quality products at fair prices. Was so excited to work there initially. Open to hiring anyone. The pay seemed good until one realized how hard the work was.,Every hour you work you are doing something different and you must be working full blast. The managers plan out where every employee will be every hour of the day. Very disconcerting. Had to always watch the time then start doing a completely different task. Had to write down every shift and every hour to be where they wanted us to be. Some of the workers were just miserable people. Some dept. managers extreme in how they wanted produce displayed but would comment after all the work was done that it was wrong. Work hours all over the place either in at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. and tons of work done after the store closes.  I have always worked very hard putting out stock on delivery day but this company receives truck daily. Very hard labor every day. Some managers very fussy. No drug tests often wondered if coworkers were stoned. No place for employees to park was told might have to use parking garage not even visible from the store. Only certain employees allowed to talk during the shift - that is what it felt like.

4985,Trader Joe's,Crew Member,2015-02-11,4.0,Crew Member,"Trader Joe's has a great environment! 90% of crew members, mates, and captains are very upbeat and put in lots of effort to keep stores running smoothly. There's lots of flexibility for hours and it's not a dead-end job. If you work hard you can get raises and if you choose to, becoming a mate isn't incredibly difficult. Most people just work here for the time being and move one though. 

There's a TJ culture that some would call cult-like. I think it's nice that there's a community at my job. It's welcoming and at times over-bearing, but still nice to experience.","It's a very labor-intensive job. I use an app on my phone to track the distance I walk in a day. It ranges anywhere from 4-8 miles in a 8 hour shift. This includes standing at the registers and taking my lunch breaks. There's also lots of lifting involved and constant bending up and down. Everyone has to be very conscious of how they are working because injuries happen and they happen often. I come home with a sore back, shoulders, arm, legs, and feet. Some days it's worse than others."
4986,Trader Joe's,Fun place to work - but be prepared to lose work/life balance once promoted,2015-02-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"You meet a lot of interesting people. Trader Joe's has a great reputation both as a store and a employer. There is a sense of comradeship when working with crews who take pride of their work. You really can build long-term friendship here. Also, benefit isn't what it used to be but it's still great!","No work/life balance once you became a mate. Be prepared for with lots of drama and politics - it's inevitable in a close-knitted work place. You can avoid it when you are a crew member, but you'll have to play the game once you're a mate, just to survive."
4987,Trader Joe's,"It's great if you can get a good captain, otherwise it's just pretty good.",2015-02-11,4.0,F/T Crew Member,"It's a relaxed culture where you can be yourself with tattoos, different hair and unique personalities (as long as you're not crabby to the customers or your crewmates). It also has a really good starting salary (especially if you have previous retail experience). As part of the Crew, you don't specialize. You will work ALL ASPECTS OF TRADER JOE'S. Everyone, from the Captain to the Mates (asst. mgrs.) to the Crew, works register, unloads trucks, stocks shelves, greets customers, works Demo (where they give food samples) and cleans up. TJ's stresses product knowledge, so we have food and wine tastings weekly.

AND if you make TJ's your career, you can have a very good life, because the Mates make VERY GOOD MONEY ($50k to $90k) and the Captains ($90k+). It's not brain surgery, folks, but if you like people and are friendly and helpful (and patient with others), you will really like Trader Joe's. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. The benefits are good (in CA, 700 hrs a year qualifies you for health insurance) and for those under 30, you get a yearly bonus (but for those over 30, you get the bonus as an IRA contribution).","Like any job, the job is only as good as its leader, and if you get a crappy Captain or lazy mates, the days can suck. The Captain at my store had 30+ years with the company, but was the most indecisive man I'd ever met. Today this, tomorrow that. It made things confusing. Also some of the Mates came in as managers, so they weren't promoted up from crew. THAT makes a huge difference! The crew would often get angry that they didn't pitch in to help enough due to a perceived sense of entitlement. Then whoever writes the schedule says our sales are low and cuts Crew on the busiest days. We all have to rush around and some have gotten hurt (including me), but we should be grateful to have a job, right?

Those who work smart aren't always rewarded, while those who have been with the company more than five years seem to put their feet up and do as much of the work as they want to. They have the best shifts, yet the majority aren't the best workers. This leads to a cascade effect where work not done or done incorrectly falls on YOU. And like every other job, there is favoritism, but as long as it doesn't affect my money, I don't care.

Oh, and the customers. The majority (85%) are nice, but the others? You have to bite your tongue and be kind when you get insulted, treated rudely or yelled at. Remember: the customer is always right, even if they're a ranting nutjob."
4988,Trader Joe's,"Crew Member (Everyone is Part-Time), unless a Mate or Captain",2015-02-10,4.0,Part Time Crew Member,"Working for Trader Joe's is not rocket science.  If you like helping people, cooking (or eating good food), and working hard...Trader Joe's is an awesome place to work!

4991,Trader Joe's,A great company to work for if you are in college,2015-02-08,4.0,Part Time Crew Member,Trader Joe's stores have a very friendly atmosphere where even though you are doing physically demanding job but you are still having a good time. The schedule is pretty flexible if you are work for the bigger stores. Health insurance and pension plan come after 4 months or so if you keep working 5 days a week. It's very easy to get transfer from store to store across the country if you are doing a good job.,"It's a very physically demanding job. Crew members are required to lift up heavy boxes up to 40 pounds and break grocery pellets. It's not easy for older employees. The promotion from crew member to mate, from mate to captain is very difficult."
4992,Trader Joe's,After further review my experience the Trader Joe's was worth it.,2015-02-05,4.0,Crew Member,"The best reasons for working with Trader Joe's as a part timer were the 10% discount, health benefits, PTO/vacation, flexible hours, casual environment, ability to transfer, 401K and other employee benefits.","Although still stronger than a lot of companies, the corporate culture and employee benefits are not nearly as strong and competitive as they once were.  Depending on the captain/full timers and the overall store, the crew member climate has a tendency to differ significantly.  Although benefits change and evolve, the captain has the ability to manipulate matters and provide direction tempering negative outcomes and lasting damage."

Benifitts, or we had them until the company cut them, cut out all the good things we had, like good health care coverage, tasting programs, store parties, overtime, and more.  We used to have nice things.","The place is so felching worried about the SPPH that they kill their employees.  Do more with less, constantly.  We hit a sales day with a $400 spph.  The store was a wreck, the employees frazzled, backs injured, etc   In short, the company is too incredibly greedy and does NOT care about the employee or the employee safety anymore.

Coworkers are for the most part extremely good natured and caring.,"Injuries are rampant, as are safety violations. Safety standards are put in place and then ignored.  Concerns raised about safety are routinely ignored. Food safety standards are inconsistent. People are targeted for termination and fired on absurd charges. Benefits have gradually and consistently been cut over the past eight years. Managers who have multiple harassment complaints are transferred from store to store rather than fired. Relationships between managers and subordinates often result in a transfer for the subordinate and no disciplinary action for the manager. There is a glaring lack of female representation in management. Gender discrimination varies from store to store, but manifests most often in duties assigned and rate of pay over time. Crewmembers are told they can be fired for discussing their wage or raises. Raise structure changes about as often as raises are due. There is no consistent process for being able to understand how to earn a raise, and in some cases people are lied to about what would be necessary to earn a raise."

Company surveys sent out to employees every year and they really do take action and make changes if many voice concerns about something. Great opportunity for promotions and raises if you perform well.

TJ's is closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Day and has shortened hours the other major holidays.","My cons are more about the grocery industry in general, not Trader Joe's.

A nice little 10% discount.,"I can't speak for other stores, but there is a complete and utter disconnect between the mates and our captain. However, if you have half of a brain in terms of retail sensibilities, its easy to see how this is the case when your regional doesn't stop by more than twice a year. It seems that the only question asked when hiring people is ""Do you have a pulse?"" because even though we are supposed to hire the cream of the crop, it appears that we are no longer even trying to reach mediocre (though the proper term to use to describe recent hires at my store is disgraceful). When seasoned and knowledgeable crew members try to Kaizen (one of our core values! though at my store, one of the most ignored) various aspects of the store, they are called complainers and negative. Crew members who steal, hide in the breakroom and openly trash customers on the sales floor are enabled and ignored in order to avoid confrontation and bad survey scores (of which they are graded upon). Hours are cut uniformly, instead of being based upon production and merit. Now that we need 30 hours (instead of 20) for health insurance, this can be problematic for those who do need our benefits and work at 100% every day. Trader Joe's is constantly reminding you via letters mailed to your house about how great things are and why we should be so grateful about having this job, which I find to be terribly ironic. The more people tend to insist that something is true, it usually turns out the be quite the opposite. I guess they are trying to convince themselves... because those of us at the bottom are apparently the only ones who are really aware at how awful things have gotten."

5036,Trader Joe's,Joining Trader Joe's as a manager (mate) was a career mistake.,2014-12-21,1.0,Mate (Assistant Manager),Decent starting pay. Get to try new food. Excellent health insurance. Great retirement package.  Worked with some fun people.  That's pretty much it.,"This review is intended for people who are thinking about joining Trader Joe's store management from the outside.

Starting compensation was decent, but yearly bonuses were laughable. My first year bonus was 1.2% of salary... For the entire year. 

Work/Life balance is atrocious and completely unhealthy.  Mates work a waterfall schedule. Here's an example: tues and wed off; thurs 2:30pm-12:30am; fri 1pm-11pm; sat 8am-6pm; sun 5am-3pm; mon 4am- 2pm.  

Store level management:  most of the other managers I worked with were promoted to mate and had several years experience working in trader Joe's, rather than hired directly into mate like myself.  Nearly all of them were uneducated, lazy, entitled, and would not last more than a few months in a manager position at anywhere else except maybe Walmart.  There is a strong disconnect between internal mates and external mates.  I was met with cold shoulders and it was difficult to find one of them to help me learn the business. 

Captains:  I worked under 3 captains and while all were very nice, none of them really knew how to manage a store.  I don't blame them necessarily, I blame trader Joe's lack of training and development.  This also explains why you have captains who have been at the store level for over 20 years.  They aren't gaining the skills and experience to go on to something bigger and better.  A lot of people with golden handcuffs.

Employees:  most crew members usually did as little as possible.  There were a few that worked extremely hard but most of them just didn't care.  A lot of people with no direction, no work ethic, and zero drive to better themselves. 

Work environment:  although in a management position, as a mate you're just a glorified crew member.  Breaking down pallets, stocking shelves, turning a key on a register to open it because cashiers are not allowed to do it themselves, working a forklift, are all common.  This a blue collar job and it will wear your body down fast.  A lot of injuries due to repetitive stress.  

Getting transferred to different stores:  in my 2+ years at trader Joe's I worked at 3 different stores.  There was no reason behind moving people around.  They also did not care to keep people close to home.  Some of the other mates had an hour commute both ways on top of working the waterfall schedule.

Overall: Worst job I've ever had and I am blessed to have found a new career. This is a dead end management job.  I would only recommend to people who are comfortable having no life and don't mind doing the same thing day after day for the rest of their lives.  It's retail management and it sucks no matter how you look at it."
5037,Trader Joe's,Heaven on Earth,2014-12-21,5.0,Crew Member,They are very good to there employees. All the equipment is in perfect operating condition. They set reasonable expectations for there employees. You don't become a liability when you start to make good money.,None compared to other grocery stores I've worked in.
5038,Trader Joe's,Great Place to start working,2014-12-20,4.0,Crew Member,They teach you true customer service at Trader Joes. They take care of their employee's and it's a very good work environment. Flexible with hours.,You run into some very challenging customers. Other than that I can't really find any cons it's a great place.
5039,Trader Joe's,"This is a grocery store, don't expect to hang out and drink coffee all day.",2014-12-20,4.0,Part Time Crew Member,"Most crew members are nice to work with; mates at my store are friendly and supportive, great captain who is humble enough to work on the floor and to stand in line when shopping for himself, eat with the crew and talk to everyone.

I like that in case of disagreements, the mates or the captain are able to keep an unbiased viewpoint, or so it seems.

I find that the ""attendance policy"" with warnings etc. is very fair. Serves well, if one has an emergency or a major problem where they can't exactly bring ""doctors notes"" etc. And the the records of the offences are being erased after 90 days.

Generally speaking, I really like going to work and am looking forward to it (and I am generally a very picky person as far as employers go).

We don't get too many obnoxious or self-entitled customers. Occasionally you'll get them, but that's not a norm.

10% off groceries and booze is nice! So is a 401k plan. (Not sure if I will get a health plan because I am not planning to reach 30 hrs/ week work load.)

Generally speaking, this is a great place to work and I believe that if one has the right personality and will, it's also a great place to be promoted to a mate level. Other than that, yeah, this is a grocery store, the work is physical and it's not paid like if you were a Wall Street banker or a marketing manager. However, I think one can learn different aspects of running a grocery store here for a better than average in industry wage and I think that if someone is looking for a less physical job for more pay, they should just meanwhile look for something more fitting. Many better paying jobs actually require or consider retail experience very important and Trader Joe's is one of the better companies to acquire that experience. My two cents...","I am nitpicking here, really.

Basically what they want (at least in my store) is part-time workers with full-time workers' commitment in all aspects - time commitment, emotional commitment, dedication and loyalty. That can feel pretty ""soul-sucking"" or like a ""cult"", as others have described and is pretty much the reason why I'm rating TJ's with 4 stars. The antidote to this issue is to come in and do the best you can, but have the guard up enough to not be sucked out of your shell at the end of the day.
 
They emphasize how they value ""having life outside work"", but it can be problematic to get a particular evening off if you are typically scheduled for closing shifts - even if you have an almost open availability to work at different times of day as well.

Apparently morning shifts are almost exclusively reserved for ""seasoned crew members"" (people who have worked for TJ's 5+ years) and so are, apparently, for a big part, day shifts.

From what I hear, injuries are common. Do yourself a favor, get decent shoes. You will get run over by crew members with two-wheelers, by customers with shopping carts etc. Also, you should stretch and learn about safe lifting techniques. There is no official training on safety so your best bet is to talk to the ""seasoned crew members"" who will 99% of the time be open to educate you on one-on-one basis about safety and injury prevention. Although, in the 10-day training everyone will generally talk about safety and if you ask, they will show you how to lift etc. Also - get decent gloves because you will work in frozen section from time to time.

Prepare to over-use a hand sanitizer or come down sick often. Why? Because you will handle cash and many of the ""seasoned crew members"" have warned that that's where catching a flu comes from. Also - wearing plastic gloves is not permitted at the check-out. (Some customers complained about feeling offended to deal with cashiers who wear gloves a few years ago so they prohibited wearing gloves at the checkout. Not strictly enforced though, from what I see and hear.)  
 
I don't like their confrontation tactics which because I find them intimidating: they will approach you out of blue, lead you outside and confront you and there will always be a ""witness"" mate with the main person who confronts. I understand why the system makes sense, but just be aware of it as it can get very uncomfortable."

- Other than your pay possibly increasing through raises, seasoned crew members are given no other perks.  Their hours get cut because they are paid more, making it less likely for them to get/keep benefits, so the company keeps even more money in it's pocket."

5048,Trader Joe's,Don't work here,2014-12-12,1.0,Crew Member,Most of your co-workers at the crew level are pretty good and fun people. It is incredibly easy to fulfill the responsibilities of your job.,"Working at Trader Joes was awful. I've worked in a variety of places including some pretty awful manual labor jobs and Trader Joes is the worst job I've had yet. 

The scheduling is awful. They more or less demand open availability. I had full availability. I would often be scheduled for 8-9 days in a row because they have you work 4 at the end of one week and 4 at the start of the next. You will close (get out at 12 am to 1 am) and then be due back at 9 or 10. The day after that you're on for 4pm to 12 am again. There is no consistency and your sleep schedule will be destroyed. This is because a computer program does most of the scheduling and management is too lazy to look at what they are actually doing. Raising concerns about your schedule to management will not change anything. You are also scheduled for right around 36 hours and obtaining overtime is very difficult.

Your back will hurt. I'm not a stranger to manual labor and don't complain about it usually. The way the registers are set up is terrible for your body. To be fast which is demanded you must twist and lift. That combination is one of the worst known for your back. Look up the NIOSH recommendations for grocery workers. The Trader Joes checkout set-up disregards almost every one of them. 

They retain crew members by telling them they are in line for a promotion. People who would have left stay in the hopes of becoming a mate only to watch the company bring in new management from outside their store. 

If promoted to the mate level you can expect about a $1 raise. You make more money by working over 50 hours a week. Essentially you are rewarded by being allowed to accrue overtime. The scheduling for the mates is just as bad as the crew which results in sleep deprived and stressed out management.

In years past the 6 month review/raise was around a dollar and now it is much closer to 50 cents while the company is making more money than ever.

The captain (store manager) was entirely out of touch with what was happening in his own store and was more focused on impressing the regional manager when he would visit every couple of months. I watched him blow off valid crew member suggestions for improving the store multiple times.

Hard work is not rewarded or even appreciated. 

There is such an emphasis on customer service that it enables terrible behavior on the customers behalf. I saw crew members grabbed by customers, called names, and generally degraded/harassed. This was routine and often by a handful of regulars. 

Working here will do nothing for your advancement in life unless you are 100% committed to a career in the grocery industry. You will not leave with transferable skills that are valued by other employers other than customer service. 

Good luck."

And you can't get a second part-time job because then you're dropped from scheduling.  Our store has had almost 30% turnover in the past two years.  Another pretty crappy thing they do is advertise the great benefits, hours, and working conditions that they had 3-8 years ago, but no longer exist.  New hires are lured in with promised of promotion and great pay.

First off we have old outdated products being sent out to various stores from our
""Order pickers"" who take the online orders and send out. 
Salad's in the wharehouse are Never Rotated by the morning  Shift crews and to save the company money the ""Leads"" Will actually send out expired or ""last Day"" products to various stores in hopes of saving costs. 
Trash is everywhere and Sometimes the food spilled in the back is not cleaned up for Days until the smell gets so bad or mold starts to grow.  Food and produce is spilled over and over with no one taking ownership of what happens, accidents are prevalent almost on a Daly basis, workers are Not properly Trained on how to use equipment. When I first got hired there the agency stated there is No onsite training or management who can train new employees who come in. Basically if you say you ""know"" How to use the equipment,  your hired with No background check, No references or No Equipment license. Rodents (mice & rats) are Everywhere and tearing into dry good, produce and boxes in the building. Some of the Rat traps are right above the food boxes with dead corpses stuck in those traps sometimes for days on end until they begin to smell. 
There is No leadership and employees basically do as they please,  most take time in the break rooms and nothing gets done on the floor,  pallets are dropped, damaged and Not safely moved with no shrink wrap. I have hundreds of photos I'm sending into the Business headquarters to try and get a response back on why the distribution center is ran this way, 90% of employees don't speak any English so when you need something done, there is a severe lack of communication.  If you see this review, ask the management in the stores how carefully there products are sent to there stores for consumer use."

Those fired or demoted are older for the most part. TJ's does not acknowledge that accuracy, proper product placement and rotation is more important than how fast you can ""throw"" product.In its zeal to increase profit, TJ's ignores many practices that cost them money. They'd rather promote a know-nothing younger employee (and what I mean is they haven't been there long enough to know enough to be promoted) than let someone with knowledge and experience get ahead - it's all about how much money you make.

Benefits are good -- dental and vision for working at least 17.5 hours per week, full medical for working at least 30 hours per week -- and the company pays something like 75% of your premium. Paid time off is accrued as you work.

They are pretty flexible about schedules. For the most part, you can decide what days and hours you work.","There is a major lack of organization and communication within the company. When messages are sent from corporate, they often don't make it all the way through the chain down to the lower employees, or they are really different when they get there. Hence, we will hear different messages from each mate, and I'm sure each store's mates are hearing different messages from each captain.

Each store's art department is expected to find its own equipment and is given a very small budget to do so. Each store's computers and printers are provided by a central office, and most are 10+ year old machines that have been refurbished countless times. Transferring files to or from our computers is extremely difficult, because we can't access any websites except traderjoes.com, and most of the computers have no usb ports. Each store does have its own wifi signal, but its name is kept secret and it is undiscoverable by outside devices.

Regional managers visit the store several times a year and make drastic decisions about our day-to-day operations without good reasons and without really seeing the effects.

Almost everyone is required to work at least one weekend day. There is an ""everyone does everything"" policy, which mandates that every employee must work at the registers and/or stock merchandise, regardless of department or specialty."

Pay and benefits were well above average. Employees received a generous retirement package and paid time off. Management was fair, respectful, and courteous. However, this is no longer the case. The company has gone downhill, taking advantage of employees by working them to the ground and not compensating you fairly. Quarterly reviews are now bi-annual reviews, in which employees rarely receive even a $.50 raise. Prior to these changes, employees were eligible for a $1 raise every 3 months (which I received on numerous accounts). Additionally, the generous company retirement package has been reduced to a measly 401K plan. 

The days of selling unique, high-quality products from around the world are gone and have been replaced with cheap, unhealthy products in flashy packages (just look at the sodium and sugar content in most of the food - its ridiculous!). It seems corporate spends more on product marketing than employee satisfaction and well-being.The company has lost sight of its bedrock principles of integrity and respect, and has given in to corporate greed. Trader Joe's is now just another mainstream grocery store.","Daily tasks can become routine and repetitive. Lack of growth, unless you are interested in store management (would not recommend). The job is also very taxing on your body, so make sure to practice safe lifting techniques and don't hesitate to ASK for help!

Dealing with customers can really drain you emotionally at the end of the day as the diversity and variety of people that you interact with can really influence the experience you have. While thats obvious for any customer service position, however i feel that Trader Joes is particularly unique in that we are obligated to go out of our way to help customers; and because a lot of them know this you can be taken advantage of and more or less have to suck it up. The manual labor can be particularly taxing and you must make sure to adhere to proper techniques for lifting and other tasks in order to ensure no injury as it is all too easy to injure yourself. There are also politics in play with some of the management for earning raises and thats disappointing. Management also sometimes does a poor job of scheduling the amount of crew necessary to close the store in an adequate and timely manner which really burdens the crew that are helping. Moving up in the company isnt hard but it also isnt easy.

TJ's uses a 2 star rated iPhone only app -DayForce- for employees to request vacation, sick leave, etc. The only other way is to track down the singular manager responsible for scheduling at least a 2 weeks in advance to place a request. There're are no TJ afforded/addressed emails to management that could expedite this process and good luck reaching anyone if you're sick and have to open at 5am. It's the most antiquated systems I've ever had the displeasure of working with. 

All employees were forced to use our/their own cell phone data to fill out post hire documentation --wifi is available, but kept greedily from employees & the hiring process. Out-of-date cheap training materials & computers give off the distinct atmosphere of a 2 bit bodega & not the image of the fastest growing ""children of god-esque"" replica... ahem, grocery store in America. 

A 2 hr orientation took 6 hours due to ridiculous needless miscommunication, inexperience, a nonexistent HR, constant technical failures (inadequate computing power aforementioned) & interruptions as there was no space separate from the 100+ degree break room to process new hires. The introductory training content & direction were disgustingly condescending at best.   

Scheduling & pay were after thoughts & addressed half heartily at the end of the day. 

My favorite ridiculous-ism was the non-confident assertion that ""integrity"" was, ""...just about being nice to people and stuff..."" - Manager

The GM (Captain) was so socially awkward, he made the others look adequate, when they were just as bad. 

There was an overwhelming sense of false/faux equal treatment for equal work with the white men holding the highest positions & wielding the most control & power, while the female higher ups (all 2 to the men's 7 @ least) were constantly abrasive, unprofessional & defensive as if they had had enough of inaction to right the proverbial ship of obvious inequalities & were determined to react irrationally at or around anyone anytime no matter the reason, nor the company kept & that included in front of the glassy eyed patrons, whose questions went unanswered, irritatingly passed off, or were given completely false & concocted out-of-thin-air responses that presented TJs in the angelic light  the kool-aid drinkers with their purple stained lips thought it deserved. 

An overall  poor performance from the top down -- I came home bewildered & wondering if all the red flags had been shown or if it was just a really bad day at the park. Sadly, I should've walked away. While not tasting the kool-aid, a glass was poured and I kept it on ice. In my case I got out before I was forced to drink it.

For a place that wants to be considered a family of friends, it fails on almost every level through forced, coerced, fake & out-of-date methods that actually give off the impression that it IS all just an act.  No one cares. The company is cheap. The equality is fake. The trust is paper thin. There is no integrity above ""...just being nice to people and stuff..."""

The following isn't about TJ's so much as the workers comp company they hire: The workers comp rep I had was a monster. Others who dealt with her had the same experiences. Word to the wise: if you deal with workers comp record EVERY call. They will lie and then accuse you of lying. She even changed her name half way through and used several different combinations of the two in our correspondence which was just confusing and unprofessional. Several times I received extra checks because the state comp board saw that they were cheating me and forced them to cough up the dough. Comp Drs covered were a joke, and repeated made paperwork mistakes that delayed my checks (which were less than $50 a week in NYC which is literally less than a panhandler can make in half a day). Several years later and my left arm still hurts. Probably will for the rest of my life. It's a sad legacy of a job I truly enjoyed."

Employees now have to work a minimum of 30 hours per week to qualify for health benefits whereas it used to be 17.5 hours weekly. This has negatively impacted longtime crew members and morale is down. Lots of favoritism. There is also little room for advancement if you're a woman who plans on having a family.

10% discount on already cheap products is nice
Employees are encouraged to be themselves
Coworker/Customer harassment and abuse is not tolerated 
Job is not as monotonous and boring as most retail jobs…you are never on register for more than 3 hours
Transferring to other stores all over the country is fairly easy and done consistently, which is great since TJs is located in most major cities. 
Coworkers are fun, intelligent, great attitude (mostly)
Many customers are kind, interesting, funny. There is definitely a higher level of customer interaction.
If you work long enough, you can make a decent hourly wage. But it will take a while.","On the flip side of the high level of customer service, you also have customers who expect you to bend over backwards for them which can result in unbelievable requests.
It is a retail job…it is monotonous. After about 3 months you have learned everything you will learn and then it is just clocking your hours and getting through the day.
For most employees, schedules are not consistent and in the slow season your hours will be drastically cut without consideration for your financial needs.
Management unabashedly plays favorites with employees which, if you're not a favorite, will affect your hours and pay. 
Promotions are rare and not based on merit. In the stores in my area, we have had several promotions of people who are simply awful. My store, at least, is ridiculously sexist. Unqualified men get promoted over qualified women constantly. 
Pretty much every long term employee has a back injury. 
Training is virtually nonexistent."
5127,Trader Joe's,Great experience for the inexperienced,2014-09-05,4.0,Crew Member,"They have a practice of hiring crew members for attitude instead of inherent skill. It's groceries, after all. Not rocket science. Crew members are trained in every aspect of the store; from basic stocking practices to more advanced ordering and receiving deliveries. Management always fosters crew development. If you want to move up, you have the opportunity to do so.",It's a physical job. You're expected to lift heavy cases of all sorts of stuff. Some managers give preferential treatment or micromanage to a fault. It's inevitable but upper management should keep an eye on these individuals. Low morale is a critical issue in such a customer-service heavy job.
5128,Trader Joe's,Company has been on the decline for the past decade.,2014-09-04,1.0,Captain,It's fast paced and very active. Products are well priced and the quality is ok...except for the perishables. There are a lot of quality people working in the stores but most everyone wishes the company would reverse it's current course.,"Company has integrity issues. There is a big disconnect between management and the crew. You never know what is going to happen next and there is a general fear factor that is supposed to be motivating. The CEO leads from an elite and entitled perspective, blanketing his ""Chairmen Circle"" with I am god mentality that has everyone running scared. The basic format has been greatly changed and the result has crew members scratching their heads in frustration. What was once a great company to work for is now a place that barely resembles  a fun and upbeat environment, it's turning into just another grocery store where nobody really wants to work."
5129,Trader Joe's,Going to work is like going home!,2014-09-04,5.0,Crew Member,"Great people (employees and customers), positive environment, ability to help people, good benefits, learning environment about food..",Scheduling is a week or less in advance.
5130,Trader Joe's,It's a sad skeleton of what was an exemplary retailer in how to treat and retain customers and employees.,2014-08-28,1.0,Crew Member,"As a company, Trader Joe's has not yet found a way to control the thoughts of individual employees. So, you can still think what you want, but your opinion is not welcome (because Kaizen is ancient history.)","As a company, the Trader Joe's I was hired by no longer exists. The culture we once embraced is gone. The employees have been smacked in the face with the new reality but the customers are just beginning to figure it out. 

Benefits and pay raises have been slashed, any perk available on the store level has been cut, no incentives for employees or even a thank you at the end of the day. There is a universal feeling that management is gunning for highly paid and/or older workers- hiring lots of youth and making life difficult for higher paid established workers. Store management is in complete turmoil, running scared of the corporate drones. The product quality has declined to the point where there is not any consistency from one shipment to the next. Trader Joe's is always looking for a cheaper way to produce a product and most of the time it comes in reductions in size or quality. The labeling errors are at best hideous, and at the worst, legally actionable. We say we don't add MSG to our products but that's only because we can call it 50 other things to try and fool you. There is no safety equipment in the stores so the injuries to employees from repetitive stress injuries are rampant. Scheduling is spotty, full schedule one week, no days the next. Take a sick day? Uh Oh, the next week you find few hours. This reeks of punitive scheduling practices. 

The CAPTAIN of the store is the one in charge and to whom the middle managers answer. This is the individual who has a finger on the pulse of the store and controls the total environment- for the crew and the customers. A great Captain will run a tight ship with high standards, clear expectations, and a happy and productive crew. These captains are few and far between because of the pivotal shift in the direction of the company. Overall, the morale of the employees company wide has taken a nose dive from the days where we had great benefits at 20 hours a week, decent raises based on performance, and wonderful retirement. That's all history now, and it shows on the face of every employee who experienced the decline. Customers are seeing the new culture now, employees are not as happy as they used to be.  

Management is unprofessional. Managers are inexperienced and misdirected as to what management really means. It doesn't mean being the company cop, or gossip facilitator, or the one who hangs out in the back doing nothing for hours. It means LEADING A CREW TO ACCOMPLISH A GOAL by mentoring rather than standing around talking with their fellow do nothings. Crew working with management on this level is frustrating and unproductive. It is a wide spread problem.

Favoritism and gossip being spread by management is rampant. Not a favorite- better watch your back and every word that comes out of your mouth, as your semi annual review will be written by someone you don't work with and will be based on gossip. Have a difficult customer? Be prepared to defend every word you said to them, because if a customer is not happy there is a crew member to blame and if you are the daily target, it might be you. 

Top management in the store fails to lead, perpetuates negative morale with out of place and sometimes public employee reprimands, and has trumped up issues to collect write ups to force employees out the door over minor issues that do not lead to firing of all employees, just the ones on the hit list (older and/or highly compensated). It does appear to be a company wide trend to force out the high wage and/or older employees...

5131,Trader Joe's,"Amazing benefits, long hours, high production expected of you.",2014-08-28,4.0,Mate (Assistant Manager),"Benefits are great with an ample health and vision insurance, dental is OK.  Possible performance bonus once a year and annual generous raises.  Passionate employees and well informed and educated customers make the time at work fly by.",Hours are long and inconsistent. For managers the overtime is what is best but working 49.5 hours/ week can be brutal especially because of the consistent schedule. One day you are working a closing shift and 3 days later you are opening the store.  Chances of advancement are slim.
5132,Trader Joe's,"Overall positive employee atmosphere, high pressure on management level employees",2014-08-26,4.0,Part Time Crew Member,"Trader Joe's is one of the best places I have worked when it comes to employee treatment - this is to say that they try to treat their employees as humans with consideration to home and family life.  They are flexible with your scheduling needs.

Trader Joe's does not get too caught up in appearance in the hiring process.  Tattoos and piercings are definitely not a problem.  They are looking for intelligent, like-minded individuals.  I enjoy working in a crowd of people who are fairly intelligent.

The workday in Trader Joe's is not too monotonous.  No one is typically hired for just one function.  Everyone stocks, cashiers, etc.  The day is broken up into hour-long blocks and you are usually not on one task for too long. 

The rate at which they hire employees is largely based on prior experience.  This can be a huge benefit to those who do have management experience, but aren't necessarily entering TJ's as a manager.  They value the experience and pay you higher rates based on such experience.","There is certainly heavy-lifting involved.  Everyone is expected to do all aspects of the job.  So if you are afraid of manual labor, this may not be the place for you.  

If you are looking to move up, expect to work here for quite some time.  I was hired at a pay rate much higher than most of the people in the ""crew"" level because of my extensive management experience in previous jobs.  However, after having been working here for 4 months, I am no closer to any higher level of responsibility and the general consensus seems to be that it takes 1 year or better before there is any chance of moving up. 

As with most retail, if you are part-time, your hours can vary greatly.  Summer-time up north is a slow season and your hours can get cut drastically.  Don't expect to always have a steady income if you are not a full-time employee.

Management seems to sometimes get a little puffed up and often do not follow through with things.  As a manager myself, this is a little irksome because I feel it impacts the trust and respect from the employees, which impacts morale."

They have some Crew Members that don't do anything and you will have to pick up the slack. Some customers come in and feel entitled. The company is changing and they are messing with the pay scale and benefits. Everyday is repetitive.

When I was working there part time and full time employees had health insurance but i believe they changed that this year (2014). You earn days off through Absence Reserve system (paid time off), it takes a while to earn a few days worth of AR but when you get enough and decide to use it, you can, no questions asked, super easy. Great for students, they will work around your school schedule. Very fun environment to work in. Holidays and randomly themed days are fun to work because you can dress up. Examples include: Halloween, Bowtie Day, Mustache Day. Every couple of months they do a paid Crew Tasting so you get to eat free food and gain product knowledge. Every year they do a bowling party at chelsea piers and in the summer do a catered crew lunch party at the boat basin cafe on riverside park. Opportunity to move up in the company is always there if you work hard and prove yourself. Customers can be really amazing, kind, funny, memorable (ill never forget pink haired breast cancer survivor woman, she was so amazing) and the elderly couple that are so in love and have been together forever it makes you want to cry cuz its so darn sweet.","Customers can be effing crazy, demanding, flat out weird-o's, rude, insane (but for every nut job you've got 10 good ones). If you're sick and you can't make it to work you have to bring a doctors note with you next time you come in to work or else it counts as a strike against you. So if you're sick with something ""simple"" like the flu, which i don't consider worthy of going to a doctor for because there is nothing they can do about it except tell u to get over the counter medicine; you essentially go to the doctor and pay a co-pay for a piece of paper. The job is VERY PHYSICALLY INTENSE! Many people including myself have suffered multiple work related injuries. If you're in shape and can do a lot of heavy, repetitive lifting then you should be okay. Some common injuries include: wrist nerve/muscle pain and upper and lower spinal injuries (aka neck and lower back) from incorrectly heavy lifting or heavy lifting in excess. Most of your shift you will be at the register ringing people up and it can get exhausting and repetitive IF you're not TRYING to make it fun."

I've never been treated so poorly in my life.  No matter what store I work at within the company.  False enthusiasm.

If not you can ""walk the plank"" as they say.    Harassment is rewarded, there are no unions, device tactics that make us compete for bread crumbs while stepping on your fellows to get some more crumbs.  Intimidation and neurotic fear is the underlining current in the air among workers.  But as long as we are forced to smile you think we are happy.","rediculously high  job ""performance"" standards.

Great management staff who spend much time on the development of the crew.,have to deal with the general public.  You don't get to spend much time with your family because you spend so much time at work.  You have to do lots of heavy lifting which can quickly run your body down into the ground.

Managers sit in the office all day while crew members run the store. Crew members who have been there for a long time and work hard are expected to make up all the work while the slackers slide by, while they end up getting the same raise as the people who work hard because it is a flat rate.

I enjoyed the people that I worked with, and I appreciated that Trader Joe's lets you try their foods so you know what you're working with. It's a positive place to work. Difficult to get in because so many people want to work there, but once you're in you're one of the lucky ones...who works in grocery stores.","Monotonous, repetitious, physically demanding. Dealing with a lot of customers, and during the holiday season can be an enormous amount of pressure. There's an underlying corporateism, and the company continues to get more corporate. Mostly, just dealing with the kinds of people who come into a grocery store...which means just about all kinds of people. Gotta be good with customers. Or else...what are you doing working in a grocery store?"
5185,Trader Joe's,Restructuring not good,2014-06-29,3.0,Crew Member,Flexible schedule. Good food and tastings. Not stuck doing same work all the time. Cool coworkers. Benefits are still good even though they have declined dramatically.,Restructuring really hurt the company as far as morale and benefits. Morale at all time low since I have been working there. The way they demoted merchants at every single store in the company was completely unfair and unjust. They picked new merchants based on favoritism. The training for managers is poor. Managers need to be trained before they are promoted not as a work in progress. Then they can tell if they are leaders or not. That is the way they use to do it. Just because someone is a good worker does not mean they can manage or lead.
5186,Trader Joe's,Too many (temporary) cooks in one kitchen,2014-06-28,3.0,Part Time Crew Member,"Co-workers are great, the atmosphere is really positive and upbeat overall. Most of the employees tend to be creative, artsy and educated. The benefits are very good, and that alone is worth putting in 30 hours or more every week. If you want to advance into section leader, merchant or mate, there are definitely opportunities to advance.","There are too many mates (managers) and they don't stay long at one store, so they come and go. That means a lot of inconsistency: half of them don't know your strengths, or they tend to forget when they set up the schedule. By the time they know you well, they're gone. There are many Dr. Jekylls and Mr. Hydes. You can confide in a mate who seems sympathetic and understanding to your concerns one day, but the next day that  same mate may throw you under the bus over the same issue. It has happened to me and several co-workers. The captain at our store is not very approachable, and mostly absent. If you want to talk to the captain, then schedule that meeting days in advance. Some departments at the store are left to figure out things for themselves."

The product was good that you could speak genuinely to customers about it and the discount was useful although the food isn't too expensive to begin with. Hours are good.","The managers are very disorganized and not helpful but most of all THE EMPLOYEES ARE SO RUDE. I have never had to work with such hateful mean people. Even the managers join in and pick on you. Everyone talks about you (usually poorly) openly despite if it is true or not. I have worked at multiple trader joe's during the short time I stayed there and has happened at every one I've worked at. The managers claim they are here to help you, but burn you when speaking to other employees and play favoritism on person as opposed to work ethic.

My guess, the people there don't pay attention or speak a word of English.

Being on the register for a full day one day, then off and on every hour the next day is not cool, have a little bit of structure, yes?

Scheduling - You can have people on a rotational schedule, rather than haphazardly giving people random days to cater to those that want specific days off.

Have assigned sections - If you want your store to be a bit organized, have sections, rotate people around those sections."
5202,Trader Joe's,Pretty good company to work for,2014-06-10,4.0,Crew Member,"Great place to work if you care about not only good food and nutrition, but also if you care about things other than just ringing a cash register. They allow employees to engage in many different types of work (sales, marketing, customer service) and every hour of your shift is rotated carefully so you don't get ""stuck"" doing one thing for too long. Timely employee reviews.","Way too many politics in management (full-timers, and also higher-ups in our region). Interfered with the fun work environment; made it politically-correct. While I know this is the case at many employers, Trader Joe's used to be known for its employee quirkiness, and to have that taken away made it feel like just another store."

Mostly relaxed atmosphere to work in. A place where you can have fun while working. It was a perfect job for when I was in college.,No upward mobility and favoritism is a factor.

5210,Trader Joe's,Great company culture with open communication among management.,2014-06-02,4.0,Mate (Assistant Manager),Relatively good pay for a grocer. The culture is by far the best among other competitors. Fun team building worker appreciation days that are not required but rather desirable and have good participation and attendance. Great coworkers.,Some of the stores can be extremely busy and the work can be strenuous. You are required to provide a certain customer service experience and as a result customers can be abusive and rude. Benefits have become increasingly worse as Trader Joe's has grown and become more corporate. As a result the quality of the employee has suffered as the starting positions has become less attractive.

I was out on worker's compensation for a thoracic sprain in my back and a traumatic head injury.  When I returned to work they decreased my hours and gave me a poor review on my (statistically proven to be bare minimum acceptable for a good review) work record.  They told me I would have no problem transfering stores when moving with my family.  When I tried to transfer stores the captain at my original store recommended they not hire me, and so the company blacklisted me.  Since the company was bought out and corporatized, the whole treatment of employees has gone down hill from what I understand having spoken with many TJ's veterans.  I would not recommend this as a place to work long term."
5212,Trader Joe's,Customer and Employee Experiences Are Completely Different,2014-05-26,4.0,Crew Member,"Good level of training. If you're a believer of the products, this is your chance to help customers appreciate them as well. You won't really have a choice anyway, since a high level of customer service is mandatory. Entry-level starting pay is competitive. Stores are laid out well; not oppressive and gloomy like other chains. If you're friendly and work hard, advancement is do-able... just let management know you'd be interested in running a store in the future. If you want to work in grocery, this is a good place to start.","As a customer surrounded by helpful people, you might not notice the following ""cons."" This is like any job where you work with fellow grunts: you'll run in to plenty of lazy people. I had worked at a decent corporate job previously and had forgotten how bitter, crude and flirty co-workers could be behind the scenes. Depending on the store you work at, receiving and moving the pallets can range from tough to brutal. The Mates (people in the Hawaiian shirts) shoulder a ton of responsibility. If you work at a busy store, you'll have to tone down your desire to keep the shelves full; helping the sometimes-high-maintenance customers and running the registers trumps restocking."

-Product driven company. If you love food, then this is the place to be. No wasting time with lottery machines, money orders, patio furniture, bus passes, gift card malls, coinstar machines, all the things that bog down the ""traditional"" grocery store. 
-Non union. Unless you like being a slave to a seniority list or being at the whim of union leaders and their unrealistic contract demands, then work hard, have a good attitude, and you'll be fine. 
-10% employee discount may be lower than other companies, but considering that most things are already value priced, it's a nice bonus.","-You will work nights and weekends, but who really wants to sit in an office 8-5 Monday through Friday, fighting traffic both ways and all the crowds on the weekend?
-Medical benefits may be hard to qualify for as a part timer, but unless you've been sleeping under a rock for 20 years, that's just the world we live in. 
-Each store is unique. Find a store with a captain that shares your ideals and experience. Otherwise, you probably won't get the job to begin with or you'll just be frustrated."

Recently there have been big changes in management and brand new rules every day I walk in. This is my first big corporation that I have ever worked for so these changes are disconcerting to me. The benefits have changed negatively in the past 8 months and it is not as attractive to work here as 2 years ago when I started here. The paid time off is okay but not enough, around 4 or 5 days a year. It is hard labor- one has to lift up to 50 Lbs and many of my friends have hurt themselves.

It's very easy for a store to look good for 5 minutes when the regional comes in. The drama is not escapable. In my stores case it's the management that causes it. Feedback is horrendous and The management tends to either wait for your reviews or cut your hours before they give you feedback. The hours are inconsistent and can change drastically week to week.

Authors, artists, musicians, students and more, all make for a great mix of people to spend your working time with.","Work life balance can be difficult unless everyone you spend time with also works the odd hours retail requires.  That stupid cliche ""the customer is always right"" gets in the way of what is actually right."
5226,Trader Joe's,I'd do it again.,2014-05-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you work hard, have a good attitude, don't get involved in personal dramas it's decent place to work. Like any other job your experience depends largely on what kind of managers you have. The company wants you to grow, but its up to you ask for more training and special skills. Stores try to be flexible to student schedules. 10 % discount on store groceries is a great benefit. Usually a fun place, fast paced.",It can be physically demanding so entry jobs are best for the young and fit. The benefits are not what they used to be and the corporation is changing. It can be difficult to keep part-time benefits if they can't or won't schedule the amount of hours needed to stay qualified. Managers move around a lot. You build a nice working relationship with a manager and then they move them to another store for training.
5227,Trader Joe's,On the decline,2014-05-07,4.0,Crew Member,"Generally, the company has taken care of its employees, though I hear things much less favorable now. There was a chance to do well with reviews, and they were reasonably simple to predict. Note that this review is primarily based on when I worked there.","Trend in reviews have been poor. Also, the further corporatization of the company has led to a decidedly less appealing work place. When I left, the store (a store less than 5 years old), there was still a feeling of family amongst the crew, management included. It has turned adversarial since then: genuinely lazy managers, refusal to promote personal growth or development, less emphasis on customer experience, further degradation of the produce quality."

And anyone with a great attitude and strong work ethic can move up fast if they choose to do so.,"When the customer is king, sometimes they get used to a certain level of service and take advantage of the crew's patience, the company's return policy, etc. Stellar customer service can breed high maintenance customers."
5230,Trader Joe's,Meh.,2014-05-05,2.0,Crew Member,"The majority of the co-workers, the hourly wage (considering that as a crew member you are a part-time employee), the 10% discount the company offers you for being an employee.","Highly physical and repetitive type of work (e.g. working up to 5 hours at the checkout, lifting goods that can weight in the excess of 50 pounds, bending in awkward ways to be able to stock shelves, working in the milk box which is set at a very low temperature), lacks creativity (unless you happen to be the sign artist), hard work is often overlooked and not kept in consideration by management, dealing with rude and pretentious customers on a daily basis, managers that are not qualified to manage."
5231,Trader Joe's,Crew,2014-05-04,2.0,Crew Member,Opportunity to help people.  The customers are very appreciative for the most part and are totally in love with the store and the products.,It used to be a great place to work but the company has changed a great deal.  They are cutting hours and hiring a ton more people.  The more people they hire the more hours they cut from crew members that have been there for a long time.  The atmosphere has completely changed.  Employees used to be happy and now everyone is on edge and miserable. (that is except for the new hires who do not know what it was like in the past)  They have entered the Walmart mentality.    Expect to hurt!! Your body will take a major beating!!!  They do not guarantee hours so expect to be on edge every week waiting to see if you will be able to cover your bills.
5232,Trader Joe's,The company is listening!!!!,2014-05-04,4.0,Mate,Removing overtime for non Mate crew(and letting them keep their high pay rate was more than fair).  Defining the Merchant role as the customer experience cheerleader and choosing the right people. Re-promoting Mates who were good that had been promoted from within but stepped down because of the gross disparity in pay compared to off-the-street hires. Promoting new Mates from within the part-time crew.  Raises  twice a year for part timers. Excellent benefits. New management structure. New operational structure should benefit all. Raises were higher last review period.,Crazy schedule for full timers. (Normal for retail).  Not knowing what changes will happen next( but it's a work in progress). Knowing loyalty to the company doesn't have much standing(part time crew is really the only crew safe from restructuring)   Only Mates carry keys now. This will cause huge logistical nightmares when 3 bells start ringing!

Your daily log will usually vary, and you can direct what you do more of over time based on your likes and strengths.",Healthcare coverage was excellent. You are now required to work a 5 hour workweek to maintain those benefits so doing something else ( which alot of people do and worked part-time at TJ's for full benefits) is more difficult and if so keeping benefits is harder if even possible.

A new manager in my store changed the whole vibe and made it a great store to work at.

-Good food and many food tastings. 
-10% discount. Can't go wrong with that. 
-With enough notice, you can take off basically as much as you want
-Ability to work the hours you want (if your store is big enough). 
-Bonus (cash if you're under 30, money into your pension if you're over 30)
-AR starts accumulating after 6 months of work","-Management literally does nothing. Most managers are extremely lazy and pass all work along to the crew members. If they like you, you get an easy day's log. If they don't, they'll put you down for long and tiring tasks. They micromanage to make sure you do the work they are responsible for. 
-You are required to work at least one weekend day. 
-They purposely schedule you in such a way so that you can't qualify for the health benefits. 
-The entire staff is a slave to the antics of the captain. Getting a new captain changes your entire work life. 
-Absolutely never become a mate. Most are a slave to the descending work schedule:
Day 1&2 1pm-11pm, Day 3 7am-5pm, Day 4&5 4am-2pm. So if you value your health (no time for sleeping, exercise, etc.) or your friends and family (no time for them, either) do not move up. The money is not worth it. 
-While sales go up year after year, benefits and raises keep getting cut. Dan Bane likes to send letters out after these cuts to remind us how much better we have it at Trader Joe's, anyway.
-The work is very physically demanding, no matter how young or in shape you are.
-If they do not like you, they will find a way to fire you. Period. Kiss ass or be fired. 
-They withhold raises from people they know won't fight back such as the disabled, immigrants, etc. Anything to save money. 
-While managers (who do nothing) get an hour break, the crew members are allowed 30 minutes. 
-You start at $10 for the most part, but if you knew how physically demanding the job was, it's really not so great after all. 
-Overpriced products. You think you're getting quality but many of the products are just repackaged America's Choice and Green Giant products"

Decent insurance.","In the short time I have worked at TJ's (2 yrs), raises were reduced, insurance was dropped for those not working at least 30 hrs a week, and the contribution to our retirement plan was cut by a third.

The changes in TJ's benefits and workload appear to be the direction where the company is headed.  It saddens me that TJ's is steamrolling toward growth and bigger profits at the expense of some very dedicated employees.

New pay structure stinks.  In the past workers could get very good raises if they really impressed management.  Now it's less than a dollar or nothing with every review (6 months).

I'm working there while in college.  Used to offer benefits.,"The company's integrity is in the toilet.  They implemented a new scheduling system that ""trims the fat"" and only schedules the bare minimum shifts to keep the store running.  Shortly after, they announced that they would not be offering insurance to those under 30 hours/week.  Many of the crew at my store was being scheduled UP TO 29 hours during the time frame which would determine their eligibility.  When I brought my concerns up to management about how it's pretty obvious that these two things go together, they name called me and made it seem like I'm a conspiracy theorist.  I have also been inappropriately touched by a customer, and when I reported it to my store captain, he shrugged it off and said that customer is weird.  They have also implemented a new policy at my store where you are penalized for calling off, even with a doctor note.  This includes one of my coworkers who sustained a severe injury and had to call off for several days, but had doctor notes for each occurrence.  When I asked about this new policy, management told me that if I'm not contagious, I have to come in, even if it is due to injury.  We are belittled by management and if you speak up about it, they penalize you and tell you you're ruining morale.  It's their shady practices that ruin morale, not crew members reacting to the situation.

I remember and Love the original TJ's.,"The Captain is Deceptive and has no Backbone. Management is a Joke and overly rewarded.The captain promotes from within a circle of controlled Drones. The number one rule of Management is to carry a Back Stabbing Demeanor and project a Fake smile. The Captain has alway's held back Good, Reliable, Hard Working people. They simply get rid of crew members that will bend down and Kiss A**. Most day's it's hard to be at work. The crew has no reason to work hard or feel Appreciated. Hard Working people have been knocked down and Demoted. People are no longer Honest. Some of the Crew will now pilfer and Steal to make ends meet. The Benefits are dwindling fast. Health Insurance is failing in many way's. The Company has turned a blind eye to these problems and is only concerned with Mass Growth and Profit.

5311,Trader Joe's,"It's a job - with a paycheck - that is, when they decide to pay you.",2014-01-10,2.0,Section Leader,Friendly crew! Fun place to be yourself with customers! Great opportunity to learn merchandising when you are a section leader.,"Mates feel important by micro-managing and telling everyone what to do. Like we can't figure it out? Pay is not bad for retail but the hours are killers. You could be there until 10 or 11 at night and then back in at 5 or 6 the next morning. Management couldn't care less about these ""turnaround"" shifts and what it does to their employees. 

The captain seems to listen but there is no follow-through on what has been discussed so that is not helpful. 

We are asked to do the work of many when we are short-handed - which is very often - so that the captain and mates ""make their numbers."" They get bonuses - we do not.

Now, to the paycheck comment.....paydays are every other Thursday. People plan on that. So payday was on Thursday, January 2, 2014. Interestingly, no paychecks arrived at ANY of the stores across the country. When I asked our store management, they said, ""Oh yes, today is payday but we'll be getting our checks tomorrow."" HUH? Paychecks a day late without any notification whatsoever to employees? I can understand a change in payday if it falls on a holiday but it didn't. And even in that case, reputable companies pay their employees the day before - NOT the day after. Store management only discussed it if you brought it up to them. They were not proactive in letting employees know that, in fact, no money had been deposited in their account as they had expected. This was a huge, huge miss for store leaders.

The other thing that really bothers me about this event is that we never received an apology from senior leadership. Nothing. Nada. It was just supposed to be okay for a really large group of people who make just barely enough to be above the poverty level (and some are even below the poverty level) to have their paychecks messed with in this way. I think this says volumes about Trader Joe's ethics and integrity - which, by the way, are supposed to be pretty important to them.

Very sad indeed."

5321,Trader Joe's,Started off very well but company culture is rapidly changing for the worse.,2014-01-01,2.0,Part Time Crew Member,I am lucky to have a great captain and decent group of managers. I make good money for working as a grocer and I enjoy a majority of my coworkers. Overall I would consider it a good job but I am lucky to have a good management team. If that changed because our captain was transferred the job would very quickly become unbearable. Also I strongly feel based on recent changes that in a few years this company will look very similar to any other major grocery store.,"This is a very physically demanding job. If you work there for any length of time you are more than likely to sustain at least some sort of injury. The most common are strains, sprains, carpel tunnel syndrome, and self inflicted cuts from box cutters. Years ago this job was amazing and I really felt like management cared about us. Now it is very clearly about squeezing as much work out of us as possible for as little as possible. They have cut our possible raise amounts twice in the past year and also recently cut health benefits for anyone working under 30 hours. Upper management also continues to encourage stores to hire new employees despite low turnover rate which in essence forces captains to over staff their stores. Upper management does this because we are supposed to meet certain sales per person per hour goals. Unfortunately for those of us who have worked for the store longer and make more money we often see our hours cut first because we are costing them more per hour. This also means that because we are overstaffed they can't offer us 30 hours so that a large number of employees just lost their health insurance. What is most infuriating however is the fact that while our company posts record profits each month and open new stores at a ferocious pace they continue to strip things from their front line employees. They are financing their growth on the backs of their front line workers.  In numerous public opinion polls and trade magazines Trader Joe employees are consistently rated in first or second place in categories such as friendliness,product knowledge, and professionalism. The best way I can sum Trader Joe's up is a few months ago I received two letters from Trader Joe's. The first was written to commend all the front line employees what a great job they had been doing. The second letter stated that after looking at other grocery stores compensation plans they realized we were very well compensated and as a result they were changing (read cutting) our benefits. Within a couple years unless they reverse their course you can look forward to being helped by a bunch of low wage high school dropouts and burned out older employees."

If you don't kiss ass, you will be stuck as Crew member forever.  Sneaky and underhanded in the way they have recently cut benefits - many think there were store quotas of employees that would lose health insurance.  Not all mates have a good idea of your strengths/weaknesses so almost all employees are seen as interchangeable."
5323,Trader Joe's,The job is great... when you first start,2013-12-16,3.0,Crew Member,"Fun work environment, flexible scheduling, better than average pay. The coworkers make this job fun!","Absolutely no room for growth. I had frequent repetitive movement injuries and the managers would not report them because I could not ""prove"" that I got hurt that way on register or while stocking. The job is very physically demanding, which is fine, but be prepared to feel exhausted. 
Since TJ's is usually placed in higher end neighborhoods, dealing with the seemingly ungrateful and uneducated (about seasons and food) clientele can be awful. 
The work environment is not really all that pleasant. So much drama all the time. If you're a person who can work in a gossipy environment, all the more power to you. The stores can be pretty incestuous. Many people in upper management don't have a life outside of their work.

There are always favorites. My store in particular was a ""bro club."" It was hard to feel recognized as a hard worker when management would socialize with less hardworking co-workers outside of work.

Trader Joes is known for benefits, but honestly they can be hard to come by. My schedule was written so that I specifically didn't receive health insurance."

You are out getting carts one hour, on register the next, in a freezer the next, unpacking heavy boxes from a pallet the next. It is like legit manual labor.

The store I worked at had intelligent great people as section leaders.","Lots of politics among management, no upward mobility.  The police have been involved at my store (Cambridge, MA 502) because of how often top management allows situations to escalate and cannot resolve issues without the captain herself resorting to gossip, name calling or yelling at employees in front of customers.  Employees have successfully litigated against the company thanks to discriminatory practices management has been involved in while trying to cut corners and exploit weaknesses in the employees with higher wages.  Hopefully there will be more cases and I hope to watch journalists building a narrative around this store.  I tried to turn employees cynicism into something more constructive (such as unionizing) but ultimately felt sick going to my shifts and left the store because I felt like executives were out of touch as well as so many of the employees thanks to how often management lies. Yes...the worst part are the managers (merchants and many mates) who are victim to the policies of the captain that currently works there and has the blessings of HR and the regional manager, they fear losing their own jobs speaking out against top management and will resort to lying to maintain status quo.  Fortunately the captain did not get her bonus this year because the company is growing weary of her, but honestly it is the regionals who are to blame for how poor this store is run.

On top of that, the company throws away a lot of food that are originally marked as donations in TJ's internal accounting system.  There are articles that talk about how wasteful many TJ's stores are.  NEVER BUY meat from Trader Joe's!  And if you buy produce, it is not fresh and it is frequently mishandled from store to store (my store handled it fairly well but we still threw away A LOT of produce that goes bad quickly).  Buy from your local fruit/veggie stand!  Support CSA's (Community supported agriculture)!  AVOID SUPPORTING TRADER JOE'S PRACTICE OF THROWING AWAY A TON OF FRESH FRUIT/VEGGIES

You can read all these articles praising Trader Joe's high wages, but what these articles don't talk about is how many of the employees who wages were capped or near the cap of $22 per hour have mysteriously left the store?  There is more to the brand that Trader Joe's has built than meets the eye."

5343,Trader Joe's,2 cents from a rookie should be taken with a grain of salt. This is just what I see.,2013-11-08,3.0,Crew Member,"Here you will learn to hone your interpersonal interaction. If you can maintain an engaging personality with fellow crew members and earn their trust and favor, you may find room for advancement or earn the coveted double bubble award.   Managers are outstanding save one or two in the bunch, but even they seem to have the best of intentions.  They may not see that they are micro-managing because they are striving to uphold the Captain's vision and to meet expectations. But on the whole, the management team can often find ways to correct actions in a manner that does not require an adjective in the form of an expletive. This is the only food job I know where you can earn between $8-$20/hr as a part time crew member. But top dollar comes with a price: be prepared to become either jaded or bitter. Some vets need to keep that attitude at home. Not all are like that and it is inspiring to know a top Mate or Captain rakes in 6 figures thanks to all the crew members who supported the rise to the top.","Raises have diminished from being merit based to $0.55 and then $0.45 bi-annual raises dependent on a positive review. Thanks to Obamacare and some changes from the top, employees must work a minimum of 30 hrs a week but crew members are only scheduled for five 7.5 hour shifts each week. Cutting an hour here and some pennies there....where is it all going? Not to the crew who overcome considerable obstacles, crowded back rooms, and a milk box overflowing with product to bring smiles and great customer service to irritable customers who often forget to treat us like human beings. At least the store management recognizes us for what we do.  And occasionally, they reward us."

Once your application is delivered, it may take several weeks for a response.  Albeit, they may get hundreds of applications a day.

In my personal experience, I was opening up a new store in a brand new location. Many locals were not aware of Trader Joe's, and sales were slow. Management hired twice as many people as was necessary. Thus, our hours were slashed.  I went from working 38 hours to on average 12 hours.  One week I wasn't even scheduled. Needless to say, many employees quit altogether. I, however, found another job, but kept working here because I enjoyed it so much."

It's labor intensive work that they have to get done, so they promise great pay and benefits to attract employees.  Then a person works there for a few months, realizes they were conned, and then leaves.

They started cutting hours last January.  People making $30,000/year dropped to $18,000 or less.  We were told hours would come back in May, then in July, then August.  People didn't want to lose good jobs so they spent savings, maxed-out credit card, and took loans.  Now it's October and we see that they're not going to give our hours back.  Many of us are no in crises debt with no job prospects.  They lied and lied and ran us into bankruptcy.  Just to make a ton of money for themselves by dropping insurance.

Just on this morning's crew there was a girl losing her apartment.  A guy losing his house. Another girl getting her utilities turned off.  And a guy desperately trying to sell his car. (Which, by the way, he needs to get to and from work.)

And they're begging for a lawsuit.  Just at our store there are 3 people who left decent jobs to come here.  They were promised careers that the Captain and Mates knew weren't going to happen.  These 3 guys were making $30,000-$40,000 a year, and now they're practically unemployed because they can't get the hours or raises.  Plus, no insurance."

Customers love the brand, the product & the customer service they have come to expect which is bar none, so if you don't like enteracting with people all day or don't like ""needy"" customers (those that expect you to go above & beyond) do not bother applying you will not enjoy the work.","While having carefully scheduled segments does allow you to change up your work & generally keeps you from becoming burned out at a task, it also requires all employees & management to have impeccable time management. If you are five minutes late to a register, the person covering that register is 6 minutes late to lunch or stock, and since every employee may be changing tasks at every hour it can throw off the efficiency of the entire team tremendously. This makes things suprisingly inflexible for such a ""laid back"" company & if you are more than 5 min.

Popular items such as flyer/holiday products, almond butter, popcorn kernels, etc., seem to run out or be unavailable consistently, yet the company continues to grow at a fast pace while not being able to supply some of the most in-demand items.

They are hiring a lot of new employees so they can keep their seasoned unfavored crew members under 30 hours a  week to force them onto the ACA exchange. This used to be a great place to work.

Over a period of time they have cut our pay raises from 4 a year to 2 a year, retirement is cut by 5.4 percent a year, health coverage cut, etc. The company used the bad economy as an excuse to make these changes. The timing was right for our CEO to make these changes happen. If you thing about the timing of all of the changes.

2.  Rapid expansion leads to supply problems and more discontinued products or items out of stock.
3.  Cutting employee benefits and sending memos that employees should be happy to work there because they are getting more than at other discount places.  
4.  Employees now have to have open availability, which eliminates the chance for second jobs, schooling or a family life.  If not available around the clock, employees do not get sufficient work hours to make a decent wage or get the remaining health benefits.
5.  Newly implemented ""sales per person hour"" percentages cut the crew to the bone.  The results are dirtier stores, haphazard rotation of products, more injuries.  Customer service is beginning to suffer because there are fewer people on the floor to do the same work.
6.  The new system discourages teamwork, and there is a reduced chance to make connections at work.  There former ""family"" has broken apart.
7.  Trader Joe's is fast becoming another food chain by adjusting its business practices for race to the bottom.  If you want to work as a busy store clerk and cashier for $10/hr, this is the job for you.  It is not a good company anymore and will lose its standing as a good employer.

Flexible hours, diverse workforce.  Clean and safety-minded company.  No one is acknowledged as ""full-time"" except for Captains, Mates, and Merchants - Crew are all essentially on-call, which means they are NEVER eligible for state unemployment under this new CEO - clever, eh?","TOO Many managers with their own axes to grind over the Mate-Captain structures makes for confusion among employees, and favorite-playing between mates and crew.  Angry mates enlist crew in their passive-aggressive attitude toward newly promoted captains.  No incentive to work harder - when young employees call out for trivial reasons, those left doing their work get no perks and there is no downside for the slackers.  Managers need to manage the crew they like as well as the crew they have personality issues with.  Recently leaked changes in benefits coming January 1st is a cheat to existing employees already eligible (and lured by) current benefit structure that make low wages palatable - this is the Wal-Mart-ization of what was once a decent, progressive-minded company."
5390,Trader Joe's,crew member thoughts,2013-09-01,5.0,Crew Member,We're like a BIG family. A cohesive unit that makes everything work. Everybody from the top down to your part timers works very well together. Upper management is very supportive and will listen to whatever you have to say. They pretty much have an open door policy for everybody on staff. Would highly recommend this company as a great place to work.,"The only one that I can think of is, there is no set schedule. One day you might work an 11-7 shift and the next day you work a 5am - 1 pm shift. I call it, yo-yo scheduling. But it's really no big deal."
5391,Trader Joe's,"Started great, went downhill from there.",2013-08-28,4.0,Mate (Assistant Manager),"Originally, the great atmosphere, happy crew members, advancement from within, and hearing customers say"" I love Trader Joe's"".","After Theo Albrecht died(German brother who owned Trader Joes), Dan Bane made massive and monumental changes to the structure of the business(If it ain't broke, don't fix it?).  Trader Joe's was not broke but running like a fine tuned machine.  First, destroyed the nautical hierarchy(Captain, First Mate, Second Mate, Merchant, Specialist, and Novitiate) and made it Captain, Mates(Captains-in-training) and Merchants(usually past-full timers or other long time store leaders). Making Mates a generic position was meant to promote competition for advancement and just led to back-stabbing to get ahead.
     And then came the numbers.....SPPH(sales per person hour), Comp. sales to previous year, raises being a set figure yes/no based on meeting expectations or not, lowering raises, promoting Mates from part-time status at $8-$10 LOWER than the ""off-the'street"" Mate hires who are managers from the Walmarts, Targets, Whole Foods, etc. and don't know the Trader Joe's culture. (In response to the 10 year part timer who had ""15"" bosses making $50K- $120K,- after three years of being a mate, 1 out of every 3 crew members is still making more per hour than I am under the new Mate raise system, which is once per year, so it angered me that those part-timers making $3-$4 per hour more than me would say""that's why you make the big bucks in stressfull situations"".  And they aren't commuting an hour to work.  But I do agree that there is alot of incompetance with management in general, what do you expect from Walmart?) Basically trying to sanitize management of anybody that has risen from within as most hires are off-the-streeters and Captain positions are given to RMT's(Off the street hires put on a fast track to Captain for no good reason). 
      In a nut shell, the company is now being run by an accountant(whether that be Dan or Ed) and is now treating crew like numbers instead of people.  You will see poorer customer service because with fewer crew members at the store to perform the duties that need to be done, there will be little time to show you where that product is or after their 5th hour on register(usually reserved for the lazy crew member who accomplishes little on the floor so we staple them to a register to keep track of them), their demeanor at checkout is likely to be less polite than once was. But that is what you get when numbers are more important than people.       
     Trader Joe's is raking in the profits. They finance all the new stores with their own money(smart) and are planning more aggressive growth(dumb).  Anybody relate with the term ""discontinued"" or ""TOS""-temporarily out-of-stock?  Trader Joe's is kind of like Walmart where they negotiate deals to keep the prices low and then grind the crap out of the manufactorer to keep supply up.  TJ's can't keep many of the popular items on the shelf now, how the heck are they going to do it with more stores.
     I miss hearing customers say ""I love this store"" and now only usually hear ""oh, you discontinued that, too?""
     Watch as everything that made Trader Joe's great starts to erode under the new business plan."

The 30 minute break time is completely inadequate. 30 minutes does not allow enough time for a crew member to eat a meal and re-energize for the rest of their shift. It needs to be extended to 1 hour, but that is wishful thinking.

The work can be back breaking. 3 hour shifts on register twice daily without a break are very common.

Management, especially Captains, are often corrupt and indulge in blatant favoritism. If you become one of the Captain's cronies, your job is secure and you will get raises at review time. I was not one of my former Captain's lackeys.  She disliked me for no valid reason, I was written up for ludicrous stuff -- like not giving a kid stickers at checkout on one occasion -- one!  I got negative reviews that were filled with fabrications about my performance and I was fired after one year.  My full timers praised my performance consistently, but it was the Captain's toxic dislike for me that cost me my job"

there is a strange discord btw full timers and part timers bc they frown upon fraternizing; although you make friends and will want to hang out, it's a ""no no.""
your day could depend directly on how much went on the shift before; so, if there was a ""cool"" supervisor before that let everyone slack off, it could make for a rather hectic day."

Our store was really happy until a new captain came. The previous captain was very well liked. Management participates in bullying its crew members to the point of harassment. Managers will lie and fabricate stories to fire or discipline you. Drawers suspiciously come short and crew members have been written up for it. When an investigation is conducted we have found that it was a mate and the captains error. Crews who complain about work conditions, food safety are targeted for discipline. I have watched crew members being followed by sometimes up to three mates. Certain employees never have to go on Register, usually the ones who have orders. Discrimination against gays and disabled. So far our store has several lawsuits under this new management. Expect to be worked to the point of injury and be treated like an outcast when that happens. I can't believe that a grocery store could be full of politics, cattiness and unethical business practices. Good benefits are not worth the constant stress you under.

Instead we are slapped in the face with unstructured crazy changes. Most of us understand that some people don't get raises at their jobs at all. The company has been beyond generous with us but now since they need to start saving $ they are having the management not award raises to at least half of the employees in their store and the reasons behind it are ridiculous. Furthermore, they overhired for the summer which made everyone get their hours cut. Well unless you write an order then you get your 5 days, but some people don't want to write an order and be blamed for things that they might not of done. We understand the summer is slower but it appears they are hiring new people so they can be paid less. As for the mates, the ones hired from the outside are trained to be almost robotic. It's just sad, the culture of the company is going down the toilet because they couldn't adapt fast enough. I'm ready to move on and trying my best to do so."

In recent years however the gap between management and crew has opened and begun to expand, with areas from store to store of infection. This has taken away most of one of the primary ideals of the company, the entire crew is functioning as one happy, content unit. When the management is instructed to, or evolves into this fake, put on a happy face and the crew members will believe everything is peachy persona, in addition to reducing pay raises, cutting hours, then hiring new employees at lower wages, and at review periods saying that the positive fun loving people who pass this to customers are not meeting requirements so as to skip their tiny raises. This has broken the moral and disheartened the loyal crew. Crew starts to inadvertently (most of the time) pass this on to customers.

Awesome Medical/Dental/Vision/Retirement benefits, including chiropractic/physical therapy and mental health benefits, really terrific core values and culture (see note in Cons below). There are differences between working as a part-time Crew Member and working as a manager of course, but at all levels the compensation is pretty good for what you do. Excellent raise structure for part-time employees. A 10% discount on your shopping and lots of free coffee/snacks while you work is pretty nice, too.","As a crew member -- 
As with any hourly job, you are given hours based on your availability and the store's needs. If you have open availability, and a busy store, working close to 40 hours a week and making a living is no problem. If you have limited availability, or your store has off/on busy seasons, the income may not be as steady or reliable. 
Also, the work can be very physical, and the high service expectations of our customers can be exhausting. 

As a manager --
Pretty much totally exhausting all the time. 10+ hour days on a rotating schedule or not, each store is different. Working both closing shifts (until or after midnight) and opening shifts (starting at 4 or 5am) in the same week is normal practice. You are given a LOT of responsibilities, but the responsibilities themselves are not the problem. it's more so that you are expected to fulfill them regardless of the normal rhythm of the store and the 100 other tasks you need to accomplish in a given shift. The better managers will delegate most of those tasks out, but often, there is no opportunity due to tight staffing and increasingly tighter hourly production/payroll goals. A lot of this is dependent on your Captain (Store Manager). There are some opportunities for movement/transfer if you are really at odds with your Captain, but not many, and for any move you need your Captain's approval. Great Captains fight to develop other great Captains -- they encourage forward/out-of-the-box thinking and reward performance. Less stellar Captains will want you to do everything their ways, and might ignore or even reprimand ideas/practices that are different. It can be hard to keep your head up and stay positive in that kind of environment, and even harder to be convincingly excited and happy to be at work everyday, which of course is the expectation."

In the last year, closing crew (3-11pm shift) are getting shafted. Constantly understaffed, and these closing crews routinely stay well after 11pm...usually closer to 12am.

- Job descriptions are set by individual store managers (Captains), you may have a completely different set of expectations from one store to the next. 
- HR is minimally effective at best
If you're looking to move up in a company, look elsewhere. They're in a state of flux right now, and new priorities are being set up all the time. The problem is that they have a set of roles/jobs in the store, but the main office hasn't given a specific job description to any of them. So, you'll be in one store in one role, but if you transfer, the new manager may decide that you're going to do ABC now, but you've never been trained on it. The flip of that is, move to another store, and then your new manager has decided that you're not going to do ABC, but instead XYZ, or may take away all the responsibilities you had before. 
They need a straightforward way of taking care of this, but corp isn't stepping in at all. 
HR is ineffective at best, don't bother calling them with any problems you may have with benefits, their info is out of date and wrong most of the time. 
They also lean back on the 'mom & pop homey store' look, but they're growing, and they refuse to adapt to new and more efficient ways of  inventory/labor/ordering - Where I am they just started using UPC codes in the early 00's, and many of the managers see tech as this big monster, most of them are incapable of using something as simple as Outlook."

The company tries to extend the best benefits it can, although they are getting less and less.","See above. Trader Joe's gets sued a lot -- because they always settle and don't ever fight back.

Co workers were pretty positive and hard working for the most part.",sometimes people would not pull their weight or get specialized treatment from upper management. Others would work hard and not get recognized. Hard to get promoted and sometimes the work can get strenuous.
5439,Trader Joe's,Trader Joe's?? Nope ...Slaver Joe's is more like it,2013-05-01,1.0,Crew Member,"10% shopping discount. Everyone, including managers and the ""Captain"", know how to, and often do perform the same tasks as the lowly crew member.","NO ACCOUNTABILITY for the majority of employees who stand around, socialize, and generally let a small minority of the crew do most of the work. LOTS OF FAVORITISM based more upon social standing/friendships than work ethic and ability. VERY LITTLE communication, as there is no real means of in-store communication (email/intranet mail, etc) other than speaking to someone directly. Even then, the message is often lost or not passed on to anyone else in management who MIGHT do something to improve the situation. Even when an issue is widely known, little or nothing is done to correct it. Unsafe working conditions given there is SUCH LIMITED STORAGE SPACE. Management sometimes ignores work-related incidents/injuries which should at least be documented with an incident report. Low hourly rate for crew ...and only small increases with time: not based uopn level of competence, title, or responsibility. 
Blatantly engage in age discrimination regarding annual bonus ...if you're under a certain age, you receive a bonus check every January. If you are above that age, you have no choice but to see that bonus go straight to your ""pension"" ...which takes 5 years to become 100% vested. So you're losing money from the first year you're an employee. Can't see how this is legal!!"

5441,Trader Joe's,Great work environment,2013-04-30,5.0,Part Time Crew Member,good starting salary and benefits.  very flexible with employee schedules. Company is very safety consious. Great co workers good work environment.,Really no 'cons' at this time compared to other jobs I've had
5442,Trader Joe's,on its way down,2013-04-25,2.0,,When I first started 10 years ago there was more opportunity for raises and the health benefits were better. I like that I'm not at a desk and that I move around most of the day.,"In the past few years raises first got less frequent, then got smaller and less frequent, and are now X number employees can get a raise in an all-or-nothing sort of way. For me, who has been employed here so long, it makes little difference in my wages--I'm capped out--but for people starting at $10 per hour, not getting raises is serious. Trying to survive in this area on so little is next to impossible. 

Also, TJs puts its profit above employee safety. I don't think we've had a day in years when everyone has been at work in good condition. I've had everything from facial stitches to crushed legs. I'm currently on Workers Comp., and I am wary of going back unless the conditions are actually changed. The cute little drawings with safety slogans don't do much good if there's no follow through from management.

It can be cliquey. There is a lot of imbalance in productivity. 

Moving up in position usually means sacrificing your whole extra curricular life. Because pay and benefits have decreased, there are fewer people interested in making that sort of sacrifice, and the managers we currently have have gotten lackluster.

I don't think many places are better---all grocery stores are overpackaged---but the environmental footprint is massive, and it makes me ill watching TJs promote itself as some sort of eco friendly place to shop. Some of our resuable bags are plastic shipped from Asia."

The reality is your chances of making the Captain position is slim to none unless you want to pick up your whole family and move them away from everyone and everything they know.  Tattoos and piercings? Cover 'em and take them out otherwise there's no room for you in upper management regardless of amount of education or proven work ethic and leadership abilities. Simple as that.  The 'diversity policy' doesn't include you.

5456,Trader Joe's,Good Employer If You're Management. If not... RUN!!,2013-03-28,1.0,Crew Member,"-Decent starting wage. Trader Joe's has an awesome retirement package of 15.4% if you're age 30 or over
-Very friendly PT crew members and customers
-Offer Medical/Dental/Vision/Retirement benefits
-Family atmosphere that makes it an enjoyable job if you can fit a niche
- If you can get in good with a low-level manager, do so. These lower managers(Merchants) often times have more on the job experience and have been with Trader Joe's for years and have simply not wanted to move up the ladder. I worked with countless Merchants who had a positive outlook and knew more about the store than the Captain","I was with the company before and after things took a turn for the worse. Almost 10 years.
- For starters 2/3 of all hires are age 29 and under. By doing this the company saves millions of dollars every year, because they only pay 5% retirement benefits as compared to 15.4% for crew members above the age of 30. They also love to cut your hours as a way to save money. You could have 40 hours one week and the next your down to 24 hours wondering what happened with little to no explanation from the manager writing the schedule. 
-Many of the stores are somewhat of a throw-together and are only about 9,500 square ft. on average. This makes for small narrow isles and a lot of accidents. It also saves the company a TON of money in real-estate fees. You're average conventional grocery store is 50,000 square ft.  
-Management expects you to go to them and ask for feedback when it should be the other way around. 
-There is also no formal training guide from which crew members and management can learn how to do things. Managers go to Trader Joe's University(TJU) to get training, but people have told me it's more of a party than training. It's sink or swim and more often than not you end up sinking, because of the lack of training your managers have received over the years, which is miniscule. Captains and Mates will often times make your fellow crew members give you training who are surprised this is part of their new job description. Many times you will be told you're doing the job wrong simply because you're not doing it the exact same way someone else, usually a Mate or Captain, would do it.
-Management likes to promote their friends within the company and often times the mates they bring in ""off the street"" and crew member they promote are not even remotely qualified for a position in management. Many Mates and Captains had unsavory attitudes and nothing, but contempt for the employees and really don't know how to create a fun working environment.
-Stores are also dusty and dirty and not cleaned for long periods of time. I brought this up to the attention of management multiple times at my store and was told ""Corporate has a 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' mentality"" 
-The Registers and computer systems at the front desk were running on outdated software . My store was still running Windows Microsoft Office 2003. The Registers, especially, are breaking down at an alarming rate at the older stores,mine being one of them, which have not been updated in many years.
-Corporate is now hiring an extremely high number of people for the position of ""MATE""(Assistant Store Manager) at Trader Joe's to help fill the void when they open new stores in the future. Ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem, but Trader Joe's has a very unique culture and way of doing things that you don't see at other grocery stores. It is a culture that someone ""off the street"" doesn't get and having these people as your boss on the first day is very detrimental and demoralizing to the crew members and managers.
-Captains and Mates are not required to adhere to Trader Joe's founding principles, or ""Core Values"", many of which are useless and outdated anyway. Crew Members, on the other hand, are held to these ""Core Values"" like superglue. 
-There is NOT a lot of room to move up in the company unless you're really good at positioning your lips on the  Captains buttocks. If you're a suck-up you'll get all the opportunities in the world whether you deserve them or not and if you're like me and have a good, hard work ethic, sorry, no opportunities for you. I must have asked 100 times to do more and every time the answer was the same ""NO"".
-Crew Members often times will tattle-tale on you to the Captain and Mates in order to get more opportunities in the store.
-Management will do whatever it takes to get ahead including lying on your reviews. I'd work hard all day doing the work of 2 or 3 people only to get a ""have a good night"" from the Mates as reward for working 3/4 of the load. As another reviewer said it's the 80/20 rule. 80% of the work is done by 20% of the crew.
-There is no accountability for crew members or management in place when an employee does not follow ""company standards(the biggest oxymoron of them all). 
-Absolutely terrible communication on a store level. Crew members are always expected to give a WOW! customer experience and yet we are not given the training and resources to help us deliver that level of customer service. If  you chat up all your customers you're golden.
-Safety Training/equipment is an afterthought. The Fork lift and pallet jacks are all out of date  just invited daily injury. So, be ready to blow out your knees and lower back, because there is no equipment besides a red knee pad and a few step ladders to save you. Management is absolutely oblivious to the fact that SAFETY COMES FIRST. They simply don't care to correct this or any problem in their stores
-Reviews have gone from 1-5 pts system(1 being the worst, 5 being the best) to now a ""MEETS EXPECTATIONS"" and ""DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS"" systems and you are never really told what the Captains definition of EXPECTATIONS is, since everyone perceives it and therefore you different. I would be reprimanded verbally by the Captain for having Poor Customer Service and then told on my review that I have outstanding Customer Service. Contradictions like this are the order of the day in stores especially with many of the new ""off the street"" Mates and Captains.
Trust me, the list could go on indefinitely, because of the new direction the company has taken. Trader Joe's is sadly, becoming more like Safeway everyday and they don't even know it."

You hear about how happy the employees are which is because of how great the company was and how well we were treated. Like valued staff members. Now that is being chipped away at. The economy can be a good excuse but honestly what was a small personal company is now beginning to treat its employees like they work at Safeway. Raises are lower across the board. Fun really isn't encouraged. Employee tastings have all but disappeared. Prices for insurance has raised.

Excellent health benefits including dental, prescription drugs, vision, even for part time employees. Company paid retirement package where company (currently) matches 15.4 % of gross yearly salary and places this money into a 401k for you , with a six year vesting schedule.

Fast paced, seldom place to work. Great pay for supermarket work.","Company is extremely focused on opening new stores and as a result is hiring large amount of off the street hires for Mate,(Assistant Mgt) positions. If you are ex Target or Starbucks, TJ's wants you! 85% of promotions used to come internally from former part time crew , now it is far more difficult to move up that way. TJ's is dangerously close to losing the spirit and mentality and corporate culture that has made it such a hit for so long.

Reviews used to be given four times a year for everyone. Now it is twice a year for pt crew and yearly for ft crew. Bonus incentive program has become a joke unless you are a store Captain. There is no longer a formal store training program for management, you are expected to sink or swim pretty much on your own. Captains are under great pressure to bring in good numbers and are easily dismissed after years of loyal service. 

Work to life balance is abysmal. Management works ten hour shifts, often with only nine or ten hour turnarounds. Get a good data plan for your cell phone, because you'll be texting your family all the time. Even store Captains unload trucks, so the work is physically demanding and each store has a long list of employees out on Workman's Comp. 
Current restructuring plan places newly hired off the street Mates in charge of pt crew and Merchants whom often have many years with the company and better understand company values.

Company is cutting back on payroll per store again, leading to a feeling of never having the time to do the job right. Store cleanliness and food safety suffer."

5492,Trader Joe's,BEWARE of Store Openings,2013-01-06,2.0,Crew Member,The benefits at Trader Joe's are competitive.,"What almost no one will tell you is, one of the ways Trader Joe's keep cost low is by not having a traditional approach to advertising. They use A TON of word of mouth to spread the news at Trader Joe's. This is great for consumers and terrible for all employees because no customers means no hours.

This would be fine if management were upfront about this fact which they are not. It happens at every new Trader Joe's for the most part. 

With that said, my advice is to beware of working at a brand new store. There are hardly any hours to go around and they most definitely wont tell you that during training."

-fantastic benefits (cheap health insurance, great coverage, amazing retirement plan, paid time off)

-managers are much more concerned with making customers and employees happy than with the store's bottom line. I've never worked in such a supportive environment before!
-everyone basically does the same job, and managers pitch in and do just as much work as crew
-I love that we have control of everything on a store level: writing orders for product every day, having in-house sign artists, being involved with local communities, etc.

5514,Trader Joe's,"LOVE the food, GREAT company perks, POOR Store Management!",2012-10-20,2.0,Supervisory,"1.  I enjoyed the clientele that the company attracts.  
2.  The products they sell are exceptional in quality and price.  
3.  I enjoyed cooking “the spread” for the taste testing.
4.  The benefits are excellent.
5.  They throw GREAT parties.
6.  They pride themselves on their honesty (corporate level only)","1.  I find them to be ignorant of even the most basic of management practices (hiring/firing/training/project-managing/time management/P & L, to name a few).
2.  The company does a very poor job of training their supervisory and above levels ( i.e., worked with people that had been in a supervisory role for 10+ years and were highly ignorant of crucial, good-food practices).
3.  The store was consistently poorly cleaned (the meat cases were not cleaned for many months, the cold cases were filthy; when this was brought up to higher management you were then, from that point on, “black-balled”).
4.  The relentless lack of consistency and professionalism on the management level (captain/first mate/supervisory levels)were amazingly bad.  Favoritism ruled (good ole’ boys club)!  I was constantly amazed of the promotions that were given out like candy.
5.  The company wastes an ENORMOUS amount of money on the Trader Joe University jaunts.  The people teaching them MUST be related to corporate -- for they are clueless.  The company possesses exceptionally poor training methods throughout all levels of the company.  Small example: While at the store, if you can grab your teaching literature and hide somewhere on the premises without being seen, you can try to read a paragraph or two (which MUST be accomplished) before you must return to the floor to work -- there is no structured time allowed to study…NONE.
6.  You are more than likely to be injured on this job.  I will truly say, if you do NOT go to the gym 3 times a week, avoid working for this company.  Not so much for the actual lifting, but the extreme demand on the few people that actually do work, (while the rest of the “divas” stand behind the desk/hide and goof off--YES,I am referring to the middle management/upper management).  Many of the loading docks and lifting equipment are in questionable shape, just inviting daily injury.  The stores are crudely put together allowing for easy injuries of the employees (most  stores are a “throw-togethers).  The cash register areas need to be upgraded immediately (this area alone allows for so many preventable injuries).  W/C must be just loving that area.  
7.  They waste an ENORMOUS amount of money on doing the hand-lettered signs in each store.  Translation: hemorrhage.
8.  All of the input for ordering is done by actual body count and entered with pencil into a notebook.  (For goodness sakes --the technology/software exists -- BUY IT).  Again, due to the lack of training, there is an enormous amount of waste of perishable products (YES, even when the management was ordering).
9.  The store I was run as if you were seven years old, with a group of your little friends, and a “Let’s put on a show!” mentality.  The management was utterly clueless.  
10.  The supervisors have zero quality of home life.  After being worked to death during your shift, you would be scheduled to return in six hours and work another ten hours.
11.  The district management never looked at the store, or spoke to the other employees, he would go and hide with the manager and chat happily.  All the while the store was unsanitary, with heavy losses, an untrained staff, and theft (Yes, corporate was aware of this).  Nice.
12.  Oh, the list could go on, and I have heard that the company has now started to slide harder.  It really is a shame."

GREAT benefits, including an employer-paid retirement and easy acquirement of time-off. Plenty of job stability.","Working a rotating shift is usually required, meaning 1-2 closing shifts, 1 midday shift, and 2 opening shifts per week. The shifts for this position are 10 hours/day, and often you stay late. The raises are one per year, and they are almost laughable, at least in the beginning.

Despite dealing with some customers who are not the best, most of well educated, know and udnerstand product and aspects of the store and are not like shoppers in your normal grocery store.

Always doing something different: there are no departments so you get to do a little of everything. Working to floor and putting up product, running a cash register, collecting shopping carts and baskets, etc. You're not stuck doing the same thing for a 6 or 8 hour shift every day.

Don't need to have food knowledge, but helpful to know about the store and products. Always opportunities to try ned things and learn about the products.","There is lack of structure to the company on a store level. Generally when hired, you are just thrown at tasks and not always throughly trained. There is no training program outside of reading the handbook and some paperwork and watching a couple of quick safety videos. Can become quite stressfull the first couple weeks to months.

The ""managers"" are called merchants and mates and can be people who are immature, inexperinced, younger than you and overly bossy/act as if they own the place, even when the company stresses ""No Beauracracy.""

In any store, there can be a lot of additional rules added in that are not company standards that make things awkward or difficult and quite frustrating.

Reviews, though 2x/year can become vague and only give moderate feedback, with the review being broken down into sections where either a crew member ""Met Satisfaction"" or ""Did Not Meet Satisfaction"", therefore leaving you without a gray area in which many people fall for certain sections."

Hard working and fun coworkers. Tasty food. Managers are supportive, positive and good at what they do.","Physically demanding. If you want to advance, you must be flexible in your schedule - count on working nights and early mornings and long hours and, of course, weekends. You also have to be willing to relocate to the various stores within a given region, if you want the management track. Part-time crew members can usually relocate, but if you want to pursue management roles, you can choose your regions but the company decides where you will work within that region. Rotating between stores (such as Woodbury, Minnetonka, St. Paul, etc)  is considered training and experience for managers."

5567,Trader Joe's,It used to be a great place to work,2012-04-26,1.0,Crew Member,"I make really good money here, and the benefits are ok.  I also really enjoy the people that I work with.","Sadly the cons list has gotten alot longer in the years that I have worked here.  The benefits seems to cover so much less than they used to.  As much as I do enjoy my coworkers, we constantly get into trouble for talking to each other even if we are still working.  They have recently made changes to our attendance policy that is very hard to maintain, especially if you have a family.  Trader Joe's says that they encourage a balanced work/family life, but I have not seen that in our store at all.  It truly feels like they want to get rid of people who have been there a long time.  The new review process I feel is not very fair, and it feels that the people writing them are being told that they have to only give bad reviews.  Even the very best employees have been given bad marks on their reviews.  Trader Joe's was a completely different company when I started there, but now if just feels uncomfortable being there.  Also, if you work at night, management is practically shoving you out the door as soon as they can, and if you complain about it, or say you need your hours you get accused of stealing from the company.  I do still work at Trader Joe's, but now it is because I have to, not because I want to.  It is too bad.  All of this is a bid to keep as much profit in the company as possible.  And I could take that much more easily if they would just say it.  Instead of giving bad reviews in order to not give raises, just say times are tough and we cannot give raises.  Or changing the attendance policy in order to write more people up.  I know that there is no going back to the way the company used to be, but I feel it could be made better."

5571,Trader Joe's,Happily working for corporate,2012-04-12,3.0,Crew Member,"The people are very friendly.  There are lots interesting parts to this job (trying new food, staying informed, feedback sessions and group huddles) that make it a pleasure to come in to work.  The benefits are OUTSTANDING for a part time job, my current full time job can't compare.  Great raises, something like 6% last time I was there.  Additionally, Trader Joe's has an interesting and effective philosophy of changing employee tasks every two hours so that crew members don't get bored.  Typical work day is very enjoyable, customers are friendly (sometimes not) and you can be friendly back.","First off, you will work really hard, especially if you want hours.  The full timers at TJ's have to work a brutal 50 or 60 hour work week, something insane like that.  Physically demanding tasks abound, and the workload is generally unrealistic for the amount of staff and the time they have to work.  It's the classic case of corporate making unreasonable demands on the retail end.  
             While TJ's comes off as this hippy-dippy company, their actually owned by a German based corporation that is, in the end, only interested in the revenue intake.  My two managers would also excuse some people for lateness and write others up on the spot if they didn't like them.  Corporate never seemed satisfied with our sales each quarter and everyone got really sick of it.  The workload became unbearable and I left the company right before store management changed hands and things got really bad.  Also, my manager was absolutely soulless and only cared about the bottom line.  He also talked to people like they were dirt which made coming into work difficult at times."

A chance to learn about interesting foods.
One on one training.
Really one of the best retail jobs out there.
Management really made an effort to train and develop employees. 
Women didn't seem to advance as quickly within the company. I don't know if this was due to not as many women pursuing advancement, women not being advanced by management, or some combination thereof.","Despite being one of the best retail jobs out there, it is still retail. This means long hours including weekends and holidays. This might be ok for some, but I needed a more traditional schedule."
5576,Trader Joe's,hard to describe...,2012-03-11,5.0,Sign Artist,"I have been an employee at tj's for a really long time, and even years in I still really don't mind coming to work, and sometimes I am even downright excited about it.  Around 100 people work in my store and around 90 of them are awesome human beings from a wide variety of walks of life.   I think I would have pursued greener pastures (higher pay, more fulfilling tasks, maybe even freelance design work full time) long ago but -- and this is the case with a lot of tj's employees-- the pay, benefits and overall work atmosphere keep some really amazing people with a lot of potential in hawaiian shirts.  

The pay is great if you have been with the company for years even if you haven't changed positions.  My hourly pay is now more than twice what it was when I started five years ago, and I technically have the exact same responsibilities.  

Regular crew are given between $1.20-1.50 per year as long as you are competent.  My first year I was given around $3 in raises to ""bring me up to the level I was performing at"".

Artistically speaking, you are sometimes asked to work against what you know to be good design sense, and that's a little sad.  That said, you're going to do that in any visual advertising field.  I can't speak for all stores by my boss is awesome.  He respects my ideas and trusts our team, and that has been really great.  If you're good at hand lettering and have a great design sense then your gut is right, this is probably the job for you.  Doing this four days a week for years has made me (by sheer practice alone) into a great artist-- I have a grasp on color and composition that I never thought was possible.  It can be a really challenging job if you make it one, but no one is going to push you but yourself.  

Other perks: 
The benefits are better than your friends with ""real"" jobs.  $50 a month buys you medical, dental and vision.  Getting sick usually means a $20 copay and a $15 script.  Teeth cleanings and new eye glasses are 100% covered.

The retirement has changed a little in recent years for some, but if you're over 30 years old they calculate 15% of what you made in any given year and set it aside for you on top of your full salary.  No employee contribution necessary unless you want to.  

Paid time off is earned based on the hours you work and the time you have been with the company.  I earn around 2-3 weeks year.

You get to leave your work at work.","A lot of decisions come down that seem reactive rather than proactive.  Communication can be spotty everywhere along the chain, there is a particularly large disconnect between the store manager and the regional manager.  The company is having a identity crisis, and visually kind of feels like a yard sale.  There's victorian clip art, tiki huts, rowing shirts with oars on them, and a neighborhood vibe all coalescing.  Its weird and makes the art weird too."

5578,Trader Joe's,Not what its cracked up to be...,2012-03-05,2.0,Crew,"The majority of the crew members (entry level) are really good people to work with. If you are employed permanently (not 'temporarily' or 'seasonally'), apparently the benefits are good. the discount is minor (10%). the products are great. the dress code is nice and casual. most of the customers are great too. they do put in effort to move you around a fair amount so you don't get bored (because generally speaking, a crew member works like a slave but the work isn't very mentally satisfying.)","As the company continues to grow, it becomes more corporate and less humane. i was very disappointed in the lack of communication and poor abilities of observation of many in upper mgt. There is a store mgr (captain), ass't mgrs (mates), and ass't mgrs with slightly less responsibility (merchants), then a big downward jump in responsibility to crew (entry level--cashier, stocker).  Essentially, some people have stayed merchants (and have not wanted to become mates), because of the store mgrs failings and companies new direction.  The step upward from crew member to either merchant or mate is now huge, because the company wiped out the supervisory positions which used to be extremely helpful to slowly and steadily go up the ladder.  Now it will take years, and endless politics to advance.  I found the merchants (lower ass't mgrs) to be much more confident, friendly, and open minded than mates (higher level ass't mgrs) or the store mgr (captain). This is not a good thing. Also, they want to you ask for feedback and when you do, all managers say 'speak to the store mgr', and that is infuriating. then, on top of that, the store mgr is very difficult to get to spend time with, let alone a direct answer from.  Despite the diversity of people that work there, it is a place you have to fit into or they kick you out, and sometimes there is a lack of honesty and ethics in the way they communicate (getting support of honest feedback), or operate (lack of safety gear)."

New review system for part-timers finds any reason possible to withhold raises. This change has just taken place and unfortunately puts TJ's on the same track as other big corporate grocery retails. Which is selling out employees for more profit. Their trying to sell it as a better method of reviewing employees, but it's nothing more than another move away from being an employee friendly company.

The pay is not great. Employees are not treated evenly. I worked under one store manager, and felt the wrath of a lot of transparent favoritism. Resentment and tension builds between employee interactions because of the favoritism.
