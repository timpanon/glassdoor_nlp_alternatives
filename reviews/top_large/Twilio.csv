You will meet a lot of very smart people.,"Twilio is a company with a lot of great potential, but as soon as you get in the door you realize that they have hired a lot of R&D leaders who are more interested in ""empire building"" rather than actually ensuring that Twilio is a successful company. As a result, there is a LOT of politics and a lot of turnover as smart people don't want to deal with this nonsense. Most (if not all departments) have been expressing that they don't have the software & tools to do their job for years now. However, instead of making those investments, Twilio spends those resources hiring more senior management, many of whom are so redundant that it just creates more infighting for all the ""empire building""."

41,Twilio,A Child who thinks to be an Adult. Do not recommend.,2022-03-11,2.0,SDR Inbound,possibility in proceeding with your carrer. Great SDR team and manager.,"Twilio is such a disappointment. It is a Startup dressed like an Enterprise. They are so behind with the process that it is actually unbelievable. A company like Twilio, promotes how important is to keep under one single umbrella all the tools to facilitate your agent's work, and then....inside their own company you have 3000 tools to go through your day, none of them work properly. The laptop is slower than the CRM. They still use file Excels. Long hour working, zero organization, everything is so messy, there is no real linear rule of engagement with the internal teams. You get paid for receiving queries from customers but then you end up being tech support, consultant, OB, secretary, diplomatic, and everything else. The Target is communicated every 2nd week of the month, and sometimes it is also a bad surprise. There are no clear criteria in the definition of the target.
If you are an AE, you are a god on the hearth, so you will have all the rules on your side. If you are an SDR you have to shape on your multiple Gods will. The AEs bring money, after all, the others are just entertaining themself. A little bit of humility for those people wouldn't be bad. Only a few of them are really cooperative and teamwork-oriented, the others...Jesus, I recommend them,"

Not a top-down hierarchy at all. A great product that developers truly love and respect. Visionary leadership and a very strong brand in the industry.","-Constant growth makes it hard to keep up with new teams and team members, especially in the Covid era. There has been some attrition but for the most part these are long-time employees achieving their full equity packages and moving on on great terms with the company, and often at companies within the Twilio or API economy.

-Clearer information on promotions, expectation in the company is that promotion is unlikely except for a very select few, and most open management/more senior roles are usually filled with external candidates."

The company has the right vision for a communications company, but just needs to execute on it.","In the last 6 months, the company has lost a handful of strong C-level executives and VPs. Attrition is bad. For the leadership still there, many don't seem to know what they're doing. It's smoke and mirrors. I've seen leaders go on leave and have their jobs replaced by others after coming back. Some people who are put in leadership roles do not even know the functions of their own team. They hire some strong new leaders, but they end up leaving because of the toxic culture."

The only magic is how employees just disappear.  People leave everyday—managers and leadership the worst I have seen and it’s rampant across the entire company.

Yes, you will see new jobs posted all the time, it’s not due to growth but  to fill roles that most employees leave within a year.

Tread carefully and do your homework talk to people who left, talk to people who work here, people leave companies for many reasons, but at Twilio, burnout is inevitable, no work life balance and utterly dysfunctional.

The attrition level is frightening, it’s never addressed always swept away."
57,Twilio,Career side track,2022-03-02,3.0,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"Generally great people to work with, a very strong inclusive culture. Some good benefits but falling behind top tier employers fast with regressive policies like limited time working remotely in another country.",Frenetic work pace especially on operations side. Lots of broken inefficient processes where bodies are used to bridge the gap leading to constant burn out. Comp is about 75% of market norms with miserly yearly increases even with promotions that are mostly based on 'visibility' - has alot of fake it till you make it. eTeam has yet to effectively address persistent concerns about inflation and currently gives it mostly lip service while giving more attention to niche concerns like DEI than broader employee issues. Work life balance is a slogan that gets lot of airtime but zero effective change due to constant under resourcing and poor resouece management overall stemming from cost controls.

The quality of the new hires keeps going down, 
The company burns a lot of money on events, parties, celebrity speakers, conferences, etc. but also manages to underpay employees,
The company and the extremely vocal cohort of employees (typically on the slack channels) very often make very bold statements on sensitive, touchy social and political polarizing subjects and this has made the company an uncomfortable place for everyone who doesn't agree with them"

Salary, even with recent changes, is not so great. RSU and stock volatility make the salary worse.
They're paying the piper for failing to plan for the rapid growth. Excessive churn in valuable employee cohorts (the people who built stuff and the people hired in the last year).
Their revenue producing products are seeing margins erode significantly from competition, impacting future growth.

- Many of the leaders that we’ve promoted up the ranks over the years are amazing role models.
- People are collaborative and super helpful.
- Great progress towards doing good with ERGs, opportunities to volunteer, anti-racist frameworks.","Terrifying retention issues and seemingly no attempt from the company to address these: 
- Folks from acquisitions are leaving Segment and Sendgrid at all levels, making merging technologies and processes extra difficult. 
- Long-tenured Twilions will create a massive exodus in the next few months because their stock options are running dry and they are not considered valuable by HR. We will lose incredible talent, knowledge, and fabric of culture as a result. 
- Rough work-life balance. I’ve been working here 5+ years and never had the option of a sabbatical. Burnout is inevitable. 
- We’re being asked to work cross-team without proper frameworks for it. 
- The new Twilio Magic with its forced optimism feels toxic. I miss our old values."
114,Twilio,Not the same company it used to be,2022-01-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"They have cool swag, the t-shirts are especially soft","Twilio used to have an amazing culture a few years ago, and this is what you're seeing in the old reviews. But since the company went into hypergrowth its been completely destroyed. There has been massive churn the last 6 months and you can see this at all levels from IC to C-level. Hiring standards have gone down, promotions are based entirely on the old school boys club, new leadership is defensive about any feedback given to them and lashes out at employees for speaking out. The culture now is fearful and there are bullies everywhere trying to tear people down to make themselves look better. It's truly a shame to see how far this company has sunk (and not only the share price which also seems to be following the same trend). I would think twice about joining, twilio is riding the coattails of its own reputation, but that isn't going to last forever."

1. Great technical work in R&D
2. Amazing leadership
3. Great work life balance
4. So much to learn
5. Culture is awesome here",Nothing that I see. Make sure you retain great talents and keep them motivated.
116,Twilio,Best company to work with,2022-01-26,5.0,Talent Guide (Recruiting Coordinator),"Best salary package, Best reward policy , Best work culture, Best recognition and the Best managers.",To be frank till now I haven’t felt any Cons. That much twilio is taking care of their employees. Really proud to be a part of this company.
117,Twilio,Onboarding online was a TOTAL nightmare.,2022-01-26,1.0,Technical Support Engineer,"If you are lucky enough to be on the right team:
Great perks, great culture, good salary.
The company is growing a lot, and offers many opportunities for professional growth","Unfortunately my experience was not positive.

I was hired as a technical support engineer, great salary and good condition.
As usual, new hires are sent to California for training; unfortunately, due to the pandemic, the entire onboarding process was virtual, an event that the company was not prepared for.

The trainings were very confusing (often simple recordings of very long zoom calls, dispersive and time consuming).
 
I was the only newcomer not based in Ireland of a team entirely based in Dublin of a team of colleagues who had already worked ""live"" before the pandemic (you can understand how difficult it is to be able to build bonds by working only online, especially if there is no good onboarding program.). Sadly, the team members made absolutely no effort towards inclusion (apart from many nice words and ""core values"").

Shadowing was a TOTAL nightmare:

I didn't have a defined mentor, there was no trainer and training program. There was no trainer, in general I went around between two or three people, who treated me more like a burden than a trainee (and since there was no defined program each one taught me different, often conflicting, things).
Whenever I asked for information via chat I was answered after a long time - and with reluctance (if not in an arrogant way).

It was not clear where I should look for information and even how to read the tables that were there: there was no manual, no info, I was totally left to myself.

I often found myself yelling at the screen in frustration.

The person I spent most of the training with was an extremely arrogant girl and fussy to excess, which, with an annoying ""i know it all"" attitude  she made me rewrite the answers up to 10 times, simply because she didn't like a few words (I've been in support for 10 years, I KNOW how to properly write a response to a case).

The team leader was an ice cube, totally devoid of empathy and problem solving skills - did absolutely nothing to try finding a solution or understand the difficulties of the situation (the person training me behaves rudely even with people from other departments, so the problem wasn't just me, and probably making her training people wasn't the best idea).

_Nobody_ tried to put themselves in my shoes (given that this is also one of their core values, i'd say this is a serious lack).

After less than two months (Where I live the trial for long term contracts is two months) they let me go because ""I had not passed the trial period""; when the rest of the colleagues were given a trial period of six months (as per Irish law): this is also very bad behavior.

Unfortunately, this is my experience: judging by the many positive comments, I probably wasn't particularly lucky.

Perhaps in a different time and situation I would have had a diametrically opposite experience: unfortunately the emergency, the work from home, the fact that I was not in the same country as the team I was working for, somehow contributed to the disaster.

However, I have known Twilio almost since its foundation - as a former colleague of mine has been working there for years altrady, and it was a company I used to like and I was proud to work for; unfortunately, in the light of my experience, TWILIO has EXTREMELY disappointed me."

Like most tech, there is a remote-first/WFH culture.","Twilio requires proof of vaccination status, regardless of whether you're contractor status / 100% remote / or never setting foot into their offices. 

This is a massive overreach given the SCOTUS ruling on January 13, 2022. Those who do not comply, and or receive approval of exemption (religious or otherwise) will be terminated (placed on admin leave unpaid) and you can guess how that turns out."

127,Twilio,The Best Onboarding Experience Ever!,2022-01-19,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"Twilio has the best onboarding/brand experience internally. They offer tons of useful company tutorials, remote resources, and apps that new hires can learn and take time to fully onboard for a month as well as attending company virtual events which are very inspiring. The Company Kick Off sessions are amazing and Jeff, the CEO has a huge amount of energy, positive, and inclusive attitude.

The company has been growing exponentially over the couple of years, and also taking off great missions like becoming an anti-racist company by hiring a Chief Diversity Officer and encourage everyone to truly embrace and promote the culture of diversity and inclusion. Also, the company tries to make a real social impact by organizing employee donation/charity support programs. I'm proud to be a Twilion! Truly a developer centric culture. They know their customers, users, and employees. I'd recommend Twilio to any of my developer friends.","Not cons, but It's a bit hard to know what other teams are doing due to so many different teams, segmented businesses, and remote teams in many different global regions as the company expands through acquisitions and business growth. Like this year's Twilio kick-off slogan ""Come together!"", I'm looking forward to learn other businesses within Twilio and how other teams work.

Compared to the scale and impact of Twilio, the brand recognition and understanding of what Twilio does to common public is smaller than its business size as of right now, but I love they have been focusing on improving the quality of products and scaling the business first."

They also have a good reputation so their name looks good on a resume.,"If you are in ""sales"", expect to do minimal selling and a lot of maintenance/account management. Twilio is self-service, but many customers do not know how to do the build themselves/leverage Twilio to the best of their ability and our support team is not great at helping. You will also deal with 5-10 billing issues a day because we can't invoice correctly. 

The training when you start is 3 days long to learn about the Twilio platform, but they don't cover anything when it comes to learning Twilio systems/the ins & outs of Twilio. This is important because the hardest part about selling Twilio, is Twilio. We have extremely poor infrastructure/systems. 

They also are misleading when it comes to career growth and their is no straight forward answers/paths built out on how to advance."

137,Twilio,sales recruiting,2022-01-14,5.0,Recruiting,"two words: job security - we continue to hire in high volumes to support our rapidly growing GTM organization. 

Twilio has gone through rapid growth and as a result, change is inevitable. If you thrive on delivering on your numbers, helping to successful scale sales organizations, and care about meaningful work - this is the job and company for you. 

While I know we haven't always gotten in right the first time, we have an organization of owners. What that means is, we're all responsible for highlighting the inefficiencies and working to come up with the right solutions that allow us to continue this build. The door is always open for feedback, and our leadership team is focused on doing what's right for the employees. 

Personally, I like the challenge Twilio gives me each day to attract the best talent into our company. I am given autonomy, a voice, and feel my leadership team has my back. In addition, I have seen the GTM organization really lean into us as TA partners. I am not a resource, I have a seat at the table. I earned that by being vocal and pushing to ensure we're not an afterthought. I am very grateful to have found a home in sales recruiting at Twilio.","We are growing fast, and that means a lot of change. As I mentioned above, change management doesn't come without its challenges. I frequently tackle objections from candidates who aren't clear on the vision, or strategy of Twilio. It's my personal mission to make sure I'm sharing all the reasons this company has supported me, and helped me do meaningful work. I am not scared of the challenge, I welcome it. If you are looking for something with meat, this is the right place for you. If you're on the fence, reach out to one of our recruiters via Linkedin and ask. There are so many of us who love to turn a negative perception into a positive one!"

Our CEO has a good heart.,"Long hours, especially for the months surrounding the SIGNAL conference. Meeting heavy culture - even as an IC, I would be in meetings sometimes from 8-6pm straight on top of my actual job. I felt like I was shuffled around a lot between teams and projects because our strategy was changing so often, although I would say the most painful changes were unintended consequences vs. strategic decisions (e.g., 4 managers in less than 6 months). There are certainly pockets of highly political/toxic people, but if you end up on a good team and heavily advocate for yourself you'll be fine. Our CEO/leadership has to remind everyone to be nice to each other periodically. Twilio will not take care of you. I can't say that I'd recommend working here for someone in an early stage of their career."

There's a lot of opportunity to make money as an AE at Twilio but you're not running traditional sales cycles. You make money by convincing those who are already spending to spend more OR by finding a needle in a haystack to take their spend from nothing to something. The former is often a little more project management than it is sales and the latter is very arduous and time consuming.

The company is growing 50%+ YoY has a public company with 7k+ employees. That's the fastest growing B2B tech company of this size of all time, right up there with Salesforce, Slack, etc.","1. Performance is highly dependent on your accounts. Large deals at Twilio require high volume so think B2C tech companies (apps mostly) with huge followings, users, etc. like Robinhood, Chime, Acorns, etc. There are so many of these accounts to go around so whoever gets and holds these accounts is all but guaranteed to have pre-determined success. 
2. It's also very difficult to sell Twilio into non-tech companies. Developers are essentially a requirement and if you have a patch with a lot of old school industries like manufacturing, you're SOL. 
3. Also there's Lots of favoritism in the MM org. You can tell when certain people get decisions in their favor, great accounts year after year, optimal territories, and/or are slated for promotions despite lacking the quantitative metrics, merits and experience. It's a huge morale killer.

173,Twilio,Twilio(INDIA) is a HHH(H-horrible) rated company. Let me explain.....,2021-12-07,2.0,Software Engineer,"No challenging work, rather very lame work, which you can finish in no time, hence awesome work life balance. If you want a company with decent pay and want to chill completely, don't care about career progress/increment, this is the place for you.","Explaining the title(HHH) here.....

Let's first get this out of the way. No I don't just write negative reviews, I make sure to always post positive reviews too.

Twilio is a great company no doubt, Twilio India also could have been so much more, but they have completely messed it up, and if you are even a decent developer this will be a complete waste of your time.

* First H stands for Horrible Pay/Salary Structure:
 1. The pay here is so much less compared to all the other product companies in India.
 2. Your package will have ~50% stocks, which is a big lossy deal(assuming you are in 30% tax bracket), as cash gets taxed at ~32% whereas your stock will get taxed at ~42%, plus the stocks of this company has wild volatility, for example it has lost almost $160+ per share in the last couple of months.
 3. Increment is meager here, ranging from 4-8% in most of the cases.

* Second H stands for Horrible Work:
 1. Mostly maintenance kind of work comes in India, and it is mostly small changes and bugfixes, all the core challenging/interesting/business critical features are held in US offices.
 2. Higher management will tell a bunch of lies during hiring to attract and recruit people, but it's just a bunch of lies.

* Third H stands for Horrible Higher Management:
 1. Twilio has a core value called ""No Shenanigans"", but the higher management in India are role models for just the exact opposite of it.
 2. As I said above for lying during recruitment, they do the same for internal things, they hide and lie as long as they can, giving lame reasons later to cover it up.
 3. All the false promises they give you during joining, they don't hold up any of them and later when asked they keep saying they are looking into it.

Even if all these things are ok with you, you can for once think of joining Twilio India core. BUT there is another company called Segment which Twilio has recently acquired, and they have teams in India for the same, if you even remotely find out that you are being hired for Segment teams, run with all fours as fast as you can. There is a great deal of politics involved in this company between the higher management and you will just be the victim of it all the time.

To summarise, the purpose of this review was, I had been hiring engineers, and occasionally some of them will be really good, and it really hurts me to not being able to tell them about all this and they joining here and regretting later.

So I wanted this review to stand as an eye opener for them, and if not via this review, at least do your own research to connect with people from Twilio offline/via friends, and get to know what you are getting yourself into and then only join.

Honestly until you fall into the category of people I mentioned in Pros, I think you will get far better companies to join in Bangalore than Twilio."

You have to do exactly what is asked and the way it is asked like you were under command. Be prepared that your efforts to bring goods and improvements to the team will never be considered as positives. That is why it is extremely difficult to stay positive in such environment. 

Typically, there are clear favorites and outsiders in the team. Eventually, engineers start losing their confidence and become unemployable. They may become very defensive or toxic because this behavior is reinforced by the environment."

Although I don't have the stats on how many people are joining the company, the number of people who have already left seems quite big. But I guess it's normal in companies of such scale.
Perhaps I am just too naive to think that this doesn't happen a lot in other companies, but to me it seems there is quite a lot of some kind of bureaucracy going on. Almost every week I see some new initiatives which involves lots of new documents. Hard to keep up."

So while it was scary to be a contractor, my hard work paid off and I really feel like my manager has my back. I would say pay is pretty competitive and I love that EVERYONE employed at Twilio gets stocks. We have great perks like gym, phone, book, desk set up reimbursements. 

But what I really love about this company is that I don't feel like a resource and I actually feel like I'm making a difference and that I 'count'. This company carries a lot of empathy from what I have seen. We had a snow storm in Austin, TX in Feb and they gave everyone $1K to go get a hotel room to stay warm. We also have two mental health weeks to take off in August and September that was just implemented. Basically the entire company shuts down. 

I feel very lucky to be employed at Twilio and the people I have placed have told me that they to feel lucky and that they hadn't been this happy at a company in a long time so I know it's not me as I always solicit feedback from people I have recruited here.","As a recruiter, we are growing at a RAPID pace so there are tons of jobs and it's a lot of work but to be honest, I love my job so it doesn't seem like work to me."

I am a gay man and never received a promotion or even a development plan. My managers had the same or less experience than I had yet I was held back. During a layoff last year they eliminated my position (no development plan) and gave my responsibilities to less experienced managers who are younger. I am not a disgruntled employee. They did they same with my peers who also had their jobs eliminated. The meaning of diversity at Twilio is hiring women.. I agree, hire women! But diversity has a much broader definition."

304,Twilio,Knives out,2021-05-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- SendGrid was great but the experience after the Twilio acquisition went rapidly downhill. Compensation and benefits are good; stock and ESPP were especially sweet as the stock price really took off. 

- Free food and beer in the office (in the Before Times anyway) were a nice perk, although Twilio started gradually whittling away at that and other perks. 

- Company continues to grow robustly in spite of flaws.","- The veneer of inclusivity and sensitivity and whatever the hell Twilio Magic means belies a real viciousness that took me by surprise after I’d been lulled into believing the facade. Unfortunately I took leadership’s Ned Flanders surface act at face value, only to find out it was a fraud. I wasn’t all that enamored of the SendGrid leadership that took their huge piles of money and left after the acquisition, but they were much better than their Twilio counterparts. There might be some managers in the organization interested in coaching their reports toward career development but that was certainly not my experience. Oddly, threats are not especially effective as a motivation and coaching technique. Weird, I know.

- Twilio engineering had the reputation of growing too quickly to implement the kind of process and discipline needed for enterprise-level software development and it showed in the platform’s instability and number of outages."

Great D&I
Very competitive pay within the industry
Nice vibe overall and feels like most people in the company are great","Career development into different areas is a bit tricky as from how the operation is structured, offices are really scattered around the world. If you have the availability to relocate, it's great, otherwise you're kinda stuck with the not so many areas available in each location. 
I'm sure it's something they're looking at but specially with how the world has gone remote as of the last year, perhaps trying to be more open with cross location teams and employees would really help in this regard.
Not a major issue at all though."

-The benefits. PTO, Stock Purchase Plan, the pay in general.. all stellar.","---Twilio is tough. You have to genuinely like a challenge in order to adjust here... I've seen people have a really hard time onboarding with how complex our product is and how quickly you need to adapt. ""Drinking out of the firehose"" is a common expression, and feels quite accurate when starting (but also for the first full 8 months). Also, growing pains suck (although they are expected with how quickly we're growing rapidly) so a lot of processes change overnight.
---Also, there's virtually unlimited PTO, but it's hard to take it because everything moves so quickly. So it's up to you to create your work life balance, and people like me may end up working too much."

While most companies talk a big game about caring for their employees, Twilio actually means it and backs it up. Especially during COVID-19, Twilio has been going above and beyond to make sure that as employees, we feel included and valued. The career trajectory and culture alone make this an awesome culture to work for. Plus, the perks are pretty good too.","In terms of working in sales, Twilio is definitely not a traditional sales company, which is probably both a pro and a con at times. If you are a salesperson and are looking for a traditional software sales company, then Twilio may not be the best fit.

Before Twilio, I worked for one of the most disruptive technology companies in history - so it really was not an easy decision to make. Still, I am must say I am superbly happy that I made this decision.

I enjoy every day at Twilio as the company takes good care of its employees, and you feel that you are an integral part of the company.  

Also, they are pretty authentic people, and you feel it in the energy at our offices, customer events, all hands, pretty much wherever you go. 

Customers, especially, developers LOVE Twilio as it is one of those companies that they have the best documentation ever and a platform that works.  

To sum up, I love Twilio for a few reasons: 1. An enormous opportunity ahead of the company in the customer engagement space,  2. Authentic: honest and kind people all around (they want to do good); they care about diversity, environment, communities, employees,  and, most importantly, 3. When I talk to prospects, they get the value of Twilio and love platform for its excellent documentation and superior executive on its vision.","As any company at the growth stage, there are a lot of challenges with scaling the systems and processes to support the sales team and supporting function.

The product options are so interesting to sell to customers, which is truly unique.","Not one sales leader with the exception of one has carried the sales bag at Twilio. As a result, the leaders really have no clue on the extent of sales operations issues that are exhaustive and incredibly time consuming. In addition, a large portion of a sales job is doing account management, which really prevents the sales motions from happening.

While there are some good managers on the SendGrid side, mine was spineless  and we've done nothing but spin our wheels. 

Product direction is totally missing on the SendGrid side. It's like we are waiting for Twilio to tell us what to do but he um nothing is being said. 

Many mangers are unqualified and there is next to no (is there any) accountability for managers. I've seen more than one valuable employee be let go by mangers that, well, are simply not fit to be managers.

SendGrid used to have decent values. Hungry, Humble, Happy and Honest. As hokey as that sounds, when I joined, we lived mostly by them. (Honest was always weak. I attribute this mostly to Managment's get-in-line and conform or get out mantra (hence the valuable employees we've lost). I digress however. Now we have ""Twilio Magic"". It's so magic that employees objectively (according to an in-house survey) don't know what they are, or think we embody them."

Being in a function where I see and work with a lot of the organizations at Twilio, the place is great. I am a female employee who truly feels valued by my peers & by leadership. Twilio’s intent to ensure people of color & under represented minorities feel valued is also always there. The social impact we make in .org is incredible. It’s a bit baffling to see people are disinterested in Twilio investing in junior talent. Junior talent has to start somewhere & the fact Twilio is willing to invest, mentor & develop is amazing. I wish we could hire MORE junior talent - we are already a very top heavy company as it is. I also have a hard time believing someone got “fired” because they wanted to work on diversity. Twilio is always asking people to step up & contribute to diversity, be an ally, etc. 
Don’t believe everything you see on the internet - Twilio is a wonderful place to work, the culture is incredible, the majority of Twilio’s employees have the intention to always do the right thing.  
Twilio allows you to volunteer 20 hours/ year, which is awesome for social impact & giving back. 
Twilio is a growing company & culture, just because things can’t stay “the same” it was back when we were 300-400 employees, doesn’t make it a bad place. I love this company and the opportunity it has provided me over the last 4.5 years.","- Growing pains. Nothing to be scared of. It’s where you can make the most impact of helping “to scale” - but it can be painful having to adjust at times. 
- Getting people in the mindset of ruthlessly prioritizing. It seems after planning, things always do a “shift” mid year for something we didn’t predict to happen.

Wildly embarrassing earnings call, and it kept getting worse after the call.  Sounded like the 3 stooges - an embarrassing time to be at Twilio.  CFO lost huge credibility.

There's a lot of new management and they are people who have worked at scale and can help us as we continue to grow and evolve. Good people, lots of challenging work, and great market opportunity!","2019 was a year of growing pains. We doubled our workforce and don't have the infrastructure and processes that support our size and scale. We need to go slower to go faster long term since we're feeling the growing pains that come with this level of growth.  We sometimes fail to live our value of ruthlessly prioritizing and try to do too much at one time.

* A strong sense of social mission","The engineering org has lost its way and the pace and quality of innovation fell off a couple years ago and may never return. It's become a sales company and only cares how much its reps are crushing it. The product side has become a confusing mess of mismanagement, bureaucracy, politics, and competing sideways initiatives. Twilio  has the bureaucracy of a company ten times its size. None of its management knows what their jobs are or how to do them. The company has an inkling that something is wrong and is beginning to make some good firings, but the quality of incoming management is ever lower, so it's not helping.

The company is so enamored of social justice initiatives and abstract corporate values that the culture has become very cult-like, and is getting in the way of them actually running a company that takes care of its people."

Current management has a very top-down mentality, dictating stuff that should be left to teams, treating team members as fungible commodities they can just move around on a chess board
Trying to save money by focusing on very junior hires and hiring in places like Estonia and India (moratorium on US hiring).  Focus on junior devs means senior devs have to spend all their time mentoring and aren't able to be Individual Contributors, which is unsatisfying for many and leads to pretty crappy code"

Product is such a mess, it will take years to sort through.  Merger integration is shaky at best.  Executive leadership, the top two, will destroy the place.  Wildly ruthless and disrespectful on a regular basis.  Talk to any woman in leadership in particular.  Stock price has plummeted.  Much further, and departures will add up.  Loyalty to stock price, definitely not to the leadership.  Diversity?  Clear opportunity to hire a POC on the Board and who did they hire?  Another white man.  No substance or investment behind diversity whatsoever so stop pretending you're the voice for the industry.  All remarkably disappointing."

This is because of the growth, development and change that I've been a part of. I joined when we were in the final stages of being a start up and now get to be a part of the next phase. Having worked in more traditional companies previously it's been a great opportunity to work in teams where think outside the box is encouraged and where the perks and benefits are a deeply held part of the office culture. I've also been given the opportunity to work with teams outside of my core function which has led to building of relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders around the company and led to me being able to make an internal move to a new department.",As with all companies that go through rapid growth the processes haven't quite caught up with where we are but this is improving every day.

The people are very helpful and there for you for any help you will need.  The culture of the company is very attractive and everyone is very optimistic.

(1) Flexible working conditions -- my boss has always been understanding with requests to work remotely, leave early if necessary, take time off for personal issues




(2) Good work/life balance -- While you are at work in Twilio, you do work hard ; but once you are finished for the day - you really are finished. You can work as hard as you want and as long as you want - but overall, Twilio is respectful of people's time and personal lives



(3) Fun work environment -- it's a fun environment to work in; Twilio seems to put a lot of effort into their facilities and employee experience offerings



(4) Good benefits -- The benefits used to be kind of so-so, but they have overhauled them and now its actually really quite good



(5) Respectful of diversity -- As someone who is from a minority, I feel that Twilio does a good job with fostering a safe work space - and it feels genuine to me, not like a company which is just paying lip service



(6) Understanding and empathetic management and HR Department -- all the management which I have engaged with have been very supportive, understanding and empathetic. Of course, the role as a manager is to coach and help employees grow - so as in any company, managers are not shy about being honest with feedback - but this feedback has only ever been delivered in a respectful and professional manner. Similarly, Twilio puts a lot of effort into their HR and employee experience efforts - and I think that the HR function is probably the best 
 and most supportive one that I have seen out of all the companies I have worked for. 



(7) A genuinely good quality suite of products that provides a tangible value add for customers -- It might be complicated at times, but at the end of the day, Twilio is a good quality product offering, and it's easy to see why people would choose to use our products. For me, this makes it easier to understand the product and do my job




(8)  Lots of mobility and opportunity to move around teams -- Twilio likes giving people the opportunity to move around and try different things and work on different teams, and its quite common to see people move around to different roles","(1) Complicated products that change pretty quickly -- only a con if you are someone who is not comfortable in that kind of environment - but sometimes you do feel a bit all at sea with all of the new products


 
(2) Sometimes lengthy chains of communication which make it hard to get tasks done quickly -- some teams have complicated structures with people in different time zones and with different responsibilities - so it is hard to adopt a rinse and repeat methodology with workflow



(3) Very San Francisco dependent -- this is improving, but we are still heavily anchored to SF for a lot of more important issues - with the timezone difference, this can sometimes be a headache



(4)  lack of precedence for certain customer situations which means that you are sometimes winging it and hoping for the best -- Twilio is an ever changing suite of products, and inevitably, there are sometimes new situations and problems)



(5) Constantly changing priorities -- sometimes it is a case of something being important one day, and then low priority the next - the only way to handle it is to just ride the wave of whatever is going on at that time



(6) Very ""American"" -- Twilio doesn't seem to full grasp a lot of the cultural differences that exist between the US and EMEA - so sometimes their methods can be a bit jarring for those not used to the more informal American work culture. Honestly, most of the time this is more of a source of laughter than a gripe - but its definitely something that they should address as they grow in Europe"
514,Twilio,All may not be what it seems. Welcome to Twilio Dublin,2019-07-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some great people working in the office. Salary and benefits are good.,"HR in Dublin is self a serving, spouting 'function', and is sure to tell everyone that they are all about the business and its people, its great sales talk. This person rarely shows up in the office. Only comes in when a senior manager or director visits from another office to give the illusion that they're usually there. 

This person does not want to deal with any issues that come their way, removes themself from any possible grievance, and passes it onto another person so not to annoy senior managers and directors by highlighting grievances. Being ‘friends’ with these senior managers is more important then doing the job they’re there to do. 

The previous 5 star review for Dublin ""Encouraged to be your authentic self"" with the section about HR in particular being approachable and helpful, is the most self indulgent tripe I've ever seen. Obviously a fake review from HR."
515,Twilio,Good growing company,2019-07-19,5.0,Senior Physical Security Manager,Great leadership and the pay is nice.,"No work-life balance, you will just work all the time."
516,Twilio,Fast growing but ruthless company,2019-07-01,2.0,Sales,"-Talented, smart & experienced executive team
-Leading CPaaS product
-Stock performance 
-Aggressive commission plans (at least while I was there)
-Commercial sales segment doing exceptionally well - most reps are far exceeding plan
-Budding sales culture
-Good alignment with marketing
-Employees are friends with each other outside of the office","-More focus on looking good in front of the right people vs. actual performance
-Executives will not own their mistakes, would rather offload blame and fire scapegoats
-Dehumanizing, tyrant executives who will cut you off mid-sentence and bring down morale
-Culture of judgment where you could be alienated for a mistake 
-Secretive, ""big brother"" leadership style where little info is shared with individual contributors
-Leadership style is ""do as I say not as I do""
-Short term decision making > long term decision making (e.g. win the logo at all costs instead of focusing on margin, activation and solution delivery)
-Zero empathy for any personal struggles experienced outside of the office
-No mechanism for management feedback 
-Struggles with moving up-market (particularly Flex) - top enterprise reps are not 100% of plan 
-Internal battles continue to ensue over account ownership
-Most remaining employees I've personally spoken with are staying because they feel handcuffed by RSU vesting"
517,Twilio,Good product but terrible culture,2019-06-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"really great product, smart executive team","too much stress, no reliable source to give real feedback, no growth for employees"
518,Twilio,Blaming and oppression,2019-06-04,1.0,Software Engineer,"Stocks, business travels, snacks, free lunch.","There is no such thing as a work-life balance. Be ready to work as much as you are required to. Twilio is an international company, and nobody cares if it's already night on the other side of the ocean.
Think twice on every word you say, as anything that can be interpreted as an inappropriate language can and will be used against you during performance reviews or as an argument to put some pressure on you during any other work-related topic.
Don't expect any cooperation between teams: people are reserved and try to avoid irritating authoritarian management by personal initiatives since it leads to even more blaming.
Overall the atmosphere here resembles an army: there is always an artificially created lack of resources (unrealistic deadlines, missing conference rooms, poor equipment, etc), limitless understanding of whole picture by common employees, punishing and oppressing way of motivating people to work.
This seems to work for business, but it's dubious deal for a regular employee."
519,Twilio,Good overall company. Hot and cold teams. Ego risks.,2019-06-02,3.0,,"Solid product in a good space. Going to grow on this basis alone.
Lots of chances to stand out
Always a challenge
Great, energetic people. 
Rewards for giving back 
Doers and builders stand out","Egos alienate good people and overlook risks. 
eg 1 SF-centric mentality forgets simple things like different time zones and cultural differences.

520,Twilio,Encouraged to be your authentic self. Not big in hierarchy- Welcome to Twilio Dublin,2019-05-24,5.0,Accountant,"Twilio is a great employer. I appreciate it especially when I compare myself to my peers in other tech companies. We get paid very competitively and the perks are amazing. The job itself is rather interesting as well. I love the very caring and chilled atmosphere in the office - coming from a financial background , the flexibility my managers give me and the autonomy is amazing and I for one am very appreciative of it , we are given the tools to succeed.  In no other company will you get so much 1:1 time with your manager and controller who will sit you down and ask what career path you're looking at and how they can help you get there.

You're always encouraged to be your authentic self. Not big in hierarchy. - Sense of belonging: The people working here are usually passionate about what they are doing. 

HR team very approachable and helpful when anytime advice was required. Always available :-)

Lot's of resources for learning and development while you work in making the world more open and connected","- As in any company you will encounter issues and you will not be happy with many things, it's not Paradise.However , I found that the more we put in the more we get back. 

 - Very fast paced environment. - You get a lot and you have to give back more."
521,Twilio,Great opportunities in an exciting company,2019-05-22,5.0,Finance Analyst,"Lots of pros here: 
1. Twilio is experiencing a huge amount of rapid growth. This gives employees an opportunity to get a vast amount of experience in senior tasks that may not be possible in more established companies. 
2. The benefits are excellent - health insurance, well-being monthly allowances/perks and great stock plans. Parental leave and PRSA pension were also recently added, putting us on a level playing field with other tech companies. Of course, there's lots of food/beverages to enjoy & social engagements too. 
3. There is typically a fun and relaxed atmosphere. 
4. Company-wide leadership is very approachable.
5. There is a lot of flexibility with work hours & places (e.g working from home  is no problem & fitting hours around personal commitments is also very do-able as long as you are getting your work done). This is a huge perk. 
6. Teams are so willing to help each other. Most people working at twilio are incredibly friendly.","Some cons due to the rapid growth: 
1. There is risk of burn-out for some employees, due to the rapid growth - however & keeping up with the pace of change, however, this is acknowledged by management and not ignored. 
2. Internal processes are not yet where they need to be  - but it is a case of progress over perfection. This is to be expected in a growing company. 
3. Working across multiple timezones can affect work-life balance negatively, however, as the company grows, I expect a more in-region business model to be put into practice. The flexibility available also counter-acts this."
522,Twilio,Can't build Culture with RSUs and stock options,2019-05-16,2.0,UI-UX Designer,"The money is sweet... it is more than the average anyway
Benefits are good...(including stock)
Most times you can slack for hours during the day and no one cares...","There is deffo something wrong here in regards to culture and inclusivity...
When I visited HQ in SF for the on-boarding sessions, I was impressed that no one invited me to hang out.
It's like you are invisible.

Although the office(s) there is huge it is totally sterilised with no vibe or emotion.
Probably everyone is busy checking the share price.

Other offices are  too small to have any character of its own.

If you don't care about culture and values.... you'll be fine."
523,Twilio,Fantastic company - once in a career opportunity to grow,2019-05-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great company - truly values diversity and autonomy at every level of the business.

524,Twilio,"Great Company, Leadership and Coworkers",2019-05-03,5.0,Customer Account Executive,"1. Transparency and access- Within the first six months of working at Twilio in a remote office, I personally met with 5 C-levels here. There are constant ""ask me anything"" type forums and feedback is encouraged. There is always something to contribute, and I know that in my short time here I have made an impact. 

2. The people - smart and genuine people work here and its easy to be inspired to be greater.  ""All-in"" mentality and most people will help. 

3. Twilio works. Customers love Twilio and want to talk about what they build. This company is transforming the future of communications.  Our earnings call keeps getting more and more impressive each quarter.  My LinkedIn is blowing up with people that want to join.","1. Lots of internal inefficiencies - learn to ""be ok"" that there isn't a process to everything (or most things)

2. Easy to be overwhelmed and overworked. There is always something to fix or take ownership on. There isn't always a clear path. You can get a little emotional if you don't anticipate this. 

3. Remote employees are often an afterthought. Logistics with everything from scheduling meetings, technology, and benefits still are messy outside of HQ."

Smart co-workers
Senior leadership is very inspiring and employees seem excited to be part of a growing company","There is a tribal culture within the engineering orgs! Teams seem to focus on their deliverables and there isn’t much focus or priorities given to unblock or help other teams! Although the upper management says we want to get rid of tribal culture and focus on bigger picture, the ground reality is completely different. 
As the team and company grows, there seems to be silos of information stacked amongst few ‘key’ old timers and very little is done to disseminate the information, the tribal culture makes it even more worse."

Twilions are willing to work with each other across teams and a lot of us work well together. Even those of us who didn’t work well together at first have managed to figure out how!","Some confusing management picks have been made. Some new management has displayed immature behavior, stonewalling & giving the cold shoulder to some, while loudly being friendly to others. It makes the work environment uncomfortable. Other management changes have included replacing someone with amazing experience with another person with very little. This feels hostile and it feels like all the work I’ve done since starting means nothing to these new people. I had hoped to stay here for years, but I’m not sure I want to do that. I’ve tried to talk to multiple people in management about my concerns, but have been brushed off. I used to feel like I actually mattered here. Not the case anymore."

Nice moat around competition, which is also a Con, see below.","I've worked for other companies that have this problem. I've seen it come crashing down before. 

Every week the CEO gets up in front of the company for the all-hands meetings and is just so bubbly enthusiastic about how fast they're growing, and isn't this great, and thanks to everyone for all the hard work, and go team, and isn't the amazing growth just INCREDIBLE,  and yay for us, etc. The problem is once the obligatory cheers die down, EVERYONE HAS TOO MUCH TO DO. The rah-rah atmosphere is a two-edged sword. It makes so that people feel they aren't being a team player if they stop and say ""Wait a second, we're growing so fast we aren't doing very many things really well, and at this pace, it won't be long before we aren't doing ANYTHING well."" Meanwhile, employees are getting silently burned out, pressured to feel that this is such an oh-so-very-special place to be lucky enough to be that a few jugs of midnight oil burned for the cause is nothing we should be complaining about. 

Twilio is something of a cult, and people are expected to work very long hours and often in a slapdash fashion ""for the cause"".

The company has an unusually niche technology stack, so most people coming to work here have a steep learning curve and have to acquire a larger-then-average amount of proprietary knowledge. Which means the people who have already climbed that learning curve are not easily replaced."

I've met and worked with some extraordinary people here, and I really value what I've learned from them.","The first year I worked here, I was ready to quit. I lucked into a change in situation and now I really like my job, but working here is very much like participating in the free market in that you have to go make your own success and job fit, and there are no safety nets if something goes wrong.  However, there are high rewards when you do well if you've managed to find your way into a good team or org. Overall, I think the risk is worth it, because there are lots of good areas, but I hate seeing valuable people wasted on bad management and churn."
539,Twilio,N/A,2019-01-21,5.0,Intern,Good place to work at.,It really gets boring sometimes.
540,Twilio,I love this place! I feel like I've found my home.,2019-01-11,5.0,Senior User Experience/UI Designer,"What can I say? Twilio is a company that truly caught me by surprise. I've worked in all types of environments from agencies, large corporations, to companies creating products – none them come close to Twilio in how they treat their employees, the culture, the CEO, and the innovation. I feel like I ""dated"" a bunch of different jobs and finally found my dream job. That's not an exaggeration.

Things I love:

• Cool office space in downtown SF 

• Friendly co-workers, humble yet good at what they do. No one makes you feel dumb if they have more experience than you. People want to help.

• Competitive salary, RSU's, great benefits for a super low cost for families, quarterly raises, unlimited vacation (with manager approval), weekly dinners and lunches, fridges and shelves stocked with drinks and snacks. 

• Making really cool stuff, innovating, and being empowered and trusted to do your job – not micromanaged. 

• Work from home option – this is especially important to me since I live in Sacramento and can only come in once or once every other week to the SF office.

• Great upper management – my boss is a fantastic leader (very hard to find) who empowers you to do your job, is concerned with your growth, and would help you grow in your skillset and career path no matter if you stayed at Twilio or left. That's the sign of great leadership.

• Great home/life balance – my manager has made it clear he doesn't want us working over our 8 hours in our work days. That rarely happens if ever in a tech company. I appreciate that and so does my family.

• Trending up – Twilio is growing like crazy, acquiring other software companies and taking the market by storm. That's exciting to be a part of.","I usually can find negatives but I really don't feel like anything is negative about the company, I really do love it here. 
Maybe the fact that it's growing so fast can be a little crazy, we're bringing in about an average of 20 people a week so we're running out of space in SF but other than that Twilio is really great."

Customers are happy and are under the impression that product is awesome

Intelligent people with significant business and technical acumen

Catered lunch and snacks","Twilio Sales org is a new branch of Twilio. The internal processes are downright garbage and morale is terrible. Management has no idea how to assign territories, create accurate comp, and will put you on a PIP immediately if you don't make the near impossible ramp quota. This happens because the product is incredibly difficult to learn, and you need to spend hours outside of work daily - this will take you about 6-8 months to even feel comfortable positioning the product on the phone. But by then, you'll already be incredibly stressed out about your performance.

Morale is terrible and management realizes all the problems I have mentioned, but does little to do anything about it. The changes they want to implement take forever. 80% of revenue for Twilio comes from marketing and it's a self-service platform, so the company's focus on Sales is pretty much nonexistent. The onboarding is trash for sales.

If you want to be in sales here, do not believe in work/life balance. It doesn't exist if you want to be a top performer. The compensation is not worth the effort in my opinion.

Again, if you're an engineer or interested in product, DEFINITELY consider Twilio."

I know this isn’t on account of my experience or effort level; I’ve worked at 3 other great companies in the Bay Area and left another company in hopes of a new opportunity to keep the trend upward. Regardless of how often I’ve made it clear and shown my hard work to management, it has been clearly overlooked.

Territory defines your success here and even if you work hard, management will seemingly give good territories to either brand new reps or promoted BDRs. Why not give it to reps who know how to sell and aren’t new to the gig? Maybe they would grow the deal size a bit more. If you ask for help on bettering your situation, don’t expect to get some actionable ideas on how to get better or improve your situation. They may as well say a blanketed statement like do better.

Our comp plans have been a complete mess and are now capped so there isn’t an opportunity/incentive to overachieve in our department. Also as others have indicated, your comp plan changes quarter to quarter as they attempt to “improve it” so it’s hard to really know how you will end up doing in the end. 

Morale is at an all time low and management doesn’t really know how to improve it. They ask their teams to try and be positive and trust their direction. Well I’ve been trusting their direction and it hasn’t paid any dividends.

If you plan to work hard, expect some recognition, want to make money and are looking for a positive environment, this is not the place to do it. Experienced reps with great training don’t succeed here, it’s the ones who are on the top of the managers mind that do."
562,Twilio,It's been a fun ride,2018-09-10,5.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"I've worked with a few tech companies in the Bay area and this is by far the best company I've worked for.

Territories are not equal and the ones that are left are not good. Regardless, you'll have the same quota as everyone around you. Also, they hardly train you so don't expect to know what you're talking about for at least 8-12 months. You'll also sign a new comp plan every quarter and won't get paid for at least 45 days after the quarter, probably even longer. The comp plan also might not come out until the week before the quarter ends so you may have no idea how you're actually getting paid the entire time.  If you have issues about anything and bring it to HR, it won't accomplish anything."

This problem seemingly runs through the entire engineering management chain. There is not a single department headed by a manager people respect. As you can imagine, when a lot of people like this get together, fiefdoms develop.

580,Twilio,Horrible place to work if you are in sales,2018-03-21,1.0,Sales,Decent product with name recognition with an impressive list of customers.,"OMG where do I start? Twilio is an awful place to work as a salesperson.  They have been having a sales hiring surge over the last year after the new COO came to Twilio from Salesforce. He is trying to make Twilio into Salesforce's image and is making it a terrible sales culture. So much change in territories and comp plans that it was impossible to build a pipeline. The comp plan is so hard to understand that reps just give up trying to figure it out. (30 pages long) Twilio pays comp 4 times a year. 45 days after the end of the quarter. And when they do pay comp it is usually wrong. There are constant battles between sales, operations and legal. The processes are so arduous to follow and they are constantly changing. And you better watch out if you want anything done quickly.  The legal and operations teams have no sense of urgency. and if you do need something done outside of the process they will penalize you for it .  There are so many cliques at Twilio that if you are not in the ""cool crowd"" then you are isolated and ignored. Favoritism is rampant. Reps who are favored get all the good leads and opportunities. Executive sales leadership is the worst I have ever experienced.  They do not value salespeople who color outside the lines and if you upset the wrong person  you get fired for  some trumped up reason. If you don't fit into their sales model then they find ways to make you exit the company.  Cutting territories, moving people around and reassigning accounts and pipeline.  If you have a problem with management don't go to HR. All they do is tell your manager what you said. Bottom line-Twilio is a horrible place to work for salespeople."

I love the people I work with and feel like I've found a workplace where I can fully be myself and be appreciated for me. While there's a bit of hierarchy and politics day to day, people genuinely want to help each other and make the company more successful. There's a spirit of togetherness that I love seeing every day. 

And an amazing culture of innovation. My coworkers are constantly thinking through how we can make products, processes, and people more efficient. They genuinely care about what they do, and our follow through as a company for what we commit to is incredible.

Our sales team is killing it, support is doing a whole lot with very little, facilities are my favorite people, and product keeps coming up with brand new ideas to make cool things happen.

Twilio treats its employees well. We may complain about the lunch line and so-so benefits, but the sheer amount of care that's put into things like our company all hands and our new hire training experience shows the company's dedication to its people. 

Jeff is an great leader and sets an amazing example. Management, on the whole, are caring and well intentioned. We've had some really incredible new managers from internal promotions who I enjoy working with.","Ok, so some of the less glamorous aspects:

Twilio's model for designing and shipping new products has... shall we say... some areas for improvement. There's an almost exhausting race to find the next biggest, brightest thing to go after. As a result we have a lot of floundering old projects because we're bad at retiring products but really good at running at breakneck speed towards the next new announcement. Churning our products quickly creates engineering issues. Also, it's just plain exhausting for our engineers and it drives marketing to insanity for every launch.

And we preach wearing the customer's shoes, but the shoes we try to wear are a tiny group of customers who will generate the most revenue. Product Managers are missing exposure to a larger set of customer issues that literally prohibit some users from adopting Twilio, and there's no easy way for them to get more expansive qualitative feedback.

Also, most importantly, Twilio is essentially propped up by a subset of really, really amazing executors. We know informally who a lot of these people are. Lots of them are employees who have been at the company for many years, like myself. They have a lot of institutional knowledge. And they are quitting. In droves. It's not unexpected in a post-IPO world, but the company seems highly reactive when a valued hard worker with tons of tribal knowledge announces plans to leave. I hope HR has plans for retaining what small long-standing talent remains or keeping people who've been around for a while more united. Especially within our sales force, where the majority of employees are new and reorgs are not uncommon."

Competing companies offer better perks (e.g., Twilio only offers food 2 - 3 times a week, while most tech companies offer breakfast/lunch/dinner everyday). Not a big deal, but it really sums up the benefits/pros of working at Twilio. Good, but not great!","Twilio's frugality pretty much sums up the cons of working here.

""Be Frugal"" is one of Twilio's company values and quite frankly I'm sick of it!!! The value is used differently from situation to situation such that the company always benefits and not it's employees.

On a related note, the compensation package at Twilio is a joke. Hardworking individuals are not rewarded (except maybe in Sales). No bonus structure for anyone outside of Sales. The leadership team/HR raves about how Twilio uses performance-based compensation reviews, but an absent bonus structure doesn't really support that premise. Promotions are extremely hard to come by and career path is non-existent for most roles.

All in all, if you are a hard worker looking to work at a technology company, there are much better alternatives out there from a career and compensation perspective."

I have never really seen a place where employees understand and care about the product as much as at twilio. Strong focus on innovation and creative freedom. Plus small team sizes (5-7 per team) afford a lot of opportunities to learn and grow.,Office space seems a little cramped up. Other than that none really.
611,Twilio,Hard to imagine a better job.,2016-03-31,5.0,Developer Evangelist,"First and foremost, the work is meaningful. The mission is to ""change communications forever"", and unlike so many cliched mission statements, we've actually got a shot at making that happen. Businesses have launched based on the existence of programmable SMS. Women have been rescued out of sex-trafficking because they were able to text a shortcode for help. Folks living in poverty have have found public assistance that they wouldn't have otherwise discovered for lack of adequate internet access. 

But if you're into building photo-sharing apps, you can do that too with MMS.

Working for a communications company allows you to impact nearly every sector of the economy. Something like 95% of Americans interacted with a Twilio phone number last year. And because the use-cases are so broad, we're constantly learning new ways that customers use our stuff (compare that to, say, an analytics company where there's more or less a singular purpose for your product). The customers and use-cases never get old. 

It's good to feel that the work you do matters. 

The people are great. I came from a small 30 person company where I had spent six years and I just assumed I'd never find that kind of kinship with a group of coworkers before. I'm remote, so my relationships are a bit different than most (more on that later), but every time I come back to HQ there are tons of hugs and smiles. Our engineering team is truly world class. Our facilities team executes at a level of excellence. The people here are genuinely kind, empathetic folks who care enough about their work to do it extremely well. 

The company cares deeply about its people. Think this is evident if you chat with anyone from the E-Team face-to-face. The salary is competitive and the benefits are generous. The parental leave policy (4 months maternity, 3 months paternity) is industry leading. Un-tracked PTO is legit (though, I agree that calling it ""unlimited"" is a bit shennanigansy). I've taken up to six weeks off a year. At an all-hands last year Jeff (CEO) said, ""I just got back from two-weeks vacation. I say that not to brag but to tell you all to take vacation. We're playing the long game here."" Last year we implemented mandatory vacation -- you have to take at least 5 continuous days off. 

The company and leadership try hard to be on the right side of social issues. The E-Team has gone to great lengths to diversify the workplace. For instance: having women's leadership panels during all-hands, bringing in outside consultants to evaluate our workforce diversity and to reveal unconscious bias in the hiring process, encouraging the employee-led Skittles group, throwing a celebration with hundreds of cupcakes on the day marriage equality passed. Twilio.org was given a huge endowment (don't know if that's quite the right word but I'll use it) to affect social change. We supported efforts to call senators and congressmen to fight for net-neutrality and against internet surveillance. We publish a quarterly transparency report. We publicly sided with Apple in their latest battle with the FBI. 

Jeff is an incredible leader. He is a battle-hardened visionary, an engaging public speaker and is capable of setting the mission and inspiring the troops. He's also a developer. Don't think the importance of that can be overstated for a company that builds tools for developers. Roy (COO) seems perfectly suited for his job as a nuts-and-bolts counterbalance to Jeff's role as visionary. More importantly, they are good men. This provides great assurance when issues come up that make you say, ""I'm not so sure about this..."" 

That's not to say that mistakes aren't made or that the working environment is perfect or that there aren't weeks when we have to sacrifice quality of life for the sake of getting the work done. But it's so much easier to endure those issues when you can trust the character of the leaders and the mission of the work.","You're going to work hard. There are often 50 hour weeks. Sometimes more. Tasks and job responsibilities aren't always clear. One of Twilio's core values is to ""Draw the Owl"" -- that is to say that there is no instruction book for many of the things we're trying to do. I put this in the ""cons"" because, while some people really dig this kind of environment, it's probably also the most common reason why folks quit. 

If you're looking for rigidly-defined roles and a 9 to 5 schedule, this won't be a good gig for you. Twilio's trying to brave new territory. There's no map. Sometimes we go the wrong direction and have to backtrack. Sometimes the trail is super bumpy. Sometimes the wagon tips over while fording a river. Sometimes people catch dysentery. It's the nature of going places no one has ever gone before and trying to get there before everyone else. Again, it's reassuring that the folks leading the expedition know (roughly) what they're doing and actually care about the people making the trip. But the ride's not always comfortable. If you're looking for things to complain about, you'll always find them. 

Similarly, the road to career growth isn't always apparent. I imagine that this in part stems from not knowing what roles we'll need two years down the line. I can name dozens of people promoted over the last few years, but I doubt many of them had that job in mind 12 months prior. In many cases, that job didn't even exist. Based on what I've seen, if you work hard and handle your workload, you'll gradually get more put on your plate. That ""more"" often evolves into a new position with a new title and new salary. 

The remote experience isn't awesome. 75% of the company is colocated in SF so, naturally, a lot of the culture revolves around HQ. There are impromptu celebrations, social activities and hallway conversations that you'll miss out on if you're not at HQ. It's easy to feel like an outsider. It's a known problem that folks are actively trying to solve. We recently switched to a new video conference provider, have experimented with leading all-hands from remote locations, and surveys have gone out to ask remotes how we can improve. Company wide adoption of Slack last year helped a lot too. 

All that said, collecting an SF salary while not living in SF is pretty cool. 

If you live in the States and want to work in engineering, you'll have to work out of either the SF or Mountain View offices. It's a bit disappointing that we haven't figured out how to utilize a remote engineering team, but that does seem to be the norm. It does seem that we're improving as we now have engineering offices in Estonia and Bogota. But for the most part, if you're a developer, you must be willing to relocate to SF. 

We've outgrown HQ. WiFi there is pretty bad. This is frustrating for remotes too as video conferences hang and drop. There aren't enough conference rooms and telephone booths, so there's often a lot of background noise on calls. These issues should be resolved when our new HQ opens. I haven't heard an official ETA yet, but I'm guessing early 2017 at the latest. 

There seems to be a ""if you want to get something done, set a meeting"" culture at HQ and the open workplace is fairly distracting. I've certainly found it easier to put my head down and work while being remote. 

Twilio's certainly not a perfect place, but I think it's easy to get a warped perspective of what constitutes a ""normal"" work environment when you work in tech.  My guess is that if you took the average non-tech worker (or the average office worker from a generation ago) and dropped them into the Twilio office, showed them the benefits, showed them the culture, the free lunches, the stocked kitchen, the Wednesday night dinners, the track jacket ceremony and the $30/month Kindle reimbursement, they'd be astonished that workplaces like this exist. 

It's worth tossing a disclaimer in there that I'm a remote employee working on one of the few fully-remote teams, and am largely shielded from the day-to-day BS that pops up at a company of Twilio's size. My experience is quite different than that of most Twilions. Take my review with a grain of salt."
612,Twilio,Marketing Manager,2016-03-30,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Wonderful people - smart, motivated, enthusiastic, passionate
Exciting industry/ company - Twilio makes an awesome product and is the true innovator/ leader in their space. It's really exciting to work for a company that is setting the roadmap for their industry
Fast pace - everything moves quickly and people are excited to jump in and start doing
Openness to new ideas - the company welcomes new ideas and actively encourages people to try new things and constantly iterate","As with many fast growing companies, communication between teams could be improved. As it is, it often feels like teams within the same department don't communicate or share information as well as they could, which results in some missed opportunities for collaboration."
613,Twilio,Great place to work but not perfect,2016-03-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Twilio has a lot of good things going for it.  The platform is amazing, the people are selfless (helping out each other and giving back to the communities they live in) and the company seems to continue to succeed.  In Engineering, there's been some great leaders brought on and the ones who have been here for a year or two are starting to see success.","Though I do not work in or with sales, I've heard some people aren't happy.  While some people are successful, the sales model is unique which if you're not willing to adapt you may struggle."
614,Twilio,you need to understand /where/ you get into,2016-03-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Jeff, the CEO, tries fairly successfully to build a different kind of company. Think all the things you know and hate about big companies, he wants to avoid these. There is a strong emphasize on creating a family atmosphere: Twilio-Birthday parties, ThanksGiving dinners, Halloween costume contests, volunteering as a team and many more year round events. If you haven't yet realized the product is awesome and Twilio grows like crazy. There is also a strong desire for cultural diversity. If you always felt you are different from others, maybe even considered by some a little weird there is a good chance Twilio will hire you and you will have found a family at work. There is a lot of tolerance here. They hire almost only young people though, so be aware of that as well. People are trying hard to-do-the-right-thing beyond their jobs. Twilio for some is an attitude, an aspiration to make the world a better place ( Twilio volunteers, sponsored Hackathons, Twilio Fund, the Polaris project etc. )","Jeff is a product person, an engineer. Engineering and product teams rule this company. I think Jeff also understands the value of support, albeit the support team is constantly overworked. They have tens of thousands of signups per month and these people want to be nourished and no matter how good the Tech Support leader is and how fast they hire they will always be behind. This is an API, not a product and as such many support questions tend to be very involved. 
GA and Sales is outsourced to the COO who tries to operationalize his value by introducing former colleagues and corporate rules from much bigger companies. 
GA ( HR and Finance ) are the same as everywhere. It's a big well oiled machinery. They have their rules and processes and do their work.
If you are in Sales you are pretty much screwed at Twilio. Sales strategy so far has changed every 6 months without measurable impact and they went through several leaders in the last couple years. The problem is that while Twilio is growing like crazy it does that without measurable impact by sales. For Twilio sales is a experiment and costly at that. 
There had been quite some attrition in the sales team lately. I think these had been pretty good people who made or were close to making their numbers. They just realized that there is no career progress in a company where a sales person is shown as Bozo the clown.

Going back to the title of my review: If you want to join as support person you will either break or you turn into steel and can get a job anywhere after your Twilio life. If you want to be in GA ( HR, Finance etc.) Twilio is like any other place. Enjoy it while you are there and then move on.  If you want to be in an engineering or product role at Twilio this will be the job you will rave about for the rest of your life. If you play with the idea of a sales or sales support role you are in for a surprise and you better keep your current network close at hand."
615,Twilio,Great place to work!,2016-03-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people here are smart and driven. I like how the company does a very thorough job onboarding a new hire. They provide onboarding series that you can attend that are hosted by the executive team where you can learn about the history of Twilio and the different departments within Twilio and how they operate which I found really beneficial. Another cool aspect is that for the non-technical folks, there is a week bootcamp that you can attend where they will basically teach you how to create an app on the Twilio platform.

This is a great open environment where everyone is pretty friendly. The management here are transparent with what is going on and everyone wants to help you succeed. The CEO hosts a biweekly company all hands. The team I work on is great where I have a manager and a team that are not only supportive but is providing me insight to help me develop and grow and allows me to take ownership and autonomy on what I want to work on and do with my role. 

I've worked at many companies before both large and small and I'm really thankful to be here at Twilio because for me it's been a great balance.","Typically start up growing pains where more infostructure needs to be put in place and processes developed. It's definitely the type of environment for those that are driven, curious and willing to speak up/ask questions and execute on ideas. You have to be willing to adapt quickly as with most start ups as it is a fast paced environment. 

Not sure how they came up with the lunch schedule but its only 2-3 times a week which I wish was everyday but there's plenty of snacks available."

Sales is a necessary evil.  4 or 5 Chief Sales Leaders in less than two years.  Current leader is remote and powerless.  They let industry experts go.
618,Twilio,Not what I hoped for,2016-01-29,1.0,Sales Engineer,"I really like that there is a focus on humility at the company. I think that a lot of start ups these days have the pressure to make it big and the fact that Twilio focuses on things like Twilio.org is so awesome. My favorite team at Twilio is Facilities. They are so dedicated and welcoming. No matter the struggle they pull through for everybody, which is absolutely great!","In accordance with the several other reviews - No career growth opportunities what.so.ever. 

HR/Recruiting don't put enough focus on diversity hiring even within their own teams and team managers are new and untrained. People judge you and make you feel small like you don't matter almost as a defense mechanism so that when you do ask for more it's easier for them to shut you down. More of a corporate culture than a start up. Not as great as I hope for and kind of upsetting :("
619,Twilio,It's ok to work,2016-01-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice benefits, good work/life balance","Small company, so you don't have much career opportunities, tasks diversity, etc. For such small division as tallinn office the environment is surprisingly conservative."
620,Twilio,Amazing and effective engineering culture,2016-01-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Management really values engineers’ time and supports them when they want to pay down technical debt or focus on scalability.
* Small teams structure like at Amazon emphasizes ownership and teaches you many skills hands-on— writing the code, deploying, and ops management. (There is on-call for some software engineers, which may be a con for you).
* Very seriously takes some of the principles of agile / modern software development, such as committing to and checking-in on betterments from retrospectives, and using “we” phrasing when referring to outages and incidents. ""Be Humble"" is a corporate value and it is lived out pretty well.","* Interviews take up a lot of time, 1-2 hrs a day really add up.
* Not so good at distributing tasks such that senior engineers aren’t overloaded."
621,Twilio,"No career growth, poor management",2015-12-21,2.0,,"Twilio is a place that attracts good people. People who are passionate, driven, and honestly care about one another. On an individual level, some of the best, most personable people come from Twilio and make the place feel like home. However, just because the people care about one another does not mean that the company will care about you or your personal growth.","There is no ability to move teams. There is a career growth ladder that’s largely a joke. Promotions are made through back room channels. If you’re an engineer without a CS degree, particularly if you’re a woman or POC, good luck finding people who are willing to give you the opportunity to grow (or an equal paycheck). There is no investment in growth, learning, or educational opportunities. Don’t expect to be able to join a team like Customer Support or Sales Engineering and move into Engineering! You’ll only be disappointed.

Management is a huge problem. There is an excessive number of managers, and many who are first time managers who run their teams without proper training and support. The managers who are good at their jobs typically juggle 2-3 teams at a time. The rest hold personal grudges and push out people who don’t think exactly like them.

There’s a lot of talk about being a DOer. Do the thing you want. Be the change you want to see. So there are a lot of motivated folks who work hard in their off hours to create programs that make the company look really good, but never get compensated for their time and efforts beyond a token thanks. So keep that in mind if you want to start a program within Twilio.

Team breakdown:

The Product department runs the show. R&D spends more time trying to churn out half-baked ideas than making thoughtful, careful decisions and investing in technical debt. Deployments take hours, sometimes even days. Engineering is so used to fire-fighting that there’s little chance to think ahead and invest wisely in technical decisions.

Marketing is constantly fire-fighting and trying to find its voice. After 8 years, the company still doesn’t have a consistent message, target audience, or way to describe what it does. There’s a high concentration of bros on one of the teams in Marketing.

HR is a mess and completely out of touch with the rest of the company’s needs.

Sales is filled mostly with bros, although the BDR team and Sales Engineering seem to be heading in the right direction.

Customer Support is an old boy’s club and everyone seems a little shellshocked at all times.

Facilites is a gem, a diamond in the rough.

If you’re remote, good luck! It’s not going to be an easy road and nobody will care about what you need in order to do your job.

The Executive team is a mixed bag. Jeff, the CEO, is very passionate, but he’s more interested in becoming the next Amazon instead of building a great Twilio. Lee is a great CFO and runs a tight ship in Finance. Roy is a big company executive in a small startup land. The two don’t mix very well.

Overall, the people are really great. The product is going places. But treat this place like any other job and don’t fool yourself into thinking it’s a family or they’ll invest in you for more than a year."

623,Twilio,A good place to be!,2015-12-10,3.0,Engineer,"The company has a genuinely solid product portfolio and happy customers. The HR and Facilities teams make the office a nice place to be and will more than go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable. The on-boarding process for new employees is better than anything I've experienced before. As an Engineer, the technologies are more often than not new and fun to work with, you're always learning and there is no shortage of interesting problems to solve.","There is a ton of bickering between the various teams at Twilio, and thinking about it as I write this, the level of spitefulness is higher than anything I've ever experienced previously. We love to talk about small empowered teams at Twilio, which we have and are. But, an unintended consequence of the myriad engineering teams at Twilio is the unproductive competitiveness. Teams (and colleagues) very frequently trash one another behind closed doors rather than practice empathy and collaboration.

My take? The highest levels of Engineering management are quite adversarial and stand-offish. I don't interact with them often but in the few meetings where I'm exposed to them it's awkward. The fish rots from the head down, and I can't help but wonder if they're responsible for the conflicts and promoting some of the poor relationships found amongst the teams. Ultimately, you'll notice there is more thought on how to push engineers out than effectively growing existing ones."

- The industry/space is really interesting! There's a ton to learn about things you likely never knew anything about.
- The Twilio brand name is strong, particularly in the Bay Area
- Work-life balance is good. Sure there are some late nights, but overall this is a company that allows you to also have your own life.","- Extremely limited opportunities for career growth. This varies slightly across various departments, but overall this is not the place to go if you're looking for fast career growth.
- Inexperienced managers. Many managers at Twilio are first time managers and are young and inexperienced. They may have been great as IC's, but they're horrible people managers and do not know how to inspire or motivate.
- Compensation is low relative to market.
- By far the worst though is the company culture. This is a place where you'll routinely find your coworkers playing ""F*, marry, kill"" about other employees. Most social conversation revolves around who hooked up with who and rating the 'appeal' of other coworkers. If this type of thing makes you uncomfortable, you should stay away!"

645,Twilio,Best job I ever had.,2015-03-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I loved working at Twilio. The culture is fantastic, the company seems to try its darndest to uphold their 9 values (and a new set of Leadership values!) and they really try to take care of their employees.

Every Monday, Jeff Lawson (CEO) holds an all-hands meeting where he discusses things that the company is doing well and could be doing better. He is always excited, and he sticks around to watch other people present to the company. There is a fantastic onboarding process, including making all new-hires stand in front of the company and play The Name Game, where you basically here the 250+ SF employees learn your name by shouting it at you. It's pretty thrilling, and makes you feel welcome.

As the title of my review suggests, this was the best job I've ever had. Twilio is constantly, constantly shipping - so there's always something exciting going on. Every employee has to build an app, even if you have no prior experience coding. Once you get that app built (people will help you) you get a Twilio track jacket and some other great stuff. It's so empowering.

The benefits are great - I was on a distributed team so I had the opportunity to work from home if I wanted to -- I always wanted to come into the office. I had a couple of great managers, and the best team I could have asked for in the role. 

Anecdotally, I was laid off from Twilio. And despite the fact that I can no longer say ""I work at Twilio!"" which I used to proclaim with pride... I now get to say, ""I worked at Twilio!"" which still feels good. And of course all of my clothes (and shoes!) are Twilio branded, so I can still pretend if I want. 

PS: Do you have a Twilio shirt? They're so soft.","The growing pains of a burgeoning successful startup apply. As Twilio prepares for an IPO, they have to look more attractive to investors and are making the changes to accommodate the growth. Lots of new people, lots of new processes, and this might not be for some people.

When you hold yourself and your employees to such a high bar, there is a good chance that some fingers are going to slip from that bar. This is bad especially when those are managerial finge... alright, I'm skipping the bar analogy. It's so important that these values are regularly revisited at all levels."

I appreciate that everyone respects each other and no one person's job is more important than the other person's job within the organization...","Every fast growing family, I mean company has its dysfunctional features and Twilio is always willing to acknowledge their dysfunctions and work through their issues.  I am confident if I  speak up regarding an issue...and come prepared with a reasonable solution to that issue...it will be heard and hopefully put into action."
651,Twilio,The nine values,2014-09-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is determined to hold to it's nine value as it grows, and this makes it a fantastic, honest and open place to work.
I've never been part of such a large team that is so passionate, committed and truly believe in what they are doing.
The work life balance is fantastic, with unlimited PTO and a ""family-first"" attitude, burn out is tackled by being offered time to rest and relax.
The perks are amazing, travel and expenses are all covered.
The opportunity for personal development (at least for me) has been great.","I fear that the company will lose the ability to scale it's communal, family feel as it grows, but the C-level team is working extremely hard to tackle this problem before it becomes one."
652,Twilio,The 9 Values are For Real!,2014-08-04,5.0,Senior Technical Support Engineer,"I love it here.  People care; about the product, about each other, about the customer. 

The talent at every corner of this company is staggering. And everyone I have dealt with is willing to help and teach and make things work.","A little process, but not too much, would be a great help as we grow."
653,Twilio,"The Grass Is Not Always Greener. Or in this case, red.",2014-08-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Twilio is, and will be for some time, a leader in their space. The technology and the talent at Twilio is driving telecommunication to do things it is very uncomfortable doing. That being said, this a what a disruptive company looks like. They are taking a legacy industry and flip it in on its head. The Engineering talent at Twilio is unmatched and the collective brilliance is what has taken this company as far as it has gotten to this point.

Working at Twilio is much like going home to family. You see a lot of smiling faces and hugs all around.","This is where ""family"" takes a whole new meaning. Much like a large family you have cliques, favorites, and perhaps some people get a bigger allowance because of the favoritism. 

The tension between teams is pretty ridiculous for a company this size and I believe there is zero empathy for what each team is going through. While each team is burdened in their own way, there is very little being done to curb or improve the camaraderie.  

There still exists a small group of people who have been with the company for a long time that have major influence over hiring/firing and other seemingly meaningless business decisions that impact the morale of the company. Why this still exists is a mystery, but I am sure the sense of entitlement they must feel every day is somehow gratifying in their day-to-day work life. These people are often untouchable, unapproachable, and condescending to deal with.

While the engineering talent is tremendous, it's difficult to understand why so many failure points exist. Issues that are usually brought up after a big issue are rarely followed up leading to instances where the issue pops up again further impacting customers needlessly. A lot of focus is around what new features people are working on with very little thought around fixing existing infrastructure beyond the hyperbole people hear in group meetings. 

One thing that also stands out is that people are pushed out of this company far too often. Good people. People with great ideas but those ideas may not align with the company gameplan so their jobs are made difficult until they decide they just don't want to take it anymore and they leave on their own or are simply just let go for very little reason. Bottomline: if this company wants you out, they are going to find a way. But just to be fair, this is true for most companies in the Valley."
654,Twilio,I feel very lucky to have found a job at Twilio.,2014-07-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I actually like going to work everyday.  The people I work with are dedicated to their jobs but not so single-minded that we can't have fun during the day.  I feel like I am appreciated and my input is valued.,The commute to the city is a hike (but expected and a trade off for a higher salary).  At least it's not too far from Bart.
655,Twilio,Best career decision I ever made,2014-07-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Many companies talk about caring about employees and customers but the actions tell a different story - this company really means it and acts on it right from the top. 

Great caring people with great attitude and amazing skill set.

Culture and how you treat people really matters here. This is the most welcome I have felt at any company I have worked at.",None that I have come across so far. Not everything is perfect of course but nothing that isn't normal for fast growing companies and the will to learn and improve is there.
656,Twilio,Great place to work... company vision is something you can really buy into,2014-06-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Normal San Francisco Startup feeling.  People are great and work life is decent (not a 9-5 shop, but not a 15 hour day shop either).  Benefits are pretty standard for SF.","No real cons - the reporting structure is pretty flat, and most everyone is pretty approachable.  It is a pretty development centric company, so depending on what you do, could be seen as either."
657,Twilio,My best job so far,2014-04-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I enjoy working at Twilio because I know we're providing a high quality service to developers. As a developer myself, it makes me feel good that I can stand behind our API and recommend it to anyone. I've also enjoyed the people at Twilio - folks have been very friendly.","It's a typical startup environment, so the goalposts seem to move pretty frequently. Many policies and procedures are tried - some take, some do not.  But I am given a lot of freedom to exercise my judgment and do my job how I see fit, so this affects me less than it might if I had less personal responsibility."
658,Twilio,A once great company going super nova,2014-02-01,1.0,Sales,"The smartest, hardest working people I’ve ever been associated with.  Very good perks.  For the first few months the most fun I've ever had at any company, then it went south.","Lots here:

-	Because of the focus on shipping product there is huge technical debt and a very shaky code foundation that has resulted in costly customer impacting outages.  There is a lot of lip service about fixing the problems but it is trivialized over shipping new features.  This is very serious and begs the question about the long-term company viability.

-	Developer burnout trying to keep the system up and ship product.  Developers are expected to work all night on production problems and do their day jobs.  There is a real lack of quality in the product.

-	Management shenanigans have eroded their once prized culture with some very key people either being forced out or quitting out of frustration with direction or lack of career advancement.

-	Cronyism in new hires.  The hiring system was set up to keep this from happening but with new management they are bring in their friends.

-	Management  manages by Twitter, short term thinking and micro management rather than setting direction.  

-	An undercurrent of distrust between internal Engineering teams and between Engineering and the other teams in the company that is again leading to erosion in the culture and setting up favoritism.

-	Senior managers believing in their and the companies built up propaganda, the feeling of invincibility."
659,Twilio,Lack of leadership resulting in a lot of churn,2013-12-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Super great product; lots of smart and fun people to work with; excellent benefits and perks.,"Work comes in sideways all the time, disrupting many plans. Features seem to be more important than quality. There is a weird aura of dislike between different teams, with teams badmouthing each other, creating an uncomfortable and hostile work environment."
