112,Universal Studios,"Always varied but, sometimes dangerous",2021-11-28,4.0,Security Officer,"Got the opportunity to do a lot of things, once trained. Could swap schedules, when others had something available or wanted to pickup what you wanted to give away. If they didn't have extra shifts that they were trying to fill during busy times. Top 2 levels of security management are good at open door policy but, always busy.","Hot. Hot, sweaty work. Or cold. Dependent upon the post and if you were outside, could be baking in the sun for hours without a break. Standing on hot concrete, almost getting run over by ungrateful team members in their cars while doing traffic. Management is promoted from within based on who you know and how nice you play politics, not how well they did their job. Many a manager should not be in that role. Management doesn't take feedback well. Suggestions for more effecient ways to do things are often met with criticisms and brushed aside. Then, later put into effect as their own idea with no acknowledgement that it was you suggestion. But, hey, I guess it became more effecient so, there's that. Higher up management to be excluded from this.

Schedulers do NOT listen to availability. Ever. If you need hours, you're going to have to hunt them down and beg management. If you don't want to work tons of hours, you're going to have to beg others to take your shifts and hope that management allows them to take them. During busy times, they often have more hours than people tk take them so, won't allow you to give away shifts."

Some managers don't see you as people and are never there when you need them. Guests can be extremely rude and the work (depending where you are) can be extremely physically exhausting. It's very difficult to move up through attractions. You have to stay on your toes because part of your job is keeping people safe, and making operational mistakes can quickly cost you your job.

I once got yelled at for not smiling in an empty room. The supervisors are clearly pressured from the people above them but take it out on the people the precede over.
As seasonal, I was never allowed to pass 36 hours a pay period, so I couldn't receive benefits. This did not stop them from giving us the turn around shifts or scheduling us 6- 7 days in a row, as long as it overlapped pay periods."

583,Universal Studios,Worth The Experience,2019-10-23,4.0,Retail Team Leader,"- Employee discounts and free access to the park
- Retail union was great compared to other places I've worked (read: Disneyland)
- A very open environment among employees, you're allowed to feel negative without being shamed in the back for it
- Guests are SO MUCH BETTER than the ones who go to Disney
- People are really hype for Harry Potter and it's easy to make them happy
- The park has programs in place to upwards and lateral movement. I was promoted to the Team Lead position and offered a position in Labor Relations within 3 months of starting. I had prior theme park retail experience, but good work and attitude can get you in the right direction.
- Fun work perks, like the summer bash and team member only events for new attractions.
- A foot in the door for the NBCUniversal Page Program, heard some great success stories every quarter.
- Union dues for retail are very fair compared to what was negotiated. The probation period is fair, sick time accrues pretty quickly, and the union doesn't ask you to pay a withdrawal fee (don't do that if you've in the Disney College Program. You most likely won't join that union again and they ask everyone for different amounts. It's kind of a scam. Never ever pay a union withdrawal fee.)
- After Disneyland, Universal feels less emotionally constipated. I really got along with my coworkers and orientation group. Yes, management plays favorites, but it's usually based on how well you work over how much they like you as a person. My interview for Team Leader consisted of a manager telling me that I wasn't ready to be a Team Leader and it felt like a test of my character rather than a criticism. As you can see, I was promoted and that manager later congratulated me/remained professional and treated me the same as any other Lead despite his attitude in the interview or opinions about my status. Personally, it felt like my work was rewarded and I was recognized for the effort I put in.","- If you're not good at upselling, you probably won't go far in retail
- If you work in Harry Potter, you can't take the clothes home so it adds at least an extra hour onto your entire shift just to get changed and walk to the check in
- When it's slow, it's slow. Early January to early April and late August to September can be really rough, especially if your store comes in under sales goals.
- You can't be a Team Leader in Harry Potter and get cross-trained in Transformers. It's not fair. I want magic and sci-fi. Both is wonderful. Let us do BOTH.
- Can easily get overwhelming during peak season.
- If you're a Honeydukes lead, you will be place in the Hogsmeade Station. There is no AC. Winter isn't too bad because of how much you can walk around, the general temperature, and how heavy the costume gets (all suede, 3 layers over your chest to keep you toasty). During the summer, many leads got dehydrated or suffered heat exhaustion even when drinking their weight in water. Also, the chocolate frogs melted.
- It's probably a compliance for food safety, but you have to damage out every baked good that doesn't sell, especially past the expiration date. Donuts from the Simpsons are indeed made daily, but they mean daily. You have to toss them. Feels like a big waste of food."

Most of your daily work will involve screening incoming guests/employees or sitting at a gate house. If an incident does occur, management doesn't trust you to handle it yourself, and you must report it to a supervisor and back off until they arrive. 

I have never felt valued or appreciated. Supervisors from other departments have complimented me on my work, while my own supervisors still don't even known my name.

Uniforms are provided at work, greatly simplifying getting ready for work, reducing the frequency that you'd need to do your own laundry. The time it takes to get into uniform is factored into your hours and you get to leave 24-36 minutes early depending on your job's role in the park, while still getting paid for your full shift.","I was hired in April 2018, and through November 2018, I have still never been scheduled for a single shift. Ever. Upon completion of training, all shifts that I worked were obtained via being on-call. I'm sure I don't need to explain to anyone how challenging it can be to be on-call for a 24 hour position, when you can be given a closing shift followed by an opening shift, etc, and STILL not be given enough hours to pay rent.

The biggest problem I have with this is that during the interview process, I was told I'd be getting 3 days a week in the off-season and 5 days a week during the busy season (scheduled! not on-call)... aaaand nothing. None of the other people in my training group or holding the same job title as myself had this problem; they were all scheduled just fine, and everyone (including leads and management) kept saying ""oh it takes a few weeks, it'll happen"" but it never did.

The company gives you the option to apply for other jobs within the park, but because it required working 65 shifts before it's permissible to do so... well, if you're not given any shifts, there's nothing you can really do about that. The union dues really hurt when you're not getting shifts, too."

One of our supervisors has no training within our entity, and is absolutely no help,  it is great at taking the credit for the leads work to make herself look good. 
HR is terrible at handling complaints about managers because food managers and food HR reps are like best friends. Complaint after complaint has been buried. 

When seasonal supervisor positions open up, they’re basically given to who can kiss butt the best. Several good workers that I’ve known have been basically told by my manager that she’s turning down their application for frivolous reasons, instead of encouraging them towards it

Sexual harassment is not taken seriously by HR. A girl had a fellow team member stalk her, and all they did was stop scheduling her, and he was kept on. After 2 other women complained, he was transferred out of the venue, but was still on the job."

713,Universal Studios,You can find better...,2018-10-03,2.0,Ride Attendant,"• Free entry to the park if you are an employee (but don’t expect Front of the Line or Express privileges even though you work there. They won’t allow it unless you happen to be a Ride Operator then you can for your own ride you work at)
• Comp Tickets (no sign ins for spouses or children like Disney does. You gotta use your comp tickets to get family in and they start you off with only 3 until you hit your first year)
• Pretty good health/dental benefits (if you can work enough hours to have them offered to you)","• Stressful. They expect way too much of you for not a lot of pay to justify their strict expectations.

• Low pay. Most positions are barely above minimum wage. And there is no compensation for company loyalty. With the minimum wage increase, I have seen employees who are newly hired make almost as much as those that have been with the company over 5 years. The pay scale is unfair.

• No hours. Expect to literally battle your other employees to be scheduled. They put you against each other when you start by making you call in at 7 am to put yourself “on call” just so you can hope to snag a shift (which you probably won’t since those who are higher than you in seniority can also call in and will get dibs on any available shifts)

• Favoritism. It’s everywhere here. Expect to kiss a lot of butt and if you don’t, dont expect management to give all opportunities and recognition to those that do. Many departments complained of this.

• Poor management. I’ve seen and heard multiple stories of managers who sleep around with those underneath them and then promote them and managers who screw others over scheduling wise and do back handed things like scheduling you against your availability. Universal seems fond of promoting people to management who have questionable ethics and managerial skills. Probably because of the favoritism. You get ahead if you’re a favorite. Doesn’t make you qualified or good.

• Scheduling is not flexible. I’ve heard that it is in some departments but for departments like retail, janitorial and ride operators (basic entry level positions). I’ve seen people scheduled against their availability. They also do a lot of “shift bidding”. Basically if you are high enough up in seniority then you can get the availability you want. If you are lower in seniority, expect to be screwed with no hours or hours that aren’t conducive to availability. If you opt out of shift bidding and opt to just be scheduled by your availability and are low in seniority, expect no hours. It’s almost like they punish you for having a life.

• Full Time is nearly impossible to obtain. If you don’t keep your availability entirely open and work 5 days a week, don’t expect to obtain full-time or full-time benefits. Even if you do? If you don’t work X amount of hours in 6 months then you can be stripped of your full-time status. 

• Advanced scheduling. They schedule you two weeks in advance so you better know everything that is going on in your life to the point where you can request days off two weeks in advance. If you don’t and have a sudden emergency? Expect disciplinary points. Management is not lenient about giving you days off for personal emergencies. 

• Overly strict disciplinary point system. Even if you are in the hospital, don’t expect forgiveness. With doctor’s notes they’ll still saddle you with points, just less of them. If your points go above 8, expect a suspension. Yes, even if you were legitimately sick. 

• Poor Employee treatment. Employees work hard and deal with stressful situations all day but they are still treated shamefully. They make the employees park in the garages furthest away from the employee gate and do not accommodate employees with their own parking garages like Disney does. Meanwhile they let the guests get preference for the parking garage that is closest to the employee gate but still not close for the guests to the main park gate. It makes zero sense. And heaven forbid you try to park or drop another employee off. Parking staff are trained to treat employees like nazis and treat you like you a criminal if you dare try to park or drop off anywhere closer to the employee gate. I won’t even go into the hoops you need to jump through just to get a name badge that isn’t your given name (ex: If my name is Robert but I want to go by Bob. Or Elizabeth and I want to go by Beth). Oh, and if you lose your name badge three times in a year, expect to pay a fine for a new badge that probably costs them around .25 cents or less to order but you’ll pay $5.00 to replace it. 

• Cheap company. It doesn’t want to pay it’s employees and it wants to cut hours in every department and put way too much stress and workload on it’s current employees. But that doesn’t stop them from over hiring people who will never see hours expect for peak seasons like Summer and Christmas. Once peak is over, expect no hours and severe job performance scrutiny. Management literally looks for any reason to fire you or give you points so you can get fired in non-peak because that’s when they need to cull labor due to the over hiring they did for peak. 

• No Employee Protection. I’ve seen employees get shoved, spit on, groped and hit by guests and management will side with the offending guest and offer recovery instead of defending or protecting the employee. You think the Guest would be kicked out of the park for behavior of this sort but nope! Management will just offer them front of the line passes and reward them for abusing their employees. Shameful."

Promotions on a venue specific level in attractions department are frequently biased/nepotistic. Even if managers aren't biased, team leads can influence promotion chances to easily in their favorites' odds simply by giving them more chances to shine/offering them ""unofficial shadowing"" so those team members have a leg up when trying to interview for promotions. Venue management needs to be better at discouraging this, giving all team members with ideas and ambitions ways to be mentored by leads or management that promotes greater equality (perhaps other management or leads helping randomly pair team members with mentors in positions they are aspiring to)."

- really good discount on merch + food 
- really fun environment... it's so cool to work in a place that people literally go for vacation, and guests are generally happy to be there 
- guests that aren't happy are usually pretty easy to fix, by like giving a front of the line pass or some jelly beans (and management really encourages this kinda ""star treatment"" for guests) 
- good opportunities for people watching
- cool coworkers even if it can be kinda clique-y at times 
- moderately lenient attendance system even though it can seem stressful (you get a couple 5 min freebies every month) 
- good proactive union 
- good employee recognition system, and a culture that really encourages you to recognize your coworkers for good work","- scheduling by seniority sucks and it can be impossible to rise up in the seniority ranks when you literally never get scheduled outside of peak hours (summer, HHN, maybe like 2 days over Christmas) 
- so you won't get scheduled for weeks or months at a time but then they'll like suddenly put you on the schedule one time and you'll have to drop everything to make it or risk getting an attendance reprimand 
- you have to pay for HHN tickets
- also working HHN suuuucks everyone is drunk and rowdy 
- you have to work corporate NBC parties which is gross and unfair in my opinion
- comped tickets for friends and families take a while to accrue (2 your 1st year, 4 your second year, 16  after that) and discounted ticket prices are only okay
- no room for growth or promotions 
- HR is useless. I left my HR person several voicemails about an issue I was having and they never called me back. 
- they literally sent out a memo that said drug tests were optional and then a couple months later started firing employees for not consenting to supposedly optional drug tests (5 people got fired from a single attraction in one month for almost identical scenarios like this). 
- a lot of people get fired for really dumb, trivial reasons. It seems like after the peak season is over, they look for reasons to purge the long lists of employees so that there are more hours to go around."

Universal as a whole has a lot to offer. There should be a lot of re-structuring around every department to keep the flow fresh (when it comes to management)","If you are good at your job in this case SALES, you will make good money but you will also make less money than what your actually generating for the company.
ex. You sell 8 thousand dollars in tickets, and you will get 1.25 % of only qualified items..... Over view of how exploited you will feel.

You sell 40,000$ and you will only get paid 1.50 or 1.25% for the items that qualify to get paid on.

Ohhhhh and no commission. They call it incentive. So in order for you to get that 1.25 or 1.50 you need to reach a goal which in some cases is reachable if you have sale skills or drive.

You sell for the company 20,000 in a week (which is possible) you will get paid in incentive between 150 to 250$.... sounds good some average at 400+ because they have skill. On top of getting that extra 150 you get taxed 30% on your commission.

Some goals are achievable, some are not. So dont count on that extra money if you dont know what your doing.

If your drive is money, THE CHAIN OF COMMAND will say; don't count on that extra money, count on your hourly wage, your not here for commission your here to take care of the guest.....( SALES COUNSELOR, is not a social worker or a guest services agent.... they have to re evaluate how things without sounding incoherent.

FYI if you sell 13 cars in a month at a car dealership you get paid 23,000 ..........
In universal you get paid a 700 a week.... only if you sell 22,000 on applicable items.

BENEFITS: You get park tickets.....

I ended up quitting so I could move to Florida and seek better employment. This was right when minimum wage went up to $12 in California. :|","The coworkers were really clique-y. I didn't really feel like I fit in with anyone but the crowd I went through training with. This seems to be common in theme parks. 
The job also got to become really easy to auto-pilot through. I don't feel comfortable giving less fooks (pardon the French) about my job just because I'm working peak hours. It becomes easy to have a bad day and affect your performance just because you don't really get time away to yourself to chop up onions on a cutting board or something of that nature. A very people-oriented job and maybe it was my lack of abililty to cope with the stress of having to deal with thousands of people a day.

878,Universal Studios,Very great place to work and grow.,2017-07-11,5.0,Retail Sales Clerk,"I had the intentions of landing a job in the Wizarding World (which I thankfully did) and it's been worth it. It's such an incredible feeling to interact with guests in a way that you both can contribute. Making a person's day by pairing them with wands, or even saying silly potter related things after they've made a purchase. It's a blast to work at, if you're a potter head, that is. I've taken up shifts in the regular park as well and it's the same thrill. I've worked at another theme park prior, and I didn't really feel like I could be myself there. Here, it's different. There's just so many ways that you can open up to guests and have them open up to you because you'd be working somewhere where you have limitless conversational topics. Discuss your favorite universal movie, favorite attraction, favorite anything. You just see so many people from all around the world that it's a tossed salad and very fun to dive into. They really do listen to employee satisfaction. For instance, when it gets really hot, they give their employees free water. The leads are great. Managers are incredible. Hospitality level is fantastic. I'm enjoying it so far.  The employee benefits at city walk are pretty great too. Especially those movie ticket deals. Great save!","You will get many international guests who may or may not speak English. Either they know some, or very little. It gets a little difficult trying to communicate with them at first, especially if no one in your venue speaks their language. You'll find your way around it through practice. Still, it's a timely process and sometimes, the guest(s) may walk away from you because proper communication may not be achieved. That's about as much of a con that I personally can think of at the moment. That, and the fact that if you work in the Wizarding World, you're not allowed say you know who's name and you're not allowed to be a death eater."

883,Universal Studios,It's a Typical LA-area Theme Park Job,2017-06-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The atmosphere can be fun, employee discounts on food/merch in the park, I got in for free whenever I want. Most of the park is new, so that's good. The food in Harry Potter is the best in the entire park. It's Union, so once you build seniority, it's harder to get fired. At Xmas, they add an extra percentage on your merchandise discount, for a short time. They do provide holiday meals for employees working on Xmas and Thanksgiving. This is a great job for college and high school kids who don't have big bills/responsibilities. It's also very accessible by bus and metro, which is convenient. There can be lots of opportunities to transfer to other areas inside the park. You tell them what hours/days you can't work and they try to accommodate you as much as they can.","Our ticket benefits are being diminished. Employees don't get even one single free ticket to Halloween Horror Nights, even though we busted our humps from Sep-Nov for it. Then, we used to get a really good discount on tickets for family members, until they took it away and then raised the ticket prices. It used to be under $100 bucks to buy my kids a ticket, now it's $100 per ticket. Joe off the street pays $105. How is that fair?  It's hard to be out in the park, especially in the summer. Lots of repeating yourself over and over....the same questions. You'll be standing literally right in front of the bathroom and people will come up and ask where they are. Cranky, over-tired, screaming kids.  That kind of stuff. Its Union, so they take money out of your paycheck every month for dues. Oh yeah and Management will cut your hours without any notice whatsoever, during the slow times. Then your area managers will act like its normal, even though this can be quite a shock for someone who's new and didn't know it was coming. It usually happens right after Halloween. You don't really get the full perks of the job til you're 2-year anniversary, but not a lot of people make it there because of this reason. And don't expect to have weekends/holidays off."

I can't speak for other job sections in the park but we are very close, like a family. I feel that the trainers really care and many of the leads are willing to help you improve rather than just go on power trips (well, most). Wearing name tags all day makes it so that you know everybody's name and they all know yours, so it's kinda funny to hear even the higher ups greet you on a first name basis. We also get all kinds of perks like free tickets, great discounts, free movie previews, etc. Plus the cafeteria is awesome, lots of cheap but delicious food. You also get to meet tons of new people on a daily basis, and not just your coworkers. We get guests coming in from all over the world and you'll get to hear about a lot if interesting lives while on the job. It's quite the experience.","Even in a close knit environment you will have personality types that you don't get along with. With so many people who are the same age (mostly 20's) working in the same place, there's bound to be a strange almost highschool atmosphere. Though the easy going personalities outweigh the uptight ones, dealing with people who think cleaning tables equates to something serious can be exhausting. Also, just as a fair warning: YOUR FEET WILL HURT. In park services we move around constantly. Whether you are seasonal or part time your hours will be long, generally 8-9 hours days with suggestions for overtime. And you more than likely will agree to a lot of overtime because between January and may you will get no hours! Keep this in mind! They may throw you in for spring break but that's it until Summer, then you can work HHN, then grinchmas, then nothing again for 5-6 months because hours are based off of seniority. You will need a second job to make ends meet. And of course you shouldn't take this job if you can't stand people or answering questions. If you think answering the question 'where is the bathroom?' a hundred times a day would drive you crazy, it's best not to apply."

Free access to the park and two free tickets for family or friends. Every once in a while they would have food trucks or some kind of freebies for employees. Another nice thing was that you would be assigned a mentor. They would help to make sure that you were comfortable working and would help you out if you wanted to move to another position in the park.,"The management in my department (Admissions) was neglectful at times, forgetting to give us breaks and meal periods."

You receive no benefits other than some free tickets to get into the park to spend your money. Employees are normally not allowed to get 8 hours in a day unless they are short-handed, which makes it very exhausting and hectic. Also I was scheduled for a 4am shift, drove the 45 minutes thru toll roads ($16 it cost me in gas and tolls) to get there and was told they didn't need me."

They provided many benefits, provided a lot of hours (especially if you put in the effort) and had many opportunities to grow within the company in any department. Climbing the ladder here is relatively simple, so long as you work hard and draw attention to yourself in a good way, ie. go above and beyond.","You will work during holidays, especially for newer employees, which is a given for any entry level job. Most hours are during peak seasons, so try to climb the ladder fast during peak season to ensure hours on off-peak. Since they also have a lot of opportunities to grow within the company, newer entry-management level employees, and at times new managers as well, there tends to be a lot of micro managing as each Supervisor/Manager wants to prove themselves better than others to maintain said position. Easily avoided by working hard and keeping a cool head on your shoulders."
1208,Universal Studios,Food Cart,2015-04-25,3.0,Food Carts,Universal gives you 2 weeks of job training before actually working. Great benefits like meal tickets. Universal cleans your uniform every day. You have the opportunity to earn free park tickets.,Getting to be full time staff looks really difficult. If you aren't full time then you are laid off for multiple weeks with no income. It seems like a good job for teenagers that want to work summer and spring break. But for an adult that has to pay rent this job barely does it and since they make the schedule every week it's hard to give your other job a schedule on time to get hours from them.

If you suck up to the right people, you get promoted, even though it's specifically stated in their employee handbook that favoritism is *extremely* looked down upon.

You get employee discounts that you can use in the park and on Citywalk, and you've covered by a union.","Working in food service at USH is a nightmare because 95% of the time you're dealing with thousands of people in a day. During the summer it's worse because it gets really hot and you have to wear the ridiculous hats. The clientele at USH isn't exactly the best either. For the little pay you get, it becomes unbearable sometimes. The managers in food always use favoritism. The majority of the FOH leads there don't follow up on the stand attendant's breaks and lunches properly. Simply getting to work is cumbersome because the park is far; you have to wait 10 -15 minutes for a shuttle to take you up the hill; and then you have to deal with wardrobe which takes a while as well. Overall, the environment in the food department is very immature. There's a lot of gossip and bickering even amongst the managers when they gossip about the stand attendants they don't like. The manager's communication is pitiful. Most of the time they won't even acknowledge you unless they need something. It really gives off an intimidating feeling. The hours are horrible. Unless you have years and years of seniority the hours you get are few and irregular. Some of the restaurants are very unsafe to work in. Even with my slip and oil-resistant shoes that I'm required to have, I have still fallen and sustained injuries at work because of the type of flooring some of the restaurants have. To sum it all up, working at USH can take its toll on you because charging people overpriced items everyday, dealing with mindless drama between fellow employees, getting very little pay and small breaks, and feeling intimidated by managers and higher-ups can make an employee with mental illness even more ill. There's really no opportunity for growth in this department."

1298,Universal Studios,Special Events Crew,2014-06-03,3.0,Special Events Crew,"Firstly, let me make it clear that I am working for Universal Studios in Singapore, Sentosa.
Although I have only work for a little more than 2 months (and I have friends still working in there to learn about Events) I will try to give my full experience here and why I quitted so early.

-The environment is nice and lively (not gloomy and boring).
-Different circumstances to tackle every time.
-We have a certain level of authority even when we are the lowest rank as the higher-ups just 1 level above us are really flexible and respect us to be able to take our own decision. (Please don't confuse with anybody 2 levels above us, some are not what you want to work under, but this happen with all company anyway)","-Pay is the minimal average (they just give the most minimal market-rate)
-Forceful higher-ups (2 levels up and above)
-HR and Finance department are killing your pay very badly.
-Super bad location for those without cars

My work Experience (Does not apply to ALL position, I am just sharing on my particular one):
I can say that the colleagues in the lower-rank are quite nice although due to such environment there are bound to be slackers and backstabbers everywhere. The pay is low, and the most hateful of all in this company is the finance + HR department combo. They will make sure the time you can work is to the minimal.

My first working time is 12pm - 7pm. Each hour I get only S$7.50 (which is about +/- S$0.50 during 2012, and we do not have a local minimum-wage system). However the travel time is tedious due to the fact that it is in Sentosa, so there is literally no public transport to enter that is cheap and so we can only wait for the staff-bus. My travel time from the East (Tampines) is about nearly an hour on average including waiting time between intervals. You will need to be about 30mins earlier in touching the ground of the carpark inside USS than reporting time to make sure you are definitely not late as you have to queue up for your uniforms, change them, and walk a long distance to the office.

Back to the finance + HR combo part. They are the worst kind for those who are doing part-time. The 6 hour work (AND only on weekend, since there are no special event on weekdays) time is already quite pathetic, which make out to be about S$52.5/day only, and S$105/weekend. After I leave, they reduced the time to only about 2-7pm, and subsequently 2 months after I left, they reduced to 3pm. 

For those whom find S$105/weekend is fine, then you are wrong, due to the travel time needed, and the uniform system is sickening too, if there is high human-traffic, you need to queue for your uniform. The travel time will at least be a 20mins more anybody, even if you just stayed 1 train stop away as you need to wait for the staff bus (and again, if there is high human-traffic, good luck for queueing for the bus). 

Every 5mins (12:00:01 is considered 15mins late) reduced 15mins of pay, thanks to the miser finance department. The HR forced us to work when we have exam and on Chinese New Year as well. Although they say we need to comply during PH and Weekend (commit) during the interview, so I cannot argue. However, most of us were really unhappy even though we need to comply.

After I left, they revoke the staff pass to enter during our free time. The system must only see your attendance on your working day. This is to make sure you do not come in and play during free-time because you're a staff. Miser to this extend, I understand the profit part, but we are just a small team of people and most importantly, we are tired of seeing the theme park that we don't have the mood to come and play unless our friends ask us along as a gathering."

At the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, theming is huge, getting to act as a magical person was awesome, if you're a super fan, it's a dream job. Work in the restaurant as a greeter, cashier, server, busser, bartender, or in the kitchen, or as a member of management as a trainer, team captain, manager, etc. Cares about the guests and employees.","team member stays can be short or long-term, angry guests, hot and rainy weather outside on the carts."

Not to mention: Take Five Cafe. I want to go back this year, I'm hooked!","Scaring guests for 30 minutes to an hour non-stop gets tiring, even if you have a simple scare. There is also the threat of being hurt by guests or having them do a number of rude things to you, but if you don't take it to heart you'll be fine - most guests aren't like this however, so don't worry. I also had only one negative encounter with one of the employees who handled props - I accidentally damaged my prop and he treated me like dirt for doing so, and he even teased me negatively about it later that night. But this was sorely because of his own attitude and he was hired by Universal like I was, and he probably won't be hired back."

Perks are nice, since you get discounts in the park and on Citywalk, plus you can attend movie screenings and get discounted movie tickets. You are also a part of a union, so despite the union dues, you do get good perks from them. The hours are very flexible so you have time to do other things in your free time like school or another job. There is also growth potential after about a year of working here. The company is also pretty lenient with attendance; they don't automatically fire you after being late a few times, but rather they use a point system where accumulating points from calling off or being late determines disciplinary action. A separate point system is used for cash handling, and this is also pretty lenient. And, a plus for some, there is no drug test screening before hiring and the company doesn't really care what you do outside of work as long as it doesn't affect them or your performance on the clock.","The worst part about this job is the hours; you have no guarantee for hours so during the off-season you can go weeks without hours in your first few months of work. After about a year, you start to get offered more hours, but it takes about two years before your seniority kicks in and you don't have to worry about it as much anymore. A lack of hours means obviously not as much pay but it could also affect your benefits; there is a minimum number of hours that need to be worked to remain covered and with no hour guarantee this can be hard to manage. You can call in to try to pick up a shift but this is first come first serve (not seniority) based and not as reliable, especially if you live further away since it is very last minute."

Always has, always will. They will hire the same performers for multiple gigs rather than bring in new talent. 

Management does not listen. Ever. Whether it's a safety concern, conflict within the department, or conflict with the actual job, management will make the decision which favors management. Employees are not important and are replaceable.

There is a severe disparity in pay. A venue may have multiple departments working within it, all of which work equally hard. But a ride & show attendant or character escort makes crap an hour for being out in the heat dealing with more guests on a one to one basis than the characters or performers (and I'm talking about the costumed characters, not the furries) both of which make much more than the people doing crowd control. Want an example? Ask a ride & show attendant at Disaster how much they make an hour, and then ask the performer what they make. Or Marilyn Monroe and Betty Boop versus their escort. Or a superhero in Marvel versus their escort.

The attendance policy is draconian and makes no allowances for outside issues. Whether you have a sick child or are 3 minutes late you will get pointed. There's no appeal. So missing work because your child is ill and there is no one available to look after them is on the same level as someone calling out because they're hungover. Clocking in a few minutes late because the tram wasn't on time is equal to someone showing up 20 minutes late because they don't care about the job. The Universal mentality is 'You missed work. Screw you.'

If you're young or pretty, you can go far in the company. If you're talented, you might go far, but it isn't as much of a given as being pretty.

And be careful about writing about Universal on the Web. Under the guise of company confidentiality Universal will can you if you say anything bad about the company, no matter if it's true or valid. That and saying the word 'union' on or off company property can get you fired."

I have a disability and they have flipped over backwards to accommodate me, well almost they started to flip and fell on their head. A few of the employees can be nice and yes there is a lot of diversity, I am gay and there's a lot of gay employees there too but some people are mean. They offer deep discounts in the lunch room you can get a hamburger fries and a soda for 4.63. Also the employee ticket they give you is a front of the line pass for you and your guests. They also offer discounts to movies, and some discounts on city walk.","I have found out this company does not like to give you your breaks, I have made some complaints and nothing is done, and the other employees seem not to care, often they will make you take your breaks, all of your breaks combined at the end of your shift. Beware this company pays below minimum, I say below minimum because there is union dues, and the union does nothing to correct this, yes I do love unions but aren't they supposed to be arguing for higher pay. Some employees I know have been there for a few years and only make $1.00 over minimum wow so much for the union, but I hope they will be there to protect me in case something happens. Also they seem to promote who ever they want, some of the people I have been hired with got hired with have been promoted, I guess I have been looked over. Promotions should be done by seniority also. That's only fair."

1347,Universal Studios,It is not safe to work here!,2013-09-21,1.0,Entertainment,Co-Workers are mostly fun people to be around.  Flexible schedules are easy to get.,"People are disposable at Universal.  Safety protocol is frequently ignored, and employees get injured much more often than they should.  Management is more concerned with productivity and performance of their department overall than if they are putting their employees' safety at risk.  Safety policies get ignored, employees get hurt, and replaced by the next applicants waiting.  Many of the employees hurt have lifelong injuries after their stint at Universal.  To add insult to the injury, Workman's Compensation laws in Florida are horrible, so employees can end up with a permanent injury, lasting the rest of their lives, costing them a fortune in medical expenses, AND limiting their lifelong earning capabilities.  While the employee's life is thrust into a never-ending tailspin, the manager gets promoted, because the department had ""higher productivity"".   

If you still want to work here, if ever asked to do ANYTHING that could put your health at risk, you are smarter to refuse and face termination, because you'd get a bigger payout that way than you would get from Florida's lame Workman's Compensation laws -- they work for the employer in Florida!"
