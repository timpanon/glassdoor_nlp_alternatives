Great pay, benefits and people. Great technology.","The most disorganized company I’ve ever worked for; we’ve had a massive leadership change and the turnover hasn’t stopped; they can’t figure out why but here it is in a nutshell: we’re a mess. 

Enablement is horrible; all focused on big picture strategy but doesn’t give you the tools you need to actually close against competitors. You can’t get in front of professionals and spout high level strategy every meeting, we need to know the how. Getting a quote built and out the door is a week-long process and upper management complains about how time consuming it is to constantly approve quotes; here’s an idea, have set thresholds. If discounts are within a set threshold don’t have a human clicking the box; save that for the deep discounts that require a manual touch. 

Deal reg program and partner program are labyrinths that make no sense. The person in charge of de-complicating the program quit after the last re-vamp and I believe may have checked out long before departure; there have been recent changes but when changes are made it’s reactionary and they don’t see the repercussions until it’s too late & it’s not very partner friendly.
Sales has hit their number yet their rolling out new metrics that micromanage and make it harder to do your job and only looks at certain output that doesn’t necessarily correlate with closing business. If you hired us to do a job, expect we’re doing it and if we’re not hitting our numbers then I can understand asking for us to log every single thing. They claim it’s for uniformity and consistency, sure. Way too many emails, meetings, last minute all hands and lack of collaboration/communication across the business units. Lots of pressure, lots of red tape and lots of obstacles and too much busy work. Way too many bundles and things to learn and with the amount of turnover we’ve had it’s hard to find people to go to for help. 
It’s really hard to get your job done here and I hope we see things “ease up” a bit from the micromanagement perspective. When you value logging calls/meetings quantity over quality, you really don’t give the time and space needed to go after larger more strategic accounts. It becomes just another large corporation trying to fit reps into a box. We’re having strategy conversations on moves that have millions of dollars tied to them and it takes a lot of coordination internally because we’re such a mess. I’ve actually chipped a tooth in my sleep from clenching and I’ve never had this issue. I believe in our vision but the stress isn’t worth it. These products take time to learn and if the turnover doesn’t stop it’s hard to get the support you need to close deals & creates s ton of unnecessary stress. Right now I would tell anyone I care about to stay away and I may be looking if things don’t improve by q2."

372,VMware,VMware Management Review,2022-01-27,3.0,Account Executive,"VMware is a rich company with large cash flows from Vshpere software licensing renewals and licensing growth in both private and public cloud. VMware's base salary, compensation for overachievement, and options packages are very competitive. Pat G. the prior CEO did brilliant work to build out the Vsphere domain within Hyperscalers.","Typical sales cycle takes 6-12 months and VMware resets sales goals every 6 months, so many sales people (70-80%) never attain goal. Account teams with customers who are rapidly growing their licensing requirements or require re-licensing Vsphere in a hyperscaler can hit goal. VMware marketing is invisible or non-existant to most customers and to the field org. Go to market motion with channel is completely broken. Channel parters don't trust or understand how to grow business with VMware and actively sell against the VMware in many market segments (REL, F5, Crowdstrike, more). Sales management talks a good game (value selling and more), but in action it is mostly a churn and burn sales motion where field teams hover over accounts, harvest an ELA, and then try to dump the account to another sales team who will babysit the customre until the next ELA. The company makes enough money and realizes enough growth from Vshpere, that the other products are not effectively advertised, marketed, or supported by sales campaigns. Lying is tolerated and sometimes rewarded in the sales organization. The CEO communicates with the company by posting a 16 page manifesto, seems to lack a basic understanding of how to fix the go to market problems, and seems to be an engineer."

The management has spent the last 2-3 years pushing people into working 12-14 hour days, and then using the productivity of the people who do so as a stick to beat everybody else with. KPIs are set which are literally impossible to meet without devoting every waking minute to the job, and if they aren't met, you need to justify why you would dare to have a family, hobbies, or a healthy sleep schedule. Training on the product is extremely minimal, assuming you have time to actually do it (we don't). There are no avenues to ask for help if you're struggling, either in a technical sense or a personal sense. There is absolutely zero collaboration between agents or departments, unless you're lucky enough to be able to ask a personal friend (which obviously means that anybody acting as a potential escalation point is constantly playing favourites, and will almost certainly just ignore you if you've never been out drinking with them). Multiple people have been signed off long-term because the job has destroyed their health, and many more have simply walked away from the company. None of those positions have been backfilled; their work is simply piled up onto people who can't cope with what they already have, until they break down too. Customers regularly complain about the poor service they're getting, but management never step in to address these complaints, either internally or with the customer directly. It could not be more obvious that the company simply doesn't care about us."

481,VMware,Certain about our uncertainty,2022-01-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mostly solid technology, opportunity to make money, focus on employee well being. There are still some really smart people here.","VMware continues to lose valuable talent at every level, from CEO down to individual contributors. This is a place that no longer attracts the industry's best and brightest minds. Open positions are now backfilled with 3rd stringers from hardware backgrounds (HP/IBM/insert random irrelevant technology company here). The result are leaders and teams of people who have limited software experience and do not understand the technology landscape or platforms VMware provides. In the end we get dysfunctional cross-sectional teams who are largely mismanaged, unhappy, don't attain quota, and feel unfulfilled. Those who have been here long enough are now being treated as outsiders. It's bizarre-o-world to say the least."

550,VMware,"Seriously, do NOT work here. This company's management is disgusting.",2021-12-14,2.0,Associate Technical Account Manager,It's a work from home position.,"VMware is like a cult. They lure you in by telling you that they are all a family and you are now a part of it. They subtly exploit their employees in sneaky ways that you don't realize they're doing it until you're out of there. 

My manager and his boss (this was in the Federal TAM team in Reston, Virginia) forced us into 8-9 hour meetings NON STOP with no breaks besides a short lunch break. The meetings have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JOB. LITERALLY NOTHING. THEY JUST SHOEHORN US INTO DAILY NONSTOP MEETINGS FOR ZERO REASON. My manager and his boss made us order painting supplies with our own money (and they said they'll reimburse us later...2-3 weeks later) and forced us to do a ""painting and chatting session"" with them and my coworkers for THREE HOURS AFTER THE WORK DAY ENDED. When I think back to this moment, I'm starting to question if they have narcissistic personality disorder or they never had enough love and attention as children that they want it from their subordinates whom they have power over. 

My manager assured us MULTIPLE times that we CAN keep our cameras off during these nonstop meetings that distract from actual work and that we only need to pay attention to the meeting. Then, my manager would meet with me privately on the side and berate me for not having my camera on. He'd also get aggressive with me over zoom and look at me angrily and give me evil eye stares and slam his desk with with fists HARD. He also rolled his eyes at me multiple times and he gives dirty looks to my other female coworkers (I'm female). I think he's secretly a misogynist. 

The sneaky part is that they micromanage you but give you the illusion that you are not being watched. Every few weeks, there a multiple performance reviews given out by meeting leaders to the managers. 

But the worst part is, my manager and his boss randomly fired me because I wasn't being a team player (in other words, I wasn't going to be exploited to their whims). I stood up to them and the next week, they fired me. My manager blocked me. His boss blocked me. There was no explanation. Just a termination. You should see the houses they live in. Multi million dollar houses. The week after he fired me, my manager had a two week vacation to Ecuador while I was struggling to pay for my sick parents who can longer pay their rent. And the worst part of it all is that they told me that they would never fire me because they made me go through 4 BS interviews and they like me and want to invest in my future career. My manager and his boss are lying, cheating, rich scum who need to be taken down to learn a lesson. 

My coworkers are not any better. I had one coworker who seemed to be the leader of the subordinates and she'd schedule nonsense meetings ON THE WEEKEND. My manager said those were optional meetings, but then, as usual, he berated and embarrassed me in front of his boss at me for not joining. My coworkers would also create more work projects AFTER THE WORK THE DAY WAS OVER and contact me on my personal cell phone AFTER THE WORK DAY WAS OVER for NON EMERGENCIES.

I really, really, really want to reveal my manager's name and his boss's name so that you know to NEVER work for them (even if they leave VMware to torture other employees at other companies). However, I'm waiting until I settle myself financially so that my future is not jeopardized. When that settles, I'll write a review again here and reveal their full names. My manager's last name is Miller and his boss's last name is Boertlein. Stay the heck away from VMware and them. They're a toxic and failing company. 

Please, please, please, please listen to my warning when I say to avoid VMware at all costs (seriously only work here if you have no better options). This is not a joke review. I want to ensure that others see this review before deciding to apply to VMware or take a job there.

And I hope you will avoid my former manager and his boss. Both equally nasty people who need severe empathy training."

- Amazing benefits (such as 3 months parental leave)
- Generous budget for mental/physical wellness","- Product release process is gated and slow
- Change is also slow and/or progress is not well communicated
- ""Culture"" is a hard question to answer, because it can vary widely between business units (BUs) 
- ""Time to Deploy"" can also vary widely between BUs
- Preaches ""EPICC"" values for employees, but no action is taken if those are violated
- Noted avoidance of questions that they don't want to answer on multiple occasions
- A lot of company infrastructure levels and they are changed often
- Promotion is based on ""need for the position"". Decisions appear to be made not on talent, effort, or impact but on how visible/lauded that impact was
- Company meetings with the CEO appear to involve a lot of sucking-up and lavished praise, which can be kind of uncomfortable to witness
- Getting better, but would like to see more of a practice what you preach mentality rather than just acknowledgment of issues
- Government contracts appear to dictate policy and direction more than other contracts (maybe this is a pro for others)
- Politics are encouraged on one political side, and silenced on the other. Have witnessed some employees connecting in external groups or privately because they do not feel safe in the normal working environment."

The company also has a large footprint in existing customers with a few products that continue to be stalwarts to enterprise IT. That's where the ""pros"" end.","Since the departure of Pat Gelsinger VMware continues to fall apart from the inside out. VMware has continued to bring in tone-deaf executives who have no idea about how to sell in the industry. The continued messaging around ""multi-cloud"" is hard to swallow. VMware hardly competes in cloud and the product set that is available doesn't do anything for customers truly looking to leverage multi-cloud, it is frustrating to listen to executives continue to parrot a message that VMware doesn't have product or expertise with. Post-Gelsinger VMware's current CEO has decided to bring in executives far below the caliber of those that left. Many executives who were many-year Cisco veterans that couldn't shift Cisco back into relevance are, apparently, here to inspire us all with their progressive market experience? They don't seem to understand the technology, market or customers. A trifecta for VMware, but not the kind you want. Raghu is a non-charismatic leader who has done nothing to fix the systemic problems VMware had before his leadership started and since taking the helm has made things worse with poor leadership choices and a push for products that don't sell and a move to focus on SaaS and subscriptions for no other reason than to cater to the street. It seems VMware is waiting for someone to come buy them and in the mean time executives are bringing in friends to garner a pay day they likely don't deserve."

954,VMware,All façade and no character in Australia,2021-09-04,1.0,Staff Consultant,"The VMware title as an employer carries weight. It’s good to get the brand on your CV and then exit, as there aren’t many transferrable skills to be accumulated by working here. It’s just a good stepping stone, as I have seen while I was working here. Many come by and move on to bigger and better roles brandishing the logo on their CVs
Corporate health care is very good. Other benefits are less than average. Shopping discounts are no better than holding the Frequent Values membership. I found out I had better shopping discounts from my insurance company. They have a few extra days off for COVID, but so do many other IT organisations
Onboarding was a relatively seamless experience. However, don’t expect any support from management. You must raise a ticket for everything, and it’s outsourced
Offices are nice, but they are not being used any longer due to COVID workplace restrictions.
If you are highly technical and drink from the VMware cool-aid, you’ll be promoted to very senior technical positions that pay handsomely. If you’re not technical, it’s tough to obtain a managerial position. VMWare prefers to hire externally for senior roles. And if you’re not a white Australian, you’re especially disadvantaged","The people based in the Australian region are very superficial. You must be part of the clique, a very tight and conceited group led by immature accounts and salespeople.
There are almost no opportunities for internal candidates unless you’re willing to polish an arrogant manager’s ego. The Talent Acquisition team does not even call back unsuccessful internal hires and completely ignores referrals. They are a group of stuck up airheads who are more interested in kissing up to sales managers who are equally superficial.
Many senior people are high on their flatulence, trying to act like the most intelligent person in the room. Not because they are competent or experienced, but more so because everyone is constantly on guard looking over their shoulders, trying not to get stabbed in the back.
Company EPIC2 principles are a total sham and are there for bragging rights only. In other global offices, leaders are noticeably more sincere and do have a high level of integrity. But the Australian managers are probably the worst of any company I have ever worked for. They act like narcissists who will only do charitable work if they can showboat it to invite accolades internally and on LinkedIn.
The result is a high turnover of staff, especially in the Melbourne office. Talented people are constantly leaving for better-run organisations like Microsoft, Salesforces, Splunk, Google and AWS. 
Almost NO diversity in Australia. The place is entirely run by white Australians who try and act cool and hip. Occasionally, they’ll play the ‘inclusion’ card to seem like they’re doing the right thing. But nothing long term or of significant benefit to the people they’re trying to ‘help’. The non-white workers are just there to do the low-end monkey work and fill non-influential roles."

Promotions are based on who you know and how well you say ""yes"" to everything.

There is no value for experienced and knowledgeable employees like old days, and the main focus is just on college hires.

Hard to focus on execution when you are being coerced from the top level to change your views on traditional family values often including graphic visuals (latest corp. training videos anyone!? what was that about) , mandatory training on topics such as unconscious bias and guessing critical race is likely next

These aspects always existed and there have never been any issues previously.
VMware was focused, friendly, open and generous in giving back under Pat. What the hell happened this past year!? Whoever is pushing the changes, those invisible hands that have impacted the world, has introduced division to a level I have never seen before in my 20+ years in this industry and I have worked in some pretty harsh environments

VeloCloud is now part of Vmware under the same toxic leadership. They use VMware to cover their racist practices.

Bonuses are taken from non-indian and given to indians. I am a current employee and I have seen how the VPs and Directors control promotions with clear racist practices.

A lot of reports were sent to the vmware to investigate. What is the outcome? more toxic and alienation of employees who complain that their bonuses are stolen. More retaliation.

Many employees had their bonus stolen this round of March/April 2021 and given to the directors indian friends.","This is as toxic as it gets. Retaliation if anyone speaks up against the racism and favoritism.

Competency does not matter. Race matters. If you are indian, you will get 120% bonus. If you are non indian you will get 80% bonus.

2190,VMware,Management takes all the credit; engineers get all the blame.,2021-01-12,1.0,Software Engineer,"The checks clear, the bonuses/stock if you last long enough 
Lots of great co-workers","It appears like VMware has a play book when it buys out a company, and none of it helps the employees of the buyout. The first thing they will do is try to re-band (demote) the employees. They will use the excuse of they are a big company and things are different and you either take it or leave it. After a few months they will double the old company’s workload and ramp up offshore efforts to help. 
Upper management will trash talk the bought-out company any chance they get in order to justify any changes (layoffs and reorg) they will implement. Upper management will shield themselves from the bought-out company’s managers and employees so they can ignore their issues, concerns or complaints. They will make the bought-out company’s managers accountable to the deliverables but have no responsibility or power, understanding or control of new offshore resources. Management who can, leave the company or quickly find a more stable group in VMWare to transfer to, leaving a huge leadership vacuum. As the bought-out company star team members leave, they will be replaced by untrained resources amplifying unreasonable schedules. 

The new offshore resources will be dumped onto projects with no training or understanding of the project, team or technology. The team will not be integrated or even introduced to each other and will not be given clear goals or direction but will be given multiple and often conflicting deadlines and goals. The new offshore resources will have their own managers who have no goals or accountability to the new projects and often have goals and accountability for other projects. The bought-out employees will be squeezed into having to do their previously scheduled deliverables, new deliverables and somehow ramp up themselves on new products, VMware systems and help the new team (assigned 2 minutes ago) also ramp up. 

If they fail on any of the three projects you are on, they will be called out for not being “team player”. If they mention any organizational problems, they will be called much worse things. Upper management will berate you if you have even hint at questioning them, they will call you hostile, ironically screaming it at you. A person asked a simple question about unfreezing pay raises and an SVP went on a rage about cooperation and not being hostile. Its common for five hundred people to be on an engineering conference call and if the SVP doesn’t filibuster the whole meeting to avoid questions no one bothers to waste their energy to ask a question or from fear of reprisal. Teams and information are silo-ed across teams and even from management to engineers. It’s not uncommon for issues to ferment or fester for months and only when it’s a crisis gets dumped on the engineers who can actually fix it with demands of why several month long outstanding issue has not been resolved, when the engineers didn’t even know about it until that moment. 

Once the ramp up is done, upper management expects quick results from the untrained disorganized mess they created. This is when some directors start working against each other. Some openly subvert and work against others to see which of them survives the next re-org or twice a year layoff. Upper management entire focus is on solving “their” problems and “their” goals, often to the detriment of the product, employees, team or even company.

As someone who has helped build a successful decade long offshore program, this is not how to do it. Upper management creates such an environment of fear from over aggressive schedules, and priority contradictions, poor communication, unwillingness to listen, layoffs, and hostility towards the bought-out company it fails before it starts. 

VMWare used the 2020 financial crisis to temporarily freeze 401k matching, bonuses, and raises all while exceeding their goals."

2308,VMware,Don't work in America,2020-12-09,3.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Lots of perks, good salary, lots of extra paid time off.","Cut throat. Bottom 10% of performers in many groups are fired annually.

Dealing with colleagues in other ""business units"" can quickly become political and toxic. Internal systems are antiquated and prevent employees and customers from doing the right thing, which results in HUGE customer escalations."
2309,VMware,"Typical big company, with atypical benefit cuts / promotion cancellation",2020-12-09,2.0,Member Of Technical Staff,"Donation matching is a concretely good bright spot in a company that, contrastingly, has ""no ethical limit"" to its business (straight from CEO Pat in an AMA!)","""We'll work with Saudi Arabia and North Korea, and if you don't like it, go somewhere else."" A direct quote from leadership. I see a lot of reviews here being very positive on culture and values. Why? VMware donated to political candidates this year who oppose free access to abortion and called slavery ""a necessary evil."" Mitch McConnell got VMware cash. We want to work with authoritarian regimes. 4.2 stars for company values btw.

But enough about values - your average Silicon Valley job seeker cares about money (I used to live there, I can say this). VMware cut 401k matching, and canceled promotions and pay raises for a full year due to the pandemic. That'd make sense, if our profits suffered, but they didn't, they topped estimates. Great! Well at least our stock - oh, it's been flat for 2 years. We're a tech company right?

Well, the market might be right on this one. VMware doesn't have an exciting future, and it might not have a bright one. Will containers and Kubernetes kill virtual machines? They're at least going to do some damage. Watching from the inside as VMware scrambled to stand up ""Tanzu"", its own brand of Kubernetes that no one has ever heard of, has proven to me they're worried. I have no reason to believe Tanzu is anything revolutionary. It seems much more likely this is a company that peaked in one technology and will be behind the curve in the new one, for the foreseeable future.

If you're a VMware employee, rejoice! There are many, many better companies out there - if you think VMware is good just wait till you see them. If you're not a VMware employee, I hope this perspective has provided some contrast to the mindless one-liner reviews. Chances are you have some other options - maybe give those another look."

A couple good ones here and there), people quit all the time, constant restructuring and layoffs, doesn't hire very smart people, bad training, a lot of people in sales especially higher up leadership is very entitled and formal without any sort of desire to seem like genuine people.

Also, the internal processes are stuck in 1999 and are terribly inefficient and unclear. It makes it very frustrating to get anything done here as an employee and it makes it extremely hard to do your job.

A lot of people here seem fake, and most don't actually care about making employees feel valued. A lot of people have left the company because they couldn't stand this anymore, along with all the other bad stuff.

I've met met some of the worst managers of my entire life working here. The company knows horrific people like this work here and are too scared to do anything about it.

If you’re inspired by such motivational gems as “this is war”, you’ll be happy. I find this worldview repulsive. Leadership says one thing to your face and does the opposite in private. Employees do not feel safe to ask questions or express contrary views. Leadership is incentivized to compete for resources; lots of infighting, fiefdoms, and empire building. Solving customer problems does not appear to be a priority; investment decisions are made by architects. Very discouraging place to be a product manager. Too many stories among colleagues of demeaning language from fellow employees, and no action taken when this behavior is reported. No diversity in leadership; all white and Asian men. The responsibility for improving diversity is clearly the burden of women and minorities, as an additional responsibility to their day jobs. On townhall meetings, women are only represented as secretaries, choosing questions for the men to answer. CEO is an evangelical. No meaningful efforts at equitable pay practices; some analyst apparently does an audit, without any understanding of individual’s contribution."

Good Insurance
Innovative company","STAY AWAY FROM VMWARE SLED.

These Drawbacks are specific to SLED - I would highly recommend staying away from State Local Government and Education vertical within VMware. Don't join SLED group within VMware, there are better opportunities within VMware than SLED. SLED Culture and leadership are toxic.

I worked as Solutions Engineer in SLED. During my time, I had pleasure to work with some of the brightest engineers. However, Quota pressures was very high and expectations were unreasonable such as sale a solution that doesn't work or fix a solution that was sold before I started and would have never worked. Solution selling methodology changes every month or quarter, 

You get insane amount of training assignment, be ready to put in 80-90 hours a week. VMware is losing top talent to Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM. 

You are expected to be an engineer and account manager at the same time.

I had 3 different bosses during my tenure of less than 2 years. In Midwest SLED practice has revolving door for AEs, SEs and Directors. Senior Directors and SE managers are clueless, VMware is absorbing all the untalented people that ware laid off from Symantec and HPe at various levels, . Incompetent ones end up staying. They are able to recruit new talent by telling them story of great opportunities and almost everyone buys into it due to VMware's reputation only to find out most of them were false. Tertiary realignment is very frequent and you lose.

If you have a stable role don't fall for VMware SLED organization and stay where you are. If you are desperate in getting a new job then know that if you go to VMware SLED you might it might be a wobbly stepping stone at the best and you might be better off somewhere else.


During my short time in SLED there were almost 30 people quit or let go out of a team of 45. Average time spent in their role was 8 months."

Career opportunities
Not so hectic work
RSU","This is my worst company to work so far in my professional life.
Managers boasted themselves that its the best company compared with TCS and Infosys. Imagine their mindset level comparing the product company to the service companies.

Not sure about Blore location, Chennai workplace esp Velocloud unit is so old aged mindset and its clear unfit for young people < 15 years experience. If you are a manager and can excel by playing dirty politics , this is the best company for you.

Irony is that every-time CTO says this is a startup and should function like it. Work is also not so innovative and follows the same application development.

Velocloud is completely a crooned corporate workplace where no one is interested in your career development. Irrespective of good ideas you discussed, everything will be dusted to trash bin and only senior people has credits. 

Moreover Chennai unit acts as outsourcing to Palo Alto division and PA people treat in the same away and never as peers. Chennai managers go all way to please Bay people rather than customers. 

Frequent layoffs - 2 times a year.

Product management is worse and have no sense of analytics and futuristic view. Clearly avoid this company and do not make the same mistake I did. :)

If you have no other choice other than to work here, pls look for better opportunity after received a year of RSU."

2652,VMware,Old school corporation owned by Dell,2020-09-04,3.0,Member of Technical Staff III,"VMware acquired our company about a year ago mostly for Cloud Foundry and our customers. They provide a lot of stability and are probably profitable. They have an established client base with their legacy products and are working towards modernizing them with their strategy, ""Paving the world in Kubernetes."" I believe that they'll get there, but it has been a rough merger with offices and teams being cut as they discover more redundancies through our organization. 

Here are some pros:

1.) Work life balance is pretty good.
2.) People are generally kind
3.) Pay is on par
4.) They have been going all in on WFH during COVID and probably will continue to do so post COVID.","It's a large corporation, and they see the world as containers. As an app developer, it's been hard being in this environment as they are used to moving slowly and insisting on using bad tooling. 

1.) We've been moving our documents to Office 365 and our email to Outlook (coming from GSuite). Coming from largish start-up, this has been a rough transition, and it just feels stupid. 
2.) Similarly, we are not able to use 3rd party tools and services without approval from finance and IT, and this has been a huge bottleneck, and we have lost our autonomy to make real decisions. (Also IT is based out of India, so there are ridiculously long wait times to get help, so there's that.) They are going to insist we use Jenkins which is so early 2010s, so I'm just over it.
3.) 401k matching has been stopped. Bonuses and promotions frozen even though they have the cash to do a massive stock buyback. It just feels like they want what's best for company's shareholders and executives, but don't care if they affect their employees."

- Good salary overall","- inadequate management for the Bulgarian geography
- overloading with work which is outside of official job descriptions
- HR and Recruitment teams fail to protect employee rights which results in high levels of exploitation of some employees at the expense of others
- breaching of well-described rules for internal mobility despite a constant narrative of supporting personal growth and mobility across teams. After working for 2 years at the company I tried to move to a higher level position in a better paid job category with a pay range almost twice higher than my current one and they tried to 'offer' me the same salary as my current position. When I cited the official mobility guidelines for them, which state that salary should be readjusted in such situations, asking for a better (or should I say real) offer so as to have an incentive to move out of my current position, they withdrew from the offer because of my motivation being 'mainly financial'.... Thereby questioning my work integrity and conflating it with my professional and human right to earn more as I develop and become more valuable to the company. 
- lack of well-established processes for passing work to technical writers which results in spending hours or days trying to figure out if something has to be documented and what exactly. Incredibly frustrating.
- Absurdly incompetent high-level employees (PMs, TPMs, RMs) that can't type a single sentence without a mistake who constantly try to blur the line between their responsibilities and that of other employees so they can basically do nothing

I could go on and on and on. If salary and benefits is all you're looking for then you might be okay. If, however, you get frustrated by the complete lack of professional culture and adequate management then do yourself a favor and avoid this pile of crap."

Lot of community work - very commendable. Great programs for this which are underused by staff, sadly. They have millions they want to give away.

They rule the world and are now Too Big To Fail. So, they will always be around. You may not be however - they have a yearly cull in February and many lose their jobs. The good news is that the redundancy package is very very good.","Management structure. Basically there were about six levels of management between me and the CEO. My manager had no real power, neither did his manager. There are only very few people making decisions here and they are driven by stats and stats alone.

There is an extreme amount of corporate BS - to the point that I wanted to shout ""can you just talk English please"". 

VERY American - a European may start giggling at their completely see-through tricks to ""motivate"". Does this really work for Americans? Example: every question you ask is met with ""hey, that is an awesome question"". It is then followed by a White House Press meeting style BS line. No humour - they take themselves so seriously.

The poor people in the Bangalore office get a very bad deal and are, quite frankly, abused

These guys run a after-sales technical service system for clients which left me embarrassed to be associated with it - completely unfit for purpose (where I worked they used a chat program as an internal ticketing system! Yep. No kidding!). This is an example of management just imposing stiff without consultation and then wondering why it doesn't work."

- Inept people managers who were promoted out of necessity and not for being worthy. So you know what happens when your someone continues to think like IC even after he pushed to a people manager role
- Overstaffed, for a job needing 10 resources you will find 15 or 20 which would affect you both interms of sharing roles & responsibilities and money at the end of the year. Out of these 20, you would have 3-4 people who will do bulk of the work, the rest are average and below average at best"

I always loved feeling like part of the team at VMware.  I was there 5 years and felt valued and supported.  I never had a bad annual review and by most measures was going above and beyond.  Our team was periodically recognized as doing excellent work and our skills were absolutely unique in the company.  I would have given a Glassdoor review similar to others you see indicating ""no negatives I can think of at this time"" …but then I fell victim to January layoffs.  I waited a full year from being laid off to do this review so I would do it for the right reasons.  
There was no reason given other than ""restructuring"" as others have indicated in their reviews.  My guess is that VMware thinks of its employees as all living in the Bay Area where jobs are plentiful.  It took me 7 months to find another good job and it was very hurtful to my financial situation.  Any goodwill I had for VMware was obviously damaged and I would warn others who are considering VMware that you are at risk of being layed-off as a matter of course rather than based on your performance.  
I feel I also should point out that VMware uses stock as a part of its compensation to retain talent and after going through a layoff,  there is little doubt in my. mind that one of the major goals of the January layoffs is to recuperate your stock (for many of us six-figure + amounts of stock).  It is no coincidence that layoffs happen at a time that immediately precedes the vesting date of stock.  As an example, I would have started vesting less than 30 days after my stated last day of work and every person I talked to affected by the January “restructuring” were in the same boat.  
Another important thing to understand is when you are let go by VMware, you are told that the company will give you resources to hopefully get rehired - which they do.  However, I can tell you I wasted a lot of time applying for jobs internally at VMware and based on the behavior of the hiring managers, I am convinced the burden of my stock was a consideration and put me to the bottom of the queue rather than feeling like my extensive knowledge of VMware and my solid track record wold be a plus.  People I was friendly with wouldn't even give me the time of day and I was nothing but discouraged by people when I would reach out.  I certainly bear fault for not looking outside the company more those first couple of months but I would not recommend spending significant time on those efforts if you find yourself in a similar situation.

I would be particularly careful about joining VMware's bloated corporate marketing team."

- They take D&I seriously. Whenever a leadership role opens up, an email goes out to the entire company. They state they will not close the applications for the role until at least 2 people from underrepresented backgrounds apply.  For the folks they don't select, they give constructive feedback.","None of them are cons for me, but I can imagine the top ones for most engineers would be:
- It's very 9-6.* For some engineers, this is too early or too rigid of a schedule.
- It's not super remote friendly. You can certainly work remotely sometimes, but if that's a big part of your current lifestyle, that would be hard to maintain.

-Constantly organizing food and beer parties
-Performance bonuses
-To be honest I cannot recall all benefits, but there are really a lot. It is really good in this aspect.","Having said the pros, I will now talk based on my experience as a support engineer: there's a dark side to it (no company can be 100% perfect right?). If you're a support engineer honestly the salary isn't great for the amount of work you do (and it worsens if you land as a contractor); and depending on the team you land, you will find yourself in a very stressful environment. More than certainly you will have to take your work home once or twice per week (it can be more). Or simply stay in the office doing overtime (unpaid). You will be demanded to strive in metrics while workload is immense. If you want to boost your virtualization career, here's the place to be; but be ready to sacrifice your personal time. Bottom line, at the short term it is really demanding and exhausting, but at the long term you can look back at it and realize it was all worth it.

* Company is really transforming, history has shown that technology companies that rest on their laurels quickly crash and burn. Based on what is happening in VMware I'm pretty sure VMware won't be one of them
* Decent benefits and salary, RSU grants have really gone hill though, pretty disappointing","As much as VMware has been transforming technology wise, they still fail to address a lot of the toxicity in the management chain and culture
It is still very much about who you know,  kissing up, not rocking the boat and conforming. The hierarchy is also complex making transparency difficult , there are people who I would say can get away with socializing and not doing much work which can have a severe impact on the morale of those who do it

Then there are the talkers, those who are put in lead positions which actually shouldn't be as they know very little about the projects they are leading yet they will be loud and argumentative often at times making incorrect and sometimes foolish claims but they do it in front of management who just think they are correct because the management doesn't know any better

And the last point is that is now mostly Indian, I don't know what breakdown is in terms of the engineering workforce but given what I see I wouldn't be surprised if it was like 80% or something. Now I have had many Indian coworkers over the years some of them good, some of them bad. But the disproportion at VMware especially in cases where one knows somebody from their home province pulls them over and sets them up in a high level position when they are basically equivalent to a new grad just adds to the toxicity"

She micro managed, belittled, and down right disrespected individuals on her team and cross functioning teams. She was not a leader and ran her team like a dictatorship. I witnessed her yelling on the phone during online meeting and in no way shape or form embodied the vmware culture. Other people on the other side of the floor would hear her yelling.  work from home is huge at vmware...not on her team. After months of asking for it we could work from home on Wednesdays only if she saw fit. One mistake and she would take the privilege away. Not sure if that was the culture previously before the company was acquired by vmware but sadly vmware HR dragged their feet on correcting the problem. They stood in solidarity with the manager instead of listening to the employees.  She was very aggressive and made the environment very uncomfortable. Talk about being rattled with anxiety before a one on one.  I tried to move to another department but she blocked it. I hear she still has her job but they moved her to be an individual contributor.....nice way to handle the problem."

The office is currently really small, but we will soon move to a new building.

You have drinks, coffee and tea for free. Many activities are done during the year. Callouts with incentives, good salary, gym, food card and other perks. 

The colleagues are nice, really nice. The trouble are some managers who think too highly of themselves.","Currently the environment is not nice at all. There are obvious things that are strange. 

Not everyone is treated the same way, from at least some managers you notice straight away who their favourites are, this is not cool as you also notice who they ""don't"" like, and are therefore treated unfairly. Unfortunately this happens in at least 2 or 3 teams, and no one dares to say anything.

There's generally a lack of vision in the office, which is obvious as this still needs to roll and deploy. But even so, many will start looking for something else the moment 7 or 8 months are over.

Remember, no one leaves the company, but everyone leaves the manager. 

We've seen already some performing colleagues being fired without any logic reason at all. This creates a cloud of doubt over the management's incapacity of growing a person, being good at conflict handling or neutral when taking a decision. What a shame."

No female SEMs, almost no women in senior technical roles, men driven mentality. Same as other tech companies. There is the hope of change but I have not witnessed real results so far (in 2 years). There also seems to be a gender pay gap issue as well (comparing the same role). These realities make it hard to persevere as a female in tech, which exacerbates the problem.

I've only been here a few months, but they are very understanding of my career change and are helping me learn the ropes and the company as time goes by (even though they were very busy when I first started with many things going on, so I appreciate their help!). 

I get to work from home as much as I want and have yet to take any PTO, but the unlimited PTO option is pretty cool and I look forward to utilizing that in the future when I need to. Orientation was AWESOME, and I learned so many soft skills I didn't even realize I was lacking. This company really seems to care about culture and treating employees with respect. I look forward to using the skills they taught me to help the company in keeping to their high standards. 

It seems from other reviews that managers can make or break your time here. So far my managers and teammates have been nothing less than stellar and just so cool, so I feel my time here will continue to be a 5 star rating. I'm excited to keep learning and honing my skills and giving the best work possible.

The interview process for my position was grueling but honestly I feel in hindsight it was a pro. It really helped to encourage me that my skills were up to par with what they were looking for.","Orientation didn't happen until 3 months after I was hired. Felt very lost as to who and what VMware was exactly, and still am not entirely sure what the different  softwares I'm working on are about (I don't come from a tech background). I've been told a few times but there's so many different ones, and new features constantly being added, and they can sound so complicated that it's hard to keep it all straight.

3246,VMware,Objective Review,2019-09-11,5.0,Digital Sales Representative,"VMware is well established company and brand, well positioned in the market. 
It's a big american corporation, and gives the opportunity to a lot of people to work here, learn and progress in their careers. And not the traditional corporation, in general a more relaxed environment and people willing to help.

It has over the top benefits: 
- Gym membership
- Lunch card on top of your salary
- Insurance and dental insurance
- 40 hours a year for social service and match your donations to charities
- Team building activities
- 22 days of paid holidays a year, that you can take when you want.

They invest a lot in people's careers, there is always budget for training. 
You always get the tools you need to work (brand new laptop, 2 monitors, software licenses). 

VMware cares for their people. The Ireland office was closed and the people affected were relocated to the office in Barcelona, offered another job in Ireland or other office or got the indemnification. 
Another prove that they care about the people is higher management (senior VPs, directors, country managers, etc) visiting the office.

The growth of the office has been exponential, every few weeks there is people joining.","- There are periods when there is too much training going on. Specially because of VMware always innovating and developing new products that it might be overwhelming. 

- Change is constant.

- The holidays are subject to manager's approval. And there are periods when it's not possible to take holidays (end of quarter for example)."

There's no lack of budget and we get support from other business units and there is a lot of heart and passion behind this project. The team overall is great to work with and a lot has been acomplished within a short timeframe.

Benefits are way above the Barcelona standard. Ticket restaurant that goes on top of your salary instead of deducted, health insurance for you and your family, good leave program that gets increased with time.. and the pay is also great.","A start up has its cons, its very chaotic and no one know what they're doing.

3259,VMware,I Appreciate the opportunity to work here,2019-09-04,4.0,Sales Associate,"The pros,

Great connection with the products. 

Respected world wide brand and market leader.

Senior people in the business talk to you as an equal. They do not talk down to you. 

Salary to workload is amazing. Food cards with a substantial amount compared to other companies. 

Large amounts of onboarding training. 

 Start up feel which means you can somewhat push yourself to the front. 

People do get recognition. 

Coming from the outsourced world that obviously takes some adjustments. My role is manageable in terms of pay to work ratio. I remember working in some places where I was just a number and a quota. Here I am an individual where I am allowed to express myself and work in a manner that suits me. 

There is multiple groups in the office, force for good, sports and social and a POD hopefully overtime these groups will give employees a voice to shape this office how they want it to be. 

The company has already allowed us to be part of charitable causes. yesterday we refurbed a house for underprivileged children it gives you a great feeling that you can make a difference. Appreciate the position we are within a company like this that we can actually impact peoples lives.","Because of the start up feel it is a little hectic but we all knew that coming in. Sometimes coming into the bubble and big world of VMware you can lose a little bit of perspective. Sometimes you can forget that things can be worse because your not micromanaged to within an inch of your life. 
However a little more structure would help me from going on a tangent."

3266,VMware,Your manager determines your success at VMware,2019-08-29,2.0,Manager,"Your career journey/success at VMware will be defined by your manager.  Work/Life Balance, Upward Mobility, Cross Training or any career advancement is only existent if you have a manager and leadership team that will advocate on behalf of you and celebrate your accomplishments.  Advocating on behalf of yourself only goes so far when BU management has their favorites.

EPIC Values is a joke and no one is actually held accountable to them.  Vmware doesn't have a formal review process which is problematic because your manager is not obligated to communicate in a constructive way room for improvement/celebrate achievements.  

VMware has a LOT of work to do to actually give the representation they strive for outsiders to perceive.  Lots of senior leaders that only employ people brought over from their previous companies with aged experience which ultimately stunts innovation and creativity.  

Younger employees are perceived as inexperienced and lacking knowledge.  Someone has to either die or leave the company for you to be promoted.  Sad because there are actual employees that are invested in the organization but don't have to the opportunity to innovate and make a change.  And internal transfers are a joke - an external hire will be given the opportunity first, every time.  

So much for a ""career journey"" within the company.  This is contributed to the fact that 90% of the recruiters at VMware are contractors and are not invested in the company and could care less about the candidate recruiting experience, even with an employee referral.  


Pros: 
Unlimited PTO
Generous Paternity Leave
Professional Development Opportunities
Lots of company/family-friendly events for Palo Alto employees
Exposure to a variety of technologies","Lackluster and Mediocre Leadership
No Upward Mobility unless you're a management ""favorite""

The leadership at Pune is the worst and they train managers to encourage bad environment that trickles down to the unfortunate engineers.

to make friends and pick up experience if you are just out of college","Where do I start? The most stressful work environment I have ever experienced. Micro-management / classroom environment, unsociable working hours, constant change of priorities, lack of trust from management. The second the working environment gets a bit calmer or normal, management come down on you like hyenas and shift priorities around again.

If you want to progress here, management still have the 1980’s mentality of being chained to your desk every night until 8-9pm (to the point of exhaustion). Doing the same job from home (i.e. more flexibility) doesn’t count. They want bodies on the ground. If you leave punctually you get that disapproving look of disgust as if you are the biggest slacker in the world.

Would rather be on unemployment benefits than go back here. If you want work/life balance and work in an environment where you feel empowered, trusted and made feel that you can do it your way and in your time, this is not the place for you. The closest thing to boot camp I have ever experienced.

To add insult to injury they feed you at Quarter End with fast food and junk food and expect you to be grateful for it, at the expense of your public holidays, weekends and late evenings of course.

Don’t let the benefits fool you, stay away from this place."

That was great because the resources and infrastructure of a big company were there, but it gave most people I worked with freedom to work on many projects, influence, move around, and contribute in many ways. Plus, many things moved faster than they might at other companies of the same size. Perks were really great including bonuses, events on the campus, opportunities, etc.","The biggest con is the annual layoff. During most of the years I was there, we were growing like crazy, beating expectations, gaining in stock price, etc. It was always positive and upward. However, every single January, it was known that there would be a round of layoffs, even when all numbers were looking great as they almost always were. Management called it restructuring. But, over the years, some really good people were let go for no apparent reason. Then to add insult to injury, a week or two later, there would be a company quarterly meeting discussing how VMware was doing so well and is still hiring, but they had to make some changes. It always felt dishonest and the sympathy for those let go came across as disingenuous."

I = Integrity and the professionalism of the people and the Leaders bears this out. Never have I experienced a place so hot on doing the right thing, even if it doesn't help you personally. Long-term thinking even though we have quarterly goals and usual target pressures, we understand what we're building isn't just 3 months worth. C=Customer and the customer focus especially to help fix their business problems rather than just sell products is maturing exponentially. Finally 2 = the second C - Community. A week a year to provide voluntary service to any community you choose, fully paid, and encouraged was and always will be a winner for me when I joined. We are all people, and very fortunate to work for a Company that gives back to help others benefit from our good fortune.

3454,VMware,Decent job but not enough real development,2019-05-07,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The total compensation is pretty good, in particular for people working really hard to get the job done. For people looking for a stable company paying good money, without caring too much about writing new code, VMware is a good choice. Also, the company heavily rewards loyal employees and has a good culture.","In the vSphere business unit where most of the interesting things were developed in the past, today it’s almost exclusively about maintaining the legacy code. The management often count dirty patching as development, refusing to realize that the whole virtualization management infrastructure is irremediably compromised by technical debt. The company is making short/medium-term decisions in order increase the revenue, without realizing that the competition is getting better and better. The partnership with AWS won’t save VMware in the long term, IMHO (but I hope I'm wrong). The company needs to implement a *much* better (faster, robust, scalable) management infrastructure. If I had to develop a service based on virtualization today, probably I won’t choose the VMware stack. Sadly, the core virtualization code is still probably the best in the world, but that's not enough anymore today. Now, the problem lies in layers above it and the competition is already offering solutions which scale much better.

Another problem caused by this whole situation is that good engineers are leaving every day, choosing other companies because they're offering them more interesting jobs. As a result of that, the company pays more and more the current employees in order to keep them and often makes way too much compromises when hiring new people. This causes a downward spiral: bad hires hire even worse hires, at all levels. I really hope the company will change direction at some point, because I always had good feelings for this company, since the first time I saw their workstation running on i686."

Excellent product portfolio.
Excellent CEO.

 Pat Gelsinger the CEO has done an awesome job of taking over the reigns of the company a few years ago and completely turning it around. The stock price has more than quadrupled under his leadership. He has acquired many startups and successfully integrated them into the VMWare product portfolio and eco system. Hats off to him for creating wealth for the employees, for the owners (EMC and now DELL) and for the investors. One of the finest CEO in the Silicon Valley.","Along with these product acquisitions, this company has also acquired managers and middle management who have no idea of what management is. There is no one culture at VMWare. There are as many cultures as the number of startups acquired and the managers of these startups are free to treat their teams as they want. HR is very weak in this company and they are not for you. They are for the managers ... dont rely on them. 

I had a short stint at one of these acquired startups called Velocloud. Incompetent management, very high attrition rate. Lot  of senior engineers leaving the group. Those who stick around are there to vest their stocks. The founders thinks of themselves to be semi god who will punish you if you decide to leave their kingdom. Their technology stack will teach you nothing. Accept their offer if you cannot find a job somewhere else.

Most of these startup managers lack sympathy and empathy and will not hesitate to show you their powers and make you feel that you are a POS compared to them.

Dont be fooled by the ""100 Best Companies to Work"" or ""Top paying company"" marketing or the campus. It is actually an average paying and a very weak middle management company. Shop around, I am confident you will get a much better offer and a lot better culture, work environment and work life balance. I know people who were offered twice the package they were making at VMWare."

Live Balance is null, no chance to work from home, really bad Management, Senior People think that they are almighty sacred cows.
I won't recommend this job and company unless your only purpose would belong to a leading tech enterprise and increase the visibility of your CV.

During my 2 long years working there, there's no backup from Management's side against customers. They are extremely demanding even when they are wrong or have taken an unsupported decision. Does not matter, the most important thing is having a positive survey. YES, CUSTOMERS ARE WRONG MOST OF THE TIME.

Adding to that, there is a new generation of Managers who don't have an idea of how to manage a team, how to deal with pressure and stress and how to handle a priority one case, really poor management. A lot of contradictory changes, one week you are doing one thing and the week after you have to change it.

VMware is consistently on the leading edge of technology, and is always improving its products and has rightly earned the position of being the de facto standard in IT infrastructure virtualization. 

Pay and benefits are top notch.","The rate of organizational change is overwhelming. I'm on my fifth boss in less than three years. The one who hired me was simply excellent, and was one of the best bosses I ever had. Sadly, the last three were among the bottom 10% of all my bosses. 

My current boss does not respond to phone calls or emails, and no one is able to schedule meetings with her on a timely basis. When she does finally meet with us, she does 90% of the talking, most of which is merely a re-hash of what she knows about the situation but with no new insight or leadership provided. Essentially, she is all talk, and has developed a reputation among other executives as being uncooperative and just doing things on her own.

Finally, there is too much internal competition and politics where there should be teamwork and cooperation. People view it as a badge of honor if they do someone else's job, causing total chaos. There are routine ""land grabs"" by various directors and VPs, and of course, from people at Dell who seem to have nothing better to do. Sadly, this seems to be the norm at VMware."

Industry leading salaries and bonus (but very poor RSUs). The company moves at a reasonable pace and is very family friendly. 

The office location and campus for the HQ is awesome. 

The benefits and perks are also very good. 

The CEO and his team look to be very competent and genuinely nice people. 

The company has a compelling story with VMC on AWS. Hopefully it delivers on that vision or else the company is in for some real tough times.","On-prem enterprise software is not a cool technology sector to be in. 

Because of this perception the company does not attract the best talent anymore.  Most of the A level players have left from the engineering ranks to startups or the FANG companies.  So co-workers are mediocre at best.

Also the company moves at a glacial pace, compared to all the companies working in the cloud - releases in VMware take months to a year. 

 Its anachronistic in this day and age to have a monolithic technology stack. But with such a large installed base it will be near impossible for the company to pivot. 

Due to all of the above constraints  it is hard to get excited about the technology in the company. 

A lot of the upper management are from the traditional old companies like Cisco, HP and IBM. This does not inspire confidence in the middle management.

The company pays well on the salary and bonus front but the RSU's are significantly lower than what FANG pays. 

Bottom line VMware is no longer a premium destination for employees. Its more in the same league as a Cisco  or Oracle.  A tier 3 company at best.

Go there if you are looking for a stable company and great WLB."

I spent 1 year within this time. It was the worst experience from culture. It is all about abusive micromanagement. Middle managers are picked based on how incompetent they are. It is done on purpose to increase office politics and this will allow management maintain their jobs. We joined via an acquisition and at the 1 year visting, almost all of us left. It was a disgrace. Middle managers across the intelligence team are picked to ensure no one stays whenever an acquisition occurs. Everyone from any acquisition are targeted by middle managers until they make them leave. My health suffered. My attitude changed. So stressful. No productivity. Almost none. Middle manager sabotage progress on purpose. They write up lies to the upper management. Upper management never speak to staff memebers. There are inclusion and diversity titles that has nothing to do with reality. Also there are places where you can complain then they retaliate against you despite too many employees staff members complain about the incompetent middle manager. One middle manager within intelligence team is actually a racist and upper knows it. They just want to keep him so that staff will go and complain. Never regret leaving this toxic team under the organization of the intelligence. The VP knows and does it on purpose.",Toxic Vp in intelligence team and picks incompetent middle managers on purpose

3885,VMware,DO NOT JOIN GSS AIRWATCH,2018-06-10,1.0,Technical Support Engineer,I have not come across a single pro from joining this company and specifically this project. i am deeply saddened that the values of this company are diluted by a few selfish and unethical individuals. i had very high hopes of working for this brand but today i have recommended many colleagues of mine from not ruining their career by joining this unethical team.  however the team has a good bonding - unified by the atrocities of this gross (mis)management detailed below.   so you can that the team thrives despite the management.,"GSS airwatch is handled by the absolute scum of management that I have ever seen my life and believe me I have seen a lot of scum in my life. i have been in this process long enough to completely understand the mentality of the management - and their sole aim in life is to figure out and scheme hundreds of different ways to make life as hellish as possible for their employees. 

and if that was their measure of success i am sure they would get a fat bonus as they are exceeding expectations. 

The major scum of airwatch gss aka VP has the worst ethics and is a wonder how did he rise up the ranks to become a senior manager. apparently douchebaggery helps I ve learnt from him.  getting to actual cons itself now

◙  This project has no regard for due process and rules are cooked up at whim to suit personal motives. everything possible is done to paint the engineer in a bad light without even hearing both the sides of the stories - because the scum of airwatch think what they do is right and everybody else wrong. 

◙  Because of the major scum of airwatch behaves in this way his underlings also start behaving in the same way as they are spineless cowards who cannot speak up or have started to look up to him as a ""leader"". (i am laughing calling this guy as a leader)

◙  naive people reading this review if you ever join this team - forget about growth. Please forget about growth. the scum of airwatch will do all possible things to prevent you from leaving this team - this is because when you were born you were tattooed that you belong to airwatch gss. so it is obvious that you are marked as a slave to airwatch gss. 

◙  the scum of airwatch has 2 set of rule books. 1 set of rule books for themselves and another set of rule books for their employees. the rule book which they follow is vastly different from the rule book employees are supposed to follow.

◙  the scum of airwatch will often paint a very rosy picture that everything is fine in the team and find ways to convince you that it is YOU who are delusional and not them.

◙  the weekend allowance is very very very less compared to some of the other product based companies. it is a mere 2.5k which is not at all attractive to work on the weekends. 

◙  personal development is not promoted in the team as the scum of airwatch keep pointing to lousy budget issues and other such excuses. the takeone program which is vmware's personal development program is also denied to the engineers citing budget issues despite the fact that the budget is managed centrally and not on a team level. the scum of airwatch attempt to fool the employees in this way.

◙  the entire process feels like this is a bpo wherein employees sentiment is not cared for and pure numbers is the name of the game. some managers have also been hired from such bpos who solely care about numbers numbers and numbers. employees are treated like robots.

◙  some experienced managers who were technical at one point (dont want to take names) treat the employees like kids by shouting and scolding them. are we in some kind of pre school here? shouting at me wont earn you my respect. respect is earned when you display it. maintain a sense of professionalism and do not treat employees like you would treat children by scolding and shouting. rather than humiliating me in front of others you are humiliating yourself by showing your true charactre professionalism.

i honestly do not know about other gss teams and the culture there. but in airwatch gss the culture is terrible and i blame it directly on a few rotten apples at the top. i hate hate hate hate to the core some of the managers here and i truly hope that nobody else ruins their years here like i have. i wish to god if i had another chance i would not have joined this team even if the pay was crazy."

3896,VMware,Really admire the CEO but...,2018-05-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everything is what you expect from an established market leader. Having worked in the past with Cisco, I found everything more or less similar. I don't want to get in details since everything is same what you can find in other big shot companies.","Okay now let's talk about this since most of us are here for this section. CEO is fun to talk or even listen to and you get a feeling that he has his vision set clearly on where the company is headed and what responsibility of each employee should be. Very approachable and friendly. BUT...When it comes to his subordinate and specifically in India there is, well as other workplaces in India, lots and lots of POLITICS. 

Basically management people somehow manage to reach here and then make sure that they will stay here till they die ! And along this journey they make sure the deserving ones don't get much chance to grow while the ""YES Sir""-attitude employees stay so that manager's job is secured. 

It's not that this happened to me and that's why i am blabbering but this is a norm here. Ideas get shot down because the management may have to push their US counterparts or their own lack of will. So, here's the thing, ever since VMware jumped into SDN domain there are two set of the engineers in the VMware- Those that are from core VMware backgrounds eventually got into SDN teams due to their tenure and then there are external hires from hardcore networking companies like Cisco, Juniper and the likes. Now, in between them there is always cold war situation because core VMware-turned-SDN experts are weak in basic networking concept (I can't blame them for being that) but they can't accept this thing in front of newly joined hardcore network engineers. And THIS is the main reason why there is alot of friction in between the company.

If such core VMware-turned-SDN experts gets in some ""Lead"" type of role then they WILL make sure that the poor network background new hires will never join their team since they CAN reject their ideas and can become a problem during the promotion cycle.

Apart from these things the usual applies- Non-technical managers in technical support role, internal transfers are next to impossible as the existing team management will deny your move to another team for as much as 1 year. Notice period buyout not possible as management will give nonsensical reasons to employee for completing the same."

Decent cabs for GSS, nothing great","If youre coming to airwatch GSS BU, be rest assured that ur fate is sealed in that BU only. The AirWatch GSS managers hates lateral movement and will do absolutely everything in their power to prevent ur movement with a plethora of cheap and dirty tactics. The kind of cheap tactics prove that an employee is tied to the AirWatch GSS unit and they definitely do not promote cross movement to other roles. AirWatch GSS leadership is prison warden redefined. 

It is hilarious that these are the mafia people who preach day in and day out about being ethical but at the same time practise such unethical behaviors!

The weeknd allowance is a peanuts at a lame 2500 rs. There is absolutely no incentive to work on weeknds. Other product based companies offer well above 5000 for working on weeknds. 

In this day and age, when evry company is giving internet access to be reimbursable, vmware lets u do it after only 1 year. It looks like u have to prove ur allegiance to do this. 

Some of the managers are pretty good, but some others are woefully unskilled to be leaders. Especially the ones who are newly hired. And a certain oder person handling ess team.

The hiring has been haphazard and the truckloads of new hires coming are not fit for BPO level jobs as well. 

It is shocking at how ignorant the HR and the rest of the GSS leadership is to such malpractices. Might be the HR is also involved in this circus. 

Save yourself, there are better BUs in vmware wherein your work is valued."

- Fearful environment – No body dares to speak against the Director, If you speak you will be thrown out of the bus.  Firings are mandatory twice a year January and July. 

- Middle-level management is only a message broker from top to bottom. There is no message broker from bottom to top. Middle level management lacks basic management and technical skills. Managers  only follow commands from the Director, they are not allowed to voice their opinion, if they speak they will be axed.

- Undue favoritisms -  based on how much time you spend with the Director, who is completely perception driven and lacks fundamental rationalism.

- No process around appraisals. They use some random number generator biased with favouritism. 

-  Non existent HR - Consistently poor ratings in internal employee survey which is far low than vmware standards - HR doesn't exist.

4326,VMware,Great place to work,2017-10-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Awesome pay and awesome benefits are of course two wonderful reasons to work somewhere, but they rarely cancel out the reality of working for a terrible company.  Thankfully, VMware is a great company so you get the trifecta!  Everyone gets to do their own calculus when evaluating potential employers, but I suggest focusing first on the work you'll be doing, second on the person who will be your manager and third on the values of the company that pays you.

My team is majority male but our female employees are some of our best, many of them getting well-deserved promotions (and, I think, resulting in our most senior team members being mostly women).  My team celebrates EVERYONE's birthday, everyone's work anniversaries, everyone's promotions.  Our team's email group receives sometimes 25 questions a day from our own team members, yet I've never seen one of them go unanswered.  That's the culture of my team (fostered by my manager) and it's a direct result of the culture of the company.

Anyone who's concerned about the future of the company (in the face of competition from the public cloud) should take time to familiarize themselves with VMware's strategy.  Leadership isn't just riding the coattails of ESX and sticking its head in the sand, and I would say our view of the public/private cloud future is a lot more honest than the views of our competitors.","If you're looking for a company that has a tool and process for everything, this is not the place for you.  Many old companies have gone too far in the direction of tools and processes, but VMware could probably stand to add some more.

The Dell acquisition of EMC (which owns VMware) is definitely an opportunity for things to change.  Some of the ""synergies"" (that are always the subject of much hype in an acquisition) have yet to happen and history shows the acquirer usually fares better than the acquired."

In addition to the low coverage, it is very administrative to login to the Health Equity website and match the claims (which is a mystery as the $ amounts don't match) and then fund them with your equity account.  It is also very unclear which is which.  I was told that moving away from the HMO was voted on by employees.  I was never presented with a voting option.   It would be great if VMware could bring back an HMO as an option for employees.  Upon inquiring about this I was told that VMware cannot absorb the costs of an HMO.  Hoping this changes."

4394,VMware,VMware helps you grow and makes it possible to enjoy your work,2017-10-04,5.0,Member Of Technical Staff,"The following is my summary of my experience in Vmware after almost 2 years in the company.

The work at VMware is very focused. There is clear separation between what teams do and there is rarely any overlap between their responsibilities. The company is very innovation driven. While VMware is very focused on providing virtualization software and cloud solutions, it is not afraid to explore other opportunities where a business solution can expand into a leading product.

What matters to me is that VMware takes its employees seriously. The voice of every employee matters. Opinions are evaluated and acted upon. In my team, I have voiced my concerns several times and every member of my team has collaborated together to address the issues I brought up. This gives rooms for contributions not only inside the team, but also in work itself. Good work is rewarded and mangers show their gratitude and support for employees who have helped make important progress. This makes it possible to steadily grow professionally.

Furthermore, the company is concerned in making sure employees work in a productive environment. It attempts to mitigate the stress most employees feel by organizing social events, activities, retreats, etc.

The last thing I enjoy at the company is the atmosphere. Colleagues are kind, friendly and helpful. This facilitates easy communication and allows work to be accomplished quickly and effectively.","The only negative aspect is that VMware tends to hire people who have only recently started their education. This leads to a big skill gap between them and other junior employees. That causes slow work progress in certain cases in the first several months of their employment. Also, because they lack knowledge in many areas, only a limited set of responsibilities can be assigned to them."
4395,VMware,Management process,2017-10-04,5.0,Technical Support Specialist,"Things have been going ok, but they can always be better.","Drop in VMware standards and values in Management decisions in setting the TSE goals, which are petty and stingy"

You also get no extra compensation or recognition for working harder.  You get super frustrated with trying to change things and get things done while just running into walls of dead weight everywhere you turn.  They will kill your work/life balance because they need you to be the guy doing stuff while they play golf or whatever it is they're doing all the time.  They'll block career moves, because they need you to be the guy doing stuff.  They shoot down anything close to negative feedback because fixing problems is harder than doing nothing.

If you do nothing, you'll love it here because everyone leaves you alone while you're out doing nothing.  For those people, work/life balance is probably great.   If you're worried about accomplishing anything or advancing your career, look elsewhere.  There are barriers to entry everywhere, and a big 'old boys club' that will block you if they sense you might be equivalent or better to them in skill.  They take all the best opportunities for themselves and leave the scraps for everyone else.  

There's a lot of people on scholarship from this company, a lot who are just playing games and taking part in corporate one-up-man-ship, and only a select few who seem to be here to just get stuff done without tooting their own horn, stepping on everyone else, and generally making life miserable in some way for everyone else.

Aside from the workforce, there have been a ton of ""cutting back"" on comp plans, where they are reducing compensation on core products with zero notice.  You'll have in-flight deals when they make the change and now your pipeline takes a hit because you aren't retiring as much quota as you thought you would.  They've also implemented some caps on certain roles' accelerators, and implemented sliding scales to avoid paying you all of your money early on in the half or paying on accelerators before you hit 100% quota.

The Dell acquisition is creating a lot of problems with all the companies' reps and teams stepping all over each other.  No communication, and a lot of people trying to take the lead on everything.  Tons of people calling on the same customers and right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.  Makes us look brilliant to our customers.

In terms of company strategy, it's hard to divine that.  One minute we have a cloud thing, next minute it's canned, and a new cloud thing comes out.  Every time we announce one, it's the best thing since sliced bread until a year or 2 later when we can it.  If we could just stay the course on SOMETHING, we might get somewhere.  It reminds me a lot of working at HP, where they were constantly buying companies to replace a product that already did that thing, then they turned around and buy a new one to replace the replacement.  It frustrates not only the field teams who have no confidence anything will be around long enough for a customer to actually use it, but most importantly the customers who hate getting jerked around all the time.  VMware is forever killing products with no notice to the detriment of customer satisfaction."

I was even informed by my manager that he is not a career growth consultant that he will look after the growth and training, though it was mentioned during the all hands meeting that managers are responsible for growth

The other issue was if you are buying coffee and act as a butler tot he managers, then only you are heard, otherwise their opinion about you is final, not the amount of deals helped to close or getting good reviews from the clients.

Completely stacked to position you to make less. This leads to a majorly demotivated workforce.

4721,VMware,Best place I've ever worked,2017-02-19,5.0,SE Manager,"VMware is very supportive of career development.  Internal transfers even between completely different types of jobs are very easy to accomplish.  In the 6 years I've worked there, I've had 4 completely different kinds of roles - Internal Datacenter Ops, Sales Engineer, Professional Services, and now Management.  I never feel the need to leave VMware to move to the next step in my career or to branch out into emerging technologies.  Before coming here I always had to leave a job every 2 years to be able to move up or get involved in different things.

The highest levels of leadership constantly impress me with the strategic decisions they make and the way they are able to monetize and promote new technologies.  I've never seen a leadership team as good at making money.  This translates to solid commissions for Sales Engineers / Account Reps and general company health/growth if nothing else.

They also take their corporate culture pretty seriously.  They really mean it when they say they are committed to things like work/life balance.","There are pockets of people within VMware that are beyond comfortable.  These people barely do any work at all.  But due to their tenure, the way some orgs are structured, and VERY forgiving HR policies, they will never get fired.  I once literally caught someone snorting drugs AT WORK and HR wouldn't do anything.  Said it was my word against theirs as to what the substance actually was.  Unbelievable.  It can be frustrating to deal with such types when you are highly motivated to get things done.  I'd say maybe 10% of the company is like this these days, but it is there."

VMware does do a decent amount of stuff on-campus for employees such as a annual farmers market and a annual fall concert for families. The work is stimulating to an extent depending on which team you're a part of. I worked for two of the UI teams at VMware, and both of them started out great, but due to either poor team management or just lack of project planning things always seemed to fall apart.","Teams at VMware do not do a good job of project management from the development perspective. As a developer we initially made up the project plan ourselves until it was obvious enough to leadership that the PM should really be doing all of the planning that we as engineers were required to do. 

Additionally, engineers may be encouraged to be ""full-stack"" but there really aren't good opportunities at VMware. Managers have said to my UI peers that there is no way they would get to touch the back-end even though the UI eng was a talented full-stack eng. 

The result of these things in both of the teams that I worked for is that the team was unhappy and overworked, features did not get completed in proper sequence with regard to API/backend work and UI/frontend work and either through mass attrition or lay-offs the teams lost too much talent to be successful."

Sometime you want to stay late at work, and having snacks make it more confortable. I encourage you to read more recent reviews. My experience was in 2013.","Middle level managers are not really good. A lot of time, I have seen people play politics at work. I did sit in a meeting where one of the VP was screaming to all his staff (50+ people were in the meeting). I think Vmware could do much more to train their leadership. Salary stock options were very low compared to other large companies in the Bay areas. I also felt that the on-boarding training was weak. I didn't know well the other products, and how the customers were using it. Some of those products are for enterprise, and I can't install them in my laptop to play with them (E.g. Saas, large scale VM management products, etc.).

I left 3 months after my manager left, and the new manager kept creating friction with our team (e.g. using the ""F"" word in meeting, arguing with an employee during staff meeting, etc.). The career opportunities were not bad, as you can easily transfer to other groups internally. I also encourage you to read more recent reviews. My experience was in 2013.

4869,VMware,Great company...Dell happened,2016-11-27,4.0,Senior Member of Technical Staff,"Resources, resources, resources...

One of the advantages to work for a multi-billion dollar company is that there are resources available--from equipment, personnel, technology. Teams can be assembled together relatively quickly, and typically from different geographic areas, but still, challenges can be tackled.

Other advantages include the opportunity to work with virtualization and Big Data products and technologies, and you will find professionals to learn from and to mentor to.

Hard work is rewarded, work schedule is flexible and PTO is great...as long as you can agree with your manager (it is marketed as ""infinite PTO"" by the recruiters, but expect to take at most 4 weeks. Let's be real, there's work to be done).

Other perks include a paid week for charity or similar work, matching of charity contributions up to the Pi constant multiplied by 1000, partial gym reimbursement, $50 monthly for BYOD--at the manager's discretion, and public transportation monies, which I don't think many use.

Overall, VMware is a well-rounded company to work for.","VMware has some cons, too.  The deal with Dell has put a dent on its ambitions (it's taken about a year for the stock price to recover to 2015 levels, and most likely it won't see 2013-2014 levels for some time), and IMO it was poorly executed.

What this caused was constraints down river for the ongoing products and projects, and loss of great personnel, which is hard to replace."

Fun. The company parties are always centered around fun.

I was in SMB sales and had the pleasure of working under the very best sales manager I have ever known or had. She was promoted, though, and this led to my decision to leave. (Our director was also awesome; he left a few months after me.)

You are selling a best-in-class solution with the support of IT analysts like Gartner. It's easy to get the conversation going, and you will get hot leads. People want to work with the best... 

I think AW had one of the best sales enablement programs out here. I say that having worked at several very large companies in different sectors. I think those folks have moved on since my time in onboarding, but it was comprehensive and helpful. I have some great ideas that can improve things at my current employer thanks to those 3 weeks.

Great perks, cool 'nalia, nice facilities and great parking. You will miss a parking garage if you ever have to go back to parking outside. You will.","Being that it was a sales-y culture, you had to hit your numbers which were sometimes ridiculous or would change. That's in addition to a sketchy comp plan.  Still, I worked under two very conscionable people; both my manager and director tried their best to make things appear fair despite what was coming down from ""the top...""

Promotions were popularity contests and politics, but this is common. I have now accepted it as I am now at another company where this sort of thing happens...

2. Very good company office and if you are in GBO or GCO then you get enjoy the go connect events too, which is by the way super fun and add beer bash in every quarter and its like cherry on the top.
3. Now on to the serious part, work culture is not great unless you are in R&D. Many teams believe in manual jobs yet and still excel is bread and butter for all. But still all depends on your team and how your management looks into adaptability.
4. How your life goes is completely dependent on your manager. Either you have to be too good to be above the politics or too good in making people happy.","1. Lots of politics and a pat on back and salary hike is completely dependent on favoritism. A lot of south Indian and north Indian politics and if you know Telugu or Kannada then half your problems are solved.

May be some improvements in facility due to VMware taking over but very recently,"Where shall i start. Have been with Airwatch for past 3 years but have not seen HR for more than 10 minutes if i recall correctly.
There is high level of politics in everything. Especially in QE. The work is 99% manual testing with automation only in talks and that too only privileged few get to work on it.
1) Hiring is based on which region of India you belong to or whom you have been recommended by. Managers team is dominated by one sect.
2) Promotion is just a myth if you are not a favourite. Same with hikes or other perks. 
Freshers who come in sometimes get more than people who are experienced. Not sure if its due to management not good with numbers or purposeful.
3) Onsite - Forget it if you are not favourite or one recommended by favourite. 
High point is someone being sent who is sure to put papers on coming back from onsite. Funny part is everyone in the team knows. This includes the person who recommended the culprit, sorry for lack of not getting any other word. The lead of the person also knows. If the people in management who take decision on travel matter knew about this then i have nothing else to say to you. May be the message then was happy vacation.

After hours, the holiday party is a lot of fun, and company events tend to involve a decent amount of alcohol.","AirWatch is a great place to work if you're starting a career, but be prepared to jump after 2.5-3 years as there is minimal room to climb higher within the company.  Salaries are on the lower end of the competitive spectrum.  Promotions tend to be either nominal or lateral, and neither see much of a pay increase (if any). Vertical movement is severely limited and tends to be handed down based on tenure rather than experience, ambition, or skill.  As a result, some managers are decent while others are downright terrible.

5189,VMware,Management is awful,2016-04-29,1.0,Technical Support Engineer,"Let me start off by saying that the pros are great: 401k benefits, free food, choice of three shifts (early, normal, late), open environment, and fun company events. Coworkers even host events and invite you to join so you bond quickly if you're willing to make new friends. You work in a great area where everything is easily accessible and dress code is reasonable. When you start off at the company, it feels great.","As you slowly start to experience how the company is run, you tend to question whether this is normal or not. Can you really not work from home? Are you randomly selected to work on weekends and after hours if you don't pick a spot to sign up? Are managers supposed to comprise of people with less than 3 years experience? Are you supposed to be punished for helping other people? Do they ever encourage you for what a good job you're doing? Can you even move to a career opportunity you want to do?

You can tell from other negative reviews that they talk about inexperienced managers. They are true. I don't want this to deter anyone from seeing the bright side of this company (because it's still growing), but until managers get better trained to make everyone happy (including themselves), I do not recommend anyone to go through that and think corporate industries run like this. It makes your life stressful, you feel like what you're doing is not worth it, and you lose your voice and imagination that can better shape the company.

As a disclaimer, not ALL managers are like this. There are AMAZING managers in this company, but I am specifically talking about ones in the Technical Support role."

Not clear what impact will be of Dell acquisition, recent leadership changes, market transitions around shift to cloud and lack of clarity on what role VMware will play.

5194,VMware,Walking dead...Emperor's New Clothes,2016-04-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The beautiful campus, fresh fruit, gym, beer bashes, celebrity entertainment, and the turtles.","Emperor's new clothes: It is an incredibly political place where people are no longer comfortable with speaking up about issues (product, people, strategy...). And there are certain executives who terrorize and belittle their people with no recourse. They missed the boat on public cloud in a big way - hampered their product teams by mandating that they support vCloud Air, at the expense of avoiding Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The public cloud offering is sub-par - does NOTHING to streamline the experience for hybrid cloud, which was supposed to be the POINT. Why would a customer manage workloads one way with private cloud and a completely different way for 'public'. This is what happens when you let a handful of egomaniacs drive product strategy.

Walking Dead: The result is a campus full of zombies. There is no life there anymore. It's a sad, sad ending to what used to be a great company. And you can't blame the current state entirely on the Dell/EMC acquisition. We were on life support before that all came about."

- they may pay you good in the beginning, but you'll only get promotions if you know someone up high in the management.
- the technologies and products are getting obsolete and the company is busy fighting internal battles. 
- new technologies, like Dockers & containers are considered a threat but there are no actions to innovate
- top and middle management have close to none technical experiences, they are coming from times of early 1990's when they wrote code in VB and knowing Java and .NET was a specialization they just know about, hence do not understand the pains of Engineering staff
- all the development decision are even made by the old time architects/Sr Staff Engineers who too are on their high horses and too proud to be given such responsibility that a Staff Engineer, Sr. MTS or MTS-3 or MTS-2 are all considered stupid to make any decisions and the worst part, management supports such behavior
- its a toxic workplace, colleagues are made to compete with each other based on number of bugs you can fix or number of tests you can write or number of lines of code you are writing, ergo, if you fix 2 major bugs and someone fixed 10 minor bugs, you are an idiot who can fix only 2 bugs in given time when your colleague is fixing 10 bugs in the same time. Major and Minor doesn't matter in management's head to an extent there are monetary prizes and globally recognized honor to fix more bugs hence ""highly motivating"" the employees to fix MORE bugs doesn't matter how important.
- People manager also titled R&D Managers who last wrote code when Clinton was president or I should say, when John Howard was the prime minister, are highly inexperienced, impatient, ruthless and have low regard for your skills or career or your life.

We have great social events like having a pancake day where caterers come in and cook for us. A family bbq day in the summer where friends and family are invited, a Halloween Party where kids can come in dressed up and we all take part too in all of the festivities.

It is a very fast-paced company and market leader in the technology we provide and there is always something new to learn within this company. I know that there have been a few negative reviews on here. This company is so much more than the angry few.

401K match and ESPP helps to prop up weaker benefits.

Lots of training opportunities if you want them.  It's a necessity considering the wide amount of products now in the VMware catalog.

In theory, the employee culture and EPIC value system are very compelling.","Pay with comp SHOULD be competitive, but compensation targets are unrealistic.  In some markets the SEs are 2:1 or even 1:1 with their salespeople.  In others, it's 4:1.  Both pay the same amount when goals are reached, but the 4:1 people get SCREWED because they need to have ALL FOUR salespeople hit their revenue targets to get paid their full comp.  I was 3:1 and only hit my goal one quarter while I was there.

Oh, and be sure to keep copies of all your compensation plans!  I have had to fight to get revenue recognized for my last large deal.  I'm going on 2 months fighting with management to get it paid out.

5356,VMware,Great collaborative working environment,2016-02-28,4.0,Order Analyst,Great environment to work in. Team around you are very helpful. Local management take a really collaborative approach to the team. Feedback and suggestions are greatly encouraged and will be implemented if viable. Although quarter end periods can be very busy local management do everything they can to make these times more bearable. Usually some downtime the week after to make up for the long efforts and hours. Some time in lieu also.  Opportunity to take on project work too outside of your day to day role. Really good focus on social culture in VMware. Free on site gym and always some activities on the cards to get involved in. Load of opportunity to get involved or start societies.,Career path can be slow in OM. It's a very mature team structure so can be a case of waiting for someone to leave the team before any movement is made. It's rare new promotional roles are created and not much room to go outside any benefits structure no matter how well you are performing. It's very right place/right time in that sense.Expect to work long hours 2/3 weeks leading up to quarter end which is non negotiable as the business is based around these numbers.

5362,VMware,VMware is great but GSS is just pathetic,2016-02-25,1.0,Technical Support Engineer,"My review is very specific to Vmware GSS Bangalore, 

Pros are many things to learn , excellent facilities provided by company. Infrastructure is simply  awesome.","uffff, where to start, 

VMware has 2 sides, 
1 out side VMware GSS and another inside Vmware GSS. 

Outside GSS its definitely the place to be, but within GSS amount of work we are expected to do is like worst than even a bonded labour, there is so much pressure inside the GSS bangalore, you feel like your head is about to explode. 

IF you are joining Bangalore GSS , just totally forget the work life balance, there is nothing called as work life balance in VMware GSS, they only got big long speech about it but nothing in action. 

Leaves? forget it, at GSS they have some managers, they are not even fit to run a local stationary shops, and they are leading teams with people from different domain with some extra-ordinary skills. 

We have a manager who says for you to take sick leave, you must first come to office and he will see how sick you are ( as if  this idiot is doctor ) and if he feels you are sick then you will get leave , if not you will not get leave. take that for a manager . 

coming to work load, they literally think troubleshooting VMware is just as easy as 1, 2, 3 and you are done, management has no idea what technology they are expecting the people to work on and how damn complicated it is.you are expected to handle like 8-10 cases everyday , that if you are lucky, sometime more than that. and they dont seems to care if you say , you cant. 

Technology wise its best place to be at but work wise GSS is just a nightmare. 

My advise to anyone who wants join Vmware GSS or dreaming about it , join only if you are ready to sacrifice your personal life , peace of mind and ready to get frustrated and loose hopes of living a normal life and you want to see logs even in your dreams, then join. 

If you are prepared to see hell on planet earth , its nowhere else but in GSS bangalore."

Inexperienced managers who are right out of college with no management experience. They have big egos but do not know how to lead or manage. Management has no idea what they are doing. I am surprised VMWare would want to attach their name and image to this company.

Management by fear 

No efficient processes or procedures

Very high stress, very long hours

Attempt to have an image as a modern, hip company, but it is run in a very controlling way. The company provides apps to help improve business from any location, yet they do not let their employess tele-commute. Very hypocritical.

Training for new employees  means bombarding new employees with excess information, and then throw them to the wolves. There is no real learning. 

Extremely high turnover rate, for a reason. 

Many hierarchies that actually create work inefficiencies.

PR group does a good job of manipulating the public by pretending this company is good.

I bragged as often as I could about how happy I was to be a part of such an innovative company with such supportive management. Work/Life balance was a concept I had never heard of and the growth opportunities were limitless.,Cash flow business model. That's the only thing that seems matters now. Not the years of hard work people have put into that company. Culture and values used to be important. Guess that's just the nature of the beast. They've really grown to embrace the devil that is Corporate America. I think it is safe to say that it won't be getting better any time soon.

These will help you find the next best job and keep you employed for 10 years.  VMware name in your resume has the most value today.","The company has grown way too big and the management is incapable of handling and organizing various functions.  There are several duplicate and redundant functions within VMware and you will find many people doing the same job as you.  You will also need to be very political to navigate thru several layers and get things done.  IT at VMware is the worst function to work, the CIO position is revolving door and have a new CIO every year.  With the new CIO comes his entourage and fires a whole bunch of existing IT employees. HR turns a blind eye to this even though CEO and HR leader says employees development is important in every meeting.

IT is also heavily bloated with over 2000 employees with layers and layers of management with all of them micro managing.  You will be doing a manager role even if you have a Director or Senior Director title.  VMware also has a huge shadow IT within business that decides and tells what IT should do, so pretty much IT is a order taking organization.  You will be in a better position working for one of those shadow IT.  You learn very little technology at VMware IT and most of the time you are managing vendors and contractors.

Retaliation is rampant in the company, if you voice your opinion you can be sure to be laid off in the next round.  Similarly to get promoted or to get a decent raise you should have had prior professional relationship with your manager or both of you must have worked together in a prior job.  Identified as top performer or top talent as part of annual review has no value at VMware."

I enjoyed working with sharp and motivated peers and learned a good deal that will continue to serve me well through the rest of my professional career. Culture is a strong focus and is great. Compensation and benefits are very competitive and generous. Finally, VMware is a respected name that is a nice gold star on the resume.","There are serious headwinds staring down VMware right now. This January 2016 layoff was substantial and should be heeded as a strong warning of what is to come. There have been constant and fervent commitments from both Dell and VMware that the acquisition will not impact VMware, that VMware would continue operate independently, and that the culture that VMware is so proud of would not be adversely effected. VMware and Dell have struggled mightily to get employees, partners, customers, and investors to believe this. This round of layoffs was not a typical January house cleaning; those that were let go were tenured and respected team members, which is very alarming. It very much feels like the first publicly visible example of the true impact Dell is having and will have on VMware's going-forward management strategy, and it seems that everyone's fears are justified."

I worked there from 2007 - 2015, and it was a wonderful and stable place to be during the uncertain times of a major recession.","I spent nearly 8 years of my career life at VMware and I made many friends and poured my heart and soul into the company.  For the first few years it was the epicenter of innovation, but soon too many laid off employees from Cisco came over and changed the culture.  It evolved into a place where everyone was jockeying for a promotion and the team environment soon dissipated.   Sadly, some managers purposefully make it a mystery how to progress in one's career.

-Extremely accelerated growth from start-up to large, global, public company, while fundamental operational elements are lagging. These are needed order to support maintain/improve effectiveness and performance as the company scales.
-Ineffective performance management system (""forced ranking"") has kept ineffective leaders in their positions, has marginalized many high-potential employees, and fostered uncollaborative, competitive environment where everyone is out for themselves. 
-Unconscious gender bias is rampant throughout the company
-What made the company great a few years ago has been diminished over last several years by overpowering ""big brother"" EMC. Will Dell help or hinder VMW?"

VMware has a reputation for high quality software products which are powerful and user friendly.","The majority of VMware's revenue is from vSphere, which is being commoditized.   There are open source hypervisors, which are nearly as good, available for free.  VMware is shifting to Software Defined Networking and End User software products, but hasn't convince Wall Street that it has a successful future yet.  The Dell Acquisition and spinning off of Virtuostream is worrying analysts, causing the stock to plunge.  Predictably, the Executives are cutting IT operating costs and increasing off-shoring of jobs to India, which is further deteriorating the quality of  the IT organization.  The root issue is that VMware's CFO does not believe investing in Information Technology will improve it's business."

The company recognizes that the workforce is a bit older and provides benefits accordingly. For example, the company hosts a movie night once a quarter and the movies is invariably aimed at kids. The company also has a giant Halloween celebration that is also aimed at kids. Basically, VMware is not Google or Facebook in their perks, but it's much better than other so-called legacy companies like HP or Cisco.","The company seems to have abandoned it's engineering driver culture. This has resulted is many talented people leaving and heading off to places like Google, Facebook and Uber where that can innovate more.

The level of this group of managers is so low, that literally no one is happy with them. Their presence on customers is something to avoid at any cost if you are the Account Manager. They don't have enough education or skills to deal with the top companies in Spain. Give a gun to a monkey, let him drink lots of alcohol, and this is the top management in VMware. Guess how many people has been fired since they arrive to VMware.

5614,VMware,VMWare Marketing is a dis-service to company,2015-11-18,2.0,Marketing,"Values held by executive team, nice campus, gyms, 401k match..but all of that fades to black as you see that marketing doesn't follow the values, doesn't want to work as a team, isn't given authority or budget to act on anything, and serves to work against anyone with an idea to help vmware succeed. There are some great people here, but they are probably looking for a job. 
Read the other reviews from 2015 - I agree with these reviews and should have read them more carefully. 
If you are in an engineering, release, dev, or a product team you are far better off.  That's where the intelligence lives and people who are just normal and hard-working.","Bait and switch tactics. Was hired for one job, was doing nothing near that and getting abused right from the start. I've never seen so many people doing almost nothing to move business forward except attack one another and refuse to collaborate. 

Expect layoffs with the Dell buyout - but that's a good thing.  They've infused Oracle management with the worst of Cisco marketing management so that you get 'do nothing, and do it now.'  Management needs to be walked out for inability to collaborate, for how they treat employees, and for how they backstab and whine and point fingers because they just can't get the job done.  Integrated marketing appears to be a waste of money for the company. Not sure how they add value except as gatekeepers who record what's going on.  Business units have all of budget and influence and work around marketing as much as possible. 

VPs do not spend any time with the downstream so they don't know what is actually going on. VP's are busy fighting with one another rather than putting together a success plan for the company.  
Don't waste your energy here, go somewhere else with upside to make a difference."

In addition VMware not only offers good salary and benefits, but also has multiple charitiable based initiatives to provide donations to local non-profit organisations, matching employee contributions etc. which again gives a real feeling of caring for not only people within the company, but just people in general.

From the inside as employees, I can say that the company has done a great job explaining and guiding us through the many changes, giving us multiple open meetings with the CEO and rest of leadership. The message has been the same, and I for one can say that it really calmed the waters, from the initial news. Now that we see the roadmap and mid term goals, I'm really excited to be in the inside to see these many changes.

Funding appears to go to big new initiatives that are either hit or miss. This approach has starved other areas going counter to the concept of allowing a thousand flowers to bloom.

-The mobile space is a very cool space to be in, and things move fast. AirWatch had very strong market share and was always winning awards and accolades. 

-Structurally solid, and VMware helped to accelerate that structure.

-The Christmas Party is awesome. 

-Sales often had different contests that often included some cool prizes (not sure if that still happens with VMware as the umbrella organization).","I was in sales so the majority of my feedback centers around the sales organization. 

-The sales organization is churn and burn. It's a catch 22, as they drive you to make XX number of calls per day, but ultimately they really only care about sales. Some salespeople have different methodologies and approaches for building their funnel. In 2015, making calls is only one of them. 

-AirWatch is all about territory. If you're in Mid-Market and you have a weaker or smaller territory geography or account wise, you can NOT prospect or sell to any accounts in Healthcare, Retail, Finance, Non-Profit, Government, organizations under 250 employees, organizations, over $500 Million in revenue, existing accounts over a year old, etc. etc. I understand that this is the model, but in some cases it creates a lose-lose situation for some people."
5751,VMware,Information Security Analyst,2015-09-10,3.0,Information Security Analyst,"Very young workplace, almost everyone is recent college grads. Very fun, and CEO John Marshall kept it super fun ever since startup mode to being bought out by VMware. Most employees will do work that's very complex and senior level  and have a chance to gain important skills. This is not a place to work at if you are skilled, rather it's a place where you work to develop skills. Once you have the skills, you leave AirWatch and double your salary somewhere else. Also, take advantage of the VMware name on your resume.","Internal employees are not valued and trained. The VMware acquisition was a cluster with poor management directives, especially on the DC Ops / Infosec side of the business. Information Security was seen as your typical 'check the checkbox' type of initiative, instead of a business initiative. Upper management treated infosec as a hinderance to business and more of a 'how do we make money off of this' model, instead of let's change our culture approach. Being underpaid was fine (as I was out to soak in skills) , but when your work isn't valued around by the business, you lose motivation quickly. 

There are lots of faults in every layer of management, but if executive management doesn't shift their current culture, the information security department will cease to exist. Maybe the culture will change once all the AirWatch executives are gone and replaced by VMware appointed executives. 

Skills that were worth $100-120k / year were being done by guys making less than $50k. No sane security professional will ever do the job at that rate ever again, especially considering the complexity of the projects."

In the trash, with all the other good things you ever did.","If you think my Pros were Cons, wait till you hear the Cons. In summary, the leadership of the vCloud Air team specifically has somehow become convinced that they actually know what they are doing. No longer is there a sense of experimentation and risk taking, which attracted some of the brightest minds from across the company and the industry to sign up for the journey, but instead in their place are arrogance, ignorance, and politics. Arrogance is bread from the top down, with the ""leaders"" making arbitrary and damaging decisions while ignoring the informed counsel of the people WHO ACTUALLY DO THE JOB EVERYDAY. This leads to embarrassing displays of ignorance by the ""leaders"" in all hands presentations and customer meetings when false and/or falsified information is shared as the truth. And the politics of the place make it impossible for any of the smart folks who clearly know the information is untrue to call it out with their ""leaders"" for fear of retaliation in the form of public humiliation or firing.

Before that, i signed up for a parking program that has me park across the street because we don't have enough parking - I get $50/paycheck for that. That's $1,200/year. Sounds great, except that my company just told me that my parking across the street is worth about the same as the improvement I've shown since the beginning of employment (10 months)."

The only pro that I can think of working at AirWatch is that i got to work at a terrible company so early on in my career that now i know what to look for when i am looking for jobs and have learnt not to make the same mistakes that i made over here.,"Its a long list:
1. They will just about make anyone a team lead. For example: My manager was useless. A terrible listener. Will never try to understand a word of what i am saying and then just give their own opinions. After a while, when they would hear it from someone else, they would write a long scathing email about why i didnt inform them. 
2. Each team lead here has their own favorites and they are the ones who get good reviews and they can do nothing wrong. If your manager doesnt like you, you are screwed. Anything that you do will be reviewed 10,000 times and they will still find faults and raise questions about your performance. They will also compare you to their favorites and ask why cant you be like them. I am all for a healthy competition but everyone has their own working style so its unfair to compare people. This is the first thing a manager would know. But then they dont undergo any sort of training. HR doesnt even think it is worth spending time and money on training their people on how to be good managers.
3. The HR department here does not care what you are doing. I know someone who reached out to them because they were having problems with their lead and they didnt even reply to that person's email.
4. They expect the employees to be working 24x7 but will never show any appreciation for it.  People have stayed back and worked late in the night for projects so that they could meet deadlines. Instead of rewarding them or a single thank you, they were given more work. You have to sacrifice your personal life if you are working there.

Schedule flexibility and good work life balance, but you'll still work very hard (and enjoy it).","The empowerment of people and groups to innovate leads to duplication of effort sometimes. Some people have been in the company too long for their own good and are outdated. The company has traditionally been one level removed from hardware, and it is making the efforts to change to be more lean and agile, but change is painful and changing people's mindsets takes time. For anything other than AirWatch, you will need to be in Palo Alto. The core of VMware does not do well with a distributed environment.

The people that work in VMware make VMware the company that it is. Unfortunately it seems that for the past 6 months VMware has had an overflow of employees who are leaving the company.

This in turn has put a great amount of pressure on the people who are currently still with VMware.","Management in VMware is one of the worst I have ever experienced. Promises are made but very rarely kept.

Pressure is piled on to perform and get results that are ridiculous and impossible to achieve. 

Company (Management) needs to focus on weeding out the managers that are the reason for all of the senior engineers leaving the company.

Currently VMware is not offering a competitive wage. A similar job in other tech companies can easily result in a 100% increase in wage.

This is another reason why people are leaving VMware. If the management stopped focusing on hiring WPP's (who definitely deserve the chance to get back to work) and put more effort into keeping people with experience the company would have a much better foot to stand on compared to other tech companies.

Also, in relation to the wages it is advisable to pay the industry standard rate instead of trying to get by with measly pay increases of 2-3%"

Hard (and good) work is acknowledged.

Flexibility in the schedule is superb so long as it's not abused.

Coworkers are smart and driven!

Innovation is a key component to VMware's culture and is highly, highly encouraged and many opportunities to demonstrate innovative ideas and even foster them into being are available.","I'm not sure if this is common industry wide, but the frequency of reorganizations seems very excessive."
5948,VMware,It's a great place to work where employees are valued,2015-07-08,4.0,Technical Trainer,Some of the brightest people in the world work at VMware. It's a real think-tank. The technology and people are what drive us forward. I feel honored to work among such awesome people.,"Make sure that you spend time on the salary discussion, because even though the raises at VMware are OK, the best raise you will ever get is in your salary negotiations before you start. I have had a couple of raises, one of them is stellar, and one was mediocre."
5949,VMware,"great past, uncertain future, high potential",2015-07-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Self-starter culture, plenty of day to day empowerment, huge customer base with very positive relationship, above average salary and benefits, lots of believers.","Culture- some areas approach things like sales and R&D in the same virtualization-focused mindset that worked 6 years ago, but the current market needs a more solution-focused approach, rapid iteration and strong link to business value. This mindset is often found in the people that have been here the longest and have had great success in the past, putting them in positions of influence, making it tough to shift."
5950,VMware,Consultant,2015-07-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The vision and strategy for IT virtualization products is very inspiring. The benefits are among the best in the industry.,The strategy within Professional Services requires an unhealthy emphasis on billing utilization to the detriment of customer satisfaction.
5951,VMware,Not Bad But Not Nirvana,2015-07-08,3.0,Marketing Director,Good freedom to get your job done and overall decent benefits compared to industry averages (though as VMware grows benefits continue to get chiseled away).

No other company I have ever worked for has cared about its employees as much as they do at VMware.","VMware in the UK is a business that has had to grow quickly in a short space of time, and so internal processes are not always as refined as they should be for a company of this size."

5960,VMware,VMWare,2015-07-07,4.0,Member of Technical Staff III,Vmware was one of those dream jobs and for the most part lived up to that dream.  The company is very community oriented and does a lot to help the cities where it has campuses.  Work\life balance was good for the most part and there were a number of perks,"The work\life balance equation seems to be getting worse even though the company is trying to support it.

5966,VMware,Great overall package and work conditions,2015-07-06,5.0,Senior Solutions Architect,"Depending on your manager and team, it can be a great, inspiring, fresh place to work in. The Palo Alto campus is one of the best places ever although once you get in your cube, nothing is different. Benefits are matching competitor offerings. Work from home gives you less expenses and almost totally flexible working hours.","Again, depending on your manager and team, it can be hell. Stay away from PSO related jobs as they will try to put you on 100% travel. Flexible working from home hours might also mean that you have conference calls from the US with Australia and / or China regularly.."
5967,VMware,Pay is fine but culture is just okay,2015-07-06,3.0,Member of Technical Staff II,"Pay is fine. 
Product is promising and growing. Good technology.","Only 1 paid holiday  for 4th of July, and one day for Christmas. Thanksgiving has two days though. 
Unlimited PTO is actually making it difficult to get PTO depending your relationship with the manager. You need good reason to take PTO, and if you don't take any PTO, you won't get refunded. 
Internal transfer is difficult as well. 
A lot micromanagement."
5968,VMware,Love VMware,2015-07-05,5.0,Member Of Technical Staff,VMware is one of the top companies for engineers to work as it provides many career opportunities and helps in work-life balance.,One of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect.

I get to work on some interesting, industry defining virtualization products; great company culture in many aspects.","When it comes to promotions and being recognized for your achievemnts, I think VMware scores poorly.  In my opinion, that there are a lot of politics involved and this is quite discouraging in that sense."
5971,VMware,Company at risk towards mediocrity,2015-07-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Still has many of the early superstar engineers and manages to attract NCG recruits from top universities to keep the talent level relatively good.,"There has been a pattern of annual spring attrition taking with it some invaluable engineers, their talent, and parts of the company culture. Not all of the replacement engineers or the company growth in head count is of the same caliber as a few years ago."
5972,VMware,As many perks as uncooperative workers,2015-07-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, exciting technologies to work with. Being a VMware subsidiary should eventually pay off.","You will see mistakes all the time, company rarely learns from them. No follow up on career advancement touted. Very uneven distribution of work load. Some work 6-7h days and others 70h weeks. Quality of products and services never ceases to suffer from approximations and mistakes, a contagious ""yes we do everything"" mindset and mindless footprint expansion (illusion of extra $). Severely uncooperative individuals and poor communication/coordination undermine overall capacity to execute, as confirmed in analyst reports. Current culture makes everyone look and feel awful with constant war rooms to meet overdue and broken solutions, which are a natural result of dedicating no more attention to any system than 30min meetings."
5973,VMware,Decline in culture let by management,2015-07-03,3.0,Staff Engineer,"Nice campus (Palo Alto, Bangalore), interesting visitor programs (speakers, musicians), good bonus/stock (for some), generally nice co-workers and most are smart/capable (though not all ""good"" co-workers).  The VMware foundation encourages community giving. It's fantastic.","Recent years, despite financial success/growth, have been challenging at VMW. There are various reasons. To me there are three top level factors in the company's decline from a top place to work: (1) ""Stock advocates"" putting pressure on EMC to sell of VMW to ""unlock"" share holder value.  (2) Aggressive and (seeming) directionless drive to develop the next growth technology. (3) Infiltration of ""Good Old Boy"" management. 

The affects of each of factors are subtle and significant by themselves, but very impactful together.  (1) Forces cost control and places a premium on a ""need to move quickly"" to hold off the advocates.  This drives poor planing, staffing (no hiring in certain places, forced multi time zone teams), and a shotgun approach to product development,  leading to poor execution.  This puts tremendous pressure on the employees, making it a less desirable place to work, proven by high sr mgmt and engineering turn over in the last year.  Replacement mgmt comes brings outside cultures, which can be good depending on where it comes from, but turned out bad for VMW (good old boys and empire builders that were laid off from ""successful companies"")."

You also get to work at the forefront of private cloud transformation of some of the world's biggest companies.","Change is constant which isn't necessarily bad if you can adapt or if you thrive in ambiguous environments.  However, too much change can and does inhibit execution.  VMware is still going through a sales transformation from selling server virtualization to a full software suite for building and managing private clouds.  The EMC Federation is also gearing up to drive more complicated sales engagements however, the end game is unclear.  There is risk as to what is going to happen with VMware.  It may be spun out or sold to another company.  It may get more fully consumed into EMC or it may stay status quo if the Federation can positively impact the velocity of cloud sales growth."

Probably good place to start up for new grad or new in the market.,I agree with another review that individuals in mid management really makes the place terrible; for a company this size this project is disoriented and vision is confusing. There's not much to gain from this place if you have more than several years of experience. Treat employee sub-par compares to most other tech companies.

VMWare benefits are really starting to kick in and so far its been a good thing. 

work/life balance is somewhat okay

teammates are generally great to work with esp. our india counter parts. flexible work schedule is good. perks like hackathon, six flags, braves games, and christmas party awesome. if you want to switch to another position your teammates will generally encourage you to do so. such as QA to PM or QA to TAM or such. moving within company show we have big spots for career growth. I can join as QA and in a few years switch to PM or Dev position and get that experience. we have a lot of internationals who travel to home and bring back some sweets so get ready for delicious foreign sweets.  generally speaking i'm happy joining this company and can see myself here a long time.","your experience will def. depend on your manager. certain managers micro-manage the heck out of their teams esp. those who don't really follow the modules well, but drift in and out which is the worst because they will miscommunicate something and all hell breaks loose. not all managers are like this. some do a decent job of keeping up with things but the ones who drift in and out are the worst. so your time will def. depend on your manager. 

the way the titles were handled were a mess because some of the veteran employees had to do timesheets and limited vacation time and such while other freshers had no time sheet and unlimited vacation. they overload you with things to do and pester the whole team about it later. i'm really starting to see why the turnover rate in QA was so high. 

honestly your experience will highly depend on the manager you get and your teammates. people here are friendly for the most part so you wont have much of problems with teammates but you may have problems with manager."

6004,VMware,High turnover rate for a reason,2015-06-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,VMWare is becoming more involved and hopefully changing the culture at Air Watch.,"The entire business model of AirWatch is finding the cheapest possible labor.  They usually hire recent graduates who have no idea how underpaid they are.  Most of the people who leave usually find jobs that double their former salary at AirWatch.  They exploit smart people who join Air Watch from their Wandering Wifi division by paying them extremely low wages and use their lack of education as an excuse.
There is a reason why the moment the most talented people are leaving Air Watch at an alarming rate.
Don't be fooled when Air Watch claims to be one of the best companies or best paying companies.  That stat is all VMWare, Air Watch is nothing like VMWare...the only thing they share is a name."

- There is no interaction between the teams in AW, Dev's despise QA and they in turn despise PSO.
- If you are looking to learn more then PSO is not a team for you. Nobody encourages you to learn the whole stack but just enough knowledge to solve tickets.

6050,VMware,Disappointing,2015-05-26,2.0,Engineering Manager,"At the most basic level VMware really takes care of its employees. There are relatively few companies that can match what VMware offers with respect to standard and non-standard benefits. If you're good at what you do and are in a high-demand area you'll be rewarded with a very generous salary, bonus, and stock grants. The health benefits, vacation time, and access to high quality training, among other benefits, are truly top notch.  There are little things too, like assistance with medical costs for those having trouble conceiving. I love VMware for this type of stuff. Additionally, the Palo Alto campus where I'm located is truly in a league of its own. Anything you could possibly want, it's here. You want a top notch gym. It's here. Multiple cafeterias with various food types? It's here. On site dental and medical care? It's here. Pinball machines? Ping pong tables? Volley ball courts? All here. The list could go on. Pretty incredible.","Unfortunately despite all of the Pros I listed, the cons outweigh them for me, unfortunately.

I'll be leaving within the month.

In a nutshell there is a HUGE management problem at VMware. I've only started in the past 6 months so I came in with what I like to think is a fresh perspective. If you can, scroll through the past Glassdoor reviews and look for one titled “Looking back, VMware has some major problems” from November, 2014. It turned out to be very, very prescient for me. I remember reading it before I started and thinking, ""well, that's interesting."" It hits the nail so squarely on the head it's a bit eery. 

To summarize and add my own color to that review: There is a huge disconnect between the various levels of management at VMware and what you get from one high-level VP, may not match what the Director says, which may not match what your manager says. 

Very regularly I will have a Sr Director or VP bypass my own leader (a Director) and give me completely different priorities and instructions. You end up in a situation where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. And, just like in the movie Office Space, you find yourself telling the same thing to 3 different managers who are asking you to fill out your TPS reports correctly. I'm an engineering manager, my job is mostly spent sorting out politics and not leading a team of capable engineers.

Ultimately the problem really affects the individual contributors, the folks that really make it happen, who are left to sort out the mess. Not surprisingly, folks get and frustrated and leave. The turn-over rate, at least in my group, is depressing. 

It's impossible to retain the top talent that VMware desperately needs to stay relevant as the technology they've built the whole business on is quickly changing (containers, Amazon, etc). There are two main camps (maybe three) of folks who seem to stick it out:

(A) Those who are afraid to go outside of VMware because this is all they've become jaded and complacent. This has become all they know. The tell tale sign is you see them shopping online all day, reading facebook, etc.

(B) Those on visas or something similar from India/China/etc who don't have an easy path to moving to somewhere else or are only aware of this sort of big company culture. 

(C) The third camp of folks is the highest level executives, who are quite polished as you'd expect, they stick it out because they're not really exposed to what's going on at the lower levels and are likely oblivious, or don't really care. This is just a notch in their belt before they move on to their next executive position.

At the end of the day you're left with people who feel stuck (and are driven like rented mules to make up for the lack of quality engineers, eg working harder versus smarter) as they watch brief gusts of fresh air come by (new, smart, intelligent engineers) that quickly evacuate as soon as they get a hold of how things operate. 

It's a shame really. :-( I was so excited to be at VMware but it's time to go after only 6 months."

- Zero support for employee development.
- Managers do not work with each others. Each manager has his/her own political agenda. 
- Lower than average salary
- Crude products. Managers continue to emphasize qualities, but only verbally.
- The company always tout about the Trade Floor as an open and collaborative environment. Google trade floor and AirWatch. Anyone will tell you that you work in a factory farm, sweat shop or something. I see it as a major distraction. How do you expect people to work when others come over every 5 min.

- Management does not care of an employee's Salary unless and until he puts down his papers.
- Pure 'Chamchas' when i mean chamchas i mean it. yes they do exists and they are growing only becasue they nod their heads to their Leads/Managers.
- Leads/ Managers - Never test, never manage scrum , never test , few handle Customer tickets, Never know how to get job done from an employee in a good way. - Only to know to keep record of leaves and in-out timings. - Pathetic
- Freshers - seen some very talented freshers who have been given a wrong perspective of work. They feel lke coming out of college and joining school. Leave the place soon. 
- Salary - YOU are not paid what you are worth. People around may have more than what you are being paid. People under you will definitely have more than what you have.
- Employee benefits - Never ever gave any benefit apart from somethings. We even had to beg our managers to take us to a good resort and would end up paying for the transport ourselves. Paying half of the gym allowance makes them feel Google or microsoft all of a sudden.
- Senior Managers- Please Act before you loose everyone. throwing a google doc and collecting feedback is not the solution.
- Food - aap hi raklo yaar apna food. Seriously not even worth talking about.
- Gossips - Passionate people are present who are very interested in one's personal life and its gossips. Very popular Lead/manager speaks about the world. Another Manager who spends half of his time in cafe and on the phone is worried about the amount of time an employee spends in the pantry. I mean WOW!!

From my experience, I have applied for several internal positions, but was treated like an external individual trying to get into the company. No common courtesy for internal employees with the exception of one time. If VMware does not act quickly, employee retention will be very minimal. There is already high turnover in my department because of this.

As for my department, it is not aligned with VMware's EPIC2 values. No transparency, no work/life balance, no integrity, no sense of community, no trust and no flexibility. For the amount of stress and long hours that came with the role, the pay should compensate for that. The commute is tough so I wish there were more opportunities to work remote than once a month."

- This is not a US product based company. It is a Kannada product based company. People talk to each other in Kannada all the time.
- I have been in 3 organizations before this, and this has been the worst. I have never seen any organization with such pathetic, low class, uncultured, manner-less leads and managers in my entire life. Scolding and shouting at junior resources in a common scene here
- Support Engineers have taken up QA lead positions here and have spoiled the work environment entirely in QA. Nonetheless the QA team itself is useless so it doesn't matter much.
- I was sent onsite for 10 days (which is the max no. of days for any person in Airwatch) and had a terrible time reimbursing the expenses.
- HR team is entirely missing from the organization. They live in their own little world and don't even bother about what is going on within their company. They are not aware about HR policies, they don't encourage or do any employee engagement activities. Sending out - New Joiner, Lost & Found mails etc. is the only thing they know.
- VMWare leave policies was integrated way back with Airwatch, still the managers and HRs say that they have not been implemented yet. They force the employees to follow the old policies because it suits them.
- Coming to our Dev team, well, technology wise it is good. There something new to learn if you are in the right team. But the internal politics spoils the fun. And now a days the offshore team does only bug fixing and other support work
- Unhygienic and dirty cafeteria and washrooms.

Please search Airwatch in Google Play Store and see the review with your own eyes. You will get a clear picture about how much this product actually SUCKS !

Please don't join this company by looking at 3+ star reviews. These have been posted by the HRs using multiple fake IDs. They send out mails on a regular basis asking their employees to do the same.

Can have a short-term numbers focus at the expense of long-term success.  Can be bipolar with budgets--a lot of emergency cost-cutting, countered with bouts of ""hurry up and spend."""
6180,VMware,"Constantly evolving, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately awesome",2015-03-04,5.0,Manager,"The best thing about VMware in my opinion is that they are willing to invest in their employees. Rather than force you to hop jobs as is done so frequently in the Valley, VMware is much more willing to promote from within. There is a strong base of VMware ""lifers"" who are the pillars of the internal management team, and there is mentorship and success to be had if you have the right attitude. Work/life balance is excellent.","VMware has had a little too much ""evolving"" going on lately. Large scale and poorly planned shakeups have left some disillusioned or feeling rudderless. While this is hopefully all behind us, having seen major reorganizations happen several times in my tenure I do worry that it may continue."

But the cultural values in marketing communications, where I spent my days, are quantity and speed vs. quality of work and smart thinking. VMware seems to have a knack for hiring marketing people at the manager and director level who wouldn't know quality design or writing if they tripped over it -- which they don't often do, and sadly, they don't really care. Suggestions that would improve someone's pet project or initiative are routinely ignored.  People get favored and promoted owing to political skills more than anything else.

4. No variable pay. Initial compensation is good.","1. No onsite opportunities. Honestly, the on-site opportunities here are zero. There are a few developers who get once in a life time opportunity to travel to Atlanta - for 10 days.
2. Hygiene level is equivalent to that of a local railway station. Cafeteria stinks, the toilets are in very bad condition. The office carpets and desks are cleaned one in 2 weeks or so.
3.Food quality is pathetic. There is one North Indian and one South Indian vendor, both don't offer varieties. There is a juice counter which is worse than the lunch vendors. Omelettes prepared 2 days back are served along with the sandwiches.
4. Gives you a back to school feeling. You cannot raise your voice if u feel anything around you is wrong. The Dev managers are dictators and most of the QA managers are trying to be like him apart from a few. You cannot play TT or other recreation games before 5 p.m.
5. No work life balance for Dev. You are on call 24x7.
6. Hikes are delayed without any prior intimation.
7. The leave policies are integrated with VMWare's policy. Still the managers don't allow you to take leaves.
8. No work from home policy.
9. Regional language is used for communication within the office. People from other states - Beware !
10. There is no work in QA, still they are hiring people like sheep and cattle.
11. In house WiFi goes down frequently. This gives you a govt. bank like feeling, and creates a very good impression among the onshore team who are convinced that we are a backward country.
12. No room for innovation.

In the UK there seems to be a high attrition rate amongst sales and sales management. It looks as though the senior managers are immune so there is a lot of churn lower down.

6228,VMware,Mobile Device Management in the South East region,2015-01-27,4.0,QA Engineer II,"The People: a young and generally motivated workforce helps to drive innovation and keep day to day life interesting.

The Location: Convenient location in walking distance of a major light rail station, with company subsidization, as well as a prime spot at the intersection of two large roads helps keep the job in reach for employees living around Atlanta.

Change in Ownership: VMWare's purchase appears to have had largely positive affects with regards to benefits and employee pay. Additionally, the change has moved the company out of start-up mode, so instead of product-product-product, there is a shift going on towards quality that benefits employee well being.","The Management: The company leadership at the AirWatch level is still driven by a sales-first principle that keeps R&D from ever getting to work towards product quality. Pushing to change from the start-up 'land grab' thought process where market share is everything to a more established company's concern for providing quality to its customers will make employees, investors, and customers happy. We've got the market share, now lets make the product work right.

Support Organization Training: R&D is directly involved in day-to-day support, because the PSO/Support organization does not receive adequate training in the product prior to being thrown to the wolves. QA and Development resources are dedicated to what is essentially tier 4 support for entire product release cycles (which damages the quality of new code going out the door due to resource squeeze) on a per team basis, and there is a real sense that the R&D team is the end-all, be-all of where the buck stops for any issue. Given the nature of this belief in the company, support team members are not incentive to do any critical thinking or problem solving, as the solution to most customer issues is to push a ticket to the R&D team for support, after which they can offload responsibility for the issue. Better training for the support team would prevent the issue with R&D resource allocation (making the product better, making support less time consuming, etc.), and help provide better support to the customer.

Hiring Policies: Internally, there appears to be a feeling that quality can be driven by adding additional BA/PM team members to a scrum/product group, while having a sometimes 3:1 or 4:1 developer to QA ratio. QA is asked to certify releases with little to no real time to test the product fully, which results in quality loss (and employee frustration). Instead of trying to drive quality through development/PM, try to build teams with a more reasonable ratio (2:1 Dev to QA?), so that real quality can be a focus instead of a pipe-dream."

You have a young and dynamic team members working along with you who love exploring new technologies.
People who are passionate about IT and MDM have a great scope here.","A specific group of people talk in their native language and i can hardly get what they are discussing. 
And i get a feeling that the better chunk of work is given to the same group as well by the lead(who by the way belongs to the same set).
The HR team is of no use here. All the decisions are taken by only 2 people, both being spearheads of technology group.
The policies are not so great as far as work life balance is concerned. The work from home concept exists but only to a privileged few. They do encourage people in participating in Hackathons and patent filing and white paper submissions, but its made as a part of your goals rather than a self/team innovation and very much becomes a criteria for your hikes and promotion.
They look for a person to be in office and work 24hrs just be given an average rating.
After VMware acquisition, thought the policies would be changed, but there were no significant changes to benefit us. All we Indian employees get is to reimburse gym bills and got an upgrade on the referral bonus, no leave policy change(just 15 days of leaves), no so called VMWare employee perks showcased,nor did anyone come and let us know what policies are coming into effect.

VMware is very charitable and their actions prove it. All employees are given a certain amount of money they can donate to a charity of their choice each year. The work/life balance has been great, but it's also a bit of a con—it's only because no one is really ever in the office.","Working on an acquired product is painful. The team is currently unmotivated and has no morale, due to many factors. One huge one is VMware really didn't pay attention to the product until things got really bad and they had to step in. I don't know if it's the same working on one of the actual ""flagship"" products vs. a product from an acquisition. I am not an engineer but I have managers who just don't know how to manage non-engineers. If you're a designer, be very cautious of this place. When it comes to understanding of design, it's extremely painful having both PMs and engineers who have never worked with designers. And as for career growth, I actually don't see any here. Also, nepotism was a huge issue in our office! People with 1-2 years experience were put in senior positions simply because they were friends with the hiring manager.

- Atlanta office is in a nice location - accross the street from Marta and close to several stores, restaurants, and a mall
- Christmas parties are always awesome","- Management has, at times, had a micromanagement problem. It seems that they are afraid to trust their employees make good decisions. I will grant that this micromanagement may have been necessary at one point with a large amount of young and inexperienced employees, but now several experienced managers have been brought in and should be trusted in their decision making
- I found the open floor plan to be more distracting than helpful. It was often to difficult to work on tasks that required concentration due to constant distractions and interruptions.
- Policies are constantly changing. This is due to the large growth and acquistion that AirWatch has recently gone through, but it makes it very difficult to complete tasks when processes and policies change every two weeks
- Unrealistic timelines are often given to customers without first consulting with product teams on prior commitments and other timelines.

6290,VMware,"Managment, Agile, whats that?",2014-11-21,2.0,QA Engineer,"Your fellow coworkers are the best thing about this job.  You will make friends that will last a lifetime, but the only other thing is the casual environment.","This review is mainly for people looking to go into R&D at Airwatch but still applies to most of the company. 


The on-boarding is a week full of nonsense. It is 100% sales. How often will you need to give a sales pitch as a member of the R&D team? It would make a lot more sense if they tailored the training to one day of overall AW history, then Console basics, than finally your department. 

At Airwatch if you accept an offer for QA you do not decide where you will be placed. 

For example, If you have worked for Apple for 3 years and have a lot of experience debugging iOS applications, you will be placed on a windows mobile team. You are placed where you are needed not based on your strengths. Be prepared to move a lot too, after working on your first team, you will be relocated to another when half of their team decides they have had enough. 

You will be lucky however if you get one of the two actual competent managers for QA. 
Those two are active within their team and actually work, while the others sit around ""handing out tasks"" and try to come up with processes that will just make your life harder. 

In all honestly the R&D team is a tornado of 10 people actually working while the rest complain about how young their team is and that they are bored.  If you happen to be one of the people that work then you will not get any rewards or compensation aside from maybe a thank you from your customers support ticket . Their QA is about as flat as it gets. If you want to move up someone needs to leave and I can bet the person looking for the promotion will be the one to leave. 

That brings me to their attrition rate. ~50% of the people at AW have been with the company for less than a year. This is not because ""Our employees are learning so much that they move on."" It is because the management and amount of work are ridiculous for the ""compensation"" you will be getting. Turnover is high for a reason, and it is not a positive one. 

Workload is insane and unrealistic as many people on here have said. There is always some customer issue and YOU WILL be pulled away from your current task to work on it. That being said, you will be split across 1000 things to do and nobody will take that into account. You will have PMs jumping down your throat while your ""Lead"" will be giving you some made up task to validate their position. No one understands that you are being pulled in six different directions which causes you to have to stay late almost everyday.  It is not uncommon to have a 10+ hour day or to work on weekends while in QA. This would be fine if management put in the same amount of work.

You will be splitting work with the India team, but don't expect your lead to treat them like equals. For the Atlanta team, India is there to take blame when something isn't completed. They are not valued like they should be, much like most of the company.  

Huge lack of professionalism, you CAN NOT come gossip about how someone just had an awful interview and was ""a complete waste of my time, and a total idiot."" 

Management is the absolute worst part about this company. All they want to do is put their hands in as many cookie-jars as they can just so they can say ""I had a part in this.""  Office politics are at an all time high.  Most will not listen to their team for new processes or more efficient ways to do things. 

You will learn a lot don't get me wrong but here is the most likely scenario. 

You will probably work here for about a year, realize just how awful it is and then leave."

They encourage you to give to charities and will give you time to volunteer. Nice office environment it wasn't a bad atmosphere to work in.","It's a Call Center, supervisors / managers don't really care about your success, sink or swim, high turnover, If a customer doesn't like your answer they can D-Sat you for any reason valid or not. We were told not to ask the escalation engineers for assistance since they were too busy. We were told to ask our peers or google if we needed assistance. I knew as much or more than my peers so this was no help. The techs that had been there awhile are on the phone so they cant help. This leaves you hanging on the phone with no way to help the customer. You have to get an exception from a manager to leave for more than 5 minutes to use the restroom during your call queue. We supported non VMware equipment and was told to figure it out. If the issue was a blue coat proxy misconfiguration we had to figure out how to configure it on the fly whether you had experience with the product or not.

training. The onboarding is sales oriented, and after that you are basically thrown in the fire(tradefloor) and moved around to where they need a body. 

Once you are hired you are treated as a warm body, not an employee with skills and assets. They don't utilize employees' knowledge and experience effectively and QA is a flat organization, where 90% of people are only hired to do manual mobile app test, AKA press buttons on a phone. Most QAs are not gaining any useful technical skills through this experience.

Workload is insane and unrealistic. No work life balance. There is always some fire/customer issue that needs attention now. it is a joke to call R&D agile. 

A lot of un-professionalism,  where people talk crap about/to  each other, It is the result of giving a bunch of kids fancy titles and power. A lot of room for slacking, 10% of the QAs carry the wight of the department while the others come in and go as they please and goof around. No one is really tracked.

I actually had a manager say ""Be happy you have a job.""  Wow, that is encouraging!  Management was extremely top heavy, with not enough staff to handle the day-to-day business needs."
6299,VMware,Good company and work environment but old-fashioned.,2014-11-11,4.0,,"1. Work Life Balance - There is no pressure to work on weekends and after hours unless there is an emergency.
2. Good campus and work environment - The campus is really big, employees get their own space(cubicle or share an office). There are a lot of events that happen every week including a bi-weekly ""bash"", tech talks or celebrations of festivals/holidays. 
3. Good for people with families/kids - Halloween, Diwali, Chinese New year etc. are celebrated in grand fashion with a lot of activities for kids. Recently, a lot of musicians/bands/actors/speakers have also come to VMware and given talks/concerts.
4. CEO - The CEO(Pat Gelsinger) is an engineer at heart and knows how to execute well.","1. Slow professional/technical growth - The company is good for a new grad or staff engineers but anywhere in between is a very slow growth process. Too many managers who were bad engineers or not engineers at all means that there is too much talking but less doing. If you're looking 
2. Experience is very team specific - The core kernel/monitor teams have amazing engineers but the new teams who focus on management solutions have some really incompetent engineers - mostly JAVA shops. A lot of teams also have a bad junior:senior engineer ratio which means code quality and engineering process is low quality.
3. Old Fashioned - Almost everything VMware shouts old-fashioned. Engineers don't get laptops. For the new age of engineers who are used to working at off-times the lack of a laptops leads to a lack of productivity. The engineering processes are also very antiquated and resistant to change.
4. Too many re-orgs and management changes"

Awesome recruiting folks that have tried to write all the good reviews here :) One of the ex-recruiters even admitted to the fact that the management did not care or wanted them to write fake reviews regularly.","I was here 2-3 years from startup to now acquired mode. Things have gotten worst, absolutely no promotions within even if you might have worked & proved yourself. Only 2 people make decisions in R&D. They do not want to make any investment in your career ( ask them about how many people have gone to training or attended conferences etc, they tell you to attend it on your own time) 

Petty office politics makes the worst. All the good people in the company have left. Their attrition rate at this point is more than their growth rate. Most of the middle or senior management are sticking to their jobs since they do not want to loose their stocks/options so the quality is drastically going down.  

Surprisingly, office in India is treated as people who can work on bugs and small features, extremely sad and disappointing to see this kind of attitude towards an offshore development center. 

My peers who were not US citizens reported that they were required to pay for legal attorneys fees ($2,000 - $5,000) if they decide to apply for your work visa. They also use this as a leverage to get more work done. 

Product Managers and Sales try to crunch in features just because of 1 deal. Absolutely no vision in other products other than  their MDM one. It's a big ballon of crap and one day it is going to burst."

VMware has some really amazing technology and the products are fun to with.,"My advice to anyone who takes a role at VMware is to make sure you're happy doing that job for a long time because advancement opportunities are limited. The most frequent complaint I heard at VMware was lack of opportunity to grow in one's career.  That was true of me as well and the single biggest issue I pointed out on our yearly surveys. For whatever reason, the company usually fills open positions from the outside in most cases.

6329,VMware,On the Fence,2014-10-24,3.0,,"VMware has been an innovator in the valley for some time. They are transitioning from pure virtualization to becoming a cloud infrastructure company. They are no longer operating like a big start-up but aggressively adding operational process to set themselves up for success. Many executives have been there for a long time and seem committed to the company. For the most part, employees are still wildly passionate about their roles. The campus is nice - growing.","As the company grows, they are now hiring in lots of folks from other former powerhouse companies that seem to be changing the culture. While some people that re brought in are good, a lot of these people just seem like they're happy to do the same job they did before at  new location. Not a lot of enthusiasm. Lots of talk about where they used to work. The concern is whether VMware will remain strong or faulter by hiring a bunch of status quo people that do things the same old way. Not sure the innovation factor is still here. While some long time execs stay, some of the good ones are leaving. The turnover is natural, but when certain people leave, you start to wonder. The next two years will be telling. Career ladders are fairly non-existent. If you plan to get in, get the salary and title you want now. Moving up is rough once you get in."

There are some positives I found like limited micro management but this I believe also comes down to who your manager is. 

You can make some good money but this is now reducing year on year. 

If you are in the US it feels like a very different business. You can move around much more. 

I liked the US leadership and they do demonstrate some great qualities but these do not make it through to EMEA.","The core management in the UK have been with the company far too long. You are told you need to be able to deal with change..the only thing that does not change is the management. With this comes little upward mobility unless you are in the ""club"". If you are not in the ""club"" your options rapidly become very limited very quickly. However you are made every year to work on a personal development plan...not sure why as there is not no place to go and the only promotions I witnessed tended to be managers being promoted with the odd sales person being promoted only in title i.e. Major or senior. 

Much of your time will be spent dealing with some unbelievably crazy internal processes which are often manual and for a cloud leader somewhat unbelievable that they exist given the tools on the market today. Your internal admin skills will be welcomed here and I worked with some very good internal admin people...erm I mean sales people, Targets are set every 6 months if your in sales so if you are working on that OTE big deal the likelihood is that your target will be adjusted to accommodate this therefore making hitting you number even more unrealistic. 

Accounts will be moved up and down and away from you so again be prepared to be irritated here and thats before the US asks for any splits.

If you are going for an interview ask about attrition rates in the Enterprise Team and have them demonstrate exactly how many people actually make their quota annually...its not a high %. You will also find the hiring and interviewing process long and tedious especially when compared with their competitors."

- Flexible work hours.
- Code get reviewed before checked in. 
- Frequent employee survey, but managers know when the survey to be sent out and prepare ahead of time to treat his/her team well right before the survey. After the survey, things can go back to ugliness.","- Too many Indians in management levels. This leads to 80 or 90% of the developers that got hired are Indians. No racial diversity as you see at Google. 
- Not a quick hire and fire environment to get rid of low performers. Some can stay there rotten without contributing anything much. 
- Can have a lot of political flavors when products are merged and acquired. Not a good place for you if you don't like politics. Best ideas might not win because of politics. Your work can get wasted because of politics. It also depends on how your managers manage your team and control his people. 
- When a culture is bad, people might just follow their own interest without considering technical disciplines. 
- Too much work on some people while others don't do much.
- Bad planning at the management level. This can upset developers. A lot of chaos in some group.
- The best persons to do a particular task might not be chosen because there is no ownership. Best people might end up fixing bugs just because the wrong developers were chosen from the beginning. This can impact developer's motivation and performance.

Sr leadership, for the most part, are very engaging and approachable assuming you can get time with them.","VMware is still trying to figure out the best way to sell all the new technologies they're bringing to market which means it's still very chaotic. The sales organization went through two reorgs during the 10 months I was with the company, and my particular team's focus changed weekly, sometimes daily. I more or less spent my entire time with the company responding to fire drills which made it very difficult to add meaningful/lasting impact and value. 

I definitely can't say that's the case with every position or team; my role was newly created so realizing the implications of that was a learning experience for me. My position ended up being eliminated after 10 months which was frustrating as it takes that long just to get ramped up at this company, especially if you work in the field. 

Work-life balance is determined by your manager (mine was a known workaholic). The biggest widespread pain point I see is that the company continues to hire people in droves from outside the company instead of promoting from within, despite having a phenomenal crop of candidates within their salesforce. With so many people constantly being hired from outside the company, there isn't a prevailing culture so your experience will very much be determined by who you report to."

Work life balance is non-existent. 10 vacation days includes your sick days. Due to this policy, employees come sick to work and illness spreads rapidly during sick season.

Because the company grew so quickly they ended up with ""children"" in people Management positions. These people have no practical life experience which directly translates into not being able to manage their employees.

Management culture easily allows for  managers to be vindictive to their employees. No privacy for Human Resource matters. Management style will not change as any concerns expressed to HR are then immediately told to the manager and dismissed, leaving the employee in the crossfire and repercussions from their manager for expressing their concern.

Micromanaging has gotten to point that employees are spending more time filling out trackers than completing their daily tasks.

PTO tracking policies vary across departments. Some departments allow work from home while others say it's against company policy. 

Having attended multiple tradeshows at AirWatch, you are treated like a pledge member during fraternity rush by managers. Instead of being spoken to like a human, orders are barked at you like a dog.

6408,VMware,Great place to learn.,2014-08-16,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"In my previous company, I was sick and tired of politics, legacy code base, patchy software practices and a race against time to ""somehow"" deliver the software to customer. You would always wish to do the right thing, but wont simply have enough room to do so. To add to the pain further more, there were a bunch of managers who didn't have a clue about the code or the product.

Now, I was offered a job at Air-watch as a senior developer in R/D, I quit that organization with a sigh of relief. May be, because I have seen the 'dark side', I am in a position to appreciate the goodness here at Air-watch. At air-watch R/D, I quickly realized the following.
Pros:
	-- If you have a passion for programming, you have really interesting problems to solve.
	-- The only ""real"" process to follow is source control practices.
	-- The job requires you to have strong understanding of software engineering. To quote a few:
		- Networks and protocols
		- Cryptography (Asymmetric key and Symmetric key), Security and Authentication Models
		- Concepts on embedded storage options and remotely securing computing resources.
		- Mobility is at heart of all that is done.
	-- One has the time and space in the organization to spent on reading and research.
	-- Fairly large code base, which is ever increasing. There is no concept of customizing something special for the customer. Features gets added to the base product itself.
	-- Everyone codes, fresher to top level manager. Ultra flat organizational structure.
	-- New products and features are always in request. You really get to create stuff.
	-- Many a time, you get to work with programming veterans. For example, this year one of the senior most programming folks in the company flew in to deliver amazing series of lectures on programming concepts to freshers and senior folks.
         -- The team members are simply amazing. There is collective thought.

My share of rant:
	-- If you are not passionate about programming, air-watch R/D is not the right place to be. One need to be ready to read, try out code to strengthen one's understanding. If your priority is not software development in work hours, look for a a services organization elsewhere.
	-- Bad code puts a team in jeopardy - poor souls need to maintain the crappy software resulting from point above.
	-- you need not be a rocket scientist at all - All that is needed is solid basics in computing and a strong desire to learn more.","-- Yes, Yes, more salary will make me more happy!"

Not sure if this is worth the price of admission though :)  You need to make enough money to afford to have money taken out of your paycheck in order to set it aside for 6 months so you can buy company stock at a 15% discount.,"working in technical support does not provide a good view of this company, its policies, culture, or values.  I have read wonderful things about VMware as a company, I have not experienced any wonderful things.  I can attest to the fact that working in technical support would be tantamount to working in a completely different company - they do not share the same vision, values, culture and I am guessing management.

Upper Management leads by fear.  95% of employees are working their tails off and have (easily) 120 hours of work to do and are expected to get it all done without mistakes.  If you miss even the smallest thing you'll get ""do we need to replace you?""   

The software doesn't perform well enough to keep customers happy, and the services team is the scapegoat when there is a bug.  Ridiculous.  QA doesn't have enough time to do sufficient testing before a new version is released, but CEO insists on having the most features and functionality at the sacrifice of quality.  

If you decide to work here, you better have tough skin, be ready to be humiliated and condescended to while working 70-80 hours a week on a product that doesn't work consistently.

and I repeat, leadership is awful.  Here's hoping VMWare changes that, but being based in Silicon Valley I have little hope there will be any real changes, other than free drinks in the break room.

UK organisation trying hard on soft management areas such as work life balance.,"New layers of organisational complexity breeding politics, teams working at crossed-purposes, stifling bureaucracy.  Career development limited as new/replacement management recruited too much externally."
6476,VMware,Objective and Positive Review,2014-06-28,5.0,Systems Engineer,"1) Co-workers are all ""A"" players. The majority are driven, intelligent, proactive and extremely helpful. I have never once called someone (even out of the blue that may have never worked with me) and been made to feel as if I was a burden for reaching out. There is a culture of teamwork and ""customer first"". Everyone that I have interacted with appears aggressively on board with that.  That makes my life a lot easier. I have been in other positions where people protected their knowledge and operated almost like a mini-fiefdom, possibly for fear of job security. Not here
2) Senior leadership (thankfully) recognized long ago that vSphere cannot be the only core solution. Frankly, it is so widely adopted that it is only natural there would be declining new adoption.... simply because the market was saturated. In addition to core vSphere, our on-prem / off-prem cloud solutions and End User Compute portfolio is second to none and it will ensure that our position in the market remains dominant for years. 
3) Resources are plentiful. Initial on-boarding is absolutely fantastic and they provide cutting edge technology for new employees (ex. Powerful MacBooks, information resources, guides, etc). 
4) I work remotely, but I have been to their campuses and they are fully stocked with healthy options. There are also down time things like pinball machines, ping pong tables, quiet areas, etc. The main campus is unbelievable, and with pretty much any amenity you could ask for. I would consider relocating cross country just for the Palo Alto campus alone lol. 
5) Many companies talk about work/life balance, but VMware practices it. I am never pressured into situations that could negatively impact my personal quality of life. That said, there is work to be done. So as long as you can professionally manage your workload you will be given plenty of latitude to do what's best for your family and non-work life.  
6) This may not be the case for all, but my direct 1st and 2nd level management is the best I have EVER worked for. I get tremendous support to attack my work without unnecessary levels of micro management. On many occasions, they have made it clear to me that they are there to help me in any way they can. 
7) Considering I am a remote employee, I require an expense account. I do not have to deal with unnecessary levels of inspection. This isn't to say that there is free reign, but if I need to expense something to do my job it is rarely questioned. Just like any company though, we have a responsibility to the company/shareholders to be frugal when possible..... however I greatly appreciate not having to waste time pouring over every expense at length and providing extensive justification. 
8) There is literally an endless amount of content internally. It could be considered a con to some, as it would be impossible to consume it all. That said, there is always a resource to be drawn from if you need it. 
9) Working from home is awesome and greatly lends itself back to a nice work/life balance. There will frequently be times I need to hit my email / do prep and research after the typical 8 - 5. The trade off is that I can dictate my schedule and fit things in during the day I might have not been otherwise able to working from an office.
10) Compensation and benefits are fantastic. PERIOD...END OF STORY.

Tips for those considering employment here:

1) You may be the best VMware guru around in your current employment. Once you get here, be prepared to check any ego at the door. The people here are rock stars with our solutions. The sooner you do that the better. Just be prepared to take in all the information you can possibly process to make yourself a better resource.
2) Do not accept a job here if you aren't prepared to give 100%. As great as the resources and perks are, there are also big expectations from management. This is not the kind of job where you can ""coast"" in any sense of the word. It is part of what makes working with these people great. 
3) Take a deep breath, it may take months before you feel comfortable. You will feel like the dumbest person in the room for awhile.... don't let that discourage you.","1) The sheer volume of information that you may have to take in can be intimidating for some. We aren't just a vSphere shop, there are several dozen solutions and (at least in my role) you may be required to speak intelligently on all of them. This is both from a technical perspective and also from a strategic business perspective.
2) If you let it, you can consume every waking moment with work here. It is your responsibility to find the balance. Your management will back you on this as long as you are producing.
3) Just like any sales-driven company, there is intense pressure to meet quotas. This can also be intimidating for some.  
4) This company has thousands of people. As a result, networking is every bit as important as being a technical beast or exceeding your quota. Some people may find this difficult as it relates to job advancement. If you want to move up, you need to blend excellent job performance with excellent internal networking skills.
5) VMware changes rapidly internally. If you aren't adaptable, you may find the frequent changes frustrating. There is very much a ""start up"" type mentality here, despite the large head count (15,000+)."

The culture in Austin is bad.,Micro-management at its finest. It is and will drive all talent to other options.  The inside sales organization has been transformed from a demand generating business unit into nothing more than a call center. Austin management team is clueless and clearly in a self preservation mode to justify their existence.  Sales is pulled in so many different directions even the best and smartest are failing.  This no longer for true sales people.  It may be a great job for people that enjoy spinning 100s of plates and herding 100s of cats...

Also, the product is good, adequate training is available and the office is conveniently located. Finally, the company knows how to throw a party!  Seriously, the Christmas party and other celebrations should NOT be missed.","I saw the company grow from a start-up through the acquisition by VMWare. After 2 years, I had to leave or risk my psychological health. While there are a great number of ""cons"" (which I will list below) they all stem from the philosophy that intimidation, condescension and verbal abuse are the foundation of a Leadership strategy. AirWatch has some of the brightest minds in Atlanta working under their logo, however the employees are consistently told that their contributions are irrelevant to the business and leadership. The attitude that any employee, regardless of historical performance, could be easily replaced by a trained circus animal, tomorrow...stems from the top. Middle management tries to shield their employees from this hostility when possible, but if they want to keep their jobs the message must be delivered regularly. 
Cons - 
1. No work life balance.
2. Financial compensation well below industry standard
3. The benefit package (PTO, insurance, 401k) is a bad joke
4. Increased responsibility is ""awarded"" but never accompanied by a base pay raise.
5. Travel is required over weekends and holidays
6. Business changes are instituted without necessary consideration of consequences
7. Unprofessional management communication is common (yelling, condescension, dismissal of employees needs/concerns)
8. The ""Open office"" concept is taken to the extreme.

- promotions from within are rare

- poor diversity, many Palo Alto groups have more than 70 % South Asians, I wish I knew hindu
- from career prospective, not recommended to join on your own. Rule of thumb: 
10 years of experience + PhD == Senior Member of Technical Staff, when joining on your own.
fresh graduate == Staff Engineer, when coming through acquisition.
- Rumor / urban legend goes that some groups used to put their junior members in turtle's pond, as part of some initiation process. It was swept under the carpet by HR. Once again, it's rumor, but why somebody will make up such rumors?

The entire sales force is confined to one floor of a 5 story building and therefore everyone is stacked 3 people to a cube. There is literally someone right next to you. I mean you sometimes will bump chairs they are so close to you. Also, the only department here in town is inside sales so there is not much room for growth in your career. All the good positions are in Palo Alto where VMware was founded and the main office is. The environment in Palo Alto is awesome and super high tech but the Austin office is just a call center with cubes everywhere.

You have to work your pipeline, etc., If you are expecting to sit at a desk, skate by, and do as little work as possible for not a minute over 40 hours per week, AirWatch is definitely not the company for you. Those people flounder and eventually fail, and blame the company.

There are definitely more training sessions, etc., than many would like, and at times they can feel like detractors from a productive work day.

Operations teams are treated like dirt with only R&D being given importance. OPs managers haven't got a clue and you survive and grow only if you are their friend. Horrible recruitment policy with rules/criteria being bent as a manager wishes and the HR team is almost invisible. NO employee handbook even after so many years in existence tells you the story.

The opportunity to make great money is available at the top levels. There are some very nice people outside the management.","Traffic around this place will make you very angry. The vacation package is essentially a joke. The commission structure isn't anywhere close to the best in the industry. The lack of a work from home scenario seems at odds with the image of a modern tech company. The Micromanagement starts at the top and the CEO doesn't seem to know that a positive work/life balance is important. This is NOT a 9 to 5 job and you can forget about having any meaningful success if you aren't willing to work overtime. For example, they told me that the hours are 8:30 to 5:30 however it's really 8:30 to 6 and you can expect to be judged for leaving on time on a consistent basis. The worst example was by far their handling of the snow that recently fell, they were more than willing to let employees risk their safety for the sake of productivity even though working at home could be accomplished quite easily."

They switch our territories and regions and dont let us keep any of the accounts we spent so much time on. The CEO is awful and no one wants to get promoted so you become in his line of vision. This is a total bait and switch. If you are young and straight out of school it is great. The recruiters inflate how much we are going to make, and the length of the sales cycle. DO NOT WORK HERE."

They are very good about helping employees grow, and having many opportunities.  Every year, they had a great internal conference called Radio, where any employee could submit papers on ideas or things they were working on.  Then, a huge portion of the engineers at the company would get together for a conference where the best papers were presented and Sr. Management would talk a bit about strategy and what our customers were looking for.

I've never been at a company that had an internal innovation conference as great as Radio.  Really made me feel that VMware was willing to invest in their engineers and investing in staying cutting edge.","The main ""CONs"" I saw were that several of the divisions that were not the core products had problems creating a cohesive product portfolio.  You can see it by looking at the large number of products VMware has.  

There was a bunch of effort to change that when I was there and create better suites of products, but I felt there was a lot of good work that was not getting as much leverage as it could because Team A and Team B weren't thinking about their work as being part of the same cohesive story."

* Very slow promotion process, easier to get promoted by leaving. also very minimal pay increase year over year - 3-5%.
* Instead of being driven by customer needs, Market disruption or senior management, VMware is an engineering led company, and its direction is set by the engineers. this is great for short term delivery, but hurts the company's ability to compete and makes it play catch up.
* Company long term direction is unclear. it seems VMware like Microsoft has missed the SaaS and Public cloud revolution and is heavily dependent on legacy data center sales. 
* Same as Microsoft, VMware has strong brand in enterprise IT with high prces, making it the less popular choice for openstack and AWS/Google/ public cloud users.

Mostly from the 'entrenched' employees (5+ years at the company).   People literally go to your manager and complain about things they easily could handle directly with you.

Current one seems to enjoy drama too, though is a nicer person.   Has a second-in-command that runs the show to his own liking, literally adding and subtracting people from the group meeting calendar on a weekly basis depending on whether he's ticked off at you or not.

6677,VMware,My favorite company in 12 years of consulting-- delighted to have joined full time.,2013-11-22,5.0,Senior Manager Change Management,"Awesome people. Great collaboration with a minimal amount of bureaucracy. You can really dive in, roll up your sleeves and get things done quickly. I feel like I can be about 3X more productive at VMware than other places because theres' less politics. Having worked at a wide variety (15 or so) companies outside of Silicon Valley, I find that I LOVE working in high tech at VMware. I feel like I'm getting smarter and learning from my colleagues every day, rather than getting stuck in a morass of politics and 'wait and see' like at many other places.

I like the company's admirable green practices and charitable program (5 days of paid volunteer work annually, very good and flexible match program, etc.). 

The campus is beautiful (larger than disneyland, riddled with fountains and orchards, buildings are designed by some famous green architect and they are kind of hyrbrid indoor/outdoor), there are multiple delicious cafeterias and coffee shops around campus, good free snacks program if you're based in Palo Alto, restaurant-grade espresso machines in every breakroom so I'm fueled up on about 2-3 lattes a day, etc.

The head people person in our roll-on iday  said it well when she said that VMware works hard to keep the 'heart of a startup'. As a 4.5 billion $$ company, of course it's a lot bigger than a start up, but I think there's a really good opportunity to build tools, structure and process to enable the next stage of growth from 4 B - 8 B and I'm psyched to be a part of it.

These impressions are based on having been a consultant at VMware for 18 months and now a full time employee for 3 weeks.","As with many exciting, high energy jobs, you need to manage your work life balance and there can be tough times. So far, VMware has been great in this regard, but I think that's always a watchpoint when you're in a high adrenaline, high performing place. 

The other challenge is that VMware can be chaotic, so you need to have a good ability to navigate and figure things out on your own and teach yourself how to fish. We are in the middle of streamlining and simplifying our strategy and internal tools and processes, but things can still be pretty casual and not necessarily that well defined."

Its cash piles and central pivot point in the world of IT has afforded it that.  Stacked full of server and Data Centre talent it can go after this and isnt afraid to take on Cisco, etc.","The side on businesses are truly terrible at being integrated into the field and VMware needs to learn form IBM in the 90s about competing field teams and how it sets up those teams and manages them.   The relentless focus on numbers means that the teams become very inwards focused on doing their thing and the company isn't terribly good at selling one VMware to customers.  Senior management need to focus on this area.
In the engineering space the company has two awesome products and a number of products in waiting.  The spin off of excess products has started and needs to continue so that the engineering talent can be spread less thinly.  there has been an issue in getting quality product out to customers outside of the core areas.
As a place to work it was fantastic, but career development needs to improve so people can see where they will grow more."

A lot of opportunities and interesting projects to work on as VMware takes the idea of virtualization to the entire data center.

- Currently, in the midst of an exodus of great talent from Steve Harrod, Bogamil, as well as middle management. The smartest leaders are leaving...but it doesn't stop there. VMware is losing the most talented engineers to start-ups and other corperations (IMO) because innovation has dried up. Engineers are tired of integrating software and want to get back to building fresh ideas."

I was wrong. There are some excellent employees with great ideas all over the company but they soon get the spirit ground out of them. And as the market dictates, it's the good employees who can - and do - leave. Decisions are overturned on a whim with the decision makers claiming no memory of making them (which is an indescribably confusing experience when you have the approval in writing or were present for it verbally. Because of this you are forced to defend yourself for literally doing your job.  Communication is not just poor it's frowned upon, there is not an open door policy and you may not speak to whoever you need to. Bullies abound and it's the epitome of a toxic workplace. It's proudly claimed that VMware is a 15 year old start up but what that really means is there are leaders and employees left who haven't scaled to fit the reality of a 14,000 employee company, and thinking you don't need to scale is delusional.

-The vision is amazing and inspiring.  If you need to be inspired by a company's strategy, this is a good opportunity.  The execution is still catching up to the vision but it is truly impressive.
-Positive culture.  Healthy lifestyle is encouraged here, as is work-life balance and I really do believe that it is not just lip service.  They will pay your gym membership.","-The company is transitioning from being a rising star to being the next Oracle or Microsoft. As management has changed to Pat Gelsinger's team, the company has come to resemble EMC even more and is more execution driven than vision driven.  Because we are typecast as ""just"" a hypervisor company, it is very difficult to sell what VMware now does to customers who are less than progressively minded from an IT perspective.  When people think, ""Oh, VMware must be easy to sell"" they do not realize that the hypervisor and core platform is commoditized and the only way to make any significant sales is to have a customer that understands the cloud computing journey VMware is evangelizing and buys the adjacent products, etc.
-Quotas are completely out of control.  The norm the entire time I have been there is missing your quota.  As long as you are clearly doing your job, etc, this doesn't seem to result in imminent firing your life as a sales rep will always be behind the 8 ball or subject to the 6 month quota cycle.
-VMware has been in an ""awkward adolescence"" period for as long as I can remember.  Systems, procedures, etc don't always make sense, and the certain key processes that matter to customers are completely broken.  These will hurt your sales efforts.

This last piece is not necessarily a con, but many of the experienced team members are moving out of individual contributor roles to management or more interesting roles or leaving.  This is more a sign that the company is in a state of transition and existing players are moving up or moving out.  If you enjoy working for a large, strategic player a la HP, Oracle, Microsoft, then you may like this transition.  If you are looking for a large company that still has that fresh startup positivity then you may find yourself out of place here."

They are just bad. HR are puppets. They will promise you a good progression path when they interview you, then you will become a number the day you start. HR will have absolutely no shame admitting you are a number.  If you see a lot of job offers, do not believe it is becasue the company is expanding: it is just because there is a huge turnover in the workforce. 

VMware is not an IT company. VMware does finance, and you are way too expensive so they dont pay commissions. VMware will change your commission plan without your agreement, or even decide you should not be paid on some orders if they suddenly consider they are  too big for you to be responsible for anything. Your manager will have the comissions, not you. 

Poor work/life balance: whatever you do is just never enough. VMware does not care about customers, does not care about employees: VMware cares about money, period. Employees are not mentioned in the VMware core values, so it says a lot about what they think of you. You are disposable and that is just good enough. 

You will evolve in a .XLS environment with a lot of micro management and threats of personal improvement plans. Management gets close friend with HR to cover their ass. They will only interview you because they cant get everything relocated to India yet.

Way too many features planned for any particular release, which stretches engineering (and testing) thin and leads to bugs too late in the development cycle."

Interaction within teams is very good and for the most part there is a lot of bright and talented individual contributors.  VMware also does a lot for the community and in the spirit of Paul Maritz believes in ""giving back more than you take"".  VMware is attempting to get back to a lean and mean state but it might be to little to late as the competition is becoming fierce in the Cloud and Software Defined Data Center arena.  The current CEO was brought in to help right and repoint the ship,  the outcome of that is still unfolding.","Organization is very siloed.  Large organization mentality is setting in.    Room for growth is non-existant,  feedback from management is also zero.   As an organization VMware has lost its agility as it has grown (almost to a debilitating point)  and at the same time not reinvested in its systems and framework for a growing organization.  This creates a poor environment to actually get anything done.

People are leaving because they are underpaid or they found something more interesting to do.
The place wast turned upside down with the big focus on metrics and Csats. A TSE is someone who has to take calls, close a minimum of x cases per day and at the end of the day, will also have to keep customers happy (while most of times there is no proper training for new or existing products).

I have been there for a very long time and everyday its a challenge for survival.
The Management is very ruthless and is never employee centric.
VMware as a cloud company has a good name, but it has a very bad setup of infrastructure.

Pathetic middle managers who are technically inept, political and interested in advancing their own careers.
Senior management doesn't seem interested in making any real improvements.
Top talent has left already."
6828,VMware,Just Another Big Enterprise Software Company,2013-04-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"By working in R&D you get insight into how a computer works.  There's a diverse array of software to work on, from low-level coding to UIs to website development.  The core visualization groups can be a good place for a new college grad to develop good software development practices.","There was a bulk exodus of R&D in 2011 when the equity grants from VMware's founding CEO finished vesting.  That founding CEO was replaced with a new CEO that could offer a vision for the future, but no plan to execute on it (nor a plan to ""re-green"" people, probably because he came from Seattle and wasn't used to the high degree of mobility offered by Silicon Valley).  He also couldn't be bothered with running a company and hired others to do it.  In 2012 VMware spent $1.25B on Nicira, in effect buying back some of the people that left in or before 2011.  Shortly after he resigned at his 4 year anniversary and cashed out $26M in equity--since Nicira was funded in part by his predecessor that suggests he didn't have a superior vision after all.

His replacement (the current CEO) is more geared towards running a company but hasn't done much from a leadership perspective besides jettison the web companies that VMware acquired under his predecessor's leadership.  In the meantime R&D has continued to bleed the little talent it has left while replacing them with lesser talent (at least when permitted by headcount restrictions), thus resulting in yet another big software company that has a lot of people who know little and accomplish even less.  This 2011 bleed likely contributed to vSphere 5.1 being the ""Windows Vista"" of virtualization releases, and it's likely to contribute to the next release being the equivalent of ""Windows 8"".  The ""Principle Engineers"" that remain are less ambitious and don't seem to do much (and certainly don't set a good example or tone for the rest of R&D).  The company has taken various surveys to find out how unhappy people are but never took any steps to determine the underlying reasons why or address them.  The newer hires try to deal with the post-apocalyptic R&D that offers little in terms of guidance, a high count of bugs to fix and burdensome processes that have been put in place to try to avoid bad code check-ins."

There is little development of employees even though they have tried to recognize the need over the past year in small, ineffective ways. It is a cultural shift that will have to take place to make real change. 

Remote employees are usually very isolated. Unfortunately, the layoff of 900 individuals on 1/31/2013 was an enormous shock for those outside of corporate. Instead of transitioning employees or offering other roles first before laying people off, those let go were told that VMware would be reshaping roles and would have 1000 new jobs announced in early 2013 that these employees should apply for. It seems that if this had been less of a knee-jerk reaction and more of a well-thought out shift, they could've prevented job loss, kept higher morale and current employees would not be drowning with work due to less headcount and absorbing the jobs of others. Work/life balance is suffering now for remaining employees as a result."

Smart people across the board - this can be a shock for many and in some ways it's like being a pro football player - most of these people were the smartest kids in their high school, then went on to be one of the smartest people in a top five school, and when they get to VMWare, they are considered average (or maybe slightly above average) because EVERYONE is so smart.

Too Much Politics - I was personally threatened by a SVP for providing review feedback on a Development Manager which was unflattering (she had zero compassion for the QA team and wanted them to work 60 hr weeks for more then a month keep the original unrealistic date that she had given).

Infrastructure has a very startup feel to it, even though the company is more than 10 years old.  

The company recently changed from an industry-standard vacation accrual system to a system in which each employee has as much vacation as negotiated with their manager. This will actually be a ""pro"" for any employee with a good manager and who's put in a lot of effort into building a relationship with the manager.... but the change caused a lot of anxiety, and the implementation was perceived as not very transparent.

The annual internal innovation event is a great opportunity to interact with people across the company and take the time away from our jobs to come up with the next big thing.  
There are some truly fantastic managers who understand people management, project management, and the VMware business.  
There is room and support for career growth.  
The salary is good.  Annual raises, bonuses, and stock are very good.","The annual release cycle doesn't meet anyone's needs. We can't make big bets because they don't fit into an annual release release, which means that we can't deliver enough value to justify an annual release.  
There's a new fire drill that requires a drastic re-plan every few weeks, which impacts morale and leaves the impression that senior management doesn't know what it's doing.  
QA is perennially understaffed, which makes the annual release cycle more difficult.  
Our customers don't want annual releases.  We're not investing in our architecture or scalability, which leaves us vulnerable.  
The benefits are okay, but not as good as other companies.  The 401k and charitable giving matches do not match local companies."

- promises of technical career progression don't seem too promising: Sr Staff and above seem dominated by old-timers and acquirees; little potential for organic promotion

No stress on product knowledge, nor any care toward actual productivity, but rather the appearance of productivity. Contests and incentives drive the floor and hinder any account management, as the push is to accrue ""tally-marks"" to win money, instead of discover, qualify, and develop legitimate sales opportunities. 
Unrealistic quotas for the territories-- which directly affects income. Management shrugged off the issue with a half-hearted apology. For territories that suffered from last year's hurricanes- no exceptions or acknowledgements were made regarding earning abilities/quota adjustments.
Too much emphasis on floor ranking (also heavily weighted on contests and call statistics), it's a determining factor in career advancement and firing/layoffs. Some people appear to have been set up for promotion instead of earning it. Days are spent being monitored, judged, tallied, and ranked."

--No-one even care about the interview feedback; forget that, they done even care if the interview feedback is not even submitted. All of interview process is just for showoff..decisions are based on completely different parameters. if you do not have a 'godfather' , dont even consider applying for a job here.
3. Major lax in transparency. Management in HQ do not have visibility of ground reality in remote sites.

Employees are not challenged to excel, and those that do excel are given zero recognition or even thanks."
