13,Vans,Assistant Store Manager,2022-04-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great work environment, great products, and mission statement. Vans as a brand had great representation and good people that help support you. It can differ with some of the Store/District/Regional Managers but some of the ones I've worked with have definitely helped me throughout my time here.","In my time, I'd say some of the biggest cons are the unreachable targets set by the company. Meeting these unreachable targets allows us to earn the payroll needed to give some of these associates and others the appropriate hours allocated to complete daily tasks such as shipment, floorset, shipping orders, and etc. Some of which are heavily dependent on traffic which is out of our control especially going into the post-holiday season. Work-life balance is pretty bad since there is no consistent schedule as there is with any retail environment. Must work two years minimum before advancing into a new role."

29,Vans,Great first-time or casual job,2022-03-29,5.0,Retail Sales Associate,"Management takes people's schedules and needs into consideration, and are accommodating. It's a great place to work at and the discounts are great if you're a core associate, but still nice if you're seasonal. It's also pretty easy to move between entry positions simply by asking. This jobs is great for college students or those who don't mind working a few hours a week while pursuing whatever it is they want to pursue.","You're only scheduled based on how good your sales are, and they will send people home early if the store isn't meeting daily goals. Don't be surprised if you only end up working even 1 hour because customers aren't buying anything and they over-scheduled. Also keep in mind, full-time is almost non-existent and working over 20 hours is only possible for full-timers or people that take every shift possible."

40,Vans,Inclusive,2022-03-23,4.0,Retail Sales Associate,"Vans is a very inclusive workspace, at least at the location I work out of. They take the time to train you on equality, privilege, and empathy. The people you work with are beyond co-workers, they are like friends in many aspects. I have GAD and depression and they have been very accommodating and caring around my mental health.","The technology is a pain. The wire management at our store is terrible and the computers for the registers are so outdated that I am waiting for both of them to just stop working. Our registers act up a lot and selling gift cards is a hassle (you have to walk around to the card reader to scan the gift card, but the reader is very particular about how you scan the cards and which cards you scan, very annoying). Not to mention we have to meet a quota for Square usage. It would frankly be easier for VF to give us brand new registers that are Square registers. Even one of the district managers commented on how bad our technology at the store was."

50,Vans,Pretty good,2022-03-18,5.0,Store Associate,I liked management and coworkers,Pay was a little low but I know they have raised it to 14 an hour since I have left
51,Vans,"Great Company, Terrible Management",2022-03-18,3.0,Assistant Store Manager,"Company is great, takes care of it's people, both emotional and physical well being.
Culture is very people oriented.","Information is frequently relayed on a very last minute basis, thus creating additional stress to the staff. 
e.g. tomorrow storewide promotion, today info is passed on to the SICs. however management already knew of this days ago. 
e.g. store received stocks not allocated, info is only updated and passed on after stocks has been received.

-Management is a Yes man to almost everyone in the higher management, this creates alot of confusion in direction for the team. 
-Management is also unable to provide assurance to the team with regards to their career development and future in the company. 
-Management has no business acumen which leads to frequent unproductive SIC Meetings.
-Management has no sales floor experience.
-Many staff have left under management’s leadership due to various reason, namely a few mentioned above. 
-Management always ask for feedback, but no follow up on what has been done to resolve or better an issue, end up seeing no changes.
-Management is unable to provide a concrete answer to our doubts with regards to operational matters, often leaving us to resolve by our own means."
52,Vans,Worst retail I’ve ever worked,2022-03-17,1.0,ASM- Assistant Store Manager,"If you’re full time you get all benefits, as well as 40 hours a week.","they don’t take HR seriously, they have management that shouldn’t even be in management, they make it into a hostile environment. I’ve worked retail for 15 years and this is by far one of the worst “people” company’s I’ve ever worked for. They only see associates and management as numbers. As well as them not doing anything about harassment cases. They pretend like nothing has ever happened and people are too “sensitive.” I wouldn’t recommend anyone unless you want your mental health destroyed."

Instead, a bully was sent to our store for the manager position, which caused generalized demotivation. 

Our assistant manager (someone the whole store respected and expected to see as new manager) was transferred so our bully-manager could bring their best friend over to our store as new assistant-bully-manager.

106,Vans,What does 7 years amount to at Vans?,2022-02-13,2.0,ASM- Assistant Store Manager,"Great employees, some of the most unique and inspiring individuals I've ever had the pleasure of working with. 

Experience. I've learned a lot about what I want from a company, my management style, what I respect and don't respect in a company.","Horrible pay. 7 years of hard work and dedication - blood, sweat and tears at Vans in the Utah market amounts to $15.80/hr. This is among several store transfers – high volume and low volume, two college degrees and years of loyalty to the brand. Two weeks after I left my position, Vans upped their associate base pay to $14.00/hr. I've never felt so under-appreciated by a company.

There are people in management who truly have no idea what it takes to be a leader. Vans hires people that look good on paper, but are horrible at face-value. It is a very political game, too. It is a rat-race, though corporate won't even consider hiring internal store-level employees that have years of experience and want to work.

There are far more cons than there are pros working at Vans."

The executive team is ineffective and people get promoted at the highest level based on politics, not skill or accomplishments. I didn’t realize until I left how slowly everything moves there. 10 alignment meetings are needed to make a simple decision. This is directly related to the toxic politics at the top. Very little thought is given to what is right for the brand, it’s basically every executive looking out for themselves. 

There’s also a sense of entitlement and lack of humility that permeates the brand. They are no longer relevant and it’s because everyone there believes their own hype. I do t see this turning around without major changes at the top."

184,Vans,Read this before you interview for an Ecommerce Role at Vans,2021-12-27,3.0,ECommerce Specialist,A great place for liberals - Vans is a very liberal minded place to work. If you have views other than that of the management either politically or personally you may want to keep them to yourself. I believe the company is still partially remote so you won't be able to take advantage of the on-site barista - which is a plus when the company shifts back to the office in 2022 (likely).,"If you are ambitious and looking to work for leadership that both motivates and enables you, the Ecommerce team at Vans (US HQ) isn't for you. There are good people that work within, but generally speaking, the Ecommerce department is stagnated by exec leadership who have been with the company for a long time. They hire from the outside for senior and director roles about 80% of the time and don't invest in bringing many people along for the ride - well unless you are a ""yes"" man/ woman (aka agree with everything the upper mgmt says). The ecom employees that survive are the ones that the higher ups like and fit in with their version of the Vans ""culture"". That version is basically, ""do what I say"". Ironically, the Vans motto is ""creative expression"". Over the years, I watched some of the nicest/ most intelligent people leave the department because of the political favoritism that exists. If you are ok with working with the intent to follow a pre-conceived agenda purely for the sake of looking good in an easily ""executive"" digestible PPT, then this place is for you. If you care more for the customer, learning from your leader and those around you, then do not proceed with an interview in this dept. Vans seemingly is sold as a ""cool"" place to work but end of the day, it's just another corporation. They aren't your ""Family"", and when you decide to leave, they pretty much say adios, nice to know ya."
185,Vans,Good culture,2021-12-21,4.0,Team Member,Everyone is super friendly and the overall culture is very young and hip.,Can be stressful at times and not enough support from management

188,Vans,"Corporate is alright but the stores themselves, well...not ALL are welcome.",2021-12-21,2.0,Assistant Store Manager,"Far more business minded at the Corporate Office than you might expect at Vans, but I found that reassuring. The people at corporate with whom I dealt seemed very friendly. We were taken care of during quarantine. I am very grateful for that.","I did not work at Corporate.

Let's just say that if you don't fit certain demographics in your store, prepare yourself for a challenge. The claims of inclusion begin to ring rather hollow when the attitudes resemble those more suitable for high school. Any attempts to highlight or address these issues with upper management were promptly swept under the rug or blatantly ignored. Precisely why I left."

192,Vans,Long term employees undervalued,2021-12-14,2.0,Assistant Manager,"Higher paying retailer, depending on your store/manager flexible schedule in most positions, good discount.","Not COVID safe we had employees put others at risk after testing positive for covid and were never let go after signing agreement that you wouldn't come to work unmasked if your not vaccinated. Many long term employees left for feeling unsafe and unsupported, with no concern from upper management. Hostile work environment that can go unreported and if reported you get retaliation even though they have a ""zero"" tolerance policy. Unequal pay that is based on favoritism."

Big ego for no reason. 
All leadership consists of insecure white men especially creative services and production. 
No opportunities for people actually doing the work. 
People will threaten you to not talk to HR. 
Even if you talk to HR they won’t care about you.
Leadership doesn’t take mental health seriously and will make fun of it.
Racism and sexism is very real in the corporate office. 
No team work everyone is just looking
Out for themselves.
All the good people eventually quit because it’s not worth it. 
Low pay and unfair compensation.

Lots of great people although lately dropping like flies. 

FYI the previous review is relevant beyond the Creative Department!!!","Leadership is a fraternity and largely made up of legacy leaders when the brand has outgrown them. They’re too focused on managing up and looking good, and not listening to and supporting the high performers who manage the majority of the workload. 

A lot of tone def actions and messaging regarding turnover, gender equality, and racial diversity. Despite what might be consumer facing. 

Morale is bad, and getting worse by the day. 

Business is also bad and the incompetent leaders are making many short term decisions to drive revenue that will impede the brands long term success."

This has cause huge issues and there has been a pretty big exiting of some great people in this past year alone. Its unfortunate that you have people making decisions for teams when they do not even work closely with their department. Vans will continue to lose great people to other companies because of the structure of how the executive team interacts with there respective teams.

While I did have the help of a supportive leadership, This did not do much to lower my stress during the daily operations of running a store, in an outlet mall, during a pandemic.

This became difficult with non-compliant clientele where you were not able to do much other than make suggestions to wear masks while in-store.

After all, the main job was to also to help clientele with making a purchase of Vans product and keeping that product clean for presentation.

Vans is owned by VF, a big corporation that owns other brands such as Nautica, Timberland, North Face and others - your 50% employee discount applies to all these stores as well including outlets.
You most likely will get your hours so don't worry about that.
Great job if you are in college and just need a job to make some extra money. Keep it in mind tho that if you are like relying on this job to survive, forget about it.
Benefits for full-time employees aren't bad.","Because so many young folks want to work at Vans because they think that it would be 'awesome', Vans (knowing that) pays the bare minimum and yearly raises aren't all that great. One time, as a store manager, I had to tell one of your stock associates that she would be getting a $0.09c raise. Luckily we were all very friendly so we just laughed about it in the backroom.
Pay for sales associates (entry jobs) is minimum wage and they could be paying store managers a little better. I knew other store managers working for different companies making considerably more than what I was making. I was making 'ok' money for California standards but again, it is California! It is expensive to live here.

Coworkers have always been friendly and I've built many lasting friendships over the time working with Vans.,"The pay is a big thing that has effected me. With no raises, minimal hours, and minimum wage, it's not a job you'd be able to live off of just being a sales associate. Of course some of the customers that come in will give you a hard time, but that just life in retail. There are always going to be angry customers occasionally, but it's all about how you treat them. The management could use some work, as my scheduling has been messed up numerous times, and there isn't much communication about changes to the store or policy unless you ask. Some managers do go out of their way to tell you which is very nice."

Not to mention the pay is insulting for management, you will only make $1-2 more than your associates. This company is tone deaf, during the COVID pandemic we were called to a zoom meeting thinking the company would be addressing the horrendous treatment by customers the retail team had been enduring since they decided to force employees to return to work.

• Great 401k match
• Big name looks good on your resume
• In general, people are nice","*can only speak for the creative department, other departments may be better*

• Leadership is a joke -- they let slackers get away with minimal work and overwork people who are good at their jobs. If you provide thoughtful work, you will be given more and more responsibilities while slackers literally go MISSING for days. Unfortunately even ""good"" managers are surpassed under this leadership, so even if you love your boss, their boss or director will block your career aspirations.

• Minimal career trajectory -- unless you're a traditional art director working on ""big"" campaigns, there's little to no career trajectory for you. You can lead processes, teams, do work that provides BILLIONS of revenue to the company but you'll always be seen as a pixel pusher that should work under an old and outdated art director. (Oh, and when you finally leave, only then will they elevate your role to manager or split it into 2 roles because they realize you do so much.)

• Boys Club Culture –- there is a boy's club culture that stems all the way from the president Doug and onto the VPs. This culture is about who's ""cool"" (do you skate? do you surf? are you a bro?) and not about who takes their work and deadlines seriously."

Brutal retail scheduling, not as bad as big box store hours but still bad. Unless you have a great SM (you probably won’t) that knows how to schedule and hire.

The illusion of upward mobility. Corporate talks a big game and has training plans on paper, but they will fall short of meeting the terms of your employment agreement. That goes for raises and for promotion opportunity. 

Outside talent gets paid more than homegrown.

Lying about sale incentives result in increase hours, in actuality they impose a strict 20 hour work week limit to anyone who’s not a manager. Awful turnover, due to favoritism from management. A clear and stark push to credit management, belittling to entry level employees. Degrading, that they bought out supreme for 2 billion and have done little to nothing to help employees in the most sensitive time of the pandemic. No commission, but dramatic expectations for you to continue unrealistic sale goals. They expect you to go above and beyond but refuse to offer the same for sales associates.

This company not only was a blast to work for but I felt fairly compensated for my time— I made more with better benefits as an ASM here than I did working as a SM for another company. The fact that they pay their employees well made it easier to find good staff which any retail manager knows is the biggest obstacle to running a store well. I only had to leave this job due to health issues, otherwise I would still be working for Vans with the intention of making it my career.","There are very high expectations for meeting sales goals and metrics and if you aren’t hitting those expectations consistently then plan on getting called out for it— in my experience it was always constructive criticism, but I can see it bothering other people. If you can’t work in a high-pressure environment and juggle tasking, managing associates, maintaining LP best practices, and customer service all at the same time then this is not the right job for you."

- You learn a lot about yourself. You grow in so many different ways.
- The culture. The history. It's not just about a simple pair of shoes on a shelf.... there's a story behind EVERYTHING.
- The discount.... duh.","- The hours...... man. Shifts tend to be 4 hours. As a sales associate, you can work as little as 3 hours outside of Christmas and Summer. You obviously have more seniority as part of management. 
- The room to grow is small. It can be a hard process and is also very competitive. I was luckily promoted within a year and worked in two different stores. 
- The salary isn't impressive. There isn't a huge margin between being part of management and being a regular sales associate.
- Often enough, way too much is expected of you. Of course, this depends on your higher management. I was a little easier on the sales associates.

938,Vans,(Stock ASM Outlets) Overwhelmed,2020-08-23,2.0,Assistant Store Manager,"Discount is nice, the culture can be nice too, if you get to work in a good store. It’s really dependent on location. It’s fast paced and if the management has your back (like when I first started working there), you can really learn sales and strong interpersonal skills with customers.","There is such a lack of accountability within management, and even the systems set in places are very slow to act to get highly underperforming individuals fired, which really brings down moral. Our store manager did not want to be on the floor or train, so all of the training and store performance fell onto the next level of management, without the pay and support of a store manager. The colorado (outlet) district is flailing, and it’s hard to watch it crumble after being there for so long. They refuse to hire store managers internally despite constantly saying that they are invested in our development. It’s a lot of surface level niceties and a lot of deeper level lack of empathy and care that is newly developed in the last couple years, and it’s not the same environment culturally or in business practice that I appreciated in the past and I can’t recommend it."

Which sucks because I look to get at the most 25-30 hours. No room to move up since a lot of the management have worked there 5+ years. Get no benefits, no paid vacation.

1113,Vans,Vans,2019-07-17,5.0,Seasonal Sales Associate,A great job with great benefits. I had a great time working at vans and learned a lot about management.,"At times it was very slow, but we kept busy by organizing the store. The only thing I can say is that Vans is not what it used to be. I have been skateboarding my whole life and seen the shift from skateboarding being unpopular to fashion highlight. I wish that some of the Vans stores still had more of a skateboarding vibe rather than a corporate store like Target. When I was very young and just starting out on a skateboard, the Vans store near me had a halfpipe in the back. Now I understand legally why they took it out, but if you skateboard you should know that getting hurt is a part of it. That's where Vans turned away from skateboarding when the people with money just wanted what they think is ""cool"" but will not let their children skateboard, buying from a brand that is rooted in skateboarding yet they know nothing about the company nor do they care. But that's my two cents, still love ya Vans. You just lost my respect a little bit."

Some of us choose to be part-time for reasons such as school so we can't necessarily work a certain amount of hours per week.

1137,Vans,One of the best companies to work for.,2019-05-21,5.0,Sales Associate,"I have been with the company for five years, both as a sales associate and as a part time manager. The pros completely outweigh the cons. First off, you get a great discount and they send you free clothing and shoes many times a year for holidays and launches. (Free Vans, say what??) Secondly, they are truly a company that cares and reward its people for doing a great job. My management team always thanks me when I leave at the end of my shift and make sure that I am taken care of. They promote 'heart share' and moments where you connect with one another. This company cares about its people and encourages creativity. Every store is different and there will be struggles. There are plenty of opportunities to move up or transfer to other stores if you are loyal to the brand and work hard! But those amazing moments with my team where we laugh, have fun, and are passionate about the brand make those obstacles so worth overcoming. I would love to continue working for this company and make it my career. If you love people, the style of Vans and diversity, this is the place for you.","Not enough hours for part timers, it is really difficult to get rid of lousy workers or people who are causing trouble on staff. This is the biggest issue.  I've noticed that most people with negative reviews have has a bad experience because of issues on their staff.  This can happen anywhere you work. People that I have come across who have had bad experiences are usually because of management in the store, lack of passion, and not keeping it professional. I felt as is upper management did not care about my store at times. It can be trying as an associate because I feel like upper management does not hear us sometimes."

You get free stuff and chances to bonus across all positions.",Can be unprofessional. The company can sometimes be uncoordinated which confuses everyone at retail level. Many people in management are inadequate leaders and can be selfish which can bring store morale down. It can be sometimes a 'drink the koolaid' feel with how upper management try to mimics attitudes and ideas that are not 100% authentic for the development of their teams. To move up in the company you have to be known and do A LOT of special projects and make yourself known amongst the 'koolaid drinkers' or you're irrelevant.

Since leaving, I’ve become more and more aware of the inherent bias and lack of diversity within senior levels of the organization; I’ve seen highly qualified candidates of diverse backgrounds get passed over for promotions and internal opportunities due to poor recruiting practices and outright prejudice from members of the HR and recruiting teams. I loved my Vans team, but HR and senior leaders need to practice what they preach. Saying negative things about former employees (myself included), demonstrating outright bias, and failing to live by your very public core values will not lead to success and will rather continue to drive great people out of the organization and into other employers.

You meet great and super chill co-workers
Rewards; including Christmas sneakers the brand gives to its employees every year (and every year is different) and 70% discount when you are the person with the most sales for 3 consecutive weeks in one month.
You get to work on stock, the sales floor, and cash register over time; associates learn a variety of tasks and learn to be more customer oriented. 
Being that Vans has become a huge deal due to ""damn daniel,"" and Kanye West making it main stream, you meet a lot of cool people; possibly even celebrities depending on which location you are working at.
If you are a manager you get the opportunity to go to California during the summer and you go to Disney; you meet a lot of other managers working in the same brand and others who work under Vans for work-related meetings and reward ceremonies.","Only gives 4-6 hour shifts for Associates
Minimum of 3 days out of the week, depending on if you frequently meet sales goals
All sales associates and floor supervisors work only part-time, only the manager and assistant manager are full time.
Not commission based even though they make meeting sales a huge deal
Black out dates - You can't miss out on work AT ALL on certain times of the year
You have to deal with a lot of families and obnoxious teenagers during the beginning of every school year--can get super annoying
You're required to live breathe and eat Vans for breakfast everyday-- your shoes and shirt must be from Vans when working (some managers are flexible on wearing a Vans shirt though, thank god)"

1457,Vans,Would Not Recommend,2017-01-27,1.0,Assistant Store Manager,"Excellent employee discount across brands. Creates a very good networking opportunity. 
No Christmas music during the holidays.
Excellent learning experience.","I worked as a supervisor for Vans, for over two years. My experience is limited to my district, but I absolutely would not recommend investing into this company. Corporate Vans would like you to believe in ""Heart Share"", which is essentially a lure to convince you that although things are not great, they could be worse. 

In my opinion, the things that are most problematic with Vans, is lack of opportunity for growth, and an incredibly high turn-over rate. Management for Vans is quite extensive and you are usually demanded to perform tasks outside of your job description and above your pay. Going the extra mile with lack of incentive and no hope for promotions is draining on the employees. 

Vans is probably one of the most disorganized companies that I have worked for. Nearly every operational task falls on the same week, every month. The tasks are manageable, if you are experienced and provided with adequate payroll. The poorly made operational schedules create a high-stress environment which often leaves employees feeling discouraged and unmotivated. 

Although they would like you to believe otherwise, the company does discriminate. There are rules and guidelines that are applied to certain employees that are not applied to others. For instance, I witnessed my SM commit theft multiple times and was asked to keep quiet by LP. The reasoning behind this is simple, it costs more to replace a SM than it does to take the loss of merchandise. 

There will be issues at every single company that you work for, however, I do not believe things will get better at Vans. If you are unhappy, I would suggest that you get out as soon as you can. Do not continue to hold out for hope, invest into a company that in return, will invest into you."

Great environment, and great people. The vibe between all employees is warm, welcoming and fun. Very flexible at times, and a great discount (50% off).","Sometimes the demand they put on sales associate are too much regarding how much they need to sell during a certain shift. It is a flexible company, but this can become chaotic and unorganized week to week with in regards to schedules. Also, shifts are 5 hours long most of the time, and you aren't given much shifts during the week."

It genuinely felt like I was working with a family. Working at Vans made me feel like I had a purpose. The company itself is amazing, and growing up in California I felt as though I could really relate to the culture of the company. The shoes we're state of the art, and the customers had vibes that always matched my personality along with the company.","Some downsides to working at Vans would be the fact that during certain hours of the day, the mall would be pretty much empty. At this point is becomes a little boring, but that's with any retail store. During these times we would usually recover the store by refolding and restocking the clothes, along with making the shoe displays look perfect."

They also teach you really good customer service techniques.

Great place to learn for those who don't have much retail experience.","Some of the management that's been there for a while can be condescending and rude, instead of constructive criticism they just cut you down.  But that's what happens when your company doesn't treat you right.

Also not a lot of opportunity for upward growth"

Awesome brand and product.","Upper-management ONLY cares about the bottom line. My store has one less full-time manager and well as three less part-time employees from one year ago (cannot hire anyone new due to corporate restructuring of store profits vs. associate count). DM comes in and wonders why EVERYTHING isn't perfect. Expectations have slowly become unrealistic and have depleted the ""vibe"" of the store.

- Flexible

This job was a great first experience which offered me the ability to gain customer service experience while still in high school.",It is very hard to advance in this company or receive pay increases. A lot of turnover with the employees because of this.
1516,Vans,Customer Service,2016-08-10,4.0,Retail Sales Associate,"great environment, easy, and get to talk to people all day",not able to move up without making lots of sales & its hard when you have a lot of employees on the floor at the same time. Its great for a teen barely starting out
1517,Vans,Losing Their Culture,2016-08-10,3.0,Store Manager,Discount is great! Environment and dress code are very relaxed. The customers are better than most in retail. PTO and Sick time are generous. Store teams are the type of people you want to work with- usually drama free. Great product with an honest history. Paul and Steve Van Doren are two of the most genuine people ever. VLS in California for SMs every year (although I'd rather have the money in the form of a bonus).,"All of the typical complaints about retail- poor allocation, sticklers on payroll, waaaay too KPI focused, expect big results with little to no reward or recognition. Bonus structure is only good if your store did terrible the prior year. If you had a very successful LY, do not expect to bonus too often. The company recently became 100% owned by Vanity Fair and they seem to be sucking the long lasting culture out of Vans. You barely see skate in the stores anymore. The new (in 2016) training program eliminated two very important competencies that made Vans employees special. They try to claim that it is not any different, but anyone who has been with Vans for a while knows they are becoming more corporate- less Vans, and less people focused. They rose prices this year to become more ""competitive"" (so they say), but we all know it was cause their sales were trending down on the year for the 1st time in 13 years. They try to sell us on fake ideas like ""they love their people,"" but do little to show it. Unless you are in charge of a top volume store, you really don't matter. In most cases, it is the DM's to blame. They hear the same messages that we hear and although we are required to carry out these messages in our store, they do little to nothing to carry them out on their end. They have been hiring a lot of external DM's who are bought in by the brand rather than true long term fans of the brand, and you can tell because they treat every employee like they are only as good as their sales or KPIs. The DM's are not very supportive either. I have worked with several and they all have trouble responding to emails, phone calls, etc. but then get upset when you don't respond to their messages within the hour. Ultimately, everyone is replaceable- Store Manger and down the line. The only way you tend to move up is if someone quits."
1518,Vans,"Good Discount, Bad Management",2016-08-06,3.0,Floor Supervisor,"Good Discount (50% for everyone / 70% for employee of the month)

Flexible Scheduling. They work around my other work schedules.

Cool atmosphere. I'm not one who enjoys dressing up in a shirt and tie, so this job is perfect. I can wear tees, sweatshirts, jeans, shorts, etc.

Customers can be cool people to interact with.","Underpaid and overworked.

No benefits for Supervisors or Associates, only available for Store Manager and Assistant Manager.

Management is unorganized.

Schedule is not consistent and employees are not always reliable. Management changes the schedule last minute during the current work week and doesn't inform you that it has been updated. Due to this I have had multiple employees miss shifts because they did not know they were scheduled and made other plans for the day."

The employee incentives we decent but it seemed they were being slowly reduced or taken away.,"There was favoritism among upper management (Store and District levels), which I am aware occurs in most work environments. The company as a whole is doing everything they can to get the most out of their employees for the absolute bare minimum. I am also aware most companies try and do this however, Vans is taking it to the next level and employees are becoming more aware of how underpaid they are to perform the tasks required of them (especially at a management level). Sales expectations continued to increase while labor continued to decrease, making scheduling time consuming and difficult. They pick and choose which company policies to adhere to based on what is convenient for them."

1527,Vans,An all around great place to work and learn the ins and outs of retail.,2016-07-03,5.0,Assistant Store Manager,"The people employed are hard workers. There's nothing that you won't learn here. Some of the nicest people you'll meet, work at Vans. And along with the great environment, the company is ultimately based on expressing yourself. There is no guidelines as to who can and can not work here. To top off the great environment and great people, the employee benefits that Vans gives, is absolutely the best. I've never worked for another company that gave their employees such great discounts on their merchandise. You seriously can't go wrong with working here.","Being in the company for almost 5+ Years, I've seen less people get promoted internally rather than externally. It's a sad thing when someone who has never had retail experience, yet has ""credentials"" gets outweighed on employment opportunities. I've seen people with experience who know the ins and outs of a store yet get pushed to the side when a position is available, in the higher echelons of this company. Also, as much as I'd hate to say it, unless you have previous retail experience or have a friend currently in the company to vouch for you, getting in is kind of difficult."

That means that as an employee and an employer, I was encouraged to be authentic and genuine and original in all my endeavors, and I was able to hire and develop people with that same message to spread. The support you felt and the sense of Family was incomparable. The Van Doren Message of it ""it was never about waving the brand around like a flag, it was always about the people"" was so true. We were encouraged to build real connections with our customers","task load was a bit heavy with operations, at times poorly timed with huge swings in peak season or traffic. just a lot on our plates at once and trying to keep the team motivated to get everything done and still keep the customer focus as top priority was always something that had to be maintained. Field Leadership direct leaders were mixed in talent. Some absolutely amazing. Some who didn't seem invested. Some who had different sets of rules for the different leaders on their team."

Coming in with product knowledge and retail management experience this job was a walk in the park for me. I adapted quickly and learned the vans way. Over the 2 years I got to go away 5 times to open new stores across country for GO TEAM that was the most fun to travel free and have it all paid for. Health benefits are cheap and really good.

Cool people to work with 
Good job if you're in high school looking to make a few dollars.","No Hours No Opportunity:
I started working for Vans in 2012 as a sales associate when I was 17 at minimum wage (not a big deal at the time) and thought I could make a career out of it. How silly of me to think I could grow with a company who gives sales associates a maximum of 8 hours A WEEK. I constantly had to compete with my coworkers to try and get more hours because then, I didn't see the corporate side of things. I busted my butt, always being told I would move up as soon as a position opened and when a part time management position opened up, they ALWAYS hired externally with people who were unfit for the position. I held on to a false hope for over two years and finally I moved up to a Stockroom Supervisor out of a last resort and panic by upper management. Finally, when my store got a new Store Manager since the former one transferred to a new store 15 minutes away and a Floor Supervisor quit, I finally got the position I wanted after 3 years. I transferred to the store 15 minutes away and knew after two months of being at that store, I would have absolutely no chance of moving up or building a career. 

No Raises:
After being an associate for over two years, I had one raise by a few cents. I didn't get a raise from minimum to $10 an hour until I moved up to a stockroom supervisor. When I moved up to a Floor Supervisor my store manager and I agreed on $11 an hour my store manager put it in and the district manager NEVER fixed or approved it. 

Too High of Expectations for the pay:
I was always pushed to put in so much ridiculous work to where I felt as if my pay did not reflect my worth to the company. You feel unappreciated by the company after awhile because you're doing so much work with no reward or incentives that actually matter.

Young Upper Management:
Having a 19-20 year old getting hired into an Assistant Manager position when you're 21, in a position under, have been with the company for close to four years and have stayed loyal, is a slap to the face. 

You Will Not Make A Living In a Part-Time Management Position: 
You can only work a maximum of 23 hours a week, during slow times of the year you will average 13 hours a week. This is not a reliable job and you will never have a steady income. If you have real bills, this is not a ""job."""

Co-workers automatically click with you!,"Management SUCKS... at my store however. They're super chill, but sometimes can be TOO chill. By that I mean, they lack communication. You often get in trouble for things they do. They definitely pick favorites and that's the worst part. They change the schedule almost every 5 minutes it seems, so you get written up for ""not showing up to a shift"" that said you had off two days ago. They never mention when they change the schedule. They say that it's all on you even if you were off and never got to see it updated. They don't alert you. It's just a piece of paper on the wall in the backroom. I've gotten written up twice for something a manager did. Make $8.50 and hour to bust my butt on work I'm not even suppose to do. Sometimes have you do stockroom replenishment when you're an associate. They have replenishers for that. Very low hours if it's not Summer or holiday season.

Many of my coworkers, and I myself, couldn't handle the emotional abuse where we were almost pushed to tears. No matter how much we surpassed our daily sale goals or how spectacular our UPT was, management always found a magical way to degrade your skills and make you feel inferior.  Management itself is the biggest joke, basically high school all over again. We had no choice but to keep our schedules open, also known as open calls, where we weren't able to plan anything because we never knew if they were going to need us or not. Tallk about inconsiderate. The pay? Another huge joke. We were basically paid so little to be a walking Vans-pedia. The hours? Only 4 hours EACH day. They'll only offer you more hours if someone called. That itself, speaks volumes. If I had known about a 12 hour week split up into 3 days, 4 hours each day, I would've rejected immediately. I wasted more money on public transportation than acutslly earn a livable wage. You can't even pay ONE BILL with these hours. I reported my former manager to the district manager for all the unprofessional things we trailed through and treatment we had daily from him. Unsurprisingly, no respond or action yet.

Terrible hours, call-in system sucks and restricts employee's day greatly, tyrannical management, no creative allowance, poor training, no opportunity for advancement until you've hit at least 3 years of experience within the company, and no concern for outside obligations (I have kids and have been subjected to 4 hours a week for long stretches of time), no respectable leadership (managers tell you to get off your phone and get to work while they sit and text in your face, and thats just to name a few."

Perfect first job experience.,"very part time, sales associates usually work 4-10hrs a week. Part time managers are lucky to get 20hrs. Very hard to move up since there are rarely any open positions.

The Vans culture is inspiring, the hours were flexible, and the discount was great","The only real downsides I can think of is the pay, and the hours you get, depending on how many members you have on your team. Unless you're working full time, don't expect to work more than 4-5 hours a day or make more than $9 an hour. It's a starting position."

It was very discouraging to work after that change (After Obama Care, VF decided to give their associates no more than 20 hours). The discounts are very nice, but when you can't even afford the merchandise (corporate's incentives), then the pay is pointless."

1674,Vans,The. worst. ever.,2015-05-11,1.0,Manager,A laid back environment. Some of the people who work for the company are cool.,"The culture of Vans has died. This is a prime example of what happens to a company when it gets too big. There's a huge disconnect between the corporate office and the stores. The bottom line in all cases is dollars and cents. I understand that's there;s money to be made, but don't advertise yourself as being about the people if that isn't the case. ""You can't take KPI's to the bank, make more money"" Payroll here is horrible. I like to believe that that's because of VF and Not Vans, but since communication to the field is a lackluster who knows. In this company your forced to buy uniform pieces. Since the company outsourced to outside the great USA and the shoes are made in Asia, the shelf life on them for someone who works 40 hours a week is about 2 months. You're provided one pair of shoes a year, once those are blown out you have to pay out of pocket. In the California stores nobody takes 10 min breaks because there's no coverage on the sales floor (horrible labor allocation). The company continues to open new stores but doesn't have the man power to back it up. It's no wonder Vans has such a high turn over rate. The pay? The worst in the industry I've ever seen. Everyone in the stores is under paid by about 30% on average. Vans does not pay competitively. Supervisors are paid just above minimum wage."
1675,Vans,don't expect too much,2015-05-06,4.0,Sales Associate/Cashier,When I applied I wasn't expecting much. I'm a high school student and this is a good first time job.  if you're someone like me without any bills then the pay seems fine. You also get a new shirt and shoes on your first day. so that was pretty cool. Vans is also very generous with their discounts so thats pretty good!,"I'm fairly new i don't have anything to complain about…yet 
other than my hours. they're not really consistent and you won't get that many…"

It's really a fun place to work.","The only con is that they do not hire many people and it is difficult to get hired. In my experience, they told me I could go back to company on my winter break from college but then retracted the offer once I asked."
1678,Vans,Not what you're expecting...,2015-04-22,4.0,Sales,Most stores are very flexible with schedules if you're going to school or have another job or other obligations. The environment is friendly and team-work oriented to work efficiently in a fast paced job. Lots of tools and resources available to those that ask regarding the company's history and specific information about product and career path progression. Make lots of friends!,Some associates take advantage of the relaxed environment and availability agreement; TIP: if you don't provide enough open availability then don't expect to work very much.
1679,Vans,Intense pressure in a fast pace environment,2015-04-15,3.0,Floor Supervisor,"- 50% discount on apparel
- 30% off sale, 20% off proskate
- Free pair of shoes & T-shirt on first day
- 70% off for employee of the month","- STRICT rules, regulations, procedures enforced
- Cram an IMMENSE amount of information (history, product knowledge, operations)
- intense selling focus (like a robot or car salesman)
- Short Shifts

* Working under pressure in a fast pace environment is a MUST. 
Managers put a lot of pressure on associates to sell as much as they can to as many people as they can. Even when there are two people working and 10 different customers in the store. You must follow selling technique protocol with every customer.


I love the culture and history of vans and I love that I could share that knowledge and admiration with my customers, but at the same time I did not think that working here would turn me into a ""robotic car salesman""
Most of the time, its almost as if money and sales come before the customers."

This place was the funnest most upbeat environment it could be when I first got hired couple years back, we got new management a year later and ever since then it's been all down hill. Since last year they've taken away multiple perks that all employees got and had to work hard for. They have really made it clear that you have to brown nose to move up. It has nothing to do with your work ethic. The hours were good at first but they hired so many people you were lucky if you got 12. Cool job for someone in high school having fun but if you need to pay bills, definitely pass. Management couldn't even manage. Especially the head honchos."

1716,Vans,Start here. Get a better job.,2014-12-13,2.0,Sales Associate,"The discount is higher than most other companies (from what I've heard/seen from friends working in retail) 50% is pretty good (sometimes it sucks because the merch has a high price tag)
Generally speaking your co-workers are decent people. The job isn't too difficult once you understand the stock room, and basics of the job.","For part-time work there are no benefits, except your discount. Hours are hard to come by, you're looking at 4-8 hours a week most of the time. The only two peak seasons are back to school (August - September) and the holiday season (late November-January) the payroll is always very strict, so working over 28 hours (which is considered part time) is very bad. You will be scolded for doing this. Even though every month you have a new floor set, new merchandise coming in, old merchandise going out, new standards to fulfill, all while maintaining stellar customer service and keeping the store at visual standards. Sometimes it is very difficult to take on such a workload on the hours you are given. On top of the shortage of hours, there are about 14 other sales associates in the same boat, competing for hours just like you. 
I know plenty of other part time sales associates that get paid twice what I do, it's a very hard job to have if you're trying to live off of it. When I first got this job I had to get a second one because the hours were so terrible. There is a very large disconnect between corporate and the stores. If your store does ""well"" in any aspect of retail (sales, shrink, reviews, etc.) then your store manager is rewarded, and you (as the sales associate) get nothing. It's hard to feel like this company cares about its employees actually pushing the product and selling it. It's very difficult to move up, there's very little flexibility as far as management goes (must be able to pretty much work all the time)"

1719,Vans,Good discount,2014-12-01,3.0,Sales Associate,Great discount on clothes/shoes. I believe the discount was 40% and then more on clearance items. Another pro is you get to wear vans clothes and the job has a lot of potential to move up.,they expect too much for minimum wage. not worth it.

There are stores that pay there associates what out management team was getting paid for a lot of work.

1726,Vans,Great company to work for,2014-10-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,great discounts. Able to move up quickly in the retail industry if you are motivated,give employees minimal hours to work. hard to get by with just working for them.
1727,Vans,It's retail for the young...,2014-10-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Like the people I work with. Benefits are good. Discount is great.,"I understand it is a youth focused company, but in my market it is difficult to attract and retain good employees when they can make more elsewhere. Huge disconnect between departments in corporate lead to unbalanced work load. One week you have everything to do at once, ie. Visual changes, new merchandise coming in, old merchandise going out and let's throw in a corporate visit. One hand does not talk to another and not enough payroll to get it done."
1728,Vans,Great place to start off!,2014-10-26,5.0,Sales Representative,"Great company culture, fun environment, good way to gain customer service experience, awesome discounts, met a lot of great people (coworkers and customers), learned how to assemble a skateboard (pretty cool!)",Paid minimum wage-- I guess the discount was supposed to make up for the low pay but it really just puts sales representatives' money back in the company's pockets

1730,Vans,One of the most well respected Retailers in the US. Very customer oriented. Hit or Miss??,2014-10-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very Relaxed environment, very family orientated, lots of history and traditions with this company. Great discount. Hard work is recognized most of the time.","Not easy to move up in this company, Lots of store drama no matter what store, One of lowest paying retailers to there employee's, Most Assistant managers are paid what entry level part managers are paid from other companies."
1731,Vans,"This is a job for experiences, not for money. Store environment all depends on management team and fellow associates.",2014-10-14,4.0,Sales Associate,"Vans is a job for the benefit of feeling involved, personal achievement, and gaining knowledge, NOT the money. I want to say first that if you are in need of a job just for the paychecks Vans is not the place for you. I have been a sales associate for almost a year, and even during peak periods I've never been scheduled to work more than 20 hours a week. However, while here I have achieved goals, been shown appreciation from customers in surveys (Great resume add on!), developed a great Vans wardrobe, and built friendships with my team members. 

- 50% discount of regular priced merchandise, 30% off sale. 
- Star Sales Associate of the month and Supervisor of the month get 70% off the following month on regular price and 50% off sale items.
- Employee uniform is Vans shoes and a Vans T-shirt. Very easy to get ready for work. 
- One free pair of shoes under $65 each consecutive year of working. 
- Awesome amount of knowledge built about store products to carry even after leaving.
- Fun work environment. 
- Strong customer relationships
- Cool prizes received for achieving goals (pins on name tag, name on wall, etc..)","- A lot is asked of associates for a low hourly pay. Your numbers (units per transaction, average dollar sale, sales per hour, daily sales goal) are taken seriously. If your numbers are not good, it will reflect on your hours for the week. (For example: Fellow associate overslept and was late, only given 8 hours the following week. However, management team members have forgotten they were scheduled an opening shift and shown up late to open the store with no disciplinary action.)

- Managers are competitive, and their goals are based off the associate goals. Associates are pushed to focus less on customer satisfaction and more on selling and adding on at times. 
- In store competition for who has to do closing activities, drags (putting shoes back on shelf), folding, based on individual numbers at that given time can be frustrating. 
- Favoritism shown on the schedule based on ""Star of the week"" (clearly stated in management that it's not allowed)."
1732,Vans,Awesome,2014-10-02,5.0,Sales Associate,Everyone there is so cool and laid back. There is a generous discount and I've never had a problem with any coworker,"The only con I really have is I feel like I work a lot for minimum wage.

Everyone loves getting Vans, so it makes the job a more pleasant place when you see the smiles.","Vans is unstructured. No communication between departments or campaigns. They hire too many. If you are looking for more hours and a higher paycheck, it may not be for you. Starting out, look at 4-8 hours a week on minimum wage. You can work your way up to 12 if you bust it. 20 if you're lucky."

Also, most of my coworkers were really cool.","For a minimum wage job, I was constantly being pressured and pressured to do better in every aspect of sales while I was already working hard. Not to sound lazy, but they really do ask a lot of you in terms of sales, and hours were not good at all. Also, they had on calls where you had to call in 3 hours before potentially working about twice to three times a week. However, 100% of the time I was told that I was not needed. This was annoying because I would have to take time out of my day that I could talk on the phone and make sure to always have a reminder.. and if I were to call 20 minutes late I would get chewed out by management."

1739,Vans,Retail me not.,2014-08-01,5.0,Sales Associate,Awesome discount and some good coworkers easy to request off. Pretty relaxed work environment.,"As a sales associate at the store I worked at you can almost forget any chance of promotion. I've been a die hard fan of vans products all
My life and always wanted to work at vans when I finally got a chance too had to know someone to get a job. Management was in a clique and put incompetent 18 year old kids in floor supervisor positions the kind who's open the back door to smoke and ask you to watch the floor alone then you pull your phone out to check the fine and he writes you up for it. There's zero hope in working on your deck book management says they're too busy with other tasks when there's plenty of down days. They just don't care and don't want you to move up. People are super lazy and never put drags away managers think they're better then that and would rarely help put them away or fold shirts typically the store closing procedures went well onto 11pm because no one was tending to the drags and clothes who left earlier. There's a very ""f it it's not my problem attitude "" just overall a sad learning expierence. The managers would often steal all the hours from asosociates and just work all manager shifts by that I mean run managers and no sales staff.  Also noone cares about skate certifing you unless your again in thier ""clique"" It took me 8 months to get certified to ring while others were always stealing my big sales. I had to call hr 3 times in regards o why I wasn't certified. I have a clean record and I'm not a thief. So I'm not sure what thier issue was. Eventually I got other jobs and just worked at vans less and less never quit just would work a day once in awhile until I was randomly terminated. And also never informed of it. There's probably only two good managers at this store the rest and old manager are incompetent morons."

Easy to get days off","Horrible pay. As a supervisor I had less than 20 hours a week and the full time employees were coerced into giving up on hours routinely.

-For the most part, my coworkers were chill, laid back, and would help you out if you asked for it

-I love Vans. Very cool brand

-Fairly easy work. You get the hang of things pretty fast","-HORRIBLE hours! I was under the impression I'd get a lot of hours because since I worked here during the holidays and they hired about 10 of us seasonal workers, it would always be crazy busy and they needed a lot of help. Quite the opposite! They were way too overstaffed (over 30 of us worked at our store). Therefore, unless you have been working there for awhile, your hours will be bad. On a good week, we will get scheduled for 8 hours. On a regular week, we might get scheduled for 4 hours. It was not uncommon for many workers to get 0 hours. What is the point of having a job with hours so low?

-On call shifts. You have to call in 3 hours before your shift starts to see if they need you to come in. They never need you because they are so overstaffed. Still, they expect you to not make any plans so you can be on stand-by just in case. Such BS. 

-Sometimes, they would cut your shift. So, if you had 8 hours a week, it's highly probably it will go down to 4. If you had 4, it could potentially go down to 0. Sometimes, it would be so slow at Vans that they would send workers home after 2 hours. They would claim they ""don't have the payroll to go around"". So why did you hire so many people then? I don't get it.

-Embarrassingly bad paychecks as a result of terrible hours. If you're trying to make some actual money, do not work here.

-They didn't really have time to train the new seasonal sales associates properly. They kind of briefly went over things on the first day, and that was it. They were helpful if we had questions later on though. But they never even trained us to use the register, because supposedly they ""didn't have time"" even though sometimes it would be so slow at the store we would all just be standing around pretending to fold clothes.
 
-I didn't feel like the managers/assistant managers gave a crap out of me. They were using us seasonal sales associates as backup and they didn't make an effort to really get to know us. I felt unappreciated and disposable. They told me during my interview there would be a good chance we would be kept on after the holidays were over. This is a lie because they don't want to scare you away. In reality, they hire about 10 people, and then they play favorites (not who is the best worker), and pick 1 or 2 people they had fun working with as the ones they keep. The other 8 or 9 people just get dropped.

-The way they let us go was really insulting. Our names were just cut from the schedule once they were finished with us. No phone call, no final shift to say good bye or thank you...nothing at all! They didn't even say anything to me about it until I went in to pick up my final paycheck a week later. It was impersonal and nonchalant. So stupid."

I love the brand itself so that was just a plus. Great discount! Probably one of the better retail stores to work for if you're into individuality and a laid back atmosphere. You can really be yourself here.",Most of the time the outlets got the short end of the stick since they were being judged on the same criteria as the full price stores.  Definitely not fair seeing as how our stuff is ridiculously cheap compared to them.  It just got annoying getting chewed out for things that were beyond our control.  Also all of our training and sales techniques were geared toward full price locations also.
1787,Vans,Your manager's level of dedication will make or break your experience here.,2013-09-26,4.0,Sales Associate,"You get a free pair of shoes (and 3 basic logo t-shirts) when you start, and another pair of shoes after every year of working there.
50% discount on regular priced items. 30% discount on sale items, 40% discount at other retailers owned by VF Outdoor. If you go to Warped Tour, you get free gear if you show a paystub.
It's a fun company with a relatively long history. You feel like you're part of something big, even though the company itself is kind of small for how well-known it is.
There is a pretty thorough training program. It's all on-the-job, but they don't expect you to immediately know everything (it took me weeks to learn the shoe and color names). They also give you information on exactly why the shoes are higher quality, and give specifics on the manufacturing process.","I have a really kind, accommodating, hard-working manager who doesn't just sit around and expect everyone else to work, but just like any other retail job, I can imagine having a manager who didn't care about his/her employees would make working there awful.
One thing that really confused me was that aside from the manager and four assistant managers, there were nine sales associates/cashiers (after a few people left to go back to school), and we were only getting a shift or two every week, but during the seasonal hiring time, they hired nine more completely new people. It seems like a smaller team of people who work more often would be better at their job than a huge team of people who come in so rarely that they don't have the opportunity to become better at their job. I'm rating the work/life balance lower because I honestly have too much life and not enough work to balance it out.
They don't do any sort of commission. I would personally enjoy a little bit of friendly competition."
