The employees here are some of the best people I have ever met and they care about even after you leave the company. I have made some of my best friends here and even if you move to a different department, you can always count on them to have your back and to be there for you. They also care about the community and the veterans they serve. It might sound like a cliché thing to say, but I have spoken to loan officers, customer service reps, and even people in HR that STILL talk to the people they have helped and don't really have any other reason to speak except to catch up. This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for and was so sad to leave.","The politics here don't make much sense, like not giving workers there Juneteenth off or some of the reasons people are let go from the company. Some of the decision made by the higher ups are questionable. It's all about who you know here."

5,Veterans United Home Loans,Awesome!,2022-03-29,5.0,Loan Coordinator,This company is amazing! I took a position with a lot of responsibility and some stress but it's completely worth it. I get to work directly with veterans from the start of the loan process to the end.,None that I can think of.
6,Veterans United Home Loans,Not the company they proclaim to be,2022-03-28,2.0,"Closing Specialist, Account Manager, Wire Specialist","flexible depending on they department 
free snack","Besides the mean girl atmosphere in the Production Department, I have been yelled at by a loan officer to the point that I ended up in Urgent care with a panic attack and on heart meds to this day because of it and the stress I was placed under. When moved to a new department and learning a new job the other departments that you have to work with are not patient or kind during that learning curve. There is a lot of pressure put upon the employees in some of the departments and very little forgiveness or understanding regardless of what their VU values claim. I have witnessed a lot of what I would call age discrimination and absolutely no consistency with they way they treat their employees. You may come out of training and get a team lead that rides you hard in a very unkind way and expects you keep up with all of your work within 3 months of being out on the floor but yet one of your peers who came out of training with you will get a different manager in the same department and their manager will be very kind and understanding and tell that employee that they are not expected to keep up with only being out on the floor for 3 months and will let them work overtime to keep up. The care nothing about being consistent and treating each employee fairly. HR knows about this issue but still no one fixes it and I have seen it A LOT. 
They claim to be a VU family however I have witnessed a top preforming employee get forced out of a job because her family, who babysit her infant, had planned a trip overseas for a month so she asked to work from home during that time so she could watch her child and work, which we have the capability to do and have done many times, and they told her no and not only that but then emailed all the other women on the team who had small children and let it be known that they should not ask either and childcare is not their problem. Since there is a shortage of infant childcare in our area, the woman had to leave the company and they would not even let her finish her two weeks. We had been working from home all through Covid so this makes no sense. 
If you are young and cute you will probably be ok if you get in good with the right people but God help you if you don't. I have heard many that have left the company say they have PTSP from working there. I could go on and on with many more stories but all I really want to do is forget this place. I do not recommend this company."

Long story short, I over heard, not in the conversation nor providing any consultation, managers planning to terminate an employee due to unsubstantiated reasons. They were looking for reasons to terminate.

One manager is in a relationship with a female employee; however, a direct report of his, a younger employee, is attempting to build a romantic relationship with the female. Now, the male is threatening to share the manager’s relationship with the manager’s wife.

This is toxic environment is affecting our team.

I exceeded expectations my first month on main floor in production, then contracted COVID at Veterans United which affected my performance. I was given a 30 day notice of termination and was not provided a performance improvement plan after my numbers dropped. The two factors that affected my numbers were illness and the market slows down in Dec and Jan. There was no grace for this. Anybody who already has a solid career, I do not recommend leaving your job to work at Veterans United, especially in production as you are just a number to them. I was very lucky my previous federal position was still open so I was able to go back to my previous job which is way more complex. I'm in it to serve and I love to originate."

I would listen to happy music on my way to work each morning to at least get my mood right because I dreaded it so much.

The CEO put out a video that told all employees if they did not care enough about their fellow employees, then they did not need to work there anymore. And by caring, meaning they have to be your close friend and spend time with them outside of work and help them move, etc. Not just being kind to them at work.

There were off-site mandatory corporate events on a regular basis involving unlimited alcohol and spouses were not allowed at the events.

It is a cult-like atmosphere and unprofessional full of uneducated individuals who only had high school diplomas or other lowly degrees. There were underwriters with just a high school education.

It was near impossible to get a job there without knowing someone already working there and there was major favoritism in hiring for higher level positions based on who someone was friends with."

Most were not a good fit because they weren’t hard workers. Hard work doesn’t mean we are working 60 hours and never have a break. There is plenty of balance for time off and being with your family.

The stuff VU does for the community is beyond what one would expect from a mortgage company, and I've watched my coworkers be supported through some really tough times in their life. I've never had a job outside of the military where I felt so loved and cared for by my peers/leadership. I also have never worked somewhere that was so invested in offering resources/trainings to become a better version of ourselves, and as leaders. Some folks worry that companies say they're Veteran friendly, but this one actually puts actions before words. I've never felt more supported, and think it's beyond awesome that my current military coworkers even have some extra benefits so they aren't worrying when called to duty. My goal is to retire with this company, because the values are unlike anywhere else.","I'm so blessed here, I don't have any cons to contribute.

It’s a weird place. The CEO ends emails with “love you guys” then the same day your manager threatens everyone a jobs if numbers are slightly off.

This company claims to love and care about their employees but it doesn’t show.

Also, some departments got a Christmas bonus and others didn’t. That doesn’t do anything for moral either.

I’ve seen a constant drop in morale every year I’m here. This place has become toxic."

89,Veterans United Home Loans,It's a meat grinder,2021-12-14,3.0,Loan Coordinator,"They pay fairly well. Although the separation in pay grades from loan officer to loan coordinator was made clear when it came to treatment. Multiple loan officers referred to coordinators as their assistant's without correction.

They try to innovate, maybe a little too fast. When hired, they trained my class for 3 different positions before settling on one. Every hiring class has a wildly different training experience. 

They do A LOT. Team outings, meals, tee shirts, hats, boots, free snacks. It can be stressful when you don't like combining your social life with work. And for the most part every event has alcohol. Great if you drink. Rough if you're sober.

Free Y pass.","There's definitely a correlation between who is determined to not be ""a good fit"" for VU, and who is visibly queer. On top of the fact despite having diversity and inclusion small groups, somehow the St. Louis office is 90% white. 

As a Loan Coordinator you're expected to be online and responding to questions 9am-5pm, while often times loan officers opt to only come in for part of the work day. This is a problem when you need help from them.

They're always re-working something. While it can be a good thing, it often left a sense of unease amongst teams. Keeping up with VU changes felt like a job in and of itself, outside of the normal changes that come with working on government backed loans. 

If the customer is mad- they will call you, and they will scream at you. Be it because they don't want to give you financial information, or you're just not able to make 3rd parties move any faster. 

They tell you it's a work hard/play hard roll, when it does not have to be. Putting all the pressure on the LC's to handle 40-50 loans at a time with a rotating door of underwriters, closers, loan officers, and more makes it pressure filled. Leaving major items up to ""underwriter discretion"" does.

All in all- this job can and will run you down."

Quick communication from HR, IT, etc
Team lead and managers did as much to help answer questions as possible, but they are overwhelmed themselves
401k","My experience at VU was a disappointing shock to me. In past positions at other companies I have always felt that even when the position was stressful, I was trained to handle it adequately. At VU, this was not the case.

 I went through training for three different positions within a year, because they kept moving me (along with many others) due to company needs. 

The training is inadequate. Though lots of time is spent on very specific items, such as taxes, there is not enough loan specific training and training on the full process of our position - in other words, we would focus on a skill, but end up feeling unprepared for our position as a whole. Trainers would imply to us that there is a correct way that they have to train us, but that once we are working our own pipeline, we may end up doing it differently (either skipping stuff because we are rushed, or being told to do something differently by our eventual team lead). Multiple people will advise differently on the exact same topic, making it difficult to learn what the current, true rule is. 

Trainers advised us over and over that our position was very stressful. They advised us that ""you won't find a closing specialist that hasn't cried."" This was not disclosed to me during any part of the recruitment process. In fact, the work life balance was highly touted, and the actual position description was avoided, because the recruiter did not know exactly which position I would placed into. 

The workload varied throughout the year but during a significant portion of my time at VU I was doing overtime to keep up with my workload, never taking breaks, and crying multiple times a week. I was truly clicking as fast as humanly possible and never giving my eyes a break, just to keep up with all my emails. 
The duties of each member assigned to a particular loan were not always clear. Many times it was hard to figure out if I was supposed to be doing something or if another member of the loan team was trying to get me to do their job for me. Communication was hit or miss, with some loan officers responding immediately, and some ignoring me until I cc'ed a manager. 

It seemed there was a motto of We can't train you on everything, you just have to learn gradually. But this type of method of learning is incredibly stressful when people are making demands that have to be met RIGHT now or else a loan can't close. If I didn't know how to do something, and couldn't figure it out, I was dependent on finding someone else to help, in a rush. Though most people would try to help, it was a stressful situation. Many swear words in the office.

Taking time off work felt impossible. Though teammates are supposed to pick up your work while you are gone, it always results in a mess. A million emails when you come back.

I felt like I was in this strange culture where some people actually liked their jobs but everyone else was miserable, but somehow the whole culture is around making everyone think VU is amazing even when it's not. The people around me were so depressed and I heard constant complaints. Some would say they hadn't peed all day because they were so busy. People in training were so stressed that they would say they cried about things.

The industry is just so incredibly difficult and complex - so I understand it is difficult at any mortgage company to learn how to be good at your position. But there are so many frustrating things about the way VU runs, and they can't just keep growing and growing and never developing truly experienced workers and only having turnover, because there need to be enough well trained people to help new people."

The company overall has a focus on making it a good place to work and puts in a fair amount of effort to do that.","Large portions of the company operate in a very different ways, at times there are issues that arise from having a corporate size without having a corporate structure such as there tend to not be standards around things that are make-sense (software engineering specific examples: how much and well things are documented, alerting, on-call). Overall a great place to work but it has its downsides that people tend not to speak about for fear of not being a ""culture fit"" and being passed up for positions that they want in the future.

These opportunities include book small groups, hobby-focused social groups, fun events for employees and their family members, an extravagant Holiday Party, and much, much more.

145,Veterans United Home Loans,Boiler Room for Retail and customer service workers,2021-08-26,1.0,Loan Officer,Benefits start day 1; clothing giveaways; Happy Hour,"This company is a cult focused on the Boiler Room mentality. The fringe benefits (free food, t-shirts, socks, beer and alcohol) is a front to keep a ""them vs. us mentality"" when it comes to employees. The interview process is designed to show a prospect that their current employee doesn't ""care"" for them as a person like VU does. The problem is, VU doesn't care for anybody but VU either. They pay low commissions as they entice customer service empyees typically earning 40k to accept a flat 60k pay. This base is high for the industry, but when you're closing the loans expected, you're only making 30% of what you'd make on the open market.

They force all empyees to sign a non-compete, which if challenged would be completely unenforceable as it is way too broad...essentially it states you can never have another job if it requires you to do ANYTHING you're currently doing (this includes talking to customers, using a phone or computer, working in a team, etc). The non-compete does NOT mention anything about the mortgage industry, just leaves a blanket open statement.

The management team will often say ""I've drunk the Kool-Aid"", like it's a point of pride. This statement best suits the organization as it is most closely associated to a cult. Unfortunately, the statement is derived from a popular cult by which the cult followers were forced to drink poisonous Kool-aid and die, or they were shot dead with AK47s. This organization wants to have an appearance that everyone is family, they require you to be friends with your co-workers outside of work, they have stated many times that they would love to see the line of work-life balance gone and you don't know what is what. In the end, when you realize this isn't the right job, company, etc, you are fired on the spot, can't complete your loans under contract, they shut off all benefits that day, and essentially treat you like a deserter of the cult.

So, in summary, this company is like a circus ringmaster, raising a lion in captivity so the lion doesn't realize they are more powerful. For those looking to have a secure pay, and become a robot and ""yes man"", this is a great position. Don't ever leave. If you have aspirations and want to challenge yourself, this is the worse position for you."

252,Veterans United Home Loans,Great Company,2020-12-29,5.0,Loan Specialist,"VU cares for it's employees more than any company I have ever worked for. They reward employees for working hard, and provide training and continues education for employees at all times.",Lack of flexibility to work from home long term.
253,Veterans United Home Loans,THANK YOU,2020-12-29,5.0,Realty Concierge,Everyone is so supportive and ready to help in anyway they can.,I have not had any cons yet
254,Veterans United Home Loans,Best Company to work for!!,2020-12-29,5.0,Loan Officer,"Family Oriented, Serving a Higher Purpose, Extremely Great Compensation and Benefits, Selfless and Exceptional Leadership",work more than 40 hours a week
255,Veterans United Home Loans,Ok place to work,2020-12-29,4.0,Operations Coordinator,"VU is an equal opportunity employer, and I especially like that the health insurance is inclusive of trans and queer people. The pay is competitive and there's always room to grow and move up within the company. Lastly, the ability to work from home during the pandemic has been amazing. I feel well supported in my role at home, and know I can reach out if I am having any issues. For example, when I first started working from home I had an unstable internet connection, so I was given a mifi router from the company to sustain an internet connection during the work day. Such a big stress relief knowing VU IT was there to help!","The work load cannot be done in 40 hours a week, so I am constantly working overtime. OT is unlimited, but its less appealing to get those extra hours when I don't feel there's a choice. I am told by my team leads that this work load is for my own growth and benefit, but my family and personal life have suffered as a result. For example, I have less time to help with the kids as they navigate online school. Lastly, not all VU employees embody the company's mission of enhancing lives. We should be treating ALL people with respect, not just the veterans our company serves. I don't get the impression loan officers and POCs understand what we're dealing with in processing. I work as hard as I can to serve our veterans and my loan team, and I consistently feel disrespected and undervalued by my own coworkers."
256,Veterans United Home Loans,Amazing company,2020-12-29,5.0,Realty Concierge,"Amazing office atmosphere, good hours, competitive pay, the company not only encourages but helps you give back to the community, VU really cares about their clients, employees, and community","Not sure if it's because of how quickly they're growing, covid, or what, but training hasn't been the greatest. It's felt disjointed. But everything else about the company is so awesome that the training difficulties are easily shrugged off."
257,Veterans United Home Loans,the best job ever,2020-12-29,5.0,Realty Coordinator,"whether it be clients, employees, people we don't know or a mission, VU cares",it is cold in the VUR office...like really cold and it is winter ;)

Personally, I love change.
For those who don't like change, that might be a downside."
259,Veterans United Home Loans,I've Found My Dream Company,2020-12-29,5.0,Operations Coordinator,"I absolutely love working at Veterans United. The people who work here live out the VU values: be passionate and have fun, deliver results with integrity, and enhance live every day. One of my favorite things about working here is getting to donate part of my paycheck to the Veterans United Foundation. I love that I have a chance to make my work even more meaningful by giving to VUF, which in turn does so much for veterans and the community!","Except for working from home (because of the pandemic), I don't have a con to list about working at Veterans United. I've truly found my dream company!"

261,Veterans United Home Loans,Amazing Company!,2020-12-29,5.0,Underwriter,"CULTURE - this company is awesome. They're so supportive of their employees, veterans, and communities. Almost every employee donates 1% of their pay check to the VU foundation and VU gives it back in BIG ways. They have handled COVID and the pandemic amazingly. Sending all employees home at the beginning and working very carefully to get some back in the office while still keeping everyone safe and able to work from home. They check in about every month to make sure we are doing ok, those who are working from home still, and if we need anything. Bonus, they love to send us small gifts from time to time and will even mail it right to our house to keep us smiling. 
They are good about reaching out to tell you what a good job you are doing or to congratulate you on any big progress you've made. 
They're good at promoting from within, I've seen lots of people move up within the last year and they always reach out to us to let us know when new roles are opening up. 
They have never had layoffs.
Their core value are, Be Passionate, Deliver Results, and Enhance Lives - I can truly say the live and breath these values and push to help all of their employees understand them and live them as well.","When in the office, the cubicles are tiny and cramped. Lenexa office could really benefit from a bigger space.
Wish we had a little more PTO each year but its still competitive at 2 weeks starting right away. 
They have all the benefits but the cost of them does seem on the high side."

265,Veterans United Home Loans,Great First Job!,2020-12-04,5.0,Loan Officer,Great atmosphere and team environment. Team becomes your family outside of home. Awesome benefits and management is approachable,I cannot think of anything!
266,Veterans United Home Loans,They actually care,2020-12-03,5.0,Loan Officer,"Veterans United is the only place I've ever worked that has made me truly feel valued as a human. They will encourage you to be yourself, make connections with your co-workers, and have fun while delivering results. Beyond that, they're very flexible (again, they recognize we are all humans with lives outside of their walls) and really take the time to get to know their employees beyond the work they do from 9-5.","While there are career advancement opportunities, sometimes if you're in a higher paying role (Loan Officer) you may not financially be able to make the advancements make sense."

I always felt like I could talk to my bosses and they were genuinely interested in helping me grow as a professional.,The company is absolutely stacked with talent so it can be kind of difficult for promotions. This is somewhat offset though by the fact they are growing so fast and need more awesome leaders.
271,Veterans United Home Loans,Work/Life Balance a Priority,2020-11-17,5.0,Business Development Representative,"The culture at this company is amazing. I have never worked at a company that would tell me to take care of myself and my family first, always reminding me that they are my #1 priority. I also love how it is so important to the company to give back to the community in a meaningful way. Employees even started their own foundation that gives back to veterans and local communities. I enjoy that I am encouraged to present new ideas to my manager and that I am not micromanaged.",I can't think of any right now.

Great pay and opportunity for growth. Overall great culture. and the majority of people are pleasant to work with!","Current volume is very hard to manage. They'll say overtime isn't mandatory, but staying ahead of your work is. This means roughly 50+hrs per week to stay on top of your work load. Not much time for relationships/activities outside of work, which is sort of a damper on your mental health. If you work at a normal or below normal pace, it seems like its easy to fall behind into the vicious cycle."
274,Veterans United Home Loans,Wonderful company!,2020-11-03,5.0,Client Connection Specialist,Genuinely cares about their employees and their clients,Nothing comes to mind at this point!

Awesome employees that will understand personal life situations and really rally behind you. Culture that allows employees to be themselves and have fun while getting stuff done. In terms of compensation, very good profit sharing and random cash bonuses rewarded to employees when the company is doing well. Overall great company to work for.","Mobility is limited unless you get a new job. There are a ton of internal job openings so it is possible to get a raise, you just need to get a new job. Don't expect to get a big raise in the same role. Benefits are pretty average, but nothing too bad."

You have to be OK with harassing people on the phone - not necessarily cold calling, but a majority of people you call are fed up and do not want to be contacted, yet you are required to call upwards of 4 times a day. You can do specific things to improve, but a lot of success depends on luck. Employee experience can vary greatly depending on managers style, could be better on other teams."

Free soda machine.,"They are no different than anywhere else except the work is much more stressful and it follows you home.  Managers promote friends and don't tell the higher ups what is really going on.  So the higher ups think everything is good while the workers LITERALLY cry at their desks.  This is not an isolated occurrence.  LOTS of people openly cry at their desks from stress.  Very inconsistent rules on how to do your job.  One day you could do X and be fine.  The next day you do X and somebody different says thats totally wrong and won't accept it.  They constantly state they aren't concerned about growth, but they are constantly hiring more Loan Officers, but not support staff to go with it.  There is no room to grow.  They want entry level jobs to be careers so you will do the same thing for 20 years and never get promoted.  They SCREAM work/life balance is important, and then give you 60 hours of work and innocently wonder why it isn't done in 40.  I literally had to negotiate with my manager about hours of overtime needed when the higher ups DIDN'T CARE.  But guess what he got bonused on?  That's right, in order to get a bigger bonus, my manager would not let me do my full job which just leads to more stress because then I get in trouble with other people who were counting on me to do my job.  Their values/mission statement sound great, they just don't actually mean anything.  They pay great because they HAVE to.   Save yourself the mental anguish.  The managers are inexperienced and do not have the guts or knowledge to resolve conflicts.  Bandaids for bullet holes.  Just look at their social media.  Their charitable foundation does do good things.  But if you look, they do not do anything without it also being a photo op.  If you think, like everyone else, that ""I can handle a bad job if the pay is good enough.""  just don't.  The only reason turnover isn't higher than it already is, is because people feel trapped.  Do not trap yourself with Veterans United Home Loans.  Oh, also while employed I used them to purchase and later refinance my own home.  They took so long doing it and messed it up so much, they had to give me like $600 in credit to stay in compliance.  And on the purchase, the manager that worked on it had my cash to close estimate wrong by around $3,000.  Yep, managers do not know the jobs they manage."

The benefits are out of this world great, and there’s a big effort to make things cool/fun for employees.","All the wonderful things that the leaders stand for is lost in some departments pretty closely to the top. Some departments have extremely unhealthy work life habits, are super cliquey, and some are managed very poorly from inexperienced and uninterested managers. With quick growth comes lots of struggles, but I think VU needs to openly and without bias face some of this negativity quickly (not just production and processing). Also, with all the events, benefits, perks, etc. sometimes there’s a hidden sense of - we want your life to be all about us and if not shame on you- and I’ve never really liked that feeling. Not everyone wants to spend work hours and free hours with their coworkers, and I don’t think that’s a bad thing necessarily."

There is usually flexibility in your daily schedule, I could come and go as I pleased during the day and no one cared.  You get the freedom to captain your own ship, and I really did love that.   If you're looking for a decent paying job while you transition to something else within a year or so, this is a great place to work.","Veterans United has created a high stress environment for those who work in production.  They chronically over hire loan officers, making it tough to meet sales requirements, and they chronically under-hire support staff like Account Managers, Assistants, and Underwriters.  In other words, getting business is difficult-- involving many nights and weekends away from your home life -- and the deals you do get are often sabotaged by the poor infrastructure of the company.   There was a point where it was taking almost 7 days to have an ""in-house"" underwriter review a loan.  That has gotten better, but could be much better.  
The pay structure is not great for loan officers.   This is a high-pressure sales job and loan officers are expected to be licensed experts, knowledgeable of corporate and federal guidelines for multiple loan products, maintain elite level customer service scores, and maintain a high score on a range of internal metrics.   Folks working in this job expect to be paid on a commission basis for their sales and VU has decided that it's more important for the owners to have private jets and homes on private islands than it is to properly take care of their talented work force.   
There is differential treatment of the loan officers regarding the pay scale.  There are some loan officers at the company who are able to earn a high commission solely because they were hired before a certain date and in most cases those loan officers have a huge team that does 80% of their work for them.  Meanwhile, other loan officers are paid hourly, must close 6 loans a month, and are required to PAY BACK THEIR OVERTIME.   In other words, you're working for free if you work over 40 hours, and you almost always work over 40.  Any bonus you earned would be confiscated to pay off your debt log.  The debt log also included appraisals for deals that fell through, often times for reasons beyond your control.  (Appraisals, on average, are between $500 and $750 each.) I would do the same amount of work and earn half the income as the guy next to me.   It's not enough for them to just be a successful company, they now have to be #1 in the country in terms of volume.  Of course, this is done on the backs of their employees and the company reaps the benefits.  
It is impossible to leave for vacation.  Taking a day off is no big deal, but taking a week off sets you back so far that it makes you unable to even enjoy your vacation while you're away from work.    Not to mention that even while you're gone you'll still be answering calls and emails from clients (and coworkers who are covering for you) --  constantly.   
The work space is unacceptable for adults working in this industry.  Loan officers at Veterans United work shoulder to shoulder in cubicles, like minimum wage workers at a customer service call center.   A loan officer at any other bank would have an office or a private work space to carry out their business while working with a borrower's personal and confidential information.  A professional working in this industry would be turned off knowing they would have to work in that kind of environment.  Simply unprofessional.  Have an upset client?  You'll be taking that call in front of about 15 other people unless you walk outside the building.  But at the end of the day, VU is a loan mill that found a niche in the mortgage market that was immune to the market crash (VA loans), and they take advantage of our nation's finest to make a buck.   They routinely give loans to folks fresh out of bankruptcy, short sales, etc.   They just want to close the deal, and the VA loan makes it easy.   
The VU foundation is funded by donations directly from the salaries of employees (I myself donated), yet the company takes the credit for the work the foundation does.   They get the credit and keep their money.   It's a win/win for VU."

This is why I avoided coming to work for VU sooner. I was a skeptic. Who were these people sporting VU shirts, posting pics to social media, constantly talking about how great it was. Well, I wasted years of my life by not coming to VU sooner! I have amazing leadership around me. My colleagues are wonderful. The environment is fantastic. And mostly importantly, I come to work everyday feeling like I make a difference. I absolutely love what I do. VU is top notch all around.","I think VU is an environment where hard workers can thrive. If you don't want to work hard and be a team player, then this is not the place for you.

We also had a really fun internship program with personal development classes and events with the execs.

422,Veterans United Home Loans,VU is the most unique company around - none better!,2017-03-22,5.0,Account Manager,"I have worked in a variety of companies from very corporate to local businesses.  This company has a culture unlike any I have ever seen.  Let’s start with the perks – like the free vending and soda machines or the catered breakfasts and lunches or all the free swag they give away.  They provide free gym memberships and a free healthy snack fridge.  The dress code is extremely casual.  There are annual events like “Field Day” and the Christmas party but throughout the year there are luaus, crawfish boils, game days, pancake days, campouts, holiday parties for kids, I could go on all day.  They truly emphasize a work hard play hard mentality.  Compensation and pay are very comparable to other companies and VU loves to promote from within so if you can get in at an entry level position, career growth is only limited by your own determination and hard work.  But the reason I love this company so much is that employees are treated like people, not numbers.  Upper management and executives care about the employees happiness and well-being – it feels very much like a family.",The jobs are very competitive and it's hard to get in the door.  Everyone wants to work at VU so they have their pick.  You can be very qualified and still not get hired.

425,Veterans United Home Loans,Probably the Best All Around Company I'll Ever Work For,2017-03-05,5.0,Loan Specialist,"VU is like no other employer. It was my first job out of college and I'm already convinced I'll never work at another place as great as VU unless I open up my own business one day. The culture there is second to none. You get to know GREAT people who work hard, have fun, and do their best to make other people's lives better every day. 

The compensation was good. Perks were great - they appreciate and take care of their employees. Great place to start a career. Since leaving VU and moving back closer to home I have had the opportunity to work for a Major League Baseball team and looking back a year later - even working in MLB doesn't compare to VU. 

I would recommend working here to anyone I know. I still stay in touch with a handful of people I worked with here and look forward to visiting again soon. The sky is the limit at VU - I hope the culture, their employees and upper management never changes as the company continues to grow and get larger.","Just like any job as a loan officer (sales) you will work a lot of hours and to succeed you'll be there late nights and weekends. This isn't necessarily a con of VU or the job, just something that comes with being in sales and doing loans."
426,Veterans United Home Loans,Truly Amazing,2017-03-04,5.0,Call Center Supervisor,Everything. I have worked in many professions for both big and small companies. I have never found a company that cares for it's employees and customers the way that VU does. From the first day I showed up to work I was welcomed as if I had been there for 10 years. They are committed to their values. Not only during work hours but even outside of work. Management has a true open door policy and they are never to busy to stop and just chat for a few moments and that includes all of the executives and owners even. I truly feel part of a family working here and every person truly cares as much about each customer and the experience we give them as we do each other.,"There are no perfect companies in the world and everyone has room to grow and improve all the time. I can say without a doubt though that Veterans United is as close as you will find to it. The only negative that I would point out here would be that sometimes being a company that is spread out so much, it can make it hard to keep communication going on issues and culture can definitely be difficult to stay on top of, but they are doing a fantastic job of doing it. They constantly look for ways to improve not only for employees but for customer experience too."
427,Veterans United Home Loans,Unable to acknowledge its struggles with diversity,2017-03-01,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great culture if you look like everyone else,"No executive buy in for a more diverse workforce
Marketing does a great job of displaying a diverse workforce that does not exist and comes across as fake
Many new hire orientations with no people of color except the diversity and inclusion rep
Forced to watch a video in orientation about the DI committee and how the former CTO appreciates diversity but doesn't actually hire it
Lily white culture committee
In general just a huge inability to own issues the company faces
DI team loves patting themselves on the back but no real initiatives or acknowledgement to improve the situation"

431,Veterans United Home Loans,Underwriting,2017-02-06,1.0,Underwriter,Very casual dress code.  Cool kitchen with lots of perks as employee to encourage no breaks or lunches.  The perks are not the same in each office with corporate employees having additional perks not offered to other company employees outside the corporate location.,"The company promotes a family balance work life with forced overtime & is not family friendly.  The company is for single employee with no kids.  Client advocate issues must be resolved no matter what time of day or the employees personal obligations towards children at home, often occurring at the end of the business day.  Loan officers are allowed to verbally assault Underwriters and name call with no consequences.  Absolutley no room for advancement in career or pay unless you are related or friend of management.  Department has family relatives reporting to each other with no employee handbook regulations to stop this.  Pay increases promised, then not received when business goes down.  Pay increases promised, never received, no one will tell you why or they are provided to some but not others inconsistently and in secret.  Training department advances employees in an unfair or inconsistent method.  Training department will openly brag no one advances if they not liked or friends of the trainers and will help some new employees not all.  If you provide this information to management consequences follow.  Biased work from home program;  full time remote is not provided to every one, favored people allowed to work from home when they want while on facebook/instagram or watching baby/toddler children who cannot complete their daily required work with others being asked to do extra work to cover this person.  Pay is not withheld and they are not required to use PTO.  Employees within the same job title work quantity is not the same.  Few are asked to produce at a higher pace and quantity with no benefit except a job.  They not allowed to step down from the position.  Vacation approval for major holidays is always given to the same employees, unfair and inconsistent. Management is never available and no one ever knows what is going on.   Management is not held to any responsibility level or knowledge of product to assist employees.  Management gets special hours, is sick and does not turn in PTO so to get paid.  Reprimand used to eliminate employees, not appropriaqtely, and not handled the same for all."

Do not expect this to be an easy jobs, definitely work hard play hard situation"
436,Veterans United Home Loans,All of the rumors are true--but it's no easy job,2016-12-13,5.0,Account Manager,"The work is challenging, but everyone around you genuinely wants you to succeed and will do anything you ask (or don't ask) them to do to help you.

You are valued, respected, and treated well. Your victories don't go unnoticed, and you are rewarded generously for your hard work.

The training program is rigorous, which is super important--the job is hard! You definitely don't feel under-prepared when you finish your training. You can tell they want you to do well and give you every tool to be a success.

The company wants you to stick around! It's incredibly obvious that they want their employees to be here for the long haul--and they definitely give you the incentives to stay. I'm so spoiled working here I don't know that I'll be employable anywhere else that doesn't do everything VU does for us.

Even upper management knows your name (if they're in the same building as you), they'll greet you and ask how your weekend was, they'll go to happy hour with you, they really care!","It's not easy! People hear all about the parties and perks, but the job is really hard--that's why we get all of the fun perks, because if you didn't have the fun, silly things to balance it out, people would burn out."

447,Veterans United Home Loans,VUHL,2016-08-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,the salaries are comparable to others,takes a long time to get hired!
448,Veterans United Home Loans,Amazing company!,2016-08-14,5.0,Account Manager,"I've worked at Veterans United for about four months now, and I can easily say it's the best company I've ever been a part of. About a year ago, they implemented a pretty solid two-month training course for new Account Managers that's been extremely beneficial. I was really impressed with the training I received. 

VU is an incredibly proactive company when it comes to making changes that are needed in order to improve process efficiency. They live their values and base pretty much all of their major decisions on upholding those values. 

Most importantly, they take care of their employees and genuinely want what's best for them. Very rewarding company to work for. That's a rare characteristic in any industry, but especially hard to find in the financial services industry.","Most of the negative comments I've seen are because the company is going through some growing pains. They have grown exponentially the past couple of years, and it seems like they are improving processes and hiring in order to keep up with the growth. I honestly don't see this as a con (having work to do is never a bad thing), but I can see where that can be a frustrating factor for some people. Most of the Account Managers are stressed right now because the summer is busy, and new employees are getting up to speed. Again, not necessarily a con since the company is taking steps to improve this, but it is a result of the growth and therefore a current reality. 

The family health insurance packages are honestly not that great, and could be a bit more competitive. Deductibles are fairly high in relation to the monthly premiums."
449,Veterans United Home Loans,Customer Service Representative (Call Center),2016-08-06,4.0,,"I worked overnight so my job was extremely easy, I was assigned a little bit of busy work since I didn't get that many calls but it only lasted an hour or two, and out of an 8 hour shift that isn't that bad. Amazing pay, gifts from the company (just because), you get a raise after 6 months (usually), and amazing co-workers (not that I got to see them that much since I worked overnight)! You're part of a team and every once in a while you will do cool activities to get to know each other, paid for by the company (you don't have to participate if you don't want to!) I got to go to Paint the Town for free, and got free Panera and BBQ on a few different occasions! Also, you will get to participate in Field Day and the Call Center Casino Night! I won free Cardinals tickets and a bluetooth speaker, and it was my first time playing those kinds of games. In the office there's a free vending machine, free soda machine, constant support from team leads, coworkers, and even your boss, a couple slides in the buildings, and countless clubs and teams to join through the company! Man, this place is great and I really mean it. I was so happy to have the opportunity to work here. 
Also, if you are looking to move up in the company, this is the place to be! You don't even need a college degree, work in the call center long enough and you can study for a higher position and test into it! And everyone is really supportive and encourages you to do so!","Although I love the company and I feel like leaving was probably a dumb decision, there are reasons nonetheless. Working in the call center means sitting in a chair for 8 hours. You do get two or three 15 minute breaks, but sitting down for that long was really hard for me. I suppose you can get a stand-up desk which many people do, but it just seemed uncomfortable to me. VU is growing very rapidly, so if you work during the day, you will receive call after call after call without a lot of time in between each one. Therefore, the day-shift is something I was not interested in doing, I did a few and it was so monotonous I wanted to rip my hair out! However, this was my first call center job and I realized that it just wasn't for me. Nothing against VU's call center specifically. 
Watch out because the vending machine is free, along with the soda machine, and very often you will find free doughnuts in the break room along with free pizza, chicken, tacos or whatever they are providing for lunch that day! (They do this occasionally, but not every day) What's so bad about that? Well, its super hard to resist, and you might gain some weight. But I also have poor self control, so if you're better than me or you just don't care that much, then disregard this complaint! The real reason I left though is because I am returning to school and my overnight shift won't work with my schedule. Also, working with one other person gets kind of lonely. The day shift is full of friendly people though, and it is very easy to make friends! Since the day shift is so busy however, I wasn't interested in it. Even if I was though, it takes months to get your schedule changed...which brings me to Advice to Management."

Most everyone working at VU truly cares about their job and those they are getting into homes.,"Very stressful industry. At times it felt as though the Underwriters didn't realize we were all on the same team trying to accomplish the same goal.

It is easy for LO's to take advantage of Transaction Coordinators. In my experience I did most of the work and he LO's reaped all the financial benefit. Be sure to negotiate a higher hourly rate."
454,Veterans United Home Loans,Seriously???,2016-03-04,5.0,IT Management,"I did that to grab your attention... When I heard about VU from a friend a few years ago, I wasn't looking for a new opportunity.  But I thought at the time it would be a great place to work IF just half of what he said was true..  After finishing my first year  I can say that it is and more and I'm not prone to exaggeration.
A fast-paced, growing environment with no end in sight, VU is the first company for which I've worked that puts such a heavy, day-to-day emphasis on their company values- so much so that they are a large portion the annual employee review.
Management is very transparent:  part of the company-wide emphasis this year has been Trust- in yourself, your team members, and the Company as whole- all are encouraged to extend trust and work to develop trust with others.
Compensations are generous and random- from walking into the office one morning and getting a box of candy at my desk with a note from the CEO telling me (and every other qualifying employee) VU just plunked $1000 into my 401(k)-  Seriously???  To naming all employees Employee Of The Year at the Christmas Party and putting ANOTHER $3000 in our 401(k)'s-SERIOUSLY???  VU is serious about each employee's future and they show it by leading the way in committing resources to each employees future, not only their own.","There can be a sense of employee entitlement at times-because the company is so generous the expectation level increases.  Sounds crazy, but yeah, it happens."

Free food and free massages. The Christmas parties are a blast!,"The constant growth means that you will never stay in one place for long, and the continuous movement affects team output. There needs to be more willing hands to help backed up departments. A little tired of seeing extremely busy departments that struggle to get done by the end of the day versus departments that appear to have a lot of people not doing much. Not all managers and team leads are competent or engaged. Like others have said, there are a few that persist at VU simply because they've been here a long time and have connections. Sometimes good employees get thrown under the bus by bad management. The benefits package isn't the greatest. You only get 2 weeks a year and that includes both sick time and vacation.

There are PLENTY of opportunities to move up in the company. Starting in the call center is a great way to get your foot in the door, for VERY decent pay in an entry level position. 

I found out I was pregnant about 4 weeks after I started and my manager's first words when I told him were ""That's so awesome! Congrats!"" (VU has 5 weeks of paid maternity leave btw!)

The way the company treas the employees with perks and company events is a rarity in the corporate world. The pay is pretty decent, depending on your position. Most departments do live up to the company value of ""be passionate and have fun"",","Processing in particular has had a very rough time keeping up with production demands. As soon as one part of the department is adequately staffed, another part is grossly understaffed due to moving people around too much. Its not uncommon for people to work 50-60 hour weeks, plus mandatory weekends on top of that. The executive leadership of the company does genuinely care about their employees, but I feel like the message doesn't filter down through the levels of management to make the people who actually do all the work to close the loans feel appreciated enough. The communication from management tends to be lacking as well. There is hardly any opportunity for growth, and often it seems like you have to be buddies with the hiring manager to get promoted, even if other people had better credentials."

The majority of the management team is very supportive and continually demonstrates their commitment by going above and beyond.

Our ""leaders"" that were responsible for guiding us within our market were very unethical and got away with very unfavorable business practices.  As other reviewers previously stated, Veterans United should immediately terminate employees for unethical and compromising patterns of behavior.  After exposing our team to a great deal of stress and countless internal audits and investigations, the decision was finally made to terminate several of the individuals that were setting us back from flourishing.  Sadly enough, these changes occurred far too late and many of our team members were essentially forced to resign due to the unstable environment, lack of support and sheer ignorance on behalf of management.

Unfortunately, I was reeled in by all of the great reviews here on Glass Door as well as knowing a couple of former co-workers who said they enjoyed it.  I left a professional position to join VUHL and within two months, I regretted it.  I was thrown into a different position than the one I was hired for and eventually ended up working for an incompetent manager which lead me to leave their employment.

This was a very frustrating place to work.  Due to favoritism, some employees can get away with surfing the web, watching YouTube, disappearing for long periods of time, not answering emails for days, etc while others who spend their time actually working would get chastised for abstract things that cannot be measured.  

The long and short of it is that, at this time, this is not a company where someone who wants to be treated fairly should work.  Leaving my old position to work here was the biggest mistake of my life and I truly hope this post will help others from making the same mistake.

While the company values are great, they are meaningless if they are not enforced on a consistent basis as integrity is greatly lacking with some."
526,Veterans United Home Loans,"Great, agile company that appreciates creativity and hard work.",2013-08-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone genuinely cares about what they do, and the people they serve. They really stand by their values, and have done a good job at getting the best out of young and ambitious people. I don't know that anyone else in Columbia could get as much quality out of their employees as Veterans United has.","Since they are a young company who likes to promote from within, their mid level managers don't necessarily have the leadership and development skills to make the people under them better. They are developing and are generally strong performers, but don't have the maturity to develop their teams."
527,Veterans United Home Loans,"A great place to start, a poor place to land.",2013-08-04,3.0,Account Manager,The company culture is phenomenal.  It is fun to go to work for a couple of years with other young professionals who are highly motivated and energetic.  The company has it's heart in the right place with philanthropy and service to the community.,"You're worked extremely hard as an account manager for very little recognition and little chance of upward movement.  Professional development at VUHL is virtually non-existent and so are genuine career opportunities.  It's a good place to go to work to gain a little professional experience and pad your resume, however, it isn't going to offer the long-term career progression.  Benefits are pretty average (they throw a lot of ""freebies"" in your face but don't offer much in line of retirement, work-life-balance, or tuition reimbursement)."

I'd say only Google has us beat as far as taking care of employees (but we're continually improving).","Parking is a nightmare, some of the positions seem really underpaid compared to other departments, and sometimes you can get pulled to another team to help them out with busy projects."

We are passionate about what we do, but we know how to have fun while serving our clients. We care about our employees and their families.  My family embraces all that is Veterans United, not just me.  The leadership genuinely cares about those we serve, as well as the employees fulfilling our duties. We are given opportunities to spread our wings and share ideas.  We don't just deliver results, we do it with the upmost integrity and enthusiasm.","Though it may sound cliche, there is nothing negative I have to share about Veterans United Home Loans. The company encompasses all that it means to live out values.  The ""extras"" and dedication to employees never ceases to amaze me.  At the same time, we are always focusing on how to make things better, and WOW our clients. No cons for VU."

Management usually seems to listen to suggestions.","Not as competitive as other employers in the area when it comes to pay. Also, having sick days as part of your vacation time makes people hesitant to take time off for something relaxing or fun because you might need the time off for something important later."
534,Veterans United Home Loans,Great company with lots of perks destined to do great things,2012-11-19,5.0,Online Marketing,"Pretty much everything. Great work environment, great coworkers. This is a great place to work if you want to give back to the community as well with the Veterans United Foundation raising over $1 million each year to give back to military causes.",Not many cons at all. I really can't even think of one worth putting on here.
535,Veterans United Home Loans,An amazing place to work,2012-11-15,5.0,Online Marketing,"VUHL does amazing things for employees to make them both happy and more productive (free lunch, massages, etc) but makes them really stand out is the bottom line is not a dollar sign. The true bottom line is the lives touched.",Getting specific feedback about direction and goals can be a little difficult at times.
536,Veterans United Home Loans,A Company Culture Where Employees Matter,2012-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The company puts a lot into the quality of the environment in which its employees work.

537,Veterans United Home Loans,A company committed to excellence,2012-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been blown away with the overall awesomeness of Veterans United.  The people who work here are energetic, motivated, fun, hard-working, and welcoming.  Everyone is happy and excited to be a part of such an amazing and growing company.  They are passionate about their jobs and helping people.  The values of the company are not just writing on the wall, but a company culture that is visible in everything done here.  On top of that, the benefits and perks are something I only imagined was possible in my job: free lunches, free massages, fun outings, free healthy (and unhealthy) food and drinks, Nerf gun wars, contests, prizes, games, family get-togethers, lunch & learns...all of which cause you to be surrounded by happy and productive employees.  I'm excited to see where my career here takes me.","If you cannot have fun at work while being productive this isn't the company for you.  Work hard, play hard.  It's not the normal mortgage company or any company for that matter--it's a fun and dynamic culture. Change is very normal around here with the expansion of the company so if you don't like change you might reconsider working here."

539,Veterans United Home Loans,A Company with an end in sight.,2012-05-03,2.0,,A lot of the workers are friendly people/young and very active in the community. VUHL is very charitable and has a reputation to back it up. The offices are brand new and very nice.,"The problem with this organization is that it has hired an weak base for growth. At least 33% of VUHL employees are not competent enough to do their jobs. The reasons many tech start ups grow and make lots of money--highly educated/highly skilled/highly intelligent base of employees and leaders...something VUHL does not have. There are lots of youngsters and that isn't always a bad thing, but for VUHL it is. They just don't have the intellectual talent to stay in business another 10 years. This is a job I am constantly looking forward to replace. I feel like my hard work in college could be better used elsewhere.

On another note, the business model isn't sustainable. Eventually veterans will realize they would much rather have face to face contact with people they owe hundreds of thousands of dollars to. Bottom line, these jobs are not long lasting, are not filled with intellectual capital, and VUHL will not be around forever. Because at this point, you can apply for 5 jobs at vuhl and get all of them without any skills."
540,Veterans United Home Loans,"Notice how a lot of these reviews are written in similar manners, very shady and it shows",2012-04-25,1.0,,"They give you free lunch on Mondays and have a decent benefit package. Salary is OK, but not great. They give a lot to the community.","Well, for starters, look at the reviews on here. It looks like to me they sent their marketing interns to spend a couple of hours boasting the company. However, this place is not a 4.6/5.0, it is barely a 3.0/5.0. Half of the employees who work here are great. They are friendly, passionate, go-getters, and love their job. The problem is the other half. The half that couldn't get a job in the real professional world. Rude, excuse-makers, and plain ignorant. There are several managers like someone listed below who are a joke. Outside of VUHL, they couldn't manage a fast food restaurant. They don't have any type of structure, either. Don't expect to know what is going on from one day to the next. VUHL does give a lot to the Columbia community, but it comes at the expense of Veterans of our country.

Stop and think what they sell....they in no way have anything better to offer a veteran than a local bank who you can see EVERY day if you needed to. The set up isn't one that seems like it could last for more than 10 years at most.

Too many uneducated people here. It seems like almost everyone is 22 years old and graduated last month. They party a lot but they will never compare to a respectful fortune 500 company with the talent-less people they hire."
541,Veterans United Home Loans,"A great place to work, learn, and grow.",2012-04-19,5.0,,"If you're looking to work for a company that pushes you to better yourself and your community every day, this is the place for you. VUHL is a fast-paced environment where your job description changes as the company continues to grow. You will never get bored with doing mundane tasks 40 hours/week. You will have ample opportunity to learn something new every day from a company that has proven to be an innovator in the industry. Most of all, VUHL engages in countless activities to serve veterans and the community as a whole. Employees are treated like people, and management genuinely cares about your well-being. The perks are talked about in most of these posts (free massages, free snacks, casual dress, etc.), but the greatest benefit you'll receive is the opportunity to grow as an individual and leave every day with more knowledge than you came in with. Their three values are the cornerstone of everything the company does, and were written by the employees themselves. If you work here, you will live them every day.","If you're looking to get by with the bare minimum and are afraid of change, this is not the place for you. You simply won't be able to keep up and will probably be miserable."
542,Veterans United Home Loans,Outstanding,2012-04-03,5.0,,"The energy in this place is incredible. The management here is all about going after new ideas and trying new things. There is always something new to try, something new to work on. The ""go get em"" attitude is infectious and makes you want to do more, learn more, try harder and excel. The management and employees are dedicated to giving back to the community. It's not just lip service here. It's the real deal. The Foundation we started is an example of that. It's not like any other company I have ever worked at. I'd highly recommend this as a place to work for anyone.",The growth has been hard to stay on top of.

Everyone is so great to work with, not just because they are nice people, but because they are all so smart and passionate about their role in the company.  It's a very cool thing to be a part of, and haven't seen any work environment quite like this.  There are lots of other perks too - casual dress, great events, free food (vending machine and fresh food fridge), faith forums, etc.","The company is growing very quickly, and there are growing pains that go along with it.  Sometimes we are understaffed in certain departments, or there is so much going on that changes aren't always communicated to everyone as timely as they should be.  Changes are constant at VAMC, but I guess that also helps us stay ahead of the competition!"

It's nice to work with friends I know from college.,We do work odd shifts and long hours and weekends to make sure phones are covered. Perfect job coming out of college to get business experience.

No job security, me and a couple friends all worked there and none of us are left. They just replaced us with new Mizzou graduates. We only know a few people who worked there more than a couple years. It's fun so enjoy it, but know it's a revolving door and you'll get replaced with some interns. Benefits were better at my other job. Commission wasn't as good as my friends had told me, basically just work for your hourly pay."

The people that make up the VAMC team are energetic, fun, smart and caring.  The company values are truly lived out on a daily basis.
