83,Visa Inc.,Corporate jungle law rules this place.,2022-03-11,2.0,"Senior Manager, Data Science Labs","1. If you're serious about doing work, it's a great open, and collaborative culture.

2. Probably one of the most proactive HR's you'll see in an organization. Policies are always updated and well communicated through various mediums, HRBPs are ever present and supportive.

3. A good paying employer, but for many tech roles(SWE, DS, DE), they are actually much lower and nowhere in the same ballpark as silicone valley.

4. If you're from a business background, this is a great place to get ahead.

5. If you find meaning in helping credit card-issuing banks and other major merchants make more money, this is the place. 

6. Has 100's of PBs in clean mastered data, a newly minted data scientist's playground. IT and engineering support outside of the US is a great enabler.

7. Visa is a fantastic brand to have on your resume.","1. I've had 3 different managers ever since. For the first time in over a decade of private sector experience, I was told that Promotions are not related to job performance. Essentially, the job role has to be created, and the internal staff seeking a promotion via that role, has to apply. Then you'll be compared against several other external candidates.

2. The above is all smokescreen. It is nothing related to how much effort was put in, or even how impactful your work is to the company or her clients. I've been reprimanded more than once not for the work that i did, but that i didn't take the opportunity to network with my clients' higher ups(as a data scientist!). Clients can even write-in to say how much you've uplifted their business and all you'll get is a nice email pat on the back. It's all about visibility, the correct people knowing you, a lot of sales talk, and politicking with the right groups.

3. For most people, their role is basically to help the boss succeed as an employee(hey I'm an employee too?), you do their work, they front the engagement to clients and internal management, and yes they get the credit. 

4. You'll see middle managers who cannot move up for one reason or another(usually politics), start creating more layers of reporting under them. These additional levels of reporting serve no additional purpose, and just adds fiction and more powerplay into a typical workday.

5. Visa prides itself as an open and culturally inclusive workplace, but it really is a very US-centric environment. In any country office you visit, extroversion and (tactfully) speaking out will get you to higher places much. The quieter data scientists are basically reduced to pulling data and slogging over Powerpoint decks for years.

6. There are super talented engineers with PhD backgrounds having a hard time expanding their role within the organization just because they can't articulate the upsides of their invention in a way that make MBAs and business folk want to invest in their idea.

7. Yes there are incentives for IP and inventions, but it really is about the quantity of patents filed. It's a phallic competition against Mastercard to see who has more patents. We have an actual dashboard to track who has more patents filed."

Upper management is clinging onto Waterfall and not embracing Agile practices. Upper management sometimes comes into our Scrum ceremonies and berates team members even though they've been asked to stop. This behavior oppresses team members and hampers them from opening up and asking important questions. Consistent hurdles with management. Developers are put on multiple projects instead of being able to focus on one, but expected to be 100% on all the projects all the time -- this creates high turnover."

147,Visa Inc.,Horrible people managers ruining the company,2022-02-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Visa is an extremely recognizable brand and it's cool to be a part of a company that has such a global presence and has the capability to impact all corners of the world. The benefits at Visa are hard to beat, 10% 401k match, HSA match, ESPP, excellent healthcare coverage with Cigna. The work life balance is very manager / team specific.

Al, the CEO is great, he is super down-to-earth and relatable. He makes you feel genuinely cared about as an employee.","HR doesn't have a seat at the table, which in turn impacts every employee negatively. Leaders from other orgs at Visa were selected to run HR, so HR is a mess, Visa hired a chief diversity officer who left after a few months. There are awful people managers who drive entire teams and top performers out of the company, yet these managers stay in their roles with no consequences (maybe they get some weekly ""coaching"" to check a box). Visa has a ~2 hour manager training online course before allowing people to have direct reports. It's really luck of the draw if you get a good manager, so make sure to vet your manager A LOT during the interview -- ask to talk to their other direct reports. 

Visa sent a bunch of internal surveys about returning to the office and the majority of people wanted to work remotely. Instead of listening to their employees, Visa decided to have everyone return 3 days per week. Leadership is going in the office and making a big display about how great it is to try to entice people, what a joke. Everyday I see a new person on LinkedIn announce they are leaving Visa."

Far from the values the company publicly declares, or those just do not land right in the regions like cemea and cissee 
Double standards. Eg speak up is officially encouraged, but most likely you will be branded as a “negative person”, punished and removed from the team and company. Issues and concerns when raised were “investigated” really slow…., with zero outcome, feels like the company is not comfortable with addressing the issues, especially if Leadership /people managers were involved, and opted to not to tackle  uncomfortable things.
Slow growth and almost  no promotion, though  the work load was growing steadily. A lot of bureaucracy, processes and slow decision making, shifting responsibility is like a corporate sport."

Culture of bullying, gaslighting and discrimination from managers who don’t adhere to policies but are allowed to get away with it. Employee relations is non existent and in my time, I’ve seen many employees’ mental health suffer because of the culture created.

On an operational level, it is a very political organisation that is undone by bureaucracy and middle management. If you work in tech and you want to build things, you’ll be frustrated at Visa, very little opportunity for creativity."

I suggest going to Visa as a full time associate.,"In my opinion: You are absolutely viewed as an intern at Visa. Program management is TERRIBLE and extremely restrictive. The actual purpose of the program is NOT to find a full time position, as assumed. If you find you match at Visa before the 4 rotations, you will not be allowed to convert to full time early. Also if you leave and try to come back you will be blackballed from the company. You are limited to only the options of rotations presented and nothing outside of this. You are not allowed to clock your overtime, even if your job requires working more than a 40 hour work week (which is extremely difficult giving that many team members are located across time zones). HR is open to any criticism nor feedback and favoritism is extremely prevalent. Many of the promises made when interviewing failed all expectations. This program is not ideal for any new graduate."

This results in the same toxic culture that leads to the attrition in the very same firms that those consultants left. Because it’s a young “firm,” none of VCA’s leaders have worked their way up the ranks in the same way that leaders at other firms have. As a result, their expectations are not based on their personal experience at VCA. Some of the leaders were never consultants, but were hired due to their experience at Visa or in payments/financial services. You would imagine that such leaders would bring a breath of fresh air, and help dismantle the poor habits carried over from consulting firms. They’re worse. For example, those leaders have a tendency to under-project the amount of time required to complete client deliverables, forget that people are people, and neglect to build in buffers into their own projects. Projects with such leaders feel like sprinting in a marathon every time even with staff and data science feedback. Those same leaders have work/life balance while their project teams are stressed and burned out by the end of their projects."

There are also many double standards. In the year where employees got a pay freeze, senior execs continue to have their double digit percentage increment. This is an irony because one of Visa's leadership principle is ""Leading by Example"".

There is many opportunities to achieve great things in Visa as there are many talented engineers if Visa makes an effort to retain them. On the other hand, Visa has to be more firm to remove engineers who have proven to be not up to standards."

- compensation is pretty good, even relative to the Bay Area
- the product basically runs itself in many ways
- interesting work that touches a huge range of human experiences and geographies
- access to an incredible amount of interesting data
- kind, empathetic people

Pro or Con depending on your point of view
- high job stability, meaning it is pretty rare that anyone is let go
- certain roles are pretty cushy
- low accountability","- Visa is an entrenched company with a lot to lose, meaning they are not willing to take risks
- Visa pays lip service to new technologies, but at the end of the day, they have a vested interest in the current system, so they aren't actually working to push forward the technical frontier
- Especially at more senior levels, the organization is intensely political. It is basically impossible to get anything done unless you know the right people (speaking as someone who actually did know the right people). And even then, the organization moves slowly
- There has been a lot of brain drain over the last 12 to 18 months
- Visa is part of the old guard in finance / payments. The leading companies of the next generation in payments are all looking for ways to work around Visa (and the networks generally). They may not be successful, but it puts Visa in the position of constantly playing defense rather than going to execute on new, interesting business opportunities"

315,Visa Inc.,Not Inclusive; Leaders aren't held accountable for misuse of power and privilege,2021-12-01,3.0,Human Resources,"Visa as a whole has many great benefits. Overall, company is a pleasant place to work.","I work in HR (People) and it's extremely toxic. Senior leaders have way too much power and very little accountability on how they treat employees. White women in leadership have essentially ran most Black and Brown employees away. Very little room for growth or opportunity if you are a person of color, and/or at the Associate/Analyst level in HR. Visa HR claims to be committed to diversity, but only when it's attached to a hiring metric or what is shown to the public. Sr. Directors and above are not held accountable for their lack of diversity plan to fill internal, leadership roles. Most of the leadership roles go to white women and it's disgusting how they get away with the lack of transparency. 

If you're considering a role in HR, aka People, strongly reconsider your options with other, more INCLUSIVE companies.

I will also say there are some AMAZING teams within Visa and I'm hoping to transfer one day soon. It's so disappointing because I actually LOVE the work I get to do, but my current leadership team is not a good fit for my mental health.

Overall, I would recommend this company to work for but NOT HR/PEOPLE. You will get trampled unless you are a person of privilege or have rank."

Lots of opportunities within the company to explore other roles. I enjoy the ownership and exposure that comes with my team.,"Limited training for new employees, which makes networking a little difficult. Promotions seem hard to come by. Pay is low for PM, and new hires are coming in at higher pay with no sign of change for tenured employees. A “higher raise pool for market inflation” was touted for this year but appears the average was just 4% (higher than normal but definitely not in line with inflation).

1- our position are customer service, however, we can only spend about 4-7 minutes on a call to be able to reach our goals. How do you expect us to provide a great customer service when we can even spend time talking to the cardholder?
2- You can take between 50 to 120 calls a day but if you sit on after call (when you dont put yourself back im ready) for about 2 minutes, managers or supervisor will send you a message to ask why you are not ready to tale calls.
3- There is always some system issues but you are still expected to meet the numbers at the end of the month.
4- You really do not have someone to report anything to, managers do not care. They won’t fight for you no matter how good of an agent you are. 
5- even higher mentioned before that we should just be happy to still have a job during the pandemic while someone mentioned our mental health.
6- in the office, you can barely use the restroom. we have to wait for our lunch and breaks because we are only allowed 4 minutes of personal time a day. Can you imagine using the restroom in 4 minutes?

Business is predominantly senior manager level or above - which is testament to the calibre of talent they hire, however, this makes it difficult for junior staff to navigate a career, as there often aren’t any roles available at the next step. 

Viewed by HR as a ‘cohort’ of apprentices, which doesn’t suit individual difference, preference or performance, as the best and worst talent are given same career options. Additionally, 4 years is also too long for an apprenticeship programme, and limits individual career progression - apprentices remain and are viewed as an apprentice by the business for 4 years. My advice would be to revert the programme back to previous versions, which allowed employees to graduate into full time roles after 2 years."

- Decent benefits","I have been with VISA Inc (Bangalore, India.) for nearly 6 years now, of which worked in a team called MAPPD under a Sr. Director (MA). I joined Visa with a big career aspiration like every one with full of dreams.
I hate to say that i regret having to work for such a manager and a team. 
1. He indirectly harassed me mentally, by providing no good work and no growth
2. Each time i have a conversation with him he always asked me ""so, will you look for an opportunity out side?"" 
3. He was one of the lowest rated manager and yet higher management supported him. So many people left because of him, yet management didn't care.
4. He asked me learn new technologies every 3 months and yet i was not there for promotion even after proving myself with assigned projects.
5. During COVID time i suffered mentally, and i'm aware of the comment i'm making here that ""he is responsible for that"", and he made me feel useless.
6. I blame myself partly for staying in MAPPD for 5 years and tried showing my loyalty (myself to blame for this mistake), thinking i might get some growth.
7. After changing team, my current manager always ask me why you didn't get promotion all these years?. Your previous manager has to give write up for your promotions and all....for all these drama, i'm the victim. 
8. They don't respect loyalty and don't give proper reasons why our growth is not happening. 

I'm still working for Visa with full of regret every day. And hoping for a decent change."

you will end up supporting and maintaining the code/job most of the time 
In JD they will not mention the support part, but every team do the support
Also, your team will own a lot of servers and you would be responsible for patching those servers. This will not be in your JD, but you will end up doing it. I know people spend 50% of their time on this. Sometimes entire weekend on this. Ask your HR/manager regarding this before joining.
Not very open to innovation or doing by yourself. Mostly depend on an external vendor. However, I did see this is changing slowly.
Very little recognization for your work. Managers are not very focused on your development.

555,Visa Inc.,The most humiliating and disappointing working experience ever!,2021-08-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Standard benefits and flexible working during the pandemic.,"Career Development: The worst experience ever. I joined Visa 2 years ago and accepted a more junior position to start with. I believed that good companies would work with me and provided me opportunities to move back up. Contrary to my expectations, they put me in positions to ""fill holes"", which was completely different from what was described during interviews. I was transferred to another team after a year and was able to better utilize some of my skills and experience. Unfortunately, given the change of the company direction, my role changed again - back to the ""filling holes"" mode. Despite I delivered high quality of work and received very positive feedback, I was not given any opportunities to move forward. I had been proactively looking for internal opportunities and I finally found a role that matched my skills, experience, and levels, but I was not allowed to apply as they said the position was 2 levels above me. (That level used to be one level above me and HR added one more level after I joined.) My qualifications, skills, and experience were way beyond the requirements. Even the hiring manager and my manager expressed the role was right for me. Unfortunately, Visa puts policies and rules higher than people. They look at levels far more important than skills, experience, and capabilities in the selection process. If I was not a Visa employee, it was likely for me to at least get an interview. The hierarchical culture was unbelievably strong and rigid at Visa, even more serious than many traditional Asian-rooted firms. I do not think the management has any idea. I feel extremely humiliated and discriminated. I regretted spending more than 2 years in this company and it definitely did more harm than good to my career."

- You get great opportunities to learn
- You get to take a lead on projects",- The learning graph becomes stagnant after a certain point of time and you might want to switch teams.
582,Visa Inc.,A company with poor management that puts their people last. I do not recommend Visa to anyone.,2021-08-03,1.0,Anonymous,"1. 2-to-1 employer match on 401k with immediate vesting
2. Flexible work schedule when returning to the office
3. 4 weeks of remote work per year, manager pending","There are so many cons to Visa that I don't know where to begin. Here are four in no specific order:

1. Terrible leadership. Leaving our CEO, Al Kelly, aside for now, Visa is ripe with terrible leaders that could not care less about their people. In my years at Visa, I've prepared well over one hundred decks for a specific C-suite individual, providing the materials for the vast majority of his presentations. Not once has this individual ever stopped by the team's desk to say hello, not once has he ever stopped by with so much as a thank you. He doesn't appear to have a care in the world for his people or their careers. 

As far as Al (CEO) is concerned, he's a little better but falls far short of me being able to give a thumbs up. In my time at Visa, the most commendable things Al has done are #1 expand the employer contribution of our 401k plan to 2:1 with immediate vesting, and #2 committed to not laying any employees off due to COVID-19 for the remainder of CY 2020. These are commendable, but also not overly gracious given that the 401k match was in response to Trump's tax cut and 2020 was a year of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus to help employers avoid laying people off. At the same time, thousands of employees at Visa have not seen their wages change in two years (2019-2021), despite Visa doing over $10B in share buybacks in that same time. In short, Visa puts its people dead last, oftentimes as a footnote to its shareholders and clients. 

My biggest complaint of Al, however, is that he does so little to intervene in (let alone fix) issues amongst his lieutenants. I believe he knows how bad things things are and how poorly some of his direct reports treat their functions but he doesn't do anything about it. I think part of this is his physical separation living on the East Coast while the vast majority of his employees live in California. He seems detached and I question how involved he is in building a better corporate culture. 

2. Consolidation of power at the top. Visa has a huge problem with consolidation of power at the top, oftentimes amongst men. These select few (Al, Ryan, Vasant, Jack) call most of the shots and they aren't open to other's opinions. If you're looking for a collaborative environment where you can have a voice and drive change, my experience has been you will not find this at Visa. Instead, this is a command-and-control environment.

3. Incredibly poor career progression. This varies by team and function, but many groups have terrible career progression. In my experience, I've seen managers and group heads actively try to block their employees from pursuing new opportunities. What's more, these same leaders will oftentimes engage in frequent nepotism and are not incentivized to help their people's careers. As a result, people's careers are oftentimes stalled out for years with nowhere to go, sometimes with a manager actively showing favorites, sometimes with a manager actively sabotaging his people's career development. 

In this same vein, there is little correlation between performance and career development. Visa does little to reward or promote top performers. Your best shot at seeing career progression may well be the person in front of you leaving the company for another opportunity.

4. A lack of positive corporate culture. In short, items #1-3 drive a poor corporate culture. Relative to other companies in the Bay, Visa's corporate culture is extremely lacking. Many things feels like lip service with no heart behind them."

619,Visa Inc.,Meh,2021-07-15,3.0,Senior Project Analyst,"- 401k - I put in 5%, they put in 10%. Really a huge reason most of us stick around. 

- if you have a good boss, which I do, you are in a much better position

- if you want to be better at office politics, you can really learn that here. Good and bad.

- work with a lot of high performers and surprisingly most also have low ego and are happy to teach others

- if you’re young in your career, it looks great on a resume so put in 2-5 years but get out before you get the golden handcuffs with equity they give out. I would highly recommend for a few years but get out before you become very jaded with the intensely high levels of bureaucracy and office politics

- if you are mid-high level in your career and want to sit back and get equity and watch your 401k build and are willing to put up with crazy amounts of politics and red tape (I’m in this bucket) then stay","- Managers have no accountability. If you have a bad one, it doesn’t matter how much visa says it is inclusive or values work life balance. Without that accountability, they can treat you however they want.

- Lack of cohesive strategy within orgs. Everything is bottoms up with no real strategy so in order to get what you need over another org, you have to play a lot of politics

- politics and bias for getting director and above roles. It’s who you know and many people get promoted to these roles who are not good at their jobs or REALLY bad managers (many cases both). A lot of similarity bias since there’s no real pay or promotion structure here which also means you have to mirror your boss to get promoted and leads to lack of female leadership

- lack of any accountability. Some people are amazing and do great work because that’s just who they are, but the bad ones have zero accountability

- to be a sr director or above over a tech org, you have to have an engineering or computer science degree. Doesn’t matter if you have 30 years of coding experience for some reason they care more about what major you picked at 18. This also is a huge systematic bias against women who tend to work in these roles but not have those degrees"

In the long term, I believe visa is a good place to work in. A lot of things to learn, and lots of potential to remain relevant to the world even as fintechs try to disrupt the payments industry.","There isn’t a lot of monetary awards to people who have stayed long. If you join the company from external, you’ll have a better salary than someone who’s been inside longer.

There are also alot of bums in the technology arm. There are engineers who just talk without action, but get promoted very quickly.  Many old timers refuse to improve current processes and stick with the current ones. Maybe for job security or they are too lazy to move on to better processes.

The racial diversity in Singapore is questionable. 

I don’t understand how some engineers get transported to the US office so easily with better benefits but still the same old bum. 

A lot of staff engineers from the US keep talking about clean code and coding style, but no emphasis on proper design. Clean code and bad design is just bad app overall."

830,Visa Inc.,Only come if you want to get exposure as a new grad on the workforce or you plan on retiring,2021-04-19,1.0,Software Engineer,Interesting concepts can sometimes come up.,"- Work life balance is bad.
- Finger-pointing is second nature to most people
- Management has a lot of power especially the people that have been there for 10 plus years. They can basically do what they want regardless of what their managers say.
- Lot of times they try to reinvent the wheel but add 10000x more complexity because they want to be fully security compliant out the door. There isn't an idea of an MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
- Zero mentorship it is a very ""they will throw you in the deep end"" mentality because time and effort is not valued into growing talent.
-- This really speaks to the type of people that are there. You either have fresh new grad or you have people that have been working in industry for 10 plus years
-- There is a very ""I am busy you need to figure out type of attitude""
-- Planning is not done well and job functions have a very fuzzy line in terms of what you should be doing.
-- Compensation is at the lowest end of the spectrum
-- ESPP plan is complete garbage and just a cheap way to give employees some stock incentives as they cancelled their pension plan a lot time ago.
- Anything you ask HR about outreach or something they can't link you to and read a reference is a black hole and you will never hear about it again."

The work is great.","(Singapore)No empathy towards employees to help them during difficult times like COVID. Literally the condition in the company is either you choose work or family. There is no support to get the employees who are stuck outside. While other companies are doing their best in Singapore to help retain their employees and help them balance the personal and professional life in all ways, Visa seem to have turned their back on employee problems during this covid. 
They have basically left no choice to their foreign employees but to leave and permanently go back to the place where they come from.

The HR policies are too stubborn and they are just adding to the difficulties during such times because of their stubborness to change. The immigration partner firm is doung a miserable job here in Singapore to help the stranded employees get back and on top of that they are charging a hefty amount for service which is absolutely free. It has been 1 n half year into pandemic and it may be around for ling and if this is the support that the foreign employees get at this time, I think it is time to rethink about the relationship with Visa"

- CEO is good","- the bureaucracy is very bad, you have to talk to so many ppl for every little thing

- tech stack is cumbersome, dev env(s) down a lot, tons of manual steps, tooling is slow and painful. Devs don't get much time to build much tooling to make their lives, or their QA lives easier. 

-processes are very complex, manual, and poorly documented

- developer velocity is very slow

- code quality is a joke most of the time. Things tend to get shoved together because of a deadline coming up. Frameworks get used incorrectly. Then things get re-written since they become an unmaintainable nightmare and the process repeats. 

- some management initiatives are a net loss (i.e. required code coverage, absolutely NO rollbacks). 

- have to enter every hour you spend on every project into tracking system (rally) which ""is not used for performance"" but feels like it is. Then use another tracking system to track the code changes (jira), and possibly other tracking systems (wiki/teams). It is an unorganized mess.

- wiki is slow and search is very bad. Finding accurate information is difficult.

- tons of gatekeepers and ""onboarding"" processes for integrating with other teams. These processes SUCK, when new infra is built, it is not built in a way to be easy to integrate (i.e. lots of meetings and manual steps).

- release process is terrible. Use of wikis to keep track of release information and release instructions. The process is not automated, not consistent. Some of the releases have jenkins jobs but even then you need to add your instructions on how to trigger the job for ever release, and a guy in ops must do the release, teams can't release without ops involvement. Releases take a long time and are error prone. It takes DAYs to prepare for a release, and must involve several people.

- case in point with release process - it once took 3 months to get out a trivial bug fix, that customers were running into (there was a work around, but still, a bad experience), simply because the release process was so terrible and we have ""code freezes"" . The change was fixed for months in lower env but kept getting de prioritized due to the work required to do the release!!! 

- since releases are so difficult rollbacks are expensive, there is a lot of pressure to get it right, which means development moves slow. Also, upper management (ie 3 levels above my boss) crap on me and my boss if you do end up making a mistake which requires a rollback. Stressful! Sometimes I wouldn't be able to sleep at night because I was worried about a release going bad!

- since there is so much pressure to get releases right, and it is so difficult, lots of changes end up getting bunched together, decreasing velocity, increasing coordination, and increasing risk. 

- gatekeeping by humans in testing environments! You have access to do stuff in dev, but in qa, signoff (pre-pre prod), SIT (dev integration), and cas(pre-prod) you don't have control and you have to make a bunch of jira tickets to get something done, then you need to ping the person assigned to the ticket to work on it cause they are super busy with other stuff..... Should be automated!!!

- Bangalore collaboration is a pain (I worked in US office). Some work like perf testing or tightly coupled dev work is done by counterpart team in Bangalore. This means you need to stay up anywhere from 8pm-12am to work with them, while they also have to wake up early or stay work late in order to meet with you (timezone is ~10-12 hr diff). I have even seen some engineers from Bangalore staying until 2AM (their time) just to meet with our team here in USA (how is that ok for non emergency??)! What doesn't get done in person must get done over email, so it slows the process even more. The Bangalore teams have excellent engineers, but the time difference makes high collaboration work stressful! 

- lots of penny pinching for projects. I guess it is somewhat normal since companies can't just spend money on whatever, but getting a project funded is loooong and painful process.

- so many approvals, including getting rubber stamps from architects that are very disconnected from your projects, it seems to rarely catch problems or enhance the designs (in my experience), and ends up being a big time waster.

- a bunch of TOI (transfer of information) sessions. Rather than having everything clearly documented and easy to find you need to schedule a meeting with someone to learn how stuff works, almost on a daily basis. This takes a lot of time."

1310,Visa Inc.,Great office!,2020-09-08,5.0,Technology Intern,"It was fun being an intern at Visa. The technology side is housed at the huge Singpost Centre office at Paya Lebar. It's 5 or 6 storeys of beautiful office space, decked above a happening mall that has a cinema, food court, grocery store, nice eateries, and more. In the office, we have pool tables, table tennis, console games, napping pods, a well-stocked pantry, a gym, and a nice outdoor pateo. The working spaces are spacious too, though I've heard they will be transitioning to a slightly more open working concept, which will mean slightly smaller individual spaces. 

Nevertheless, I'd rate the office environment a 5 out of 5.","Interns were promised (during the post-interview stage of applications) a trip to California for the Visa intern summit (annual event attended by interns worldwide) but somehow my batch (2019) was the first ever one where they decided to cancel it. We were instead given a local 2-day boot camp (no stayover) where we attended talks and mingled with each other at the Business-side Visa office at Robinson Road. It was not an alright consolation prize, I guess, but damn, was it a huge pity that we could not go to California.

It was a real bummer, and we were only informed AFTER we'd joined as interns."

I've seen a VP yell at my coworker in front of me many times. Often blaming him for not doing something when it wasn't even a priority. My own manager has yelled at me as well in front of coworkers. Is that really appropriate? Is this good management?

There's a major communication gap between VPs and what they really want versus what we're working on. Typically the VPs barely know what product we're working on. They're only concerned with their personal projects. 

Raises and promotions are almost impossible if you don't get to work closely with the VP on their projects. We'll see the same folks being promoted.

One VP even wanted his group to donate to a company he's on the board of. Super awkward.

There are some very amazing people with smarts and outstanding experiences. Working along side of them is gratifying.

The pay and benefits are exceptional and competitive with other companies in the Bay Area.","Visa used to be a fun place to work. It was very collegial. But sadly, that has been lost. It is now a hyper-competitive, bureaucratic ""meritocracy"". You are graded on a curve. Only a small handful of people can be highly rated. If you are not highly rated then you do not get a very good bonus and possibly no stock awards. The review system is based on your popularity among your peers who provide feedback, and that is used against you if you are not popular; regardless of what you factually delivered to the company. The feedback is completely subjective and based on personal opinions. Different managers use different criteria. Some managers collect the feedback and keep it secret from the employee. Other managers tell their people to collect the feedback themselves and then share it with their manager. Obviously the quality of the feedback is going to be different when it is anonymous. Some managers even follow up with a more probing investigation to gather more negative ""improvement opportunities"". There is no standardized set of criteria used and there is no consistent way of rating people's individual performance on the criteria across the company. It is all totally subjective. When review time comes around, morale drops because people do not like being unfairly judged and know they have little ability to get an above average review unless they win the congeniality award or the big boss likes them."

1408,Visa Inc.,Fantastic top leadership,2020-06-07,4.0,Vice President,"Al Kelly is the best CEO this company has had since founder Dee Hock. He creates a positive, employee-first, leadership focused culture",Far too many silos which leads to multiple organizations doing the same thing and no priorities
1409,Visa Inc.,"Great company overall, but your experience varies with department and manager",2020-06-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Probably one of the most people-focused organisations you will work for. Our CEO Al Kelly's focus on developing and growing people is very closely reflected by the HR here. In most companies the where HR are mostly taking instructions, being passive, and doing employee administration, the HR folks in Visa are pretty active in their outreach, surveys, running trainings etc. Having interacted with HR folks from executive to VP levels, they actively think of policies and programs to improve the work experience for employees.

It is also pretty diverse in the way they hire people, though certain ethnicity clearly outnumber the rest. If you're learning different languages it's a great way to practice, be it spanish, mandarin, korean, hindi - you're bound to find someone who's a native speaker!

IT services(not to be confused with IT infrastructure) are pretty efficient and responsive, they also solve the problem almost all the time.

Lastly, you'll benefit from one of the best corporate branding around town, having Visa on your namecard or resume drastically improves your chances of success!","First to preface, I've worked in a few offices and your experience will likely differ depending on your department and direct manager.

The level of ideals in People really start to diminish very fast once it gets to the ground where most of the work is being done. The team-leads here will parrot what leadership says and have obligatory one-off meetings after results of a survey are not as flattering(ie dismal). people managers also tend to put more energy into managing upwards to their higher reports.

work-life balance
my department has none of that, both the business folks and the tech people work like mad. They appear to knock off at 6 or 7 but they are really just taking their work home. I've had several days where i worked into the wee hours of the morning, slept a few hours and dragged myself back to the workdesk. Some of it is due to how in demand we are to our clients, some of it is due to slow(and expensive!) IT infrastructure, all of it avoidable if some frameworks for resource planning were given. During Covid 19 lock downs, my department slashed to zero all vendor fees but the work that needs to be done remained, the workload practically quadrupled the next week! I was pretty sure if the virus didn't get me the workload here would've.

Salaries, compensation, promotions etc
The starting salary is above the market average, if you're in tech Visa won't be paying you what FAANG companies do, but it is decent. The rank you come in would likely remain there with annual increments, unless you've hovered there for some time, like 5-6 years or so. Promotions are pretty much the only way to properly bump your pay(alternative being to change employer), and visibility and relationships with your direct manager and HOD plays somewhat too much a role in who gets promoted. While Visa is a global company it is still very much a Western one in culture that espouses interaction. If you're one of those quiet ones it's quite easy to get passed over for years at a time even though the work is consistently good and reliable. On the flip side, for someone who has been ear marked as a ""talent"" it is pretty obvious, they would get projects with visibility opportunities and help to make sure a promotion comes through the next year.

Tech and tools
The servers they use to run data analysis is hugely massive but somehow manages to also be excruciatingly slow. We've lost deals and missed targets simply because the work couldn't be processed by the servers fast enough. The focus is so much on reliability engineering but the enduser experience is dismal 9 out of 10 days. There's a lot of avoidable work overtime if this aspect can be addressed."

""Visa Principals"" are terrible. They expect every engineer to act like a publicity manager of his/her own and make sure you're known if you want to move forward, which is a bummer. Engineers don't work like that, management does. Unfortunately the leadership thinks otherwise. Peer feedbacks are used against you so you get a lower rating, irrespective of the work you deliver. It's the engineer's responsibility to find opportunities and then step on it to move forward while the management just sits back and applauds whoever can pull it off. Rest of the team can go mind their own business. This is an awful model to work with."

Sometimes it is even compared to slavery, agents are only given 4 minutes a day for personal use such as bathroom use and they can get in trouble if they go over the four minutes, otherwise they have to be forced to wait until their breaks. Getting vacation is almost impossible. VISA does not care about the customers, is just about making money. Call center agents are measured with ridiculous metrics almost impossible to achieve, is more about getting rid of the call ASAP so that you can take the next one. They laid off over 90 people that had been working there for years without even caring about the time and energy people invested in the company. Call center agents are looked down by people on other departments. People apply to other positions and they are rejected without being given an opportunity for an interview. There no open door policy, even though the company claims there is. Their leadership principles (values that they claim to have) are a joke. They do no lead by example, they do not communicate openly, they do not collaborate with others. They claim that at VISA everyone is a leader (that is another joke).

If the funds allocated to to each team could be used in a better way would be more benifitial.

Its difficult to get to next level, as there goes a lot of politics and favouritism behind promotions as well and even though the company has a good policy to support internal mobility, the hiring managers know how to exploit that option and in the end it turns out to be a tool exploited by hiring manager to get someone they like."

- Average benefit package compared to the rest of the industry
- Interesting work","- Most things revolve around politics. You can thrive if you can navigate around politics and appear competent.
- Security is reasonable in a finance company, but at VISA it often gets in the way of you getting any work done, or doing work properly
- There's a shortage of technical knowledge and the company seems unaware of this.  On the other hand there's abundance of business knowledge. That's because average tenure is high. Employers in roles such as support/manual testing tend to fall out of date with basic computer science knowledge.
- Cooperation with other teams globally is tricky. There's a problem with knowledge sharing. There's an us-vs-them mindset with respect to other teams globally
- Projects sometimes start with requirements loosely specified. Other times requirements change after delivery and whole components are scraped.
- There's micromanagement, as managers don't have enough power to help you thrive within your career, and often make up excuses instead of being transparent. But every manager has its style and reacts differently to the environment"

In addition, management can be condescending at times due to your status and will even poke fun at your salary while boasting about their high paying title.

-Very stressful working environment: They will squeeze those 8 hours out of you, no downtime, most of their schedules do NOT give you 2 days off back-to-back so forget about resting too much or planning a weekend event.

+ Business-class international travel even in today's world","- I completely support gender equality but two wrongs never ever make a right. As some of the previous reviewers have noted, Visa Bangalore is a place where men are discriminated against. It starts from the hiring phase where women are offered roles even if they do not meet the interview performance bar. Once they join, they are offered higher visibility projects and regardless of the results they deliver, they receive all the accolades. This nepotistic approach continues even into the promotion cycle where women who barely speak up in meetings or contribute anything worthwhile get promoted for 'innocently smiling' at senior site leaders while 10x more competent men are left in the lurch for unknown reasons. Long before the US Presidential impeachment process had socialized the 'quid pro quo' phrase, senior site leaders (ironically Indian-origin US citizens) at Visa Bangalore have been enjoying the 'benefits' of 'closely liaising' with their favorite female employees and promoting them multiple times in return. In a nutshell, Visa Bangalore actually deserves a (-)1 star rating as a workplace."

I am not against female, but there should not be very high % of bias towards females. Needless promotions, leadreship going out of way to promote them to simpler and lucrative roles, while male counterparts are asked to continuously slog.

1607,Visa Inc.,Needs a reality check. In a lot of areas.,2019-10-10,1.0,Senior Staff Software Engineer,"Good 401k, good parking, easy access from highway","Diversity - Visa must be the least diverse workplace I must have worked at in my 20 year career. Engineering is mostly filled with sub-par engineers with minimal skills that were contractors with some IT bodyshop at one point and got converted to employees.  Most of your time is spent dealing with internal politics or drama with very little interest from your peers about actual work. 

Culture - Peers are super nice to each other but will speak negatively behind your back with great ease. Every one shares everyone else's compensation, performance ratings, upcoming promotions, family matters freely without any concern for privacy or feelings.  This is across all levels of the company, all the way to top management. Most people hang out in groups to socialize with peers that speak the same language. 

Strategy - As an engineering org, there is no sense of direction There is absolutely no strategy from the top that cascades down to the front-line employees. All-hands meetings are a joke. 

Process Burden - Processes are archaic and there is little interest in changing anything. Most employees are stuck with long immigration waits and are bullied into working long hours and weekends. Things that are done in a matter of hours or are automated in the rest of the industry take weeks or months here. There is absolutely no respect for work-life balance. You are expected to answer texts, phone calls, IMs at any hour of the day or you are considered to be not committed or hard-working.

Focus - There is also always some new flavor of the month. Some new security tool gets introduced that opens up a bunch of findings on your application and you 
spend the next 2 months chasing those findings. Or there is some massive migration effort that your org needs to undergo and you spend most of your year just moving all your applications and data to a cheaper vendor. You are then questioned on why you didn't get anything important done.

Morale - Most mid-level management got beat up due to poor employee survey numbers last year. Managers spent most of their energy in addressing engagement issues versus getting anything real done. Individual contributors were asked to be more engaged and that was the end of it. Apparently this year, it is not a priority anymore and somehow things have made a 180 in terms of engagement. 

Growth - When it comes to career growth, promotions are done mostly on favoritism or tenure (need to be around for decades) and there are no formal career paths. Internal Mobility is talked about all the time but there are no protections. You apply for a role and you would be lucky if you even hear back from the hiring manager in months. You are then told eventually that the position was opened to fill an internal promotion.

Performance Reviews - The performance review process is a big mess as well. Visa uses stack ranking and will force your manager to put someone on the top or worse, below every year. Then HR forces then their 'curves' and the rating that you get is something else altogether than what you were expecting or deserved. Your manager has very little say in your performance."

Employee survey results for engagement and leadership are used to discipline or punish leaders, rarely is this used to determine the How side of ratings. 
HR allows Sr Leaders to materially change roles/eliminate positions without the courtesy of telling the impacted employee what their options are.  People are left in limbo/disrespected, which is completely opposed to the direction communicated by the CEO.

There is little to no corporate technology/coding standards, which lends itself to a chaotic infrastructure and coding consistency for a company with 25K+ employees worldwide.  

Good developers tend to have short lifespans because of the lack of willingness of management to encourage and drive the necessary changes needed to be a world class leader of industry standards.

1840,Visa Inc.,Worst experience I've ever had,2018-11-30,1.0,Software Engineer,"CEO Al Kelley has been great at focusing on employee morale and satisfaction over the past couple of  years.  However, many of the policies he publishes are not followed by management.  They have offered some nice new benefits such as time off for elderly/emergency care.  However, those are pretty standard.

Thanks to Dee Hock, Visa has a great business model that will continue to generate growth for years to come.  I am certain that the folks outside of technology are working for a great company.","Since this is a one star review, I will start by saying I didn't submit this lightly.  I read several other reviews that indicate a similar experience in Austin and now hope that this will lead to some sort of positive change.  I see that HR responds to these by saying to call a ""hotline"" which I did months before I wrote this ( August 2018).  This should be the first red flag.  To be fair, I will also say the Technology organization is divided into two different organizations.  One is, DMPD ( digital mobile product development) which likely doesn't have the same issues I am about to enumerate.

Let me address why I gave everything one star ( except benefits) :

Career Opportunities :  I applied, interviewed and tested  for an internal position.  Was then  asked by the hiring manager to continue to the last phase of the process but was blocked by my current management.  No opportunity to learn and apply new tech, and I am not alone in this assessment.  This is an example of how they publish a policy about internal mobility but allow management to actively ruin your career.  Nobody has your back.

Compensation :  Was lured in by a pension, but a few months later it was ""frozen"" i.e. canceled.  They are stingy with stock as well, and the ESPP is not great, as you are forced to hold shares for over a year which means several are under water right now.

They have a 10% 401K match but most the fidelity funds have lost money this year.  There is no fund above a morningstar rating of 3.
 
Their benefits are decent ( 4 weeks PTO ), and better than most any smaller company, but definitely not in the top tier.

Work Life Balance :  This can be one of the worst things about Visa.  Working in Technology, the release process can be manual and antiquated.  Many career Visa employees are resistant to modernizing such processes.  Get ready to spend all weekend with little sleep doing a manual release.  It's not fun, and you don't learn anything.  Secondly, there is not good co-location and ownership with teams in some organizations including mine.  If you are in the US, you may find yourself being asked to attend meetings at all hours of the day and night, during lunch etc..  Can't get away for a workout and there is little flexibility in schedule.

Senior Management : Every year, they have an annual survey, and the feedback on important items like having the tools to do your job is low and blatantly ignored ( every year).  Nothing meaningful is ever done,  They think making a better expense reporting mechanism, or ticketing system is ""good enough"".   The laptop you rely on to do your work is so bogged down by onerous security software and constant patching it's really tough to be efficient.   If you're lucky your laptop will be rebooted several times a week and sometimes take hours to become available again.  Otherwise, you'll end up taking it to IT for a long time.

Also,  the proxy server you are forced to use will block you from basic tools such as github and downloading simple eclipse plugins.  Blocking some sites makes sense, but basic stuff is not attainable with any reliability.

Culture and Values :  This is the worst aspect of Visa.  It is the least diverse workplace I've ever been a part of.  It's a top down sort of arrangement where your manager suddenly tells you to do 5 different things out of the blue, because his/her manager told them to make you do this.  Given that most employees are fearful they generally drop what they are doing to try and please the manager.  At the end of the day you end up with your head spinning and there is little if any acknowledgement when you fight through the clutter and accomplish something meaningful.  

English is spoken less than other languages in the cubicles.  I felt like an alien in my own country working here."

Most of them lacks basic management skills and not competent enough to lead the talented hires from IITs, NIITs and good product companies.

Directors can go to any extent to appease the USA teams while ignoring their own team at Bangalore. They only care about the Annual survey manager index results and create divide and rule within the team. 

They do not like to be challenged and asked questions and happy to run regular business like service companies. 
Layoff those who questions them as they fear these people can give bad review in annual survey.
 
Higher management also provide wrong support to these leaders and do not find the actual problem. 
You have to be fortunate enough to find a good leader for you and your team to learn something.

As others reviews have said, being non-white / westernized immediately discounts your perception as a leader. 

They keep trying to act like diversity is a big focus and avoid the ethnic diversity question by making it all about gender diversity. 

They keep saying they’re making efforts on ethnic diversity but it’s nothing really. The latest wave of restructuring has only reinforced the white dominance at every layer of management. 


Guess what, gender diversity is not your biggest problem, ethnic diversity in leadership roles is. And you’re doing nothing about it.

Virtually al leadership teams in AP hub are mostly white. All ‘working teams’ as they condescendingly put it are mostly Asian. No space for Asians in
mid management or above. It’s really sad, like reliving what our ancestors went through during colonial times. 

Do you really expect us to believe that there is no real leadership talent available in all of Asia Pacific minus ANZ (the most populous region on earth), including the thousands of Asians already working at Visa? Are they all missing that special something?

Nice Salary (most teams)
Some teams do have interesting projects but rest (most) of the teams do not have engaging work.
Work pressure can vary a lot from team to team. There are teams where people play Foosball everyday and bunk weekend shifts while there are teams who slog the entire day and don't get proper sleep.
Some fun activities, seminars and celebrations happen from time to time (if you have time for them).","You will be over-skilled for your job because of their hiring policy.
There are a lot of places where people do repetitive manual work day-in day-out. Little focus on automating this.
The above fact has lead to a lot of complex processes (unnecessarily complex). Even for small things, like adding something to browser, you need to raise a security exception and the security team is clueless on what to do next and will not approve it. Thus you may never be able to finish your work and that is not you would want to tell to your manager.
Management is not so great.
In many teams, due to work pressure, people are so occupied with what they are doing that they have no vision of where the team is going. This leads to stagnation for the entire team.
Even the management is so involved with mundane tasks that they are not able to drive the team in the right direction.
Management tries to brainwash you instead of listening to your concerns.
At times you may feel like a slave.
You may not feel like you are having an impact.

Our job was literally sending out templates and no way to advance plus they don't screen applicants for prior knowledge of how to use a computer and most of my co-workers were lost since they didn't even know how to copy and paste. The company promised me 13hr for working premium hours but only paid 11hr and when I thankfully found a better opportunity on my final week they actually shut down the department and repositioned all the other employees.

VPs, directors and managers used to serve Christmas lunch to all the employees, and they keep the doors open so that they can listen to what employees had to say. They also provided payment solutions to minorities who are impaired and cannot find the decent jobs. Thus, they cannot open the bank accounts, Visa provided reloadable cards to those people. They tried to contribute to the society around the world. That's what I liked about Visa, and I hope that Visa culture comes back in the future.",There are so many negative aspects about Visa. One thing that I could hardly understand is that they still keep some of the employees who were involved in the inside fraud. There are much more about Visa that is related to organization crimes whether it is inside or outside including Wells Fargo fraud cases.

HR is a total dark side here, they will not be supportive at all and all answers are vague and useless. They do not respect and appreciate all employees equally for example during severe climate events or serious conditions, they will not care about your family or personal life. Work is repetitive and mediocre.

In AP Hub, few locals/Asians make it beyond SD whereas white folks with little industry experience get VP in their early 30s.

Some teams have literally all-white leadership teams with legions of Asians working under them. Ironically this is the ASIA business. When a white leader leave, they hire another (or one of the other white lead takes on the leaving person's territory). 

Sure APLT has a few token locals and Indians but those too are far outnumbered and the heavily westernised types.

Who can you complain about this? Your Aussie recruiter? Or the Aussie HR? Or the same thing up the command chain.

The pay and benefits are excellent and continue to improve. The day after Thanksgiving is now a paid holiday and the 401K match was just increased.

Many of the people who work there are kind, hard working, well meaning individuals.","There is a lack of transparency that starts at the top and permeates the organization. Since nobody is clear on how executives are making decisions employees do not trust one another. People frequently throw one another under the bus in order to protect themselves. 

An example of the lack of transparency occurred at the end of 2015 when it was announced that the pension would no longer exist for employees. The reasons given were that no other companies offer it and Visa offers free shuttles and ESPP. If the numbers had been shared as to how much the pension cost the company and how much money would be saved by eliminating it that would have caused employees to feel more like investors and understand it as a business decision. Instead it caused anger and animosity towards leadership.

If you are good at playing politics you will thrive. I have watched people progress who lack vision and courtesy but know what to say when an SVP walks into a room.

There is constant talk about how amazing the company is at diversity yet no evidence of inclusion. What is the point of diversifying the workforce if those new and different people are not included in key meetings or projects?"

Multiple functional teams (Marketing, Product, IT) operate without clearly defined scopes (i.e., high degree of ambiguity and between/across teams, overlapping roles + responsibilities), resulting in chaos. Although collaboration is one of our new leadership principles, there is a much higher than average amount of political infighting and passive/aggressive behavior. Multiple times, I have seen strong, smart leaders who've attempted to drive alignment within/across organizations get stabbed in the back, which absolutely kills morale. Even the seemingly common practice of distributing org charts to understand who's who + team scope will get no response from HR or organizational execs.

Chances are you will be fired, or you will be miserable and they won’t follow through on their promises. 

Team Directors/Leads don't generally know how to do the job their team mates do. Leaders don't set goals and lash out on employees for supposedly not doing well when given vague or undefined tasks. 

The thought police presence here is real, you constantly get the feeling of being watched and judged for your words. If you don’t like working in an overly politically correct environment Visa is not your place. You come here to work, say hello, work, say bye and go home. Anything beyond that behavior will eventually get you in trouble.

Anyone who shares their ideas or gives any constructive feedback in an effort to improve products is swiftly punished via a process that ultimately leads to termination.

Turnover is rapid and noticeable. Seems like employees are getting terminated here every few weeks. They literally go through people like socks in an attempt to pass blame and deflect from the sheer incompetence of Directors/Team leads. Sadly as a result highly skilled workers who actually want to achieve and make a difference are terminated frequently.

Team Leaders and Directors choose their favorites who get to do nothing, while not logging proper hours and shirking their duties. This means all those responsibilities fall on anyone without 3+ year seniority. As a new employee you will hate your life and the management. 

Benefits that are promised at time of hiring IE: retirement plan, bonuses, leave, flexible work hours, are all taken away shortly after you arrive in order to enhance overall profits. Bait and switch within hiring process plain and simple."

2249,Visa Inc.,Things to consider before joining the call center,2017-09-03,2.0,Senior Customer Service Representative,"-Good benefits
-Lots of fun professional organizations
-Most managers live up to the open door policy","-Internal mobility is a challenge.  For years the company has had a policy in place that has prevented current employees  from skipping levels even if they are qualified to do the job. Technically, the hiring manager can override this policy if they believe the applicant is a good fit. From what I saw it is unlikely that most people are moved into higher positions. This has seemingly put external applicants at a preferred status.

-If you accept a role in the call center, especially as an agent, do not expect to move into other departments.  You will be lucky if you move forward into higher positions within the contact center.  Leadership is still trying to bridge the gap between having contract workers and full-time employees.  This means, there is no career track.  Opportunities for professional development, and exposure to aid in advancement within the company are slim to none (within the call center), especially for agents because they are only valuable when they are taking calls.

-You will be expected to work weekends and holidays.

-Their attendance policies are stringent and one could easily find themselves on some sort of corrective action, even if you are not the type of person to call off.  People with children seemed to experience the most difficulty .

-Your call quality directly impacts your paycheck, and there are a number of inconsistencies in the way calls are graded which could either work to your advantage, or kill your scores. Leadership does allow for agents to fight scores that they don't believe are fair. Depending on how big the gray area is, scores may not be re-aligned.

- It is impossible to cover all of the material that you will need to know for calls in the classroom.  You will be provided with the resources you need to look up information, but try sifting through a multiple pages in a portal while on a timed call, all while trying to keep KPIs in mind, and satisfying customers.  

-It's a stressful environment. If you are not prepared to be chained to your desk for 7 hours a day all while tolerating verbal abuse from cardholders, this is not the job for you.

-Limited breaks that are pre-scheduled.  Most people have two  15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. You are given five minutes of personal time, which depending on the call volume you may be asked not to take."

Company  promotes  toxic leadership culture by creating conflicts between managers for political gains.

There is no accountability model, the only metric for success is based on your political skill. The so called Managers survey has become  purely a political survey, the people who can manipulate the 'voters' are successful in getting  better manager scores which are rewarded by promotions.

Amazing Team Members","Extremely Toxic Work Environment

Working at Visa has been the worst experience of my career. Perhaps it would be a better experience on a different team, however,  I've heard across the board that Visa employs very poor managers. I honestly don't know how my manager still has a job. More than half our team has turned over in under a year and there is a clear pattern of abuse on our team. HR has stepped in to help, but no changes have been made. Colleagues continue to leave - even at the expense of paying back relocation costs to get away from the situation - and those of us left are just suffering through. This would not fly at any other company I have worked for. 

Misuse of power is a serious ethical violation, not to mention the business case of nonexistent morale, low productivity and the cost of turning over so many employees. 

It is not sustainable to work in such a toxic environment for a sustained period of time without some kind of damage. Visa is losing a lot of talent due to this situation."

Security SDLC has just been merged with product teams for instance, new SAST tools, new processes (DevOps for all PD teams), performance based bonuses. Many opportunities for training. Fun normal people to work with (ie they have families and lives). Hires come traditional from excellent schools and background. Company culture. Does not tolerate sexual harassment. Constantly improved","Commuting to Foster City is a huge pain. There is a suspicion that the FC campus is going to be closed. Getting more cutthroat, partly due to non-US Asian, US and non-US Indian influx. Management is hit or miss, unstable at times, and much resentment lingers over freezing of defined pension plan. Many old timers left with invaluable longitudinal domain knowledge without proper debrief, being replaced by cheaper new tech savvy go-gethers w/o same commitment to the company. Some minorities and dietary restrictions are not tended to in the cafeterias.  MC seems to be further along tech wise for a while now. Very poor time management partly due to poor tech nudges (ie meeting windows only in 30 minute increments by default).

The current Technology leadership is by far one of the worst I have seen in my 20 yrs career in the technology industry.   The current leaders are former program managers who has very low technical skill but very high political skill.   Asks bookish questions that are not relevant to technical discussions, which annoys technical managers. Promotes nepotism. One of the Senior Leader joined as an individual contributor less than 3 yrs ago, after three quick promotions, he is now a senior leader responsible for important Engineering and Operations functions and probably more soon.  His only qualification for his current position is his political and manipulation skills.  Engineering is a transformational role in the organization; Visa needs a transformational technologist and not a politician in this role.  This is the current state of Technology leadership at Visa, managed by a bunch of program managers who are politicians and not technologists.

Food : subsidized
Child care : recently they have come up with reimbursing day care , this is cool

The common practice I have seen across verticals (specially in visa Bangalore) is , the director/sr director will hire immediate subordinates from his own company.
Stop this trend VISA , serious advice. This demoralizes the hardworking employees with no background of having connections to boss or buttering or grouping and eventually that makes your stay uncomfortable.

HR , start probing into if its a mere coincidence that all nearby team mates from same company of that of boss and how the hell did they get hired even if interview panel is rejecting them ?

2. Have some standard process while exit , start caring for your lateral rather than pampering , sponsering careers to freshers and interns. They simply play TT,Fuss ball (not all of them , some of them have worked with me and they are really good , so do not take me otherwise), Xbox . Management has to see if you are paying 15-25 lacs to fresher , then get the work done by fertile brains.

It is clear they are trying to compete for young, aggressive talent -- they consider themselves talent competitors with Google, Facebook, PayPal but in all honestly, any young aggressive new college grads leaves after about a year. They do NOT allow any working remotely. None. They are big brother, watching your every move. Everyone at Visa is VERY conservative. I have friends that work at Apple, Google, etc and those companies are much more flexible and employee friendly. 

Their ESPP program is antiquated as well. You have to keep the stock for 2 years which is something we did 20 years ago. Now almost all ESPP programs are a 6 month program with a 15% discount off market price.

Everything you do, and I mean EVERYTHING, must be approved by multiple layers of management. There is lots of talk of improving “tools and process,” but no visible progress, and it remains painfully hard to get anything done. Since no one is empowered, no one takes accountability for anything.

- Very poor management and leadership - they make promises and then don't follow through, always with poor excuses

- Leaders don't care about employee development, only about making themselves look good - especially HR - all marketing hype.

Visa works more like a bank than a tech company although they like to pretend that they are a legitimate Tech player.  The year before last, the management just took away employee pensions and failed to not only compensate in any other way but to even communicate to effected employees.  Lay offs are routine, pointless.  Re-orgs are simply endless and a complete waste of everyone's time.  There are way too many people and so they don't even care about improving their systems.

-> Breakfast /lunch at subsidized, great food/snacks facility
-> Quickly get recognized if you are serious about work and make right design and coding decisions","-> Agile practices are broken; they are running a waterfall in the name of Agile.

-> Directors throw in jargons in all the meeting whenever senior management visits from US to impress them but nothing happens at ground level

-> Moving to GIT, moving to jenkins, Using intellij, having code quality tools in local machine is considered as engineering excellence - Need I say more?

-> Senior management is aware that company is being run worse than service based company and they refuse to take any action on it.

-> Directors commit to unrealistic deadlines for big deliverables to upper management to build a positive image. 
Teams are pressurized to deliver without considering code quality. 
Directors do not even defend team and refrain from taking any responsibility; their first instinct is to find reasons to escape the call/meeting with wider forum.

-> If you are politically right you can survive without writing single line of code.
Most of staff software engineers are not having enough hands on knowledge and try to dunk any design discussion.
They will come into picture only when things go wrong to point errors at someone else.

-> Management expects you to allocate 10% on project A, 10% performance of B, 10% responding to critical integration issue. You will get some time to code if you manage to squeeze in some time in this politically active environment after attending rigorous meeting and responding to emails.

-> I was part of interview panel and the level of candidates were poor. Good Developers are not even accepting offer letter.
Management knows this and strategy is to hire people from Paypal / people with personal connection despite panel rejecting candidates.

If you want to work in a fast paced environment, with tangible impact and good culture, this is not the place for you. If you want to have a chilled out work life balance, no definite future goals and want to retire in this company, then this is the place. 
> Managers have absolutely no idea what to do. They know neither engineering, nor management. 
> They commit to the upper management with dates they have no idea of, and then negotiate about story points with engineers.
> Directors think that you can partition your brain into sections which can be exclusively dedicated to working with different projects. Eg: Give 10% to project A, 15% to project B, 55% to your sprint tasks, 20% to meetings.
> They try to sell the company when you have to join them by throwing big words at you. If you fall for it, you fall to your doom. Directors throw abstract jargon of technologies that they have heard of, to attract people, and when you join, you realize that it is not true, and your team is still using struts. 
> Moving the codebase to git is considered as a massive engineering excellence program. Enough said.
> Favouritism: There are a section of employees who are not capable of actual work, but try to pick up fancy things. Directors are well aware that these employees are not team players, but since they bring that glitz to the team, they let it go.
> Agile practices are broken, projects take very long, and teams in US decide the execution path. You have to fight for trust and design rights.

Difficult to get any new technology into the tech stack as it is not a team level decision mostly and much freedom is not there in choosing technologies, as its a financial company may be its not that simple. The interview process for tech folks is getting better, but was not really upto the mark earlier so lot of people got in easily all these years who would not have made it if interviewed now.
Many already existing managers in IT are non technical or atleast not that much where they should be and dont value folks based on their technical skills but based on the number of years  in the company."

2443,Visa Inc.,Hostile Work Enviornment with Ineffective Leadership,2017-03-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Compensation, bonus, office decor, parking, initial recruitment process was friendly, decent gym.","It's hard to accomplish your tasks and nearly impossible to innovate in the environment that Visa has created. The quality of your work or products don't really matter and performance rating criteria are subjective and vague. If a senior person on your team doesn't like you (which happens fairly regularly) its very easy for them to nullify your bonus and further more destroy your career. Upper management is too busy wining and dining with other corporate executives to ever look at the products that are created. This gives significant power to senior team members that have huge sway because managers inherently trust everything they say, even if its blatantly wrong.

Work Life Balance is totally off, if you have a wife, kids or a pet, good luck you wont be seeing much of them if you work at Visa. I guess this could be a plus if you don't like being at home.

Lots of old blood in this company which treats new employees poorly. As a new team member be prepared to be stabbed in the back multiple times and expect the more ""seasoned"" employees to attempt to make you look bad at best or fired at worst.

VP and Director level leadership give very little guidance or vision of what they'd like your team to achieve, so team leads are left guessing as to what they need to accomplish. Half of work time in team meetings is spent arguing about what course or action to take and guessing at what leadership may or may not like. Ineffective.

Instead of having sane work hours and expectations, leadership decides its a good idea to treat employees out to all you can drink fests every once in a while as a way to ""recharge."" 

Most employees don't utilize their vacation time as it is seen by mid-high level leadership as disloyalty to your team. Team production will obviously suffer because they don't have enough employees in the first place.
The company used to have a retirement plan that it advertised to all its new recruits as being one of the best draws to working at Visa. A lot of new talent was recruited under this pretense and the retirement plan was eliminated to save money for the company at the same time Visa was spending billions to acquire Visa Europe.

In summary, this company fosters a toxic work environment and if your unfortunate enough to find yourself working here vigilantly watch your back, especially when around the ""seasoned"" employees. Your just a number and they will work you (often on fruitless tasks) till you either get frustrated and quit, get fired, or have a heart attack."
2444,Visa Inc.,Very Unprofessional!,2017-03-08,1.0,Project Analyst,"+ Above average compensation, depending on your negotiation skills
+ Free cab","- Over-politicized work environment. Some Directors spend 50% of their time writing nasty/blame game emails about people who do the actual work. Rest 50% of course is religiously devoted to browsing Facebook/Quora and Twitter while utilizing the office internet.

- Career growth opportunities have no correlation with your performance or ability. Band promotion process is totally based on favoritism. 

- Reverse gender discrimination (yes, you read it right!) exists in some teams. Some male hiring managers openly declare ""let's hire more women"" with a wink in their eyes! Once they're hired, they're kept as close as possible to points of influence, asked out for dinners separately and later showered with awards and promotions. Nothing in life comes for free so it's anyone's guess how that machinery works!

- Some teams (other than dev/QA) have attrition rates as high as 50%. No employee retention efforts are in place and the whole place works like a revolving door. The hiring process is always ongoing and everyone (including the skeletal HR) seems to be comfortable with a steady stream of exiting employees.

- Employee engagement practices are an alien concept here and all relationships are totally transactional in nature. The mantra is to work, draw your paycheck and forget about everything else. If you ask about growth opportunities, you'll be bluntly asked to leave Visa. Reeks of the attitude of labor driven coal-mining companies from the 1800s."

There is awesome potential to grow with a lot of countries rapidly moving to electronic payments. There is a strong brand with established relationships in key high growth markets across the globe.

Most of Visa's growth comes not through its own innovation but by virtue of being in fast growing markets.

Though USA forms an increasingly small portion of revenues, the management is completely US centric and frighteningly myopic about it. The world outside of USA is an afterthought to most leaders.

Most leaders are busy in playing politics and making others look bad. The nature of business is such that most folks don't have the ability to influence profitability. Banks wont change to MasterCard or any other competitor on a whim because of high exit costs.

Visa has all the same problems that larger companies have but management is trying to make it better than other companies.  The people you work with are probably great but because of the Cons, this isn't the place for the faint of heart.","Visa is having somewhat of an identity crisis. If you work in Technology, management is trying to make it a Silicon Valley tech company to ""keep up with the Joneses"" aka Google, Facebook.  Outside of Technology, the atmosphere is more Financial Services, bank-like.  Depending on the situation and who you're talking to, Visa is either a technology, financial services, payments technology, payments, or any combination thereof and more.

Very process heavy!  There is so much talk about being innovative and nimble, but there's a process for that.  

Recruiting and hiring is a nightmare.  Depending on the department, the level, the location, the process is different.  For candidates trying to get a job at Visa, don't be surprised if it takes 6 months with multiple periods of hurry and go, followed by hurry and wait, hurry and go.  Frustrating for everyone involved.

If you work in the Bay area, you better like bench seating because it won't be long before every floor resembles a sardine can. You know, to encourage collaboration so you can follow the innovation process.  Ugh!"

You have to watch your back more so here than in other places.  Lots of people who don't respond to emails, don't show up for meetings, take long or don't follow up. Too many people are focused on politics than value.   It happens too often.

Also, people tend to be overtitled.  I even see SVPs who report to SVPs who report to another SVP.  Clearly that is a place where titles are skewed.

Management style is top-down and the orders coming from the top lack vision and a coherent strategy.  Until this changes the rest of the organization will continue on it's current marching orders and waste money and time.

Substandard management at all levels(I'll give new CEO a pass since he just started).  Most managers act simply as a go between relaying emails without any value add leaving their subordinates to also do their job.

Politics.  It is all that matters as accountability seems non existent.  Empire building is rampant, until the next reorg that comes every 6 months.

Performance reviews use antiquated methods and forced ranking so managers have to rate x number of people poor, average, exceed - regardless of the groups actual composition and performance.  This saves them a bit of money with the few groups that actually have overall good performance while destroying morale further and ensuring it doesn't happen the following year."

There's no focus on millennials aside from saying ""we want them"". There's no management training and so many managers have no idea what to do with young people.

But Visa may still be an OK company for young male Indians who want to pad their resume. (Indian women are talked over in meetings.)","The company is generally sliding downhill rapidly. The few innovations come from copying or buying outside. Management, at least in IT, all the way to the IT top, seem to be reading from their Indian-IT school textbooks To sum this up ""Look busy and change the plans frequently if rapid results are not forthcoming."" 

Everyone from Director and higher seems to be trying to implement their own plan, I suppose for later resume building. Teamwork is restricted to just a very few teams with decent managers (less than 5% of teams). Management between teams is fully territorial, with people believing that their way is the only way and never cooperating as this would be seen as backing down from their own plans. 

The morale and culture are the worst I've experienced. Top IT guy seems to believe his job is cheerleading, so there are 4-6 rah-rah meetings every month called ""All-Hands"". Hardly anyone even goes to these anymore, they have to send email to please sit up in the front for the cameras. These meetings always start 10-20 minutes late. (I mention these details not as the worst of the environment, but just as small examples to show how far the poor culture has seeped.)

There are at least 3, and often 10 or more, layers of project planners for each project.  Of course, all but two of these (the top layer and the bottom layer) are just playing the telephone game and regurgitating what they heard from below.  Often the actual source of the information  is not allowed at the meeting that reports it (to protect the middle manager jobs). So almost all meetings end up a waste of time, where people have to ""take things offline"" to go figure out the actual source and get the information directly. 

Generally speaking the VP and SVP layers are the worst of the non-value-adding staff. They don't want any decision made by others, so all meetings are hamstrung until the VP or SVP shows up to make a call. These VP's spend their days running from meeting to meeting pointing out the obvious. Since they are heavily overbooked (everyone needs them to move things forward, no delegation) they miss many meetings completely. This is accepted and implicitly excused as ""they are so busy"".

Top execs rely on the annual HR survey for proof of the wonderful job they are doing. Everyone is pressured to complete the survey. Year after year the same areas are identified as poor performing areas -- but the next year and the year after that it is the same. Presentation of the results (at another All-Hands of course) is always marketing speak telling everyone how serious they are about changing these results.  

Now it appears VIsa is putting pressure on at least a couple VP's to come to Glassdoor and promise better for the future. Deja-vu. At least it appears a couple VP's are reading these comments."

HR is also the absolute worst. When I was interviewing and in the hiring process, they lost all of my information, emailed me with the wrong name, and I had to reach out to them before they reached out to me.

No wonder the IT organization has/had not delivered any major projects in over a year when I left.  Before this IT management came in, we were delivering 4-5 major projects a year.
And Speaking of the new management, it is not good when you can hear of the entire IT management structure being replaced in the span of just 18 months.  Go look up other studies of what that kind of turmoil does to a company.  Absolutely incredible that the board of directories would see this as a major red flag for running a technology of this company and forcing out that many leaders.  And then that takes a huge impact on your staff.
When I started this company, I was ready to take on the world, and I did.  I ran major projects worth $10's Millions.  When I left, I was having a very hard time caring about anything because of this management.  They are condescending, arrogant, and only want to have others from other companies that they have worked with before working with them."

Visa looks great from the outside, but is is a horrible place to work, grow, have your talent recognized or move ahead.  Reward is totally based upon image factors and who you know.

I worked in IT and the group I was in was so dysfunctional it was painful.  I think the CTO has set the tone for entire organization and it's not pleasant.  They have a deluded vision that they want to be a tech company so they installed a couple of foosball tables and open work spaces, then have proceeded to replace competent long term employees with less experienced (but new and shiny?) new hires.  Basically in the words of Heidi Klum ""one day you're in and the next day you're  OUT!!""
HR reply to one of the other reviews tells you all you need to know about the culture.  Reviewer expressed concern about how ""diversity"" seemed to be decreasing in IT and was condescendingly told ""Sorry to hear that you feel challenged by diversity within your organization""  Typical Visa response.  If you have a concern it couldn't possibly be anything other than your own problem.  Also managers will let problems fester until last possible moment so that they can rush in and save the day.   Whole place is crazy.  If you are considering an offer here you can probably do better elsewhere.  Billions in profit and they act like they are poor, won't give raises, cut benefits, etc.   As stated by others depending on what group you are in it can be quite a sweatshop environment with no work life balance and constant fire drills and manufactured emergencies."

2) There is no structure to the current technology transformation which means it is chaos and it is a very stressful place to work. For example, they are moving their data group from Foster City to Palo Alto. There was no consideration on how employees would commute to their new office or options for employees to stay at their current location. At the new office, there was not enough parking available either. After employees made a fuss, there was a shuttle added.

3) VISA is transforming their company to get rid of senior resources and hire young people and trying to be a ""cool young tech"" company. If you're a fresh grad with Java skills, VISA will hire you.

There are some (a few) skilled individuals, and some friendly people. Benefits are ok, not great.","They tell you during the interview that Visa is a tech company great for Millenials. Based on my experience that is not the case at all. 
Culture is very hierarchical and there is nepotism: VPs only talk to VPs. This is not a meritocracy, subpar people keeps their job & are promoted as long as they have influential friends.
Processes & Multiple Approvals destroy agility. It can take months to organize meetings since executive management is focused in the minor details.
Creativity & Innovation is not fostered. You are paid to do your job, if you try to give a recommendatio to improve it will be politely ignored or directly rejected.
Managers have no people skills. There is no 360 review so toxic managers can stay longer in the company, even when they have a high turnover in their teams. The executive management turns a blind eye.
Talented people leave constantly and less skilled people makes 80% of the company. I have met several people with no knowledge of excel, powerpoint and word working in Visa. 
Diversity is only promoted as a PR Exercise. There is not a genuine interest in Diversity, there is a constant talk about increasing the number of women in tech but no daycare on site which would help mothers/ fathers. Also,  if you are a Non US citizen, it is expected you to take a lower salary & be ok with it."

A lack of communication which leads to lots of speculation. You'll have very little idea what's going on unless you have good relationships with the ""right"" people, mainly Aussies and New Zealanders.

2658,Visa Inc.,Mixed feelings,2016-10-19,3.0,Director,"Obviously Visa is a great brand with a lot of smart minds. Leaders at the very top are motivating and are truly doing the best to drive Visa strategy. 
Comp and perks are great, above the market and in many cases a lateral move out of Visa would mean a pay cut. Still all international business class travel policy with 4 hrs rule, which is now almost unseen elsewhere.
Work/life balance is perfect as well as facilities and all other minor things are.","Two downsides which can hit back hard if you are thinking about career success at Visa:
-  internal politics, favoritism and nepotism showing their ugliest faces. People get hired/promoted just because they are friends or drink with right people, so you can be lucky to get a fair number of incompetent people around you whom you cannot question
- SBLs (Sr Directors these days) and VPs often spend more time in political games and personal agendas, rather than in the business. Who cares about the clients when a personal agenda is at stake! 

My advice to career hunters - to be successful at Visa forget the clients, focus on internal self promotion and lunch/drink with right people"

I believe it still can be a good place to work, if you're either on the coal face or you're a political animal who can roll with the punches in a senior position.

Salaries and benefits are very good
If you have the right boss, a decent work-life balance can be achieved
Bonus scheme is great if you ensure you're 'seen to be' doing a decent job
The company still has some of the best people in the business","Do not even think about joining Visa in a 'middle management' role.  You will quickly become a whipping boy from above and a punch bag from below.  You'll be the guy told to implement unpopular and pointless dictates in your jurisdiction, but will get absolutely no support from above when trying to do so.
Inexplicably naive decisions at the highest level over the last 5 years have resulted in throwing away around £1 billion on white elephant programmes trying to chase already dominated markets.  If that kind of investment had been used to further develop Visa Europe's core products, then we would have had a fighting chance of convincing our members that in spite of incentives promised by VI, remaining a semi-autonomous Europe-centric organisation would be in their best future interests.
There have been 2 rounds of redundancy in the last 3 years and many good people have either jumped or been pushed.  Be very sure if you are tempted to join Visa, that your role is compatible with the world as it will look after full re-integration with Visa International"

The overall expectation in all roles is to grow, train, and get/maintain certifications.  This shows in the recent rollout of Visa University, which has a variety of subjects to challenge.

There are many activities and groups relating to self-improvement and charities to be a member.  

All roles are goal based and your activities through the year lend to a descent bonus.  There are stock awards that are used in place of a straight percentage increase (this is better than nothing, but could be a Con item depending on your needs and length of service).  There is also a stock purchase plan that gives discounts to the purchase cost.   The benefits are competitive, so they change along with the times, slowly being reduced in some cases (like health plans).  This could be a Con, but the benefits still remain in the top of what is offered.  

Some companies have an 'unlimited' vacation days benefit, but I'm suspicious about this.  The time given by default is pretty good and has covered sick days, kid events, and vacation.  Of course, as your length of service increases, so does your allotted time off.","Goal Orientated: Lack of support and isolation can occur at times.  As the fiscal year comes to an end, most employees are concerned about the last dwindling days for their projects and goals.  This can mean a pile-on affect if you are a dependency to their success.  At the same time, they don't have time for any last minute tasks you are finishing up.  This scramble increases with the deadlines to purchase requests, travel and expense reports, etc...  Since goals are directly attached to bonuses, the behavior and culture of the last couple of months of a fiscal year change and not in a good way.


The other thing about goals is the assumption that they don't change.  My experience shows that the company is very flexible and changes direction to fit its needs constantly.  In this, change is good, but not for goals.  We have a chance to update the goals to fit the changes, but then it's not really goal, just a list of activities and tasks done throughout the year.  This can be disheartening when you are going to be measured against it and money is at stake, in the form of a bonus."

Other Pros that i can think about this Organisation are Good Cab Facility, Evening Snacks and Refreshments.
I am an employee of Visa from past one year and i find this place the dirtiest place in terms of work culture , work ethics, behaviour from management, and almost everything that an employee thinks he will get in an MNC.","I have Such a huge list of Cons that I can't list down here guys, but what is the biggest Cons that i see in this organisation is the Politics that goes inside the management.

In my one year journey at Visa, I have seen people leaving the organisation like anything , and till now the management is not able to understand why people are leaving the organisation. Even a 10th std. pass out can tell that it is the management which is making people leave the organisation.

The Senior director and the So-called Director don't know how to behave and treat the employees.
The Senior director has absolutely no work and no participation in work-related activities and I rarely know a single person who respects him. Coming to the So called Director, he still feels he is the director Ohh come on now at least understand what you are really worth . Right from the Re-org day, no one even cares about your words.

Executive are very aware of the lack of efficient tools/processes and have been making active efforts to experiment and improve - still to soon to conclude success. 

Visa is a very ethical company with a bold vision that will genuinely make you proud.","Senior directors and executive/senior management are happy and content, but mostly everyone else beneath them isn't.  Depending on your boss, your growth can really be a hit or miss. 

This is a small company compared to its global impact, so lateral growth is not a guarantee - almost nil; the fastest way to grow is by jumping to different groups/departments. Though this is encouraged, there's no clarity on what it takes, and executives do a very poor job training managers to lead rather than simply delegate.  

Politics, politics, politics - everything is about perception, not achievement or teamwork. 

The company used to have a lot of employees with 10+ years of tenure, but a serious brain drain has been occurring due to the explosion of innovation and competition in the industry. While the executives offer a lot of resources to help you learn, it's up to your managers to determine how much time you have for development. Performance assessment is based on the defunct annual goals standard with an general expectation for three performance goals and one development goal. 

The benefits were great, but they're going away little by little every year and don't outshine that of other tech firms. The pay is also fairly comparable to other firms, but on the higher end rather than lower. It can always be better, but the employees are not the most important assets, rather the network between banks and merchants are."

Good facilities(better for interns, who get a foreign trip in a short stint of 3 months in Visa and you didn't get despite working like a machine).","I ​have been working in Visa in team O&I now. Despite good salary, me and my teammates are unhappy with the work culture here.

We had to sign a paper that we don't have a problem with shifts. But little did we know that we are signing a paper that states that we are going to be paid slaves for Visa. We do 1-10PM shift one day and are asked to come for 7AM shift the next day. The manager forgets to submit the shift details to payroll department and we don't get the shift allowance for the month(we get it next month and tax is deducted because of higher amount, which otherwise wouldn't happen). The senior members of the team, who've come from vendor side have no respect for one's individuality and will demean you and thwarten your efforts every now and then. If you talk about your concerns to your manager, she will ask you to mend your ways. So, basically, if in Visa and particularly in O&I, you have to keep aside your self respect and work under such people who have no experience in people management. And forget about weekends; for people like me who live thousand miles away from family it's depressing,  because first you don't get to meet your family and second that you can't spend time with your friends as well.

Finally, if you know how to play office politics well, then you are golden: this is the place for you!","First, let’s talk about that title inflation: VPs there are “Dev Managers” elsewhere. “Senior VPs” would be just directors in most serious software companies.
Regarding technology: Visa is now an Indian shop, with some “outsourcing to the USA”. Since a certain senior person from India got in, not only lots of the development went to India, but now others shouldn’t even apply for positions even in the USA. The “diversity” program is now basically: which region of India are you from. Nothing against the people: most of them are technically competent. But they have no customer focus. It is all about finishing things quickly and putting a new project in the resume. Even marketing and customer service are being taken by people from India.

The employees I worked with were also unprofessional and made doing my job stressful. Even after all the bad thing, I stayed because of the pay.

I also noticed there trying to move up and even using ones gifts and talents not even used here. A lot of employees with better talent than myself have told me this job is not one that values ones talent and it shows by daily role activities. Visa is an enigma to me, because it should be an easy place to be employed, a company that will continue to flourish yet greed at the top and bad practices with employees that have talent being let go is a shame. I have great talent and feel I could have been a quality asset to this company, to bad I never got a chance to move up and really make my imprint.

The place is full of mid level managers who have no idea about technology and are mere PEOPLE managers for taking credit , getting paid and enjoying at the cost of the hard work of other people.
I found some managers to be not even technical, rather bachelors in ARTS and Chemistry who are expert in using MS Suite as the most sophisticated tool. Many Managers cannot even create a power point slide. Some use note pad to refer to key words. Many dont show up at meetings after lunch and prefer napping at home than driving to work.
Technical Managers or Directors think programming is a tool for developers as Email is a tool for themselves. Some think coding is scary and has to be done by the lowlife immigrants who are starving for a job. 
If VISA conducts a basic proctored exam for managers and directors , I would say 100% failure rate in solving technical problems will be evident . Visa is a finance company but never a technology company. You will never find any DIRECTOR from Ivy League schools, rather the most preferred species are South Asian  - especially Indian ,Pakistan and some Russians dominating the mid-management. Delegating work and being offline is the learning curve for directors. Converting contractors to full time is another lovable job they do perfectly. 

Please refrain from working under any South Asian Boss in VISA, Not only they will screw your career , but also they will mislead you to be unskilled. They will loathe you , your work and aggressively kill your dreams as soon as possible. 

Diversity Terrorism is what they excel at and Dumb is the least describing word found to be describing them. Some directors are so dumb they think JAVA is an island in Indonesia. These clown monkeys have never ever written a ""Hello World"" program in their life.  Well this is Silicon Valley where --- Dumb Gets Better and Better gets Bankrupt . 

So please go ahead and join a startup with less salary, less benefits but your learning curve will sharpen and you will feel the respect. Come here , get a pay and get offended everyday by dumb people. and YES if you are thinking to come here so that your immigration problem will be solved by joining this big company , then do join and slave for another 15 years for the Corporate Clowns mastering in filling Excel Sheets,"

It's a lie. It's a disaster inside. Highly political, totally siloed, ancient processes, audit and control groups run amok, mind-numbin processes, horrible data, worse tools, even worse planning and forecasting, and even worse leadership. The execs are completely disconnected from the rest of the org, have utterly no clue how the company functions day-to-day, are accusatory, and cruel. 

The company lists being an ""Employer of Choice"" as a goal, but they've stripped away insurance coverage, axe'd the pension program, flat-lined bonuses and raises, depressed titles, stripped travel and education budgets. They lecture everyone about saving money and have forced an ""everyone comes into the office/no remote work"" policy, while showering themselves with excessive pay out's, buying themselves multiple corporate jets, and letting the CEO and CMO work remotely from Manhattan, where the company doesn't even operate. Is a ""do as I demand, not as I do"" culture. 

Employee Sat has repeatedly shown that satisfaction is waning and that no one understands the strategy or direction of the company. Nothing's been done about it. HR is a nightmare and not to trusted. 

Work-life balance is horrible. Expect nights and weekends and constant firedrills and unrealistic expectations. Do not ever expect to be told ""good job"" or ""thank you.""

Don't bring new ideas. There is only the Visa way, which is stuck in the Dark Ages.

The pay is decent but it's very difficult to get promoted internally and benefits have been slowly decreasing.","Difficult to really get things done so morale suffers.  Culture of avoiding conflict and lots of people who get onboard with products, marketing, services just to go with the flow.  Questioning strategy or true critical thinking is not rewarded.   There are few people with the company who really understand how Visa and payments work.  Those who do and respectfully question mis-aligned products and strategies get buried within orgs or slowly pushed out.

Has the culture and vibe of an investment bank without the commercial focus and drive.
Directors are by in large talentless and in a recent case when they become a problem are simply moved to another area under the guise of a development opportunity! 
I've seen many long standing and talented people leave due a lack of competence and bullying behaviour from those at a director level. This is normal behaviour now as HR do anything but protect and support people who need their help, the most inept HR department I've seen! 
Talent programme is an embarrassment as its more to do with who you socialise with than true talent!"

- Pretty good benefits (medical, shuttle services, ""subsidized"" meals, etc.), although they just recently slashed the pension
- Intelligent colleagues","- Base pay compensation on a year over year basis hardly moves and you'll find that external candidates are being brought in at much higher rates. There is a lack of management effort/concern to bring up employees & entire organizations that are significantly below the median salary range (in fact, many of my own direct reports who have received high annual ratings are beginning to tread around the minimum base pay range)
- Internal promotions vs. External hires: again on the compensation front. When I hire an external candidate we bring them in at the median base rate where there is room to negotiate and in some cases provide additional incentives (e.g. signing bonus, moving assistance, temporary housing, etc.) whereas when I promote an internal candidate management, with the support of the compensation committee enforces a cap and places restrictions on how much we can offer (in most cases it's nowhere near the amount offered to an external hire)."

There is supposedly has been a project to move transaction processing to open systems from its mainframe base more than 2 years but we are replacing Unix by mainframe in Europe!

The only pro was leaving and getting a job in the real world with a decent company and better prospects. The only positive I can think of is having the brand on my CV and to be fair that is no biggie anymore.","Where to start on this one, the only way to progress is to align yourself with a senior manager and latch onto them. As they progress you will progress, you don't need to do anything to help the company move forward or get better, you'll just get promoted beyond your capabilities. You'll get looked after at performance management reviews and end up with bigger bonuses than the people that actually do something, if you do less then you get the bigger salary and better bonus and looked after more. Fear is a management technique that is used across the board and the senior the manager the worse it gets, maybe the company is stuck in a 1950's 'Mad Men' mentality where the boss tells everybody to do what they say, rather than what is better for the organisation. Avoid at all costs despite the Visa Inc acquisition."

-Teleworking is a myth and is mentioned at interviews to trick would-be candidates into accepting an offer of employment.
-Visa is NOT a technology company and has no real footprint in the digital or mobile payments sectors.  Internally the most sophisticated tools used are MS Suite!
-The company is plagued by an epidemic of horrible managers with no mediation from HR.  Unethical and unprofessional conduct is commonplace at the VP level coupled with a well-founded fear of retribution among their staff.
-If you value your professional growth, are excited about working in the payments sector and want to work with bright, sociable colleagues- avoid Visa at all costs.  You will eventually feel stifled by the pervasive lack of innovation and the culture of passive aggression.
-Teams are extremely silo'd and uncommunicative with cohorts.  You may find people unwilling to share best practices or even coach/train one another because of fear that you might do things better.  The concern is NEVER with creating better, innovative or impactful solutions to problems, but maintaining sole ownership of a given task so as to be indispensable.

Brand still strong (though as finance-related increasingly tarred with same brush as consumer dislike for banks)","Absurd quest to push net operating margin ever higher to keep the Street happy means senior management (1) is slashing benefits, most notably chopping everyone's income by 6% in the form of sun setting a defined retirement contribution plan, and (2) very limited willingness to invest in future capabilities that will create new sources of value.

What this company needs is a sense of urgency about its future. We may be today's incumbent, with a huge market share, but Kodak probably felt the same way with respect to the photographic film sector.

Business has huge barrier to entry for new competitors otherwise I'm sure competitors won't let Visa get away with approx. 70 percent operating margin. However, the company became victim of its own success and was complacent.  Finally, the company woke up to new reality as nobody is safe with companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook scouting for new business to penetrate with huge free cash flow. Lots of efforts going on spurring up the innovation. Did we hit snooze button too many times or woke up on time? Don't know...time will tell","I love the company's urge to change and to stay relevant. But it is important to not burn the bridge and treat the old timers with great respect as we won't be here without their hard work. HR has great room for improvement.

Stock price and profit is all that matters now. Benefits and salary increases have been dwindling slowly but steadily.  When accounting for cost of living increases and benefit reduction, most employees end up making less each year, instead of more.  Changes in management come with reorganizations that don't make sense and that years later get reversed when new people come in.

You're more likely to get ignored or even mocked rather then get help to achieve your personal, professional and corporate goals.  The Indian managers seem to care about growing their personal empires of employees: they want bodies not skilled workers. Not sure if that is true for the non-Indian male managers. Female managers?

Interns relocated from overseas will get full relocation while 10 year employees must pay their own way. Force placed ratings are borderline unethical in that executive management continually denies this policy exists. All high performing & newly promoted staff receive 2's (out of 4) by rule (no matter what their performance) and thus are disqualified from any equity grants. Staff 2-3 levels below will receive these valuable grants however - no incentive for long term commitment and growth for dedicated and high performing middle management.

There are a lot of people in here who EXPECT the opportunities to come to them, to have their hand held through processes and to sunset their banking careers because they feel their $150k+ salary is earned without needing to do any work. VISA is a different company now, with tons of change (which is a GOOD THING), and tons of opportunities if you give it a chance to LOOK and NETWORK with the people who influence the company. Dont expect a unicorn career here. Like most other places you need to WORK for it, make your work known to everyone, and hustle. If that means you need to retire early because you can't hang, then please, by all means, go for it.

Still I would point out some.
Some people take their job in Visa as granted and think it is their own company as each of the sr. dir and dir would behave as a CEO of Visa bangalore.
I was surprised to see Visa US people are also dissatisfied to quite an extent and it is evident in their glassdoor reviews. Some of the sr. level people have left Visa US.
Technology wise not a great place to work as most of the tech are obsolete and people on top level are even more obsolete. They just talk nonsense.
PMO team is a joke and believe me or not they have gifted more meetings and calls as a part of agile where people are busy in meetings for more than half a day and half a night. 
Most of the product stuff is a copy (mini copy as infra/services doesn't support 100% of what paypal does) of what paypal do and the reason behind it is the same set of people who migrate from paypal and then back to paypal. No real innovation. The connection is so strong that if people are fired in paypal they get hired in visa.
Work culture is not at all good. Bureaucracy prevails.
Do not join any of the divisions except Admin or HR dept.
People in Visa claim that glassdoor reviews will always be the bad one, in that case Adobe,Informatica,Google,FB,Microsoft all should have bad ratings. Just an excuse from incompetent management.
Most of us are waiting to complete 1 year in Visa and move out. But got to know that lot of people have moved out even before completing 1 year.

Too much bureaucracy - it is extremely difficult to get a simple thing done due to the many layers of approvals put in place. For e.g. does an engagement of USD 1,000 REALLY need approval from the head of department? Sourcing processes need to be revamped as it makes life a hell for those who are trying to move things at a speedier place. 

2. Trying to brand itself as Employer of Choice but the steps taken towards this goal are moving the company in the opposite direction. 

3. Interns and those hired via the new graduate development program are put on a pedestal and given ALL the  admiration and perks that the experienced hires do not have. What are the rest of us, chopped liver?

4. Open and honest communication is not forthcoming especially when there are major changes to compensation and benefits. The pertinent points are buried under a mountain of non-pertinent information. It's as if the management is afraid of facing the employees and have to resort to such cowardly tactics. 

5. No career progression since there are so may people in middle management (Director level). As a result, a people manager ends up hoarding all the work in order to be in the limelight and only allows her direct reports to pick up the scraps and work on things that do not see the light of day.

The company has tremendous potential if they will hire good people, but the toxic ""yes"" men are the ones who get promoted rather than people with capabilities to transform the business to match it's potential. I would not recommend Visa to my worst enemy, the people at visa only care about themselves. They win awards left and right for customer satisfaction and best in state, it's all rigged, the customer survey questions nearly guarantee positive responses to win the awards every year rather than actually improve the customer experience. Management will spend 6 months debating things before they act on a change which takes minutes to implement. Visa is the worst organization I have ever worked for.

Most people and teams are unable to keep up with workload and slow assistance from support teams makes it difficult to work effectively and quickly.

I read the ads placed my Visa on Glassdoor (employee of choice - really) and the reviews from interns. It seem that only the 'leadership' team and the interns are impressed with working at Visa.

Each year all employees have experienced a cut in overall compensation - no raises, smaller bonus, higher medical premiums with less coverage,working space which consists of a 4.5 feet of table with a colleague on your left, right and in front of you. This 'collaborative' environment feels more like a factory-worker setting.

Whatever bad reviews are already there, they are all so true.
Whatever good reviews are there, they are from freshers.
There are mainly four divisions in Visa India office 1. VDP (80% ex-Microsoft guys)  2.  MAP (50% ex-paypal/ebay guys)  3. DMPD(80% ex-vendors)   4. O&I (50% ex-wipro) Decide where to join.
1. Total Visa is service based culture, pathetic work culture. Some team leads/mgrs make you sit and work,observe your IN/OUT-time to office.
2. Very few good projects with very few people from good product based companies
3. Good people have started to look outside Visa for job change ,resumes are floating in mkt.
4. Already many people have left within joining of 6 months.
5. People hired are through contacts so you can imagine the quality of people hired,not many good company people are applying for job in Visa. 
6. US team is totally disconnected, imagine the struggle for KTs and other things, late night calls(12-1AM) and people in India join that. 
7. No proper road map for any of the projects. Good projects are still done from US.
8. All senior management people in India are trying to establish themselves by hook or by crook. No vision.
9. Freshers are being given some random work for their engagement, no real work.
10. Visa is another Infosys, in short.
11. Pays are not that great except NITs/IITs.
12. Freshers are also not that happy and might leave later if not sooner.
13. Salary and Designation disparity across the company as someone has rightly mentioned in an earlier review.
14. Lot of well known people in US from top management have left the company specifically in O&I div.
15. Below 5% hike , mostly 0% this time. They call variable pay as bonus and everybody gets happy for that as if it is outside their CTC.
16. They are competing with MS,Flipkart,Oracle by paying good salaries to freshers but quality and exposure is not even 10% of what MS,FK and Oracle offers. Worst of all few NITians doing testing and support job here.
17. In 8 months, emp count is >600-700, think about the hiring pace for a new company in bangalore. Heard they have over hired people and still going strong.
18. Office politics at its best in some divisions.
19. None of the divisions except MAP is a revenue generating for Visa so expect firing at some point of time.
20. At last, see the glassdoor overall review. Below 3 (at the time of this review) says everything about a company."

My sense is there used to be effort made to make the corporate culture more stable and give employees a chance to contribute pro actively, while at the same time prudently manage risk. So, though not impressive when compared to other Silicon Valley companies, not bad when compared to your average american corporate culture (especially East Coast corporate banking culture). Also, if you're looking for a 9-5 type gig, you can make that work at Visa, but why live in Silicon Valley if you're going to do that?","Except for the reasons listed in the ""Pros"" section, I wouldn't advise working at Visa. As mentioned above, my sense is that there used to be some effort placed on managing a reasonably effective corporate culture, with prudent risk taking, which, in all fairness, is difficult to do when you have more than twice the market share of your next closest competitor (there is something to be said for prudently maintaining one's market dominance). That said, everyone in Silicon Valley that knows anything about the payments space, knows that PayPal shouldn't even exist . . . I'll let you think about that for a second."

Employees often find their roles and responsibilities are unclear, which is quite common in many departments. There're too many unnecessary layers in some organizations. Often time, job promotion is not based on performance (which is secondary in most cases), but based on how skillful an employee can kiss up and kick down. There are way too many so called Senior Director and VP in the company. Some of them don't even know what they're doing and/or how to do their job; and they even don't understand the business and the industry. Amazing!! There's a lot of FAT and Parasites in the organization. The sad things are that there are a number of talent employees who are experienced and who made significant contributions to the company got marginalized or pushed to the sideline because of their incompetent managers who see them as a threat. Over the past 2 years, I have been seeing a number of talent and great employees who left Visa.  The work environment has become very political and dysfunctional, which can be found in many organizations within the company. The politics there are very thick. The leadership is very poor. I have worked for a number of Fortune 500 and small and medium sized companies prior to Visa, but I have never seen there're a lot of negative employee comments posted on InSite (internal company web site) about the leadership, benefit cuts, etc. I wouldn't be surprised there will be more good employees leaving the company soon."

SILENCE. Silence from executive management in addressing any issues whatsoever. 
CUTS. The company is doing extremely well. What should we cut first? Pensions.
DIVERSITY. Again, look at all the comments. How do you go from hiring Indian (male) management all the way up to executive vice president, and now not notice that 1.

Yet when the numbers are actually looked at, Visa is well within it ranges and many of these taxes won't apply. 

Despite numerous, NUMEROUS queries from employees requesting a discussion about how these decisions were reached there is nothing but a deafening silence from management.No reason to responds since they got their bonuses which range in the millions. Don't beleive it? Just check the SEC filings. 

The slogan around here is that Visa wants to be the ""Employer of Choice"". Yet by their own admission freezing the pension alone takes us from #! in recent business surveys to #5. What exactly is the choice being made here? Be another face in the crowd of employers?   Don't fall for it people."

If that is what you want.","Working in technology is probably the worst. Fighting for promotions under the new I.T. (Indian Technology) leadership is like piranhas fighting over a morsel of stale week old dead fish. This amazing leadership team has used everything in their arsenal to motivate every well paid employee to leave. They're laser focused on attracting interns and college grads. Their reasoning is they'd like to bring fresh ideas and new blood. Which basically means one or both of two things: 1) They admit to not being able to motivate existing employees to innovate and/or 2) They are wanting lower employee costs across the board and when people become ready for promotions in a couple of years, best to phase them out or block them till they leave disgusted, then get some new cheap hires. Burn and churn. They've also decided to get rid of consultants who knew what the hell they were doing and bring in Wipro (Indian contractor) for technology services across the board. Of course at cheaper rates. Which just means less diversity, less people whom you can actually understand when they speak with you , and you-get-what-you-pay-for service. Short of driving outside Home Depot to see if any day laborers can help in their I.T. shop for the day, the CTO Rajat has done everything else to cut costs, and of course run this thing into the ground. The results show in the internal and external products portfolio. 

BTW - I keep saying Indian because that's what the entire technology department is. It's not a racist comment, I am Indian myself, but clearly diversity is non-existent in their technology group. Which means very biased cultural thought processes are pervasive."

3068,Visa Inc.,Misalignment across goals and actions; serious issues with undervaluing employees,2015-11-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Visa is a very strong brand, and I’m extremely proud to work for the company. There are definitely some strong and extremely capable managers who empower their employees and act in a fair and non-political manner. Some managers offer benefits to their employees, i.e. allowing them to work from home or remotely, and providing mobile phones.","Issues with Managers: There are managers who engage in horrible behavior, whether it be publically shaming employees, blatant disrespect to direct reports, to the point where it becomes bullying, or overworking employees, and there is no way for employees to seek help. Some managers literally lead by fear, and are rewarded because their direct reports deliver strong work. There is one employee engagement survey done annually, and seldom does anything happen to managers who receive bad ratings. When it comes time for compensation, 360 reviews are not considered, so managers are not incentivized to treat their direct reports like actual people. There are also no people management classes for managers, so those who receive poor ratings on the engagement review don’t have any training or repercussions to their poor performance. 

Emphasis on Millennials: For a company that preaches an increased interest in recruiting millennials, there is absolutely no surveying or monitoring of millennials who recently joined Visa, with the exception of the New Graduate Development Program. As a new graduate who returned following a fantastic internship experience, I have had absolutely no external support from HR in terms of providing me with a mentor, offering any type of training beyond the normal 3-hour onboarding program, or any type of check-in about the transition from internship to full-time positions. They worked very hard to recruit us to come back full-time, but have made no effort to help facilitate, or even gain insights into, our transition into life at Visa. Many older employees feel as though the company is catering solely to young people, but this is just not the case in my experience. If you care about millennials and attracting young talent, act like it. It’s extremely frustrating to have been recruited so heavily and then ignored upon arrival at the company and in addition, to listen to leadership talk about how Visa is a great place to young people to work and how they want to recruit young talent.

Need to Align Company Goals with Practices: Visa claims to be a tech company, and have a “think like a startup” mentality—this is an absolute joke. It’s far too political and corporate to be a tech company, and cares much too little about employees to be a startup. It’s one thing to preach in all hands that you care about employees, but it’s another thing altogether to actually show that you value your employees. There is so much emphasis on the “employer of choice” pillar, but nothing really behind it. Morale on some teams is very, very low, and not only is nothing being done, but nobody seems to really care. 

Inconsistent Policies: The standards for several policies are wildly inconsistent across and even within functional departments; specifically, work from home (WFH), working remotely, and mobile phones. Within the same function, there will be teams with extremely different WFH/work remote policies, and the same is true for mobile phones. Some managers allow WFH with little to no notice, while some restrict the practice entirely. The BYOD program allows people to use their personal phones for work, but many teams allow employees to use a phone that Visa pays for in order to have constant access to email. There is no standard for any of these policies, and it is entirely up to manager discretion."

3071,Visa Inc.,Mediocre by the day,2015-11-14,1.0,Director,Visa's biggest strength is its market share and with VE acquisition there is tremendous potential for the company but there are head winds and disruptive innovations in the Payments space.,"Given the geography they operate in and the industry (fintech), benefits are not comparable. Compensation is generally much lower than most tech companies in the bay area for similar job functions i.e. staff engineer, director, sr director etc are all well below market compared to other peers in the bay area. With the recent decision to take out a key total compensation benefit there is widespread employee anger and disbelief. The callous communication to employees plus complete radio silence and spin by the Exec Management only made matters worse. It is going to be tough to retain some of the top talent or attract any new talent with this latest development. As evidenced by the number of reviews on Glassdoor in the recent days, employee morale and discontent is at an all time high."

Good brand to have on your CV.","Visa Inc has bought Visa Europe back after about 8 years of independence. Everything Visa Europe does (authorising cards transactions, clearing and settlement, currency conversion, etc.) Visa Inc does as well on a much larger scale and scalability. The chances that Visa Inc is going to maintain separate systems for everything (e.g. Visa Europe's UNIX authorisation system plus Visa Inc's IBM mainframe system) are roughly in winning the lottery jackpot territory.

A large part of the Visa Inc business case for buying Visa Europe will most likely be the operational cost savings of merging all the IT systems into Visa Inc and turn Visa Europe into a business support unit of 200 - 300staff. Currently, Visa Europe has about 3,000 staff - so do the math. Mastercard is operating the same set-up, with their European HQ being at Canary Wharf and a similar headcount.

But stuff like that seems to happens more often than you'd expect at such a big company (almost everyone on my team had a similar experience)

They also just cut benefits -- a lot. They used to have a pension pay in plan -- now they won't contribute anything (basically 6% pay cut). Our health insurance went up 15%. It was explained to us that this is because they want to ""be aligned/median"" with the benefits of other ""tech"" companies, but we keep on being told that they're trying to make visa ""the employer of choice."" Its hard to be median with other tech companies when they provide wellness centers, free food, and other on site services and we don't even get those -- just our benefits slashed.

 And worst of all, during performance reviews they basically told college hires ""well all college hires are looked at basically the same"" and gave us 0% pay increase and not even a full bonus, even if we are high performers by their own metrics. (We are being pushed to track everything and measure our efficiency in arbitrary ways, like lines of code)

This isn't what I hoped it would be as a first job out of college. There is some opportunity to learn, but not a lot to grow. There's a lot of ""well that's just how it is,"" in addition to cutting benefits. They will tell you almost anything to get you to sign the contract as well.  Former Visa interns, beware!"

- Raise health care expense 15-20%.
- No salary raise (inflation adjustment), not even for the promoted ones.

This is particularly hard to understand when the company is doing fine financially and has invested heavily in a lot of business deals, initiatives and office expansion/renovation projects in expensive areas.

It's even hard to understand when senior executives have increased investment the corporate jets/hangar and c-level executive just received multi-millions sign on bonus.  

It's very sad to see the company deliver such a important change via an email and made little effort to mange the change process other than limit the annual enrollment meeting to a conference room that can seat no more than 40 people so there won't be hundreds and thousands angry employees gather together and fight on this topic."

With recent record profits management sees fit to put the money into the stockholders rather than their employees. The other reviews here tell you how low morale is and the discontent with being treated like numbers instead of people. Management is facing a ton of pressure over recent benefits changes and their prolonged silence has created a firestorm of negativity and unhappiness. While some in the company attempt to put a positive spin on what is happening, no one is buying it.

As a company we've improved Net Income and Revenue consistently year over year and have cash reserves in the many Billions. In fact we just announced a $5B stock buy back plan, but somehow we can't afford to keep a program in place that has been a huge reason for not only retention, but also new hires.

While headed into a historically busy peak season, the company suddenly announced that it will be freezing the pension plan as of the end of 2015.  This came timed just after the announcement to buy Visa Europe yet before compensation discussions.  This was communicated in a couple of paragraphs in the lower portion of a running-on benefits update e-mail.  Obviously, the intent was to not call too much attention to this major change, but instead resulted in a huge backlash from the majority of employees.  Productivity was killed and left most wondering what the longer-term goals really are.  The company will hold the money, “earning interest”, until we leave or retire.  No rolling it to another plan for better growth. No additional contribution to 401’s to make up for the substantial cut. No alternative.  

Other cons: Promotions happen only once per year, just like Santa Claus.  You can forget about being promoted off-cycle, and the promotions that are available seem to be reserved for favorites who spent the entire year producing only the most vivid PowerPoint presentations.  There are some talented and motivated employees that are itching to do some great things, but people are kept in the trenches for years doing the same job. They are kept just enough out of visibility so that existing “leadership"" can continue to flourish. Diversity is a joke, it seems that the one-hour presentation is done because it has to be as part of the HR script.  

You hope your colleagues and staff stick around, since the hiring process is arduous and complicated, requiring no less than seven interviews fully documented and two degrees from a short list of only the best schools for an entry-level position.

But let's not tar everyone with the same brush.
3128,Visa Inc.,Worst company for laterals,2015-11-02,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,One of the Best company to work if you are a fresher. Infrastructure is good.,"Worst company to work for if you are a lateral hire especially if you are part of O&I. To illustrate my point let me explain you why?
i joined in O&I (Visa Bangalore). I was okay with everything although i had not got the kind of hike I had asked. But i was content that this will be good opportunity as they had recently started this center and everything looked glam from the office to the fun at work culture. (Point to note: Subsidized lunch started only recently and transport will start from 15th of next month [this is what we have been hearing from past 6-8 months]).
Initially while interacting with other colleagues within O&I, it came to light that everyone had a hard time negotiating with the HR for hike. [HR (for laterals at least) has been outsourced to INFOSYS and they did not leave any stone unturned to make laterals beg for each a penny]. 
Hearing about this I (at least the human inside) was happy until I came to know other laterals in other department (VDP, DMPD etc.) for the same years of experience have got much more than us in O&I (AT LEAST 150%). I consoled myself giving the logic that they have different skill set and we are cost center for the company while they are the cash cow.
But the nails in coffin happen to be the info about the salaries of fresher joining from college. Let me give you an insight here (for O&I of course). The salaries for laterals with 2-4 years: 5.5L-8L; 4-8 years: 8L-12L. Now, the salaries for fresher, IITs-22+ L, NITs – 12-14+L and others >8L (6+ L for few colleges). 
Let me clarify I have nothing against the fresher but the idiotic decision makers who thought this would be good experiment to observe human behavior when people are kept under dire circumstances. 
Think of the situation that we have to give KT and teach the fresher while know that they earn way more than what we are earning. We should not be feeling this but it seems they mock us at our back and even feel pity for us.                
The reason I am writing this is to make the HR department realize if you not normalize the salaries (if rumors are to be believed it has been done for VDP who were way better off than us) then I don’t see why there would not be 30% alteration in O&I.  
And the micro managing the employee by the O&I local boss is not helping your cause. Visa O&I work culture is worse than Service based companies; forget about Product based companies."

Smart employees","Visa is a great place to work on paper. But in reality, it is one of the most dysfunctional corporations I've seen. The senior management is totally disconnected from the rest of the company and routine decisions that are made by mid level employees at other companies are required to get CEO approval. Even  opening POs of $5.000 require CEO/CFO approval, creating a huge logjam. Our CEO has cut back the size and scope of our employee survey instead of addressing negative feedback and while the company enjoys record profit margins, budgets are continually slashed, pitting colleagues against each other and forcing political chess matches instead of teamwork and collaboration. There is no respect for work/life balance and forget about a real vacation - managers have no respect for time off - even expecting 24/7 connectivity for non-essential functions."

These companies by themselves have never fared well in the recent times so don't really know what value these  guys will add. the so called ""Change"". and adopting to Change is a buzz word, if someone contradicts that, they are asked to leave the company. There is 36% attrition in the leadership/Manager level, speaks volume of the exodus. These guys only know talk, talk, talk no really accomplishment. 
HR is another disaster, their main job is to save the executive back. HR made Mistake by changing the performance rating culture and when the employees complained about pay for performance, this year they are forcing managers not to give higher rating so that way the employees do not complain about pay as the performance rating is low, saving Themselves and making millions for executives.

Management was in the middle of transition when I was there and it seemd to be moving in a good direction.,"At the time I worked there, there was a history of IT working in a ""vendor-like"" relationship with the Business that no longer was in effect but the residue was there.  Business management treated IT very, very rudely even when it was not an IT issue.  Made for a poor working environment with the people you were supposed to be helping."

No opportunity to grow and work in a different department. Once you work in the Call center you will never leave that place unless you resign. Expect to answer 130 calls per day and not be able to help the customers. And when you want a day off, you will have to beg your manager for it. Some managers are great, and they will help you, but some, most of them, are horrible and they will do nothing for you. You will have to change your schedule every 6 months depending on performance. So, if you do not perform, you can get stuck with an overnight shift. If you perform, you will be able to choose one day of the weekend off and better hours.

Worst decision of my professional life ever"
3225,Visa Inc.,Something is rotten in the state of Denmark....,2015-08-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some amazing people at Visa.  Most of the people I knew who were though,  weren't given nearly the credit they deserved.  Many had been there a long time and understood the payments industry in a profound way.   Bringing in new talent can be a great boon to a  business trying to lead on the edge.  But respect the brains that got you there in the first place, and make external hiring and internal promotion both options for building a strong executive team.

It's an exciting industry and the outlook for Visa in the years to come is solid.  There are many competitors vying for the rich profits in this space,  but the brand is extremely strong and I can't imagine a scenario where they don't exist.  That's not something you can say about all companies in this arena.","""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower,"" (Steve Jobs) and Visa needs to  LEAD.  I mean really think up new approaches.   They have the resources, and I'm not sure why it isn't happening.

I can't quite put my finger on what is wrong with the culture at Visa, but something is.  As the Peter Drucker attributed saying goes, ""Culture eats strategy for breakfast,"" and something needs to change within the inner framework of the company.   When you walk the floors, people don't seem to be connected to one another.  There isn't an open, collaborative and collegial approach to work in many cases.   And that will have to change to make Visa viable in the long term, because that does exist at the competition."

3231,Visa Inc.,Disappointing HR Leadersship,2015-08-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Global Brand Leader in Payment Space,"The HR leadership team is made up of a lot of fluff and little substance.  The lack of self awareness is shocking and there is little collaboration among the leaders.  There is little empowerment and engagement, and if you voice your concerns you get your hand slapped - managers have the power, employees have no say in how they are being treated which is why employees take to Glass Door or the anonymous Employee Survey to convey their frustrations.

HR Leadership is hiring Leaders who care more about their own personal agenda then supporting the Visa employee base and HR team.  The passive aggressive nature of the ego centric Leaders is harmful.

You don't need to hear HR employees comments to realize that HR is a train wreck with poor leadership, the Attrition numbers speak for themselves.   Unfortunately, management turns a blind eye and just says, change is good.  True, but when its in the high double digits it is a red flag."

2. Giving employees a pay bump or promotion is difficult and time consuming. This lowers manager motivation and results in fewer requests.

3268,Visa Inc.,Project Manager,2015-07-22,3.0,Project Manager/Scrum Master,Great company. Benefits. Great environment.,management is not great. Not flexible in work.
3269,Visa Inc.,Big Corporation Work Culture,2015-07-21,2.0,,Good benefits and nice campus. There is a pretty decent gym onsite & cafeterias.,"The work culture is so pre historic, compared to the culture in other companies in bay area."

3271,Visa Inc.,Director,2015-07-20,1.0,Director,"Great but diminishing benefits. Experienced co-workers. Interesting work. Attempts are being made to make things cool for the millinials (pool tables, limited free food).",Highly toxic environment in the Technology area. Anyone with self-respect would leave (as many are). Technology EVP is a googler wannabe not realizing that he is not a Larry Page or a Sergey Brin. Technology EVP is unable to connect with anyone other than his followers on social media and direct reports that he has hired. Leadership style is abusive. Attempts to simplify process have had unintended consequences of inaccurately reporting capitalized projects.
3272,Visa Inc.,They only pay li service to innovation,2015-07-18,2.0,Director of Engineering,"One of the main reasons to work at Visa is that it is a ""safe"" employer. They never get rid of anyone. Even if you are underperforming as an individual contributor, the bonuses and compensation are not really tied to your performance because everyone basically gets an ""average"". Also, there are plenty of reasons not to get something done. You can always point at another department and say ""I couldn't finish my thing because I was blocked by someone over in ..."".

If you keep your head down, don't make any noise but show up for work and meetings, you will continue to draw a paycheck for as long as you want.","But if you want to innovate, don't believe anything they say about it. We've been told for over a year to change our methodology to Agile. The result? The groups who are successful at it (especially in my org under Loyalty) were buried UNDER another team that is waterfall and will remain so... while folks that were taking pot-shots at us got moved up.

The majority of our work is done by BPO outsourcing but none of our vendors are effective. We have roughly a 1:4 ratio of FTE to BPO in my org. It takes one FTE to lead a team of 4 BPO and the BPO doesn't get the work done. So we are paying 5 people to do the work of 1 FTE. Why do we keep doing it? Because the executives with the biggest budgets get the biggest bonuses.

Adopting new technologies is a sure path to corporate death. It is a company full of seagull architects who ""swoop down, poop on everything and fly away"". The company has armies of architects who aren't responsible for delivering value but if they approve something they feel they own it. So they say ""no"" in an effort to keep the amount of work they have to do at a minimum.

This is plainly clear in their last employee survey which pointed out that they #1 challenge to their employees was getting work done. As soon as that was announced, the security team launched a pilot to remove admin rights from developers laptops so that they need to ask approval to do things such as look at environment variables, check their system load or profile their machine's performance. How insane is that?!?!?!?

I have worked at Visa for 4 years and as of this week finally reached my limit. I am on my way out and 4 top engineers I work with have already asked me to try to find a place where they can follow."
3273,Visa Inc.,Crazy company,2015-07-17,3.0,Unemployed,The pay was medium grade and the hours was great got to make major money doing overtime and also Health Benefits was super. If you want a retirement plan check they got all that covered. Also promotions was nice getting a extra 1000 bonus was great! Rewarding employees with a night on the town by giving free movie tickets or gift cards was also very fun to have happen.,The downside is Promoting from within was very little and sometimes the mangers didn't want you to leave and after being a customer service rep learning so many products I figure why not be promoted. Also major downside is depending what job you take you will be outsourced for a cheaper labor employee. Also after leaving this company no other company can contact them to verify that you worked their only information available via website about your duties. Severance pay was good but short lived in this economy need a lot more to live off after being let go at no fault of your own.

It seems pretty good compared to other companies though there is some competition for technical resources.  Overall I can't say much about the pros.,Though the management says they care about work life balance.  They don't seem to know what that means.  There is no work life balance from what I can tell.  There is no reward for 12 to 14 hour work days.  I have seen a mass exodus either from being laid off or from people quitting.  I don't think it's the company.  I believe it's the management.

- We are constantly restructuring with little rationale.
- Decisions are revisited over and over and nothing is ever finalized
- Management says they want folks to take risks, but punishment for failure is harsh. There is no support for new ideas.  
- There is no strategy for innovation.  Visa claims to be a leader and innovator,  but they follow the big banks and are afraid to really push the envelope and compete. They only innovate when forced to by competitors like Stripe, Google, PayPal and others.
- The culture is ultra competitive with executives being pitted against one another by the CEO.   It is a mean culture.
- Employee survey results continue to slip and very little is done to address employee concerns.
- Bad managers such as those leading HR, Communications, Marketing and Merchant are kept around even though their failures are well documented.
- The internal and external communications are poor and reactive.

Incompetence is rewarded greatly at Visa, as is being an Indian male.  The EVP of Technology clearly has an agenda to destroy the company while the CEO smugly watches.  Smart people have been run out the door over the last year.  Others simply left around the holidays, without giving notice, to go elsewhere, since anywhere else is better.

3367,Visa Inc.,Visa's Dirty Secrets:  Ageism and Ethics,2015-04-22,1.0,Business Leader,"Work/Life balance. Pay, benefits,  Great place, and good people to work with....... for many years....with the exception of...see Cons.","Dear Charlie and Company;

What happened?  Visa was a great place to work.  For many new hires, it probably remains a great place to work.  For longer term employees, the future seems bleak.  There are a few self-serving senior managers masquerading as leaders who are corrupt, bending the rules, and leaving everyone afraid to speak up.  No doubt, corporate mandates influenced by stockholders are now driving policy and errant behavior.....but that doesn't excuse management complicity.  Employees are key stakeholders too, and you're giving them the shaft!!

The first Dirty Secret:   If an employee is nearing the 10/50 retirement option, he/she is likely a target for ""realignment.""  Seniority and tenure appear to be devalued, and highly skilled and knowledgeable employees are getting pushed out the door with hush-money severance packages.  Payroll reduction and payroll ""restructuring"" is the oldest trick in the book to demonstrate improved corporate performance. It's one of the most desperate and insidious corporate performance improvement tools at a company's disposal.  The 10/50 retirement package is an legacy program and abused ""policy"".  Suggesting that a specific and arbitrary age is a retirement perk, in today's world, is a class action suit waiting to happen.

The second Dirty Secret:  The new 1-4 performance rating system is a setup.  Performance issues have always been an easy way to facilitate an employee's ""departure.""   Visa is an ""at will"" company and there is no hesitation to restate this fact behind closed doors.  To add insult to injury, the outdated and draconian Performance Improvement Plan is an absolute farce.  Senior managers are abusing and manipulating the PIP, under HR's guidance, to weed out employees in the most unethical way conceivable.   Attention HR......a 50% PIP success rate is no better than chance.  Get real!!   

In addition, HR and Legal appear to believe the performance allegations and press of senior managers.   HR and Legal are unwittingly condoning and excusing the behavior.  Both groups are blind to the PERJURY and false performance claims of a select few.  Yes....lies and fraud are hiding in plain sight!!   Handing oversight and final judgement of an employees ""poor performance"" to the same manager responsible for the train wreck is an employee's death warrant.  

Having the ""fox guard the chicken coop"" is an egregious and Machiavellian form of employee negligence and abuse.  Any manager with true leadership qualities and any shred of accountability would never guide an employee to a low rating that leads to potential discharge.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts.  Permitting such behavior makes Visa's own written code of conduct and business ethics appear to be shallow and vacuous marketing material only.  

HR's commentary when confronted with such concerns.......... and this statement is in their own words:  ""...........but, It's not illegal""   Excuse the cynicism....but does that make it okay!!??  The bar has been set very low for what is considered acceptable and ethical behavior.  

Yes, this is ALL documented and recorded, but nobody would believe it if they heard it with their own ears or saw it with their own eyes.  For the courageous few who are willing to comment, there are bound to be more reviews like this."

3407,Visa Inc.,"An interesting industry and a company with potential, squandered by juvenile politics practiced by inept leadership",2015-02-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"1) Work/ life balance is good

The lack of commercial focus means easy-to-achieve targets for leaders that, in turn, makes life at VE very cushy for some.

2) Office in Paddington is nice; convenient location, gym nearby, great canteen

3) A social company where you can make friends

4) Potentially interesting projects (more a function of the industry than specific to VE)

5) Sponsorship of the Olympics and World Cup is exciting and can give rise to some good perks and a nice buzz in the office","1) Inept, highly political leadership:

Though not unique to VE, the extent and impact of this is the point. Leaders are more concerned with empire building/ maintenance than the greater good of the company or their teams.

2) A squandered opportunity through a botched 
reorganisation and redundancy programme

The arrival of a new CEO was the opportunity to clean up under-performing leaders (easily identified) and start afresh. Instead, rife were instances of the inept retaining their jobs or, in many cases, rising. What message does this give?

The restructure and redundancy programme were woefully mis-managed: poor CEO engagement (""I'm not here to make friends"" was one nugget) and a nonsense organisational structure (several ""at risk"" teams were suddenly realised to be vital; responsibilities were not clearly defined resulting in much confusion). The process lasted most of 2014 and created a depressing working environment. I don't think many can truthfully say the outcome changed things for the better.

3) A culture of bullying left unchecked

Again, present in most companies. Most striking is the apparent frequency of abhorrent treatment of direct reports by managers. Line managers have complete power over your destiny and can use the performance management system with impunity without any checks/balances to ensure fairness.

Blatantly unfair or preferential treatment of direct reports is widely observed and yet overlooked. Competent, ambitious people are often seen as a threat to management and are put down. Unfortunately, much of this comes down to a HR function without teeth, focusing more on the administrative side of their role rather than being a trusted partner to the business.

4) Lack of commercial focus/ mindedness

Whilst giving rise to some of the pros listed, it is also a significant weakness. A firm focus on the bottom line could quell much of the politics and align the interests of leaders with the firm's interests. A leader worried about achieving ambitious targets has less capacity for self-serving politics and delinquent behaviour and a corporate scorecard result significantly above 100% every year surely points to easy targets. Risk should be associated with reward (a high salary at the top levels) and this model seems to be broken at VE.

Be wary of this lack of commercial mindedness as an employee, especially at the earlier stages of your career. When the time comes for you to move to another company, it will be a tough adjustment.

5) Uncertain future ownership

The future ownership question is revisited periodically, paralysing the company in its wake with distracted leaders and conspiracy theories abound. Sort it out and get a decision."

Visa is a household world all over the world and it is inspiring to be part of that. However, the cons negate most of the effects of the fabulous brand.","Managers manage up with no regard for those who report to them.

Low morale - joined Visa with high hopes only to be brought down by a constant message in my ear saying ""don't get too comfortable""

Way too political  - when a senior manager is brought in from another company, they bring their entire team with them and get rid of all the old, knowledgeable people.  

Overly complex processes - I feel as though people at Visa oftentimes complicate tasks that could and should be simple just to feel important or that they are contributing more than they actually are.

Steps so far have been to cut pay for final salary participants, and no pay rises for approx. 1/3 of the staff, whilst bonuses are skewed towards a smaller section of the privileged few, and trend seems to be to move away from upper quartile pay towards market median, maybe to encourage a second round of cost reduction via staff churn without the expense of voluntary redundancy...

Its a good brand which is known worldwide.","To begin with, Visa doesn't need software engineers. So you are a burden to the company.  Software engineers are the first ones to let go if the company wants to trim costs.  All the software engineers report to a Business Leader AKA Manager who is not necessarily technical. Your business leader decides your career and its out of your hands once you join the company. Business requirements keep changing often, so thousands of lines of code can go to your Trash folder in a moment! If you raise your concerns with your Business leader, you will be reprimanded and it could affect your year end review. So you are enslaved! The title you get has got nothing to do with the work you do. Partner technology services team (PTS) which is actually a technical support team actively hires software engineers from the market and ruins their careers!

The pay was good, bonuses fantastic, and stock incentive very generous.  The overall environment was one that invested heavily into employee satisfaction and product innovation.","Recently, with recent management changes (CEO and virtually all direct reports and virtually the entire 2nd layer) has resulted in less of a technology-focused culture.  Nearly all senior managers are from JP Morgan or Mckinsey and as a result, the management focus has shifted from serving customers, employees and innovating in the marketplace to a culture of pinching pennies and cutting costs (at the expense of customers and employees).  While the company is still financially strong, this short-sightedness will hurt the company in the long term.  The entire management team is now comprised of leaders with less than a year of experience, and frankly, they do not understand the products and business culture of the company.  It is sad to see, but I will not be surprised if Visa goes through some tough times in the near future.  HR is a disaster-  There has been nothing but poorly executed and botched benefit, payroll, and HRIS changes."
3458,Visa Inc.,THE NEW WISA,2014-12-16,1.0,Senior Director,Located in Foster City - access to freeways,"It is very sad to see firsthand how quickly Visa has changed in the last 5 years more than ever. Despite the repeated chant by management that employees are being given opportunities to advance their careers and look to work in other areas, the reality is that this won’t happen as easy because first, there is a need for them to cover your old job without having to hire someone new. There is a lot of talk about diversity, however, the diversity at Visa now is tipping the scales one way - Indian. If you are not an Indian male, with lots of contract jobs in the last 5 years on your resume, under the age of 40, with a friend or relative in the company - you are out of luck in this company and soon to be given the boot. We have lots of incompetent managers that are afraid of risk and their own shadows and prefer to manage up than to do anything else for the good of their teams or to build up relationships with their employees.  Despite setting individual employee goals and objectives and having met them or exceeded them in the year, the performance evaluations are not objective but subjective, a lot of inequality and preferential treatment and they have no issues in admitting this during your annual review & compensation session. You can bust your chops month after month putting your health and balance between work and life at jeopardy just to find out at the end of the year that one project/team in the entire company stole the show and the money from everybody else at review time. Going the extra mile is inconsequential if you are not the manager’s pet or handpicked for special projects. Employees promoted to managers micromanage seasoned and experienced staff and are unwilling to take a risk and 'trust' that some of these folks have been doing the job a lot longer than them. To move within the company is a joke, there are two bottlenecks: 1) HR recruiters and 2) the TLT committee, you can’t hire anyone in IT to fill a job in a short amount of time and you can’t go anywhere either."

Visa is growing into hi-tech modern industry leader with a massive potential as the industry is one of the best to be in at this time.","Highly political, some people get treated differently based on the connections in the right places. If you are not one of them you can forget about any career progress or change even within the same department. Also, lately the company grew too fast too soon with a lack of recourses to support this structural change. In addition, you can get promoted only once a year."
3463,Visa Inc.,"Once great, but in decline",2014-12-12,2.0,Senior Staff Systems Engineer,"Visa has world wide brand recognition and offers exposure to a global economic picture that few companies enjoy.

On the benefits front, they are still relatively good including a 2-to-1 match on 401k contributions on the first 3%. Visa also still has a defined pension plan on top of the 401k which is increasingly rare.","Promotions opportunities are vaporware. You can jump through all the hoops and receive excellent ratings year over year only to be told that they are not allowed to do any promotions that year. Higher level positions often go unfilled or end up being filled by ex-employees that are hired back after they quit or took early retirement. The only internal promotions are reserved for senior managements' pets. You are more likely to be promoted for talking big and doing nothing, then busting your hump year over year.

We hear a lot about pushing for innovation, but it comes with the caveat that there is zero tolerance for failure. We also in theory have a 90/10 program that would allow employees to spend 10% of their time working on things that are not directly related to their position. It is meant to remove barriers and constraints to allow people to explore new ideas in a relatively unfettered way. The issue is that the Global Engineering group has so formalized it that innovation is handled as a project. It shows a complete lack of trust in employees because management has to make sure ever second of your 50+ hours a week is accounted for.

While benefits are still decent, they are nothing like they were 5 - 6 years ago. At the trajectory they are on, I would expect Visa's benefits to be just as lackluster as anyone other company in the next 3 to 5 years.

There is a lot of social activism in the company and nanny mentality. For example, we once had a chintzy free beverage program that allowed employees to get 3 free sodas or small bottles of water each day. A small group complained about the health and environmental impacts so they discontinued the program. Visa is also proud of being an LGBT employer of choice, but does not seem to see any value in being a top employer for working parents. That political/social bias is prevalent through out the company and comes off as subtle hostility to anyone with a more moderate or traditional bias."

My suspicions were confirmed shortly after when I saw they had changed the rating scale from 1 to 5 DOWN to 1 to 4.  It meant that it would be almost impossible for everyone to meet their target bonus because you have to get a 3 rating [that was never going to happen].  So the company makes well over $5 billion in profit and the money goes to more stock buy-backs to pump up the stock and EPS which certainly doesn't help the average employee since the previously generous RSUs given have apparently disappeared along with the bonus pool.  I think we all know where the bonuses will eventually go.  This is not the Visa I have been used to for 18 years.  Why even have a Target Bonus if it is almost impossible to reach?"

He's dictated that we only can hire from Ivy league schools, when he isn't even a graduate of an Ivy league school himself. At this point, so much of Visa's top talent has left, that Visa is positioned for a major breach. 

In all the years I've been with Visa, and through all the changes in leadership, NEVER has IT been in such a critical state. Additionally, all new hires just happen to be Indian males, which would be considered discrimination if they were all white males. Overall, the state of Visa is not only sad, but pathetic.

The company has lost sight of the value of it's people and this company is nothing without them.  The best personnel are leaving in their droves, taking huge amounts of knowledge with them.  A large number are dissatisfied and considering leaving in the new year, the most positive people are struggling to maintain any enthusiasm and motivation.  Management are oblivious to the level of impact to morale on the on-the-ground staff.  Management are not listening to the employees.  

Visa has good values, but it doesn't follow them.  Leaders say the right things, but they don't follow through.
The company has seemingly no control over it's finances, making tiny savings in some areas, but wasting vast sums of money elsewhere, leading to further reduction in morale.

Visa is slow, we don't think strategically when making technology decisions; the funding method for projects is fundamentally flawed, solutions built in silos don't take advantage of the benefits of shared facilities.  Aging, slow, overly operationally burdensome solutions and lack of focus on newer solutions offers no motivation for technology enthusiasts to remain with or join the company.  

Funding has been cut for pay increases, bonuses, personal growth, sickness benefit and pensions.

3485,Visa Inc.,Will Easily Push Any Employee Out the Door,2014-11-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"CEO's decision not to implement a planned pay schedule change (which would have resulted in employees not getting paid 3 weeks, right before the holidays), shows that he at least cares a little bit about what the employees think, but it also shows a failure to actually communicate with employees and acknowledge perspectives below those that sit in highly compensated SVP positions.  There is an interest in innovating, although it's like a dog chasing its tail--lots of excitement, but the company keeps moving in circles.","People are constantly being pushed out the door.  Morale is low.  There have been three General Counsels in less than one year, and the turnover continues.

There are those in executive leadership who don't know the names of people on their teams, even when the teams aren't that large.  The ability to manage a team effectively does not matter--what matters is serving as a ""yes"" person to those on the executive leadership team.  This is likely the reason the company has difficulty innovating--it only considers the perspectives of a small number of company leaders, many of whom have not been at the company longer than a year and a half and do not understand the complex dynamics of the industry.  

It is appalling how employees are treated on the way out.  When a new leader is hired from outside the company (and it is inevitably someone from Chase, Amex, or has some sort of ties to Chase), they always immediately restructure.  While this is common practice in most corporate restructuring, it is horrible that employees are told they are going to be fired the next day, and have a week or less to close out.  These are employees that have been with the company 10+ years."
3486,Visa Inc.,Going down hill fast,2014-11-19,1.0,Senior Project Manager,"Basic terms are not bad - salary, pension, holiday etc. Most starff are friendly, effective and willing to be committed to the company.","The new CEO has made significant changes since joining the company in pursuit of his goal - to reduce costs back to 2012 levels.
Visa did need to modernise and become more commercial in nearly every aspect of the way it operates but the restructure has been implemented in a particaularly blunt manner. As a result we have lost good staff, whilst retaining some less effective souls who are not equipped for the journey ahead. We should have offered them a other option. This has manifested itself in some areas where staff with poor interpersonal skills or leadership qualities have been promoted over more capable staff. Often this appears to have occurred due to relationships with more senior management or just the individual's ability to be a 'yes man or woman'. The result is distrust, loathing and in some cases bullying of staff by the less than inspirational leaders we now have in some teams.
Staff are being treated to pay freezes and reduced bonuses whilst senior staff see financial rewards grow. The board recognised Visa's performance this year by giving it a rating of 160%. A large portion of the excs bonus is based on this, and next year their on target bonus will grow by 30%, whilst the rest of us are marked down so our share of the success is reduced. Staff have been through a lot in 2014 and certinaly do not feel we are all in this together, which is resulting in low moral and poor engagement. In the pursuit of his objectives, which no doubt will result in a large bonus, I fear that our Napoleonic CEO is heading for his (or Visa's) Waterloo!"

The place was always a bit 'old school' but at least with potential, however following the restructure (that took half of 2014 due to complete mis management and inept organisation), the company has gone from bad to worse.

Anyone with career aspirations would do well to avoid VE, and this is why a lot of talented people leave - yet strangely they never seem to ask why - partly because HR is a shambles and they don't know whether they are coming or going, partly because I'm not sure they really care.

Always easy to say pay was terrible but in this case true - less than inflation for over performance as an example is not acceptable.

There are some real stars in VE but they are in seriously short supply; sadly the company didn't take the opportunity to get rid of the dead wood that it was crying out for, and as a result they lost most of their main star talent (from what i could see), and promoted only those who had appeared to have served 15yrs+ whose management style has been left significantly wanting.

It isn't a meritocracy at all and your end of year rating means very little - your career comes down to whether you're liked by the old boys running the show or not.

The workforce is completely demoralised, the most recent survey recorded the lowest score for employee morale I can ever remember (I've been here 7 years).  Trying to keep the team focussed and positive is very, very hard indeed, I have lost some good people and to be honest, I can't blame them.  The redundancy programme was the most badly managed I have ever seen anywhere in a 25 year career.

The re-organisation has been patchy, some functions and departments have embraced change.  Some have fallen back into old behaviours.  Some feel have ridden the storm and are as vindictive and unpleasant as they always where.  The result is complete inertia.

The club of incompetent managers is tenaciously hanging in there.  They are very adept at hiring their own (for protection) and are as entrenched as ever.  Like a weed, the re-organisation did not get to the roots.

There are far too many executives and department heads failing to take any accountability whatsoever.  They offer no vision and refuse to co-operate or collaborate (the whole point of re-organisation).  .

3528,Visa Inc.,Amazing company to work for!!,2014-09-17,5.0,Senior Technical Support Analyst,"They have a lot of growth opportunities within the company. I would also say that they raise you 5% of your salary every year depending on your role. Now, based on how you perform you can expect a higher percentage based on your contributions to the company, ex. training team members on a new trade, years with the company, they give you company stock, which by the way is at $215 a share which is nice ect. So what I'm trying to say is that's it's a company you won't find easily in South Florida.",I would say the cons are higher ups higher managers with absolutely no intelligence once so ever. But hey that's in every company right.
3529,Visa Inc.,"Bloated, inefficient, in decline",2014-09-13,1.0,Software Engineer,"Endless supply of cash and little accountability for deliverables, perfect for someone approaching retirement.

Well known brand, good for one's CV.

Reasonable benefits in comparison to other industries (albeit pretty average when it comes to financial services in their own right) if you're prepared to let your career stagnate.

Mostly stress-free 9-5 job with plenty of opportunities to decline doing  anything one doesn't feel like doing on the grounds of needing someone else's approval (and one can bet there is always going to be someone to say ""no"").","Obsolete IT infrastructure causing real problems when exchanging documents with the world outside Visa. Bureaucratic and painfully slow process for getting new or more up to date software adopted with outsourced corporate IT and their Visa counterparts often just passing the buck when things go wrong.

Recruitment and promotion decisions biased and non-transparent. In the annual employee satisfaction survey year after year the transparency of progression persistently keeps being one of 3 or 4 lowest-scoring items (incidentally, no attempt has ever been made to address this perception).

Very ""top heavy"" with some managers managing only one or two employees. 

Poor processes for leadership selection resulted with system where drinking with the right people matters more than any other skills one may have. Thanks to inadequate career progression framework some people with neither any discernible people skills nor knowledge of their particular area got promoted to managerial roles and in process ended up demotivating their teams safe in the knowledge their chums will protect them when things go wrong.

Poor decision making - many mid-ranking managers seemingly disempowered and unable to do anything without referring to the ones higher up the chain.

Despite the organisation being heavily dependent on IT, technical proficiency is treated with disdain. If an individual gets branded as ""technical"" (as in ""oh, he/she is so technical"") this in Visa parlance means their progression up the career ladder is pretty much a lost cause. ""Technical"" as pejorative term, that's a really strange attitude.

They pay lip service to Agile development and in reality end up overburdening everyone with ever-growing bureaucracy. Their default solution to any problem a project may encounter is just to throw more money and even more project managers at it, thus increasing confusion and lack of accountability until it eventually grinds to a halt.

Recent round of redundancies has been managed very ineptly. A number of talented individuals have been treated so badly in process that they decided to leave the organisation on their own even though Visa had intended to keep them. On the other hand some, due to their lack of transferable skills ultimately unemployable individuals, clung on to their existing or rebranded roles ultimately leaving the organisation depleted of critical skills just as it needs them most. 

Overall lack of direction and sense of purpose - the only thing organisation is focused on right now seems to be cutting headcount (presumably to make them a more attractive proposition for sell-off). Their only ""strategic"" direction right now comprises trying to play catchup with nimbler and more agile competitors; is anyone really going to use yet another another online wallet or another service for sending money to someone else just by knowing their e-mail address?"

Each doer seems to have about 5 managers, project managers and process auditors assigned who's arbitrary, whimsical and always extremely urgent busywork need to be completed before any productive work is allowed to take place. 
* Senior management has been hired from the outside. No understanding of the payments industry, refusal to communicate with staff. Instead staff are frequently dragged into mandatory offsides and workshops where management outlines generic plans than would fit any industry (except the payments industry)."

Good for people killing time better than being unemployed.,"Company prefer to keep a lot of people that are not able or willing to work. The work is done by a very few people but management is not consequent enough to deal with it properly. Cronyism is present any day. Promotion is for staff that have drinks with the right people, neither quality work nor reliability or efficiency in getting the job done is demanded. As for the reimbursements (e.g. health insurance) one sometimes had to wait up to half a year. Lot of sfaff satisfaction surveys but no proper analysis and therefore no improvement. Training is sometimes done by people that do not know half of what the staff already know. Supporting the ""wrong"" people leads to the best people leaving the company unhappily."

The old guard is the biggest con. They are a critical mass, have no marketability outside of Visa and are in constant self preservation mode. It's a tradition at Visa for the old guard to put new leaders under the bus. Good news is that the new CEO has been cleaning house, already booted out toxic senior executives and their cronies.

Because of Visa's dominance in the payments industry, the brand name and the power of Visa helps open doors for you at many tech companies and startups.","Company is going through a massive restructuring, some job elimination, compression of organizational layers, everyone at all levels might be at risk.  Many employees I believe are uncertain and generally uncomfortable.  You need to have a backup plan if you are going to work here.  Given this, it is difficult to choose Visa if you have a competitive good job offer from Google, Apple, PayPal, or any of the many large funded about to IPO or get bought out payment startups.  This particularly true if you are a new undergrad or graduate student without much experience.  If you don't have a job offer from the top firms mentioned above, then Visa is a great choice for you.  It is not easy to get a job offer from Visa, if you do, feel fortunate.  If you survive the restructuring, then you could have a good long career ahead of you at Visa."

The politics are perhaps the worst you will ever experience.  Exec are greedy and power hungry.  New leadership is ignorant and not trusting of the expertise of the employees that have built this company.  No one can make a decision and there is zero employee empowerment.   Nepotism is prevalent. Over complicated and outdated processes make it nearly impossible to get anything done...yet the expectation of employees to be nimble and move like a start up has everyone spinning and freaked out.   Moving up and around within organization is increasingly more difficult....people are pigeon holed into positions and unless have strong advocates at the top are stuck.

3614,Visa Inc.,My Professional Journey at Visa,2014-04-27,4.0,Senior Project Manager,"As of this review, I have worked at Visa Inc for ~7 years and my experience at the company has been very positive on the whole.  Now don't think that I have not faced my share of challenges.  I have.  But I managed to work through each of these with support provided by my management team.  For this support, I will always be grateful and the fact that this support was provided is a huge positive for the company.  But beyond this, I have been provided many opportunities for professional growth and development and I have taken advantage of each of these.  These opportunities came both in the form of the job itself, gaining mastery of mature and complex business processes, and in the form of a significant educational benefit that exceeds $5K a year.  With this educational benefit I have earned three professional certifications, two from Stanford University's Center for Professional Development and the third from the ScrumAlliance.  Through my had work and commitment, combined with the opportunities afforded to me, I have professionally progressed within the Visa Inc. and have been given the further opportunity of working in an entirely new role.  So the journey continues...","I joined Visa Inc prior to the IPO when technically it was a privately held company, Inovant.  As a result I have been through numerous layoffs, restructurings, and senior and executive management changes.  All in all significant turmoil.  The unfortunate effect of these changes is a culture of fear within the company.  For example, more than once staff with whom I have been working just disappears due to a layoff.  How did I find out?  Through a email bounce back alerting me that the staff was no longer in the company address book.   No notice, no goodbyes, just gone.  If this type of occurrence was infrequent, that would be one scenario.  Unfortunately it is frequent enough to result in the culture of fear mentioned previously.  

Oh and one other thing. You may recall my mention of 'mastery of mature and complex business processes' above.   Well these processes also have significant overhead associated with them and seem to get worse with each senior and executive management change."

Zero work/life balance. 

Relationship between most business and IT units is confrontational and adversarial. Business treats IT partners like external vendors and blames them for everything that goes wrong; IT in turn blames vendors for everything that goes wrong. First reaction to any problem is to blame someone else and escalate rather than collaborate and find solutions.

Visa is doing great financially, because every time someone uses their Visa debit/credit card, Visa gets a 0.2% ""cut.""  So, without doing anything particularly innovative, as long as Visa continues to cherish their relationships with banks, they will make money hand over fist and the egregious internal problems with poor management, low employee morale, and disgusting tolerance of managers who have absolutely no business being managers (i.e. sociopaths and control freaks) will have little to no effect on those results.

However, times are a-chaingin'.  Traditional payments between banks is changing.  Banks are changing and evolving as well, innovating where Visa cannot (again, due to its nasty internal problems that are currently ignored due to the current financial stability of the company).  Visa won't last without making DRASTIC internal cultural changes.

No one at V.me takes accountability or responsibility for results.  They allow infighting and political backstabbing to rule the day, rather than getting things done.  As a result, V.me went through several ""pivots"" (a.k.a. we screwed up yet again because we cannot get our act together in IT) and is now in danger of being on the chopping block.  More importantly, management allows absolutely no innovation, forcing everyone to abide by their narrow, completely backwards (and out-of-date) technical designs.  

Welcome to Visa's culture.

At the end of the day, if you want work/life balance and you are near retirement, Visa is exactly where you want to be.  But if you're looking for challenges and a career boost, Visa will leave you sorely disappointed."

The senior management who have been around a long time are largely cowards. They have zilch in terms of strategic thinking, and do little more than spout off buzzwords. They don't communicate, are unable to manage, and live their days in fear of being outed for being a non-contributor.

Poor treatment of employees
My advice: Go work for Visa if you like the brand name recognition, but do not have ambition to grow your career"
3718,Visa Inc.,"A Great company, reversing the decline it has been in?",2013-10-21,2.0,Senior Business Leader,Visa is well positioned in the payments space.    Visa is a great place to retire from.,"There has been no vision guiding the company for the last 7 years.    The new CEO is rightly trimming back ineffective areas.   Hopefully when this phase is complete, a new vision will allow expansion instead of retrenchment.

In the last 7 years, politics and games became more important than delivery.    Rewards are based on who you know, and how polished you are, not how capable you are.   Too much energy is spent on internal games, instead of focused on business."
3719,Visa Inc.,A mess from top to bottom,2013-10-20,2.0,,The company has its brand charm that lures people from competitors and other industries.,"The old senior management team wasn't doing much to escalate the company to another level. The new top execs are even worse - cleaning house all the way by sacking off those who dare to challenge. Current CEO is a deposed protege of Jamie Dimon and may try too hard to prove himself of leading a major company but unfortunately that ambition comes to no avail. Current president is basically a high school grad into nothing but fun sports. I came to this company with high expectation but am feeling sad to see it keeping sinking.

I see many good people with experience and capabilties leaving, and what's left is a bunch of so-sos with nowhere else to go."
3720,Visa Inc.,Not a Pleasant Work Place,2013-10-20,2.0,SBL,"Benefits, still has pension and 401K match is generous","The worst 3 years of my career.  Left a months ago because the job market finally picked up.  Micro managers everywhere, from HR to CFO to low level managers.  Everyone is just concerned about CYA.  IT is is worst offender of them all, can't make a move without IT approval.  You work with such incompetent IT PMO staff that nothing gets done but everything must go through them.  No opportunities unless you know the right people on the personal level.  Very political, very backstabbing.  Avoid Finance Dept."
3721,Visa Inc.,Visa needs to relocated to the East Coast,2013-10-19,2.0,Senior Business Analyst,"401K, Pension, short commute (for me), covered parking, Costco is next door.","Too much red tape.  Sr. Management has little respect for employees.  Very tight with any perks (I had to bring my own tissue paper to work!).  No ESPP program.  Promotions are only available if someone leaves (not based on skills or accomplishments).  WFH is highly discouraged.  Day after Thanksgiving, Xmas Eve and NY Eve are all work days."
3722,Visa Inc.,Going downhill fast,2013-10-18,2.0,,This is THE place to learn about the guts of the payments industry.  The Visa brand is the most recognized in the world and is the backbone of how electronic payments are made.,"I would echo the sentiments shared by others on this site. Employee morale is at an all time LOW.  New management does not seem to have a good understanding of the business, is distracted by an obsessive need to battle the old guard on all fronts, and is hyper-focused on change for the sake of change and cutting costs by slashing all employee perks and benefits. Diversity is non-existent...when asked about what was being done to address this, senior management responded by saying that Visa is not the worst he has seen because there are a whopping TWO women in leadership roles.  Everyone that isn't locked in with stock options is jumping ship post bonus season."
3723,Visa Inc.,A great environment that nurtures and champions it's staff,2013-10-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,They put a lot of effort into their management to ensure that people are presented with opportunities and rewards for effort. Very dynamic and fast paced world.,"Too many chefs sometimes, it's a slow moving machine, responsible to the Members at the expense of innovation or moving forward."
3724,Visa Inc.,Circling the drain,2013-10-17,2.0,Senior Business Leader,"The best reasons to work at Visa have all evaporated.  Once a fine company and good to its people, Visa apparently now exists only to apply $2 billion per quarter to buying back its stock grants to Executives.  Benefits are being cut left and right, and its only getting worse.","The most recent employee survey indicated an overwhelming majority of employees believe that you will get fired for speaking the truth.  Indeed, we've seen this again and again.  Very sad.  Senior management has given up on ""managing the business"" in favor or ""managing my career"".  GIS in particular has become very politically charged.  Whole teams of fine experienced people are getting sacked as leadership jockeys for political power."
3725,Visa Inc.,Short-sighted management,2013-10-16,2.0,,Meritocracy and work life balance.,"Multiple re-organisations and shifting priorities - in fact 3 major re-orgs within last 3 years. Management leaped into a re-org without being clear about how it will make things better and very often a long-term plan was absent. When a re-org does not product immediate positive impact, management was quick to react with yet another round of re-org, which then set off a vicious cycle."
3726,Visa Inc.,"A mixed bag - great at some things, disappointing in others",2013-10-14,4.0,Senior Manager,"The company genuinely cares about its employees, its benefits and development opportunities are top class. It has won awards for the way it manages and develops its people. In addition it has a great brand, so it looks good on the CV","Too many long serving employees at senior levels, blocking the way for more talented and capable people below them. A lack of consequences for poor/political behaviour. Executive Management team highly political"

Membership model allows for a lazy way of funding
The people on the ground do believe in the organisation and wish to do right for it","A lot of complaints here about the EVP's.   Whilst the accountability is ultimately with them, a lot of their ambition is clouded by the ring of SVP's.  Decisions from the top get translated in the next tier of management, which allows for business as usual.  

There is a huge infight between the Technology & Processing Services and the rest of the organisation.  This creates extensive politics at all levels.  

There is no sense of value from products and services.  P&L accounting exists only on paper and investment business cases do not stack up.

Oh and a new career framework has just launched on 1 October.  Not as a result of the new chief exec, but as a parting gift from the previous one.  A lot of the previous VP & SVP levels are irate, owing to an opaque levelling process from HR."
3729,Visa Inc.,Were talent goes to die,2013-10-11,2.0,Senior Staff Engineer,"Name recognition - Very few people haven't heard of Visa.

Good exposure to high volume transaction processing

Benefits - While Visa has slowly been whittling their benefits down, they are still better than 95% of companies out there.","No promotion opportunities - Visa hires people with a ton of skills and then does nothing to develop them. It is so silo-ed that most people lose skills rather than gain them. Promotions are generally through cronyism not talent or ability. Expect that you will never move more than one job level since all internal moves are lateral.

Lack of leadership - Visa doesn't have leaders, they have salesmen rather than managers (sometimes literally). There are too many that just say yes and then drive their staff to just figure it out.

Too many witch hunts - Focus is too often on who did it rather than how to fix the problem. Managers rarely step up and take responsibility for failures of their team."
3730,Visa Inc.,Great company!,2013-10-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great people to work with and good pay and benefits. Opportunities to work in different locations.,Some managers do have bad people skills and cannot manage or lead people. People are not being promoted on the basis of what they know but who they know.

- promotion lacks transparency, many roles doomed for falure

3733,Visa Inc.,PMO,2013-10-05,1.0,PMO,"Good on CV

3736,Visa Inc.,"Fantastic business model, conflicting management team",2013-10-02,2.0,Senior Business Leader,"Very dedicated and talented staff. Some people have worked here for over two decades and believe in the core of the business. 

The business model and opportunities for the company are great with many years of growth ahead of it as consumers secularly move from cash to electronic payments. The work is challenging with good opportunities for career growth","Visa has had an unfortunate history of executive management that viewed the company as a bank rather than an innovative payments company, and the current team is no different. An over abundant focus on near term cost reductions consumer the majority of time, rather than a prioritization of investments to the vast opportunities to select from. 

Additionally, many in the upper exec circle have a competitive vs. collaborative attitude that permeate to the lower levels and creates unhealthy conflict."
3737,Visa Inc.,Poorly Paid Slavery,2013-10-02,1.0,NACCS Customer Service Agent,"Great people, nice gym if you're not contracted, free pizza on holidays. Benefits such as dental, 401K and tuition reimbursement if you're not contracted are available to you.","You work all holidays and can include Thanksgiving, Christmas, & New Years. You every move is monitored and timed. You cannot go to the bathroom and grab a glass of water if it exceeds 5 minutes of ""personal aux"" time. You only have a half hour of lunch. Calls are back to back almost every day and the production team abuses agents that are skilled. Contractors have no job stability and the turnover rate at visa is high. Your employment has the life cycle of a fruitfly unless your manager really likes you. There's also a system known as ""occurrences"" it's Visa's version of demerits. If you're even 1 minute late you get one of these despite the circumstances. You also get one of these if you are ill even if you have medical documentation. A few of these jeopardize your chances of staying on as an employee and worse as a contractor. A grace period of 5 minutes is allotted for an application that can take 15 minutes to open. This also results in an occurrence. This job is modern slavery."

The financial strength of the company can be seen in their earnings and strong balance sheet.  An incredibly talented work force.,"Not necessarily a con - just more of a buyer beware - Visa has a new CEO who has an incredibly strong background as a CFO.  His first actions have been heavily focused on cost cutting, cutting or curbing innovation investments and cleaning house.  If you were one who believed Visa needed a cultural change, than Charlie (the new CEO) may be the right leader to work for going forward."

3742,Visa Inc.,Challenging but not motivated,2013-09-18,3.0,Business Leader,Visa plays an interesting role in the payment industry.  Globally!  Visa offers technology services that are unique and worldwide and employs people from around the world.,Visa has layers of management that rewards talkers and presenters and not necessarily doers.  Sometimes senior management is clueless as to what is really going on below the surface and thus throws money away on half baked ideas and projects.
3743,Visa Inc.,Unique Business,2013-09-18,4.0,Senior Business Leader,"Since going public, V feels more like many large public companies in terms of P and L and focusing on shareholder value.","V's corporate culture stems from its days as an payments association.

I couldn't eat downstairs anymore because it was disgusting (and extremely overpriced)! There were gnats in my food on two occasions and they told me they knew of the problem but Visa doesn't do anything. It's really hard to get work done there, cross-functional teams either don't exist or don't work well with each other. Not a collaborative environment at all. Moral is very low. Visa is very cheap, there are no perks there. As mentioned earlier, cafeteria food is gross and overpriced and we are given a beverage card to use in a vending machine to obtain soda. And the only options are Coke, Diet Coke, and black tea. There are no company picnics, events, parties, team builds (except for leadership teams). The culture is horrendous there.

Its kind of backwards. Most companies i have worked - employees are first asked to write their reviews and accomplishments based on which managers decide how to rate the employees. Visa has it backward in that - managers and executives - rate, calibrate and finalize ratings and hikes - even before the performance system is opened for employees. How wierd?

Headquarters staff is bloated, while the business units fight for funding.  

Visa treats the debit business and all new acquisitions as subsidiaries, and rarely shares information.  This further weakens the culture.

Great employee benefits (big bonus, non-contrib pension, gym allowance, bicycle loan, health and dental, home broadband, travel insurance etc.)  They talk a great talk about valuing employees and that might be true outside of the technical jobs.","TPS division (IT dept.) is two thirds of the company and most of it is project managers or consultants.  the remaining are SVPs or VPs to ""manage"" the dept. and 5% are engineers who do the work.

Projects are bogged down by layer upon layer of bureaucracy, meetings and red tape to prevent any decision being made.  More management layers are added every time a SVP reads about some new ""transformation"" trend in his in-flight magazine.  The only thing they're actually good at is covering their backsides, so nobody can ever get blamed for anything.

Thanks to unlimited free money, no project can go over budget and nobody values any money saving ideas.  Vendors will bail out any bad technology decisions by simply over-speccing any hardware or software solution.

Hopefully Visa Inc. (US) will buy VE and get shot of the rotten culture and dead wood management.  Right now this is a zero-innovation company going nowhere, at great expense to the members."

- It is hard to think of another company that is more DYSFUNCTIONAL, POLITICAL and MEDIOCRE than Visa. Bring your career here and you will REGRET it, and that is almost guaranteed. Don't believe me? TAKE A LOOK AT OTHER REVIEWS here, they all pretty much have the same grievances...

- Middle management almost takes pride in how POLITICAL the company is. They sit in meetings all day but the heavy lifting is hardly ever done. Ask for any kind of documentation or background information for your projects and they will proudly tell you everything lives in people's heads. Good luck getting it out!

- WEAK LEADERSHIP all the way up to the top with a C-suite that is ANTIQUATED and out of touch and global heads that are completely removed from the realities of what goes on at the ground level. Not surprising from a company that has the HQ in SF (for top management only) while the actual farm is 30 miles south.

- Over-filled with DINOSAURS that have been with the company for 10-20 years, have advanced to roles they are neither qualified for nor have the discipline, intelligence or skill to execute or manage others in their groups. FAVORITISM to the max, hardly a mertiocracy. People seem to grow based on how well they play the POLITICAL GAME rather than true hard work.

- UNPROFESSIONAL middle management that would make a hooker blush with the amount of profanity, lack of diplomacy and tact that can be observed in daily meetings and around the cubes.

- SINK OR SWIM environment - you will get no onboarding, no help and no development for your job. Pray that it fits exactly with what you bring to the table or you're screwed!

- A company that woke up one day and decided they are becoming a nimble tech startup. Wrong! They are stuck in the days of an overly STUFFY CULTURE with arcane, BUREAUCRATIC procedures, SLOW moving and a general LACK OF EMPOWERMENT for decision making, etc. A $1 mm investment should not require the CFOs signoff for a company that makes billions every year!

- Generally a very DEPRESSING, dark and sad place to work. It is obvious that many PEOPLE HATE THEIR JOBS (some are even vocal about it) and only stay for either lack of options or because of the pay. The elevated frustration creates an environment where people are RUDE, unhelpful, and backstabbing.

- To make things worse, the Washington of the corporate world has acquired 2 other businesses that is trying to integrate with little true strategy or success. The only success so far: more politics!

- The payment processing industry is extremely mundane, DULL and needlessly complex. Those that know it will always throw their weight around by overcomplicating the technical aspect in order to maintain control while those that don't act like they do making things even more confusing. 

- For a company that moves as SLOW as Visa, and where so little true progress is made, WORK-LIFE BALANCE IS TERRIBLE! This is a direct result of lack of prioritization from the top down, the politics and bureaucracy. Absolutely NO TASK here is done in an EFFICIENT, straight-forward way.

- Although the Visa network is mainly in autopilot mode everyone is constantly agitated and stressed out trying to justify their existence and paycheck. Everything to the smallest, most ridiculous task is a priority and gets excessive attention until the next thing comes up. The biggest joke on campus is ""if everyone at Visa took the month off, nothing would change"". There is much truth to that joke..."
