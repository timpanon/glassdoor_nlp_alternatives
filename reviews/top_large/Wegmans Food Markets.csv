41,Wegmans Food Markets,Terrible. From Corporate to In-Store.,2022-03-29,1.0,Retail Sales Associate,"Weekly pay
Co-workers were a pleasure to work with.
 Team Leaders were dependable and supportive","Cashiering was terrible. They treat you like a decent human being for the first three weeks you start out. Then, you're ignored and left at the (lack of) mercy of rude customers and even ruder third party employees (Instacart). Five star pandering to the screaming customer who felt like the cashier wasn't bagging their 200-500 item haul fast enough. Upper management was too lazy to enforce the limit of how many people can enter the store during peak COVID months. No support unless you were favored. I was left to rot on the register for hours with no break and mostly had lunch late. 

Team leaders had the responsibilities of managers; sadly they were not paid enough for it. Upper management continued to excel at doing absolutely nothing when it came to addressing employee concerns (hiring more people, high stress environment). With the high amounts of traffic from Instacarters placing their shopping carts everywhere and customer lines blocking the doors weekends have become a nightmare to walk into. Every week or two the freezers would break or stop working and it would take twice as long to get them fixed. Daily pallet loads are too much for two-three people to handle consistently. Upper management would 'grace us with their presence' when the help isn't needed; so their concern is performative at best. Unnecessary criticism is infuriating. Its not helpful to hear that we spent too much time on the pallets in the day when at max 3 people is there to handle 4-5 pallet loads. Too much showboating from upper management and not enough actual work. 

Corporate visits are an extreme hinderance and serve absolutely no point. Every time corporate visits and etc visit daily production is at a standstill. It becomes more about maintaining the aesthetic of a well run store when it was in fact far from the truth. Then there was having to stand in line, waiting for them to pass so we can greet them as if it was parade watching at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. As if day stocking didn't exist. And the managers are even more annoying to deal with because they want it to go so smoothly. This was frequent too. 

The company's rushed efforts of overambition just to have a store in NYC took a toll on the employees."

131,Wegmans Food Markets,"Lots of Bias, Zero, Zero, Zero employee discount!",2022-03-05,2.0,Cashier,"good co-workers, meeting new people, making connections with customers who actually return and only come to your line; decent wage for part-time, free water, yippee!!! Some good managers, shift leads, care about the customer experience (pro/con)","No raises for part-time workers; no incentives during COVID; no discount on our own groceries like Giant, Whole Food, Trader Joes, Safeway, etc; as much as they say it's a family, it's more like Putin, they are the authoritarian, receive all the money and the employees receive scraps; again no raises for part-time staff apparently; most frustrating as a cashier - Wegman's has it's own products, as a grocery chain you would think they would create packaging that would be not just beneficial for the consumer but for their employees. Barcodes blocked by seams, plastic chicken containers that could cut your finger, and do mess up a long of bags, come on, you can do better! Finally, bias - as a cashier working the front of the store, there are a multitude of different jobs you can do during your shift, cashiering, self-check, cart-to-curve; restock items left by customers. Every shift I work, those areas are provided to favorites. I'm a great worker, have asked time and time again to try new areas, but it always goes to the younger people, the same people. I signed up to work as a cashier in the front of the house, that includes all the other areas I mentioned, where is my opportunity. I have asked several times, even a store manager said they would make it happen, never happened. Now I'm thinking about leaving in May as it does get monotonous doing the same job every shift for 9 months."

173,Wegmans Food Markets,Decent stepping stone,2022-02-21,3.0,Facilities Technician,The pay is decent for the work that you do and there are opportunities for advancement. Your happiness at work all depends on your manager honestly. Sometimes I am asked to do ridiculously stupid things and then sometimes I get great opportunities to learn valuable technical skills but you need to be self-motivated and seek out opportunities if you want to learn. If management likes you then you have good opportunities to climb the ladder but it all takes time. If management does not like you then they will give you a lot of false promises and never fulfill their end of the deal.,I have a manager who asked me to do a lot of other peoples jobs. It gets very frustrating when you are trying to focus on what you need to do. In my personal experience the only way to learn technical aspects of the role are to work with contractors instead of in-house. The pay is all right for what you do but should be more. You have to work weekends and have and open availability. The company used to be a lot better to work for as they closely followed their core values but nowadays it seems more so about making as much money as possible without consideration for the employees. Everybody is getting worn very thin and management does not make many accommodations but that may also be because we are shortstaffed.

Part timers did not get any real holiday or Sunday pay, where full timers would make time and a half, part timers would get an extra dollar/hour which never felt worth it in comparison. The downside is the full timers had no control over their schedules, and would find themselves in rough Close/Opens or being moved to old departments that they had tried to leave if manning needed.

Steady income
Scholarship for people in college is really nice","After a while if you’re a overachiever they take advantage of you, questioning why you’re taking time off, I would get texts from my manager almost every week literally *begging* me to come in on my one day off, when I told her multiple times I had drs appointments on that day, but she didn’t care and continued to do it right up until I decided to part with the company. made me feel super guilty and uncomfortable in the workplace 

Managers are just thrown around in positions sometimes that they should not be in and makes the department hectic due to lack of leadership 

In the situation mentioned above often times a long term PT or FT employee of that department will have to almost take over the role of manager without the pay, and yes this happened with PT people too 

Very fake and toxic positivity, everyone was just so fake nice it was sickening sometimes.

Would force you to follow corporate policy but then if there was a huge issue with a customer management would just side with the customer making us look bad, because we have to follow the rules but they don’t ?? Not very empowering to me."

611,Wegmans Food Markets,Lack of transparency on pay,2021-09-14,1.0,Manager,Quick to get a response to my application,"Disrespectful hiring process. They expect you to interview multiple times, but refuse to give you even a range of pay. They repeat that you will find out pay if you get an offer.

I'm sorry, but this is very disrespectful. Knowing what a job is going to pay before being asked to jump through hoops and prove my worth is the bare minimum. Am I trying to prove that I'm worth minimum wage, $25/hr, $30/hr? I should know, and you should be able to tell your candidates during an interview what you are going to pay them.

The only reason to not clearly advertise your pay is because you are paying inequitably, and people are all getting different rates of pay for the same job. On that note. you have 4 different management positions listed for your new store. I asked the interviewer what the difference is, and she told me they are all the exact same thing. So is this just another way for you to pay people different rates for the same job, different titles? Also, what is up with not paying managers a salary? Who works in management for an hourly wage? And you're hiring 40 managers for one store? Because none of them are receiving full-time benefits.After this experience, I will no longer do my shopping at Wegmans; I don't care how pretty your rack of lamb are. I feel so disrespected by this hiring process that I could never give this company my business again.

All around dishonest hiring practices. I am upset that I wasted my time applying for a company that does not value people and lacks transparency. Just a tip to anyone working for them: ask your coworkers what they make! I think you are all going to find that you are being paid very different rates from one another. Organize, unionize!"

No communication, no inclusion. They have suddenly cut staff to increase profits but no one has told us why, or what the plan is. The cuts are drastic and our jobs are impossible to do well. Inevitably, the quality has gone down, a lot of product is missing because we can’t get it out to customers, employee injuries are way up, and employee satisfaction and retention are at a crisis point. Customer complaints are way up. Our Dept Managers are great but store leadership is disengaged. This breaks our hearts because we loved this store. We’re working ourselves to death but can’t possibly get our jobs done. Leadership throws out the occasional ( phony) ‘thank you for all you’re hard work’ then tells our managers to make us work harder. The strategy isn’t working. Customers aren’t happy, employees aren’t happy. I can’t recommend anyone apply to this store until something changes."

You don't need to be at the office everyday (hello pandemic and work from home opportunities at corporate level) to be a asset to the company. The way they handled COVID overall was poor and showed the cracks in management. They are so stuck on ""lifers"" of Wegmans and give no creditability to people who have experience outside of it. Any position that is posted at a certain level of corporate (and I'm sure store level) already have a person in mind so by allowing other people to interview and then crushing them is sad."

Cooking for employee events that put a smile of relief on the fellow employees. Listening and hearing other employees issues about the company and hopefully trying to deliver the feedback to hierarchy.","Where do I start? Restaurant foods area is highly unstable and toxic for the day to day employee that is trying to accomplish their job. Things I've noticed: the executive chef doesn't seem to hold himself nor his kitchen to a high standard. When an issue is brought to him, he chooses to point fingers with his team of immature sous chefs. Their have been so many issues with either undercooked food or not being able to produce on time that the responsibilities and retaliation fall down on the employees working there. This is just from an observation that I've witnessed. When it comes to any forms of harassment in the workplace the executive chef and his sous chefs who are considered managers brush it off as if it never happened and go about their business whatever that may be. I've witnessed so much within this company ranging from information in HR complaints that are suppose to be confidential somehow no longer confidential. To employees being verbally or sexually harassed with minor consequences. Another thing I notice is whenever the executive chef is off, the sous chefs find it as a day off for them to not do any work at all and avoid employee concerns at all cost."

Incredible place to learn new skills that will help you throughout your professional career

Great benefits and great pay",There are really are not that many downsides of working at Wegmans. I don't really think I could have asked for a better job.
740,Wegmans Food Markets,Review,2021-07-26,4.0,Produce Manager,ReviewYou never get laid off if you move down south you can move up ahead medical benefits aren’t bad dental sucks,With Wegmans at retail you always have to work weekends and holidaysSplit days off You don’t get much time off during summer
741,Wegmans Food Markets,Be Careful,2021-07-26,3.0,Food Service Worker,"Wegmans will hire you initially part-time so they can determine whether you are worthy to move up to full-time (if that is what you want). I seemed to have caused disarray among management when I asked (during the interview) to work no more than X hours per week despite having a wide-open available schedule. Once hired, I was scheduled 30-35 hours/wk (much more than I wanted), working 6-7 days in a row (54 hours in a 7 day time period over two pay periods). I did not complain. My schedule was better when I was a full-time employee elsewhere. Scheduling someone ~35 hours/wk gives Wegmans the benefit of having an almost full-time employee without having to provide full-time benefits. Disgruntled, several weeks later, I found another part-time job elsewhere, was ready to leave, but they insisted I stay and agreed to an even more limited part-time work schedule than originally requested. So, if you prove your value to them, they will be accommodating to your needs, but they seemed to have ignored by initial request for limited hours. Besides this experience, I have no other complaints about management; they are approachable and will help you out with any questions you might have. The department and perishable (boss of the department) managers will provide you guidance and input. Diverse, friendly and helpful co-workers are everywhere. Ample opportunities to cross-train in other areas and they advertise promotion opportunities in-house before they seek candidates externally.","Flexible scheduling is promoted as a great benefit, but I am not sure why. You are required to give two weeks notice if you want time off (like all jobs?) and must verbally talk to your boss (no emails or phone messages) if you can't make it in to work for a particular day due to illness, emergencies, etc. I guess they are saying that if you need the time off and you follow these rules, your request should be accepted because there are so many other employees in your department who can cover for you. I don't get it. $14.50 per hour could be higher for my job; I see now that Costcos and Whole Foods pays more ($15-16/hr). In retrospective, I believe I could have counter-offered for a higher hourly salary."

787,Wegmans Food Markets,Avoid at all costs,2021-07-09,1.0,Warehouse Selector,Absolutely no pros to this job environment other than full time employment and decent benefits.,"Where to begin....

1. Say goodbye to everyone and everything. You start off catered to, no overtime, all your days off, and staying in your department. However once your 3 months are over expect 10-12h days and 6 days a week. Management doesn't care you've busted your butt for 6 straight days for 1 day off they demand AND expect 100% every day while they'll sit on their butts and pretend to know what we do. 

2. Oh it's a super light day for your particular department? Not for you. They'll send every senior man home and still expect work to be done on time. And if that's not enough you'll be sent out and forced at a different department making that light day, and all possible plans, nonexistent

3. You want to do something on your day off? Good luck, not only can you not request your days off, but you're expected to work OT on them. You get 1 day off so better hope no doctor appointments, dental, relative need anything until then 

4. You have a union but they're a joke. They'll stand next to you when you're being scolded by your department manager and not say anything to help you. But if you go over their heads to report a senior man expect to be yelled at. 

5. They can't even pay you high enough starting pay to be worth it. $16.50?? McDonald's employees make $15 at way less stress. Sure OT ""boosts"" your pay but 60h/w isn't worth it.



Just stay away at all costs."

My manager didn't want to be there anymore, but they wouldn't let her leave. So she threw her team leaders under the bus constantly. There was so much undermining, scapegoating, and gaslighting from the start that it seriously impacted my mental health and personal life, which was nearly non-existent by the end of my time there. It became impossible to manage my own developing depression, my boyfriend's coincidentally failing health and disability, and the stresses of working in such a toxic environment. I would go to work, work late because nothing went right, try to make a quick dinner or just skip meals, check in with my boyfriend who needed much more support than I was giving, and then hopefully get 5-6 hours of sleep at best. Rinse and repeat. Frequently came in on days off or did work from home. Ultimately moved on to a 9-5 with a $15k raise, so it's hard to complain too much because that upgrade is partially thanks to skills I learned at Wegmans."

954,Wegmans Food Markets,They Don't Always Give You Their Best,2021-05-14,2.0,Produce Team Leader,"Free coffee, about once a month they do an employee appreciation lunch, more than competitive pay (time and a half on Sundays for full-time employees), emphasis on quality products, fair scheduling practices if you are a regular team member, will hold your job for you if you have a medical excuse which keeps you out for months at a time.","You don't want to be promoted above team member. Management/supervisory positions are required to have 24/7 availability. Scheduling practices are haphazard (many times, I was scheduled to work until 10PM at night and then required to come in at 5AM the next morning). CONSTANT and UNNECESSARY pressure from the area managers. Constantly understaffed. But most of all, the company only cares about their status as ""one of the best places to work at"", and will do ANYTHING to keep that title - so the HR department has created an atmosphere of complete forgiveness for what would normally be a reason to fire someone. Come in 15 minutes late every day? No problem. Call out once or twice a week? Sure! Work at a snail's pace just to get through the day? That's OK too. As a result, the supervisory and managerial staff end up putting in ridiculous hours (like 60 hours a week), and then get berated by store management for putting in so many hours! The HR department doesn't seem to do anything for anyone, and walk around the store all day with coffee in their hands telling everyone to have a great day. Also, their warehouse is ridiculously incompetent - pallets packed poorly so that they fall apart in the delivery truck, or worse yet, fall down on employees. Constant damage to stock due to poor handling by the warehouse workers. Sometimes pallets from a delivery are missing or, worse yet, loaded on the wrong truck and delivered to the wrong store. Another con is their ordering system, called CAO (Computer Assisted Ordering). It doesn't take into account any individual store sales, or holidays that don't fall on the same day every year (such as Thanksgiving - one of the busiest times of the year). Yet the CAO liaison for Wegmans is constantly coming down on department managers for doing too many order edits! Even though it's a family-owned company, they're getting too big for their britches, and more and more, the corporate elite is out of touch with what's actually happening in the stores."

My location had a serious good-ol'-boys problem.
Employee incompetence was rarely addressed.
Customers consist of many bougie karen-types.
Part time employees have little in the way of advancement options and semi-annual ""raises"" barely accounted for inflation.

Also, and I'm only adding this because I'm asked to rate this company on ""diversity and inclusion"" in the next section of this review, my location almost never hired black applicants to customer facing roles (unless they fit a specific 'inoffensive' profile). It was blatantly obvious that they were willing to hamper the advancement of certain employees to ensure that the yokels of Harford county MD wouldn't have to interact with anyone with more than a few molecules of melanin. I didn't realize this until I started doing inventory work in the back of the store and realized just how immense the racial disparity was."

Ever since Covid began the company has made decision after decision that have made our jobs extremely stressful. Very few people are happy to work here anymore. Short staffed departments are being cut even further by replacing full time with part time employees creating an endless cycle of interviewing, hiring, and training because once they realize how much work there is to do for such little pay they’re out the door. Despite low staffing departments are expected to do even more than we were doing pre-Covid when we had less workload and more staff. Upper store management doesn’t care about employees personal lives and expects them to put their job above everything else in their life. Upper store management allows many employees to get away with doing little to no work throughout the day while beating down hard workers and expecting them to take on more and more responsibility. They’re combining and downsizing departments and forcing employees into positions they have no interest in. Morale is incredibly low and will continue to drop the longer this goes on."

In the past I have given my availability and they severely cut my hours leaving me to have to ask managers myself for more hours weekly...Most employees are severely underpaid. Employees who started 10 years ago with the company are only making a couple dollars more per hour than cashiers who just recently started with the company.

They want you to be flexible and cross-train through different departments to give you more opportunities and hours, but you never truly reap the benefits and definitely do not get compensated for your flexibility and willingness to learn more in attempt to move up. 

Throughout 2020 they constantly told us not to post online about the company regarding controversies that happened in the city store locations with BLM protestors and cops. They would also never give us clear answers about what really went down. They knew that we knew that one location had protestors arrested for being in one of the store plazas and they did their best to just not acknowledge it. 

I have heard from many people that this company used to be way more family friendly before Robert Wegman passed. Now, all they care about is money and expanding the company to different states across the country. It's sad."

- They let customers enter store without a face mask and say nothing to them. Wegmans has been reported to the food, health and safety administration many times by customers. 
- Sometimes store gets so busy that managers forget its time for your break/lunch or even when you need to go home

If you're full time they expect you to be available every day of the week, and they guilt trip you into not asking for any regular days off. They dont make any effort to put your 2 days off next to eachother, even if you work overnight.

The customers treat you like garbage and managers blatantly disregard safety policies.

Theres a rotating door of managers. I would be told by one ""we're going to get you a coordinator position!"" Only for that manager to get transfered and I would have to prove myself to *another* one right away.

Dont expect to move up unless you're very physically attactive, know someone in corporate, or are somehow marginalized (disabled, minority, lgbtq). Merrit is basically worthless.

I left this job for a real career and have been promoted every year and a half ever since, on merrit alone. I had bosses at wegmans who cried because they couldnt access their email, and others who slept through their opening shift so I had to stay late into the morning to run the front end for them.

They once fired a woman I worked with for requesting time off to go to school, which is something they normally allow. She was a star employee - far better at what we did than me or anyone else in our department. They had the nerve to tell her she could reapply in 6 months if she finished out her schedule. She had 2 kids, so she had to choke back the tears and do her best to serve customers. My department had to threaten a walk out to get her her job back. She's with a better company now.

They dont care about you. They will work you to death. This company single habdedly made me lose faith in humanity. Run far far away."

2.The pay is okay some places pay more but you get two (small) raises per year and they pay every week.
3.Its fairly easy to get small amounts (one or two days) of time off as long as you let them know a week or two ahead of time.
4.Switching departments is easy if you don't have medical disabilities or need medical accommodations.(See cons for more info.)
5.They try to make accommodations for physical disabilities. (See cons for any other disabilities and minor/nonvisible physical disabilities)
6.Management generally takes the employee's side when angry customers try to cause a scene. (Provided that it was the customer that escalated the event and you don't have a track record of causing problems)
7. Their Coronavirus/Covid19 response prioritized the health and safety of employees and they began implementing safety measures as early as the first week of March.","1.The customers are often very self entitled and it is very taxing trying to serve them especially if there is any actual issue.
2.If you have medical disabilities that they don't already have a policy for they will make it difficult for you to get long term accommodations and will actively punish you if the accommodations are inconvenient for the company.
3. If you need to get accommodations for a disability they will not let you change departments if you will also need accommodations in that department. (This effectively makes it so you cannot advance in the company with the exception of a handful of jobs that you are less likely to get because you cannot train in multiple departments.)
4. They say that they offer health insurance for part-time employees but in truth you can only qualify if you work a certain amount of hours per week and rarely do they actually give anyone enough hours to qualify. It's not even that great insurance either."

I had the opportunity to travel as support help to assist new teams and meet new people. Wegmans invests in our learnings by providing classes and leadership development days that teach transferable skills that can be used in all areas of life. We are able to connect with others daily and make a positive impact in the lives of our employees and customers.

This has made it difficult at times, but overall I have been able to adapt to what is needed and know that if there is a time that I must have off, the management team always works to make it possible. In every job there are pros and cons. I value happiness and being part of a team that provides for our community, neighbors, friends and family.

1895,Wegmans Food Markets,Wegmans is Great if You Don't Like Healthcare or Making Rent,2020-02-29,3.0,Cook III,"Working in the Wegmans kitchen is a great way to see if you'd be interested in a more ""restaurant-like"" environment.  It's not quite as fast-paced, but I'd say it's a great start for someone unsure of whether or not they could handle/would enjoy working line.","Despite the agenda they try to push, moving up in the company is incredibly difficult.   I was there for 3 years and applied for multiple promotions only to get told that I didn't qualify because I would've had to work a different (additional) position prior.  The storefront I worked at, located in Virginia,  also didn't pay me a living wage or give me enough part-time hours to qualify for benefits.  After talking to other previous and current employees, this doesn't look like a unique experience.   Because their model for promotions requires managers to move up before allowing lower-level and part-time staff to vie for full-time positions.  We had one woman who was part of our server staff who had to wait five years before she was considered for a full-time job, and during that time she had no access to healthcare nor did her family.  Ultimately, Wegmans doesn't have a business model that works for lower-level employees.  I can only recommend working for them if you either a) plan on making a life long career of it (I would've had to work for the company for six years in order to afford a one-bedroom apartment in this area) or b) are in school, living with your parents rent-free, and just trying to gain some experience in the service industry."

Guaranteed yearly raises not based on performance. 

Good benefits, schedule and time off.

Ability to speak with management.","No performance based raises results in lack of performance and pride in work. Strong performing employees get used and worn out. The reward for being a hard working employee is more work, while those who do the minimum get the same benefits and pay. Often these people are also promoted first because they spend their time talking with upper management and playing politics rather than working."

1901,Wegmans Food Markets,Not Good for Professional Growth,2020-02-23,2.0,Front End Coordinator,"-I've found that the majority of coworkers are extremely friendly, and I have personally made some lasting friendships with the people who work there.
-Somewhat flexible scheduling","-I was hired at almost the Federal minimum wage (7.50/hour) and since then they're rate at hire has been increased. However, after six years I was making almost the same as new hires in a lower position (even with the 25 cent raise every six months) because the pay of long-time employees was not adjusted. When other employees brought these concerns to the attention of HR and the area managers, the complaints were largely ignored. Not a good company to work for if you want a good and fair pay. 
-The company is expanding the services offered to increase convenience for customers such as Instacart and Wegmans2Go with curbside delivery and in-store grocery pick-up. However, these increased responsibilities were passed on to the Front End Coordinating team I was a part of without adjustments to the schedule or the addition of employees. We were now expected to do our previous duties in addition to these services in other areas of the store. This lack of forethought by the store and company to hire more people or adjust the expectations of my position because of the added work made for a very stressful work environment and added daily confusion and communication issues.
-The problem with this company that has effected me the most personally is their policy on references and recommendations. The company has a policy that NO recommendations or references are ever allowed, and HR can only verify the dates of employment. As a graduating college student who has been employed at Wegmans since the age of 15 with no prior work experience, this was extremely detrimental to my pursuit for a career in my field of study. When attempting to get an internship with the Federal Government, it was REQUIRED that an Employment Reference form was filled out, which included questions about my personal work ethic. Wegmans refused to answer these questions even when contacted by an investigator working for the Federal government. As someone who has worked at this company for over six years now and has never had any problems with management, this really showed how the company values you as a person. This company really does not care for employees personal and professional development. Definitely DO NOT recommend this company for anyone in high school or college looking to improve their professional experience and increase their network.
-Inconsistent scheduling for both part-time and full-time employees outside of the store managers. 
-I worked at the Customer Service desk for two years and although this is not the fault of the company itself, the way customers treat you so negatively everyday really effects your work and personal life. I would not recommend this position for anyone looking to be happy at work.
-I've witnessed the way management regards the Cashiers and Helping Hands (parking lot attendants) as if they have the ""easy job"" when these are the two most thankless and frustrating positions in the store. 
-Weekend are difficult to actually have off because Wegmans strives to never have more employees then they think they need: even though management will never be there most weekends of the month. 
-If you dislike hypocritical leadership and being seen only as an employee and not a person, this is not the company for you."

1906,Wegmans Food Markets,Old school culture,2020-02-18,2.0,Process Engineer,Good people that truly care about the products.,"Working in manufacturing, the culture was old school and designed based on hourly store employees. Very limited vacation time and below competitive pay. Promote management based on seniority."

1910,Wegmans Food Markets,Helping hands/Cashier,2020-02-15,4.0,Cashier,Was trained for both Cashier front end and Helping hands AKA Outside help/Cart pushing. Offer a 60 cent raise every 6 months but its mostly to combat inflation and keep the pay competitive. Outside is hard and few in the store can do it but once you get used to it the day flys by quickly and you don't have to stand around all day like being a cashier. They offer free soup and water bottles for helping hands and often give wegmans brand Gaterade during the summer.  Management sees at least what 'I' do and praise when I do a good job leaving me with more freedom and less micro management.,"Nobody is your friend, technically. Everyone is out for themselves, while 'anyone' can move up. People who already know each other outside of work be it family or friends will always choose them for promotion over you no matter how hard you work as they attempt to ignore it or reward you in other ways, but asking is always key ALWAYS ask, everyday if you have to. Co-workers watch what kind of worker you are either you talk too little or too much can get you moved around or denied slower shifts and moved to busier ones to 'avoid' the chatter boxes chatting too much, worse case denied transfers and promotions.

Many people only work the minimum. The tend I a have been seeing with Former and Current employees posting about Wegmans is that you have some that are expected to run the entire store and others do the boot licking minimum, this causes people to quit as the unfair workloads start to really bother people especially in more labor intensive divisions.

Lastly people call out all the time, I guess this is a double edged sword but unless you are full-time. Wegmans can't fire you for calling out unless you don't show up for the job for multiple days and even then that is if you can even afford to, its mostly kids however that do this."

Upper Management for the most part is pretty respectful to their employees.","Hours can be very inconsistent at times, especially when college students are on break. At times, how management  schedules employees’ hours, they make it so that one is working as much hours as possible without being entitled to either a lunch or entitled to only a 30 minute lunch, making some scheduled days very physically tedious.

I went months without certain members of upper management talking to me, until my department became a focus in the division, then they played nice. 
My department was severely understaffed and while management would always preach to ""ask for help and we'll help you out. We never want you to feel overwhelmed."" All my requests for help we go unanswered or turned down. 
If there was something I didnt understand or didn't know how to do, I would get talked down to if I asked for help with it.

Health insurance is quite good and that is why you'll see many people of older age. 
Free anti-slippery working shoes twice a year.","Your skills and knowledge are undervalued. Your resume is actually never even looked at because they have their own qualifications.  The wrong people are hired for the job. The wrong people are promoted. If you are lazy and don't mind putting on a smile and show up to pick up your check this is the place for you. If you are skilled, a hard working fella and passionate about your job, you will waste your time working there--there's no manager capable of seeing it and rewarding you. People in higher ranks were getting paid less than lower ranks. 
You won't be appreciated enough despite the ''employee appreciation days'' they throw once or twice a year. 
You Will pick up the slack of the lazy people and burn out and get paid the same or even less.
The reason for good health insurance is because of the high volume there is many injuries. So many there's a board counting them over the week."

2025,Wegmans Food Markets,"Okay, but could be better",2019-10-02,3.0,Front End Cashier,"The flexibility was great. They were okay if I had to leave early for a doctor's appointment or anything else. Pay is also better than other markets such as Shoprite. Customers usually are not rude, most are nice. Training is pretty decent as well. Is so incredibly busy on weekends, it can be rough working especially if you are older. It is also difficult to get fired unless you are rude to customers. Their policy on calling out is more lenient than any job I ever had. I was late multiple times my last couple of months and no one said anything to me.","After working there for a while, they really do start taking advantage of you. If it is busy, you will have a difficult time leaving on time because the managers never get anyone to replace you on your register. Managers will also ignore you and get annoyed sometimes when you have questions because you have been there for a while. It is impossible to cross-train when starting off on front end because front end has such a high turnover rate. You are on your own very often when working early morning or before close because managers are often wandering off and are not around if you need help. Managers also play favorites. Off register duties such as re-shops and 5S is always given to the same people, the favorites, so they can get off register. Cafe cashier is also given to favorites, and they get to just talk and be on their phones without managers seeing them. There are very few good STL's. Half of them are new with no experience working in a food market. The people who should get promoted do not and end up leaving. They have been hiring from the outside lately, even for coordinators. Self-checkout is also given to favorites so they can stand around and talk to the service desk cashiers. Sometimes my light was flashing and there would be no STL's around to help me and customers would be getting angry. I have also not gotten breaks when working in the evening because it was understaffed. Managers are two-faced and look down on you. HR is great though and very helpful. Hours get severely cut come June and then rise back up come September. Holidays are brutal there. Advancement is difficult also. Really only good for high school and college students. They don't really help you like they claim they will when you first start working there."

Loved my co-workers, and the job is actually okay. You always have something to do and there's never a slow moment. There are opportunities to move to other departments if the one you're in doesn't suit you.","Have had situations where the head chefs tried to call me in on a day off or on vacation days. Lots of talk about how the kitchen is ""a family"" which translates into ""we ask you to stay on longer than you should, and we won't pay you benefits or overtime for it"".

Also, there's no employee discounts. Which should be, like, mandatory.

I am a scholarship winner and have received tremendous support financially as well as from other employees who make Wegmans a truly enjoyable place to work.,The pay will generally hover around minimum wage for part-timers.
2163,Wegmans Food Markets,A few thoughts from a 10+ year employee,2019-04-21,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"A few years ago, the company was a lot better. The culture was different. It was actually fun to work at the store, and maybe I'm just looking at it through rose colored glasses but the whole philosophy of the company has changed ever since Danny stepped down. Though to be fair, he wasn't really a brainchild of new innovative things.  The current climate of Wegmans has very good benefits for full timers, and they just recently introduced vacation hours to part timers, which originally they just paid you out for it in a lump sum once a year. They also have a nifty scholarship that will give you a few grand towards college which is helpful for when you have higher hopes than working at an overzealous grocery store.","The cons are becoming larger and larger as the days go on. No longer are you appreciated as an employee for the hard work you've done or the accomplishments that your team got done. Instead you're a unit. And before you think anything like ""well you get paid how much praise do you want?"", employee appreciation used to be a common term, getting food and drinks (coffee, soda) on holidays/around holidays, having incentives (pizza/wings) to do well on your monthly inventories, and even having higher values of the people that work there. Now, the whole place has shifted into a place I do not recognize. 

The customers treat employees like garbage, and management does not back you up. They will give them all of the free goodies to keep them shopping here, and to be honest, half of them are stealing anyway, but our security team is too busy doing other things instead. 

Managers get paid the most to do the least amount of work, but we already knew that right? I mean, it wouldn't make sense for someone making over 100 grand to do something, but the kid making $11 an hour, you should make him do back breaking labor. I wouldn't have a problem with that if they gave workers a decent wage, but the Wegmans yachts have to keep getting bigger and bigger. And even their coupons, employee or customer are just garbage.

The people who say this is a good company to work for seem to never had any passion in life, or just bounced around from bad job to bad job until they found one that didn't totally crush them."

Also, we are paid weekly and I’ve made many friends in each department even upstairs in the offices too.",Even when it’s super busy managers would rather watch us struggle than hop on. There are always so many call outs so if you’re not one of those slackers you have to pick up the pace and work faster. The people in accounting come by to take money from till and leave you asking for a loan and also take up your time when dealing with customer.

very easy to transfer from one department to another (6 months minimum of working in original department before you can) (another interview will be required)
a scholarship
and more","sporadic scheduling and sometimes less people scheduled than needed
fewer hours in different departments during certain times of the year depending on what is being sold
managers breathing down your neck sometimes but you should be fine as long as you can get stuff done and put out
management will often bend to the will of the customer over the employees, depending on the situation, even if the employee wasn't at fault sometimes.
management is often busy and not always available to deal with situations when they are presented. (This is most prominent on the front end where TL's and managers have to help different people every five minutes or so. Also not always prepared for influxes of customers.)
Scheduling isn't always the best when it comes to time outside of work. If you are a full time student (high school, college, etc) its better to be very specific with your availability, Especially if you have things to do outside of work like activities or tests coming up as leaving it open will leave you open to work. They can and often will put you on shift if you have free time outside of availability. Plan in advance for events or tests because you will have to put in time for them three weeks before they come up."

Hours are pretty set so it works for college kids. The cart pushing is seriously great exercise.","It's hard to be brief and unbiased because this was the worst job I have ever had. Absolutely no one in my department liked it. The way the stores are designed is that they use cheap labor (best place to work yeah right, I got paid $10 an hour to run an entire department), so most of their employees are high school kids, and the stores are way too dependant on that. Adults are outnumbered and it makes for a very sub par work environment because teenagers are not good workers. Upper management is comprised of thousands of individual robots who are the exact same person doing the exact same thing for no reason. If you deviate from their cultlike personaity your chances of promotion are low because they don't give consideration to the quality of your work. I mean zero. Coffee shop managers get bored and transfer to pharmacy, getting positions over actual pharmacy techs. I worked at 3 locations and live in a city with countless stores, so I can reasonably say they are all completely different as far as standards and expectations. Wegmans brand is still very nice overall but it's hard transferring stores to come into a completely different sysyem. Personally I switched for grad school and went from being the unofficial HH manager to just a cashier who got no hours because my new location were snobs and thought the way I did things was ""weird."" It just doesn't consistently practice the so called values that everyone drills into your head. They do these things called conversation notes that are like a private meeting where they complain about you for an hour, ask you how you feel, and then let you leave. It's very forced and childish and they serve no purpose other than to make you feel so uncomfortable that you get angry or cry. They also have a habit of arresting customers for shoplifting which is funny because they regularly underpay their workers and don't seem to care about how that's stealing."

Company culture has changed significantly towards the negative (again, this trended this way due to a surplus of now ""bad/toxic managers"" at the senior store & and division leadership level who are simply just ""yes-men"")"

Great co-workers.,"Tone-deaf and incompetent management at PA Distribution Center; horrible operating system (Red Prairie) that corporate believes is wonderful but every single floor employee in the distribution center knows is utter garbage that impedes productivity and efficiency. 

""Happy, Shiny People"" style  management, with fake cheeriness and valuing tone over substance. 

Rotating mangers and hiring form outside the distribution center only guarantees that team leads and managers don't know enough about the operation, perpetuating a needless tension between team-leads and workers. 

Don't work here unless you want to go home every day feeling frustrated and knowing that the company's systems and management did not allow you to do your job well. 

Schedule changes all the time. No way to build a life when your days off change every few weeks. So much for their hollow commitment to Work/Life Balance. Again, an indication that HR and management is clueless and inept.

I keep in touch with many  employees who still work there, and not one is happy there nor do they think any improvements have been or will be made.   The consensus is that the company is broken and management in Rochester is either unwilling or incapable of making the fixes that need to be made. 

They almost never promote selectors to team-lead positions, which has created a culture where inept, under-informed team leads try to tell more experienced workers how to do their jobs. 

Stores may be a great place to work, but the distribution center is a pit of misery."

If you are not a manager expect to be treated less than one. The values of the company are not represented at the lower manager level, as in lots of hourly employees feel under appreciated and over worked. I truly don’t know how Wegmans is always on the best places to work for. If you have aspirations to do more and move up quickly, this is definitely not the company for you.

But I know that they support you in earning promotions in the store, such as becoming a manager or etc.","Managers have a lot of power over cashiers. If they hold a grudge against you, they will find ways to make you work harder, such as assigning you to a busy register or maybe even scheduling you bad hours based on your availability (i.e. working the busiest hours and working long enough to get a break but not long enough to get a lunch.) But if they favor you, they will find ways to make your job easier, such as assigning you to the least busy registers or asking you to do an errand because they know cashiers would prefer to do something else in the store.
Also, the job is exhausting. I come home very tired after every shift. You will really work like a machine as a cashier. It's the worst part about the job, and managers know it too, that's why they'll always refuse to go on the register if they are short on staff."

Management will use and abuse you while you are trying to develop(you'll do their job but not get paid for it) in order to be full time you must have a completely open availability,  so if you need thursday nights off for your kids sport or something they may cooperate for a bit but then randomly throw you onto the night. 
They do not review store policies at orientation so you don't know anything about absence policy or sick leave or when you get vacation time. 
They won't terminate people that are consistently absent from work because ""they care"", this puts a real burden on the people that actually show up because they still expect the same work to get done. It is hard to get fired and most people don't leave because the job pays decently. This means there is little chance of openings in your stores unless a new one opens up near by.

Upper management is fake and untrustworthy. Rampant favoritism. Empty promises about giving you more help and then nothing ever changes.

The department you are will really make or break the job. Being a cashier is like being stuck in an endless void of repetition and misery.  It is very hard on your body yet they still want you to go faster to get IPMs up. It makes you feel little more than a machine. 

Service desk workers are expected to do too much. Not only do they handle difficult customers, returns, product compliants, lottery, ticketing, answering phones, general cashier responsibilities, and answering questions other people don't know the answer to, but they are in charge of the bottle redemption center. Cleaning the machines, building and hauling bins, the TOMRA truck loading/unloading, the cardboard, and cleaning the room in general must be juggled with all the desk responsibilities. You have a line of customers who are angry or need help and the alarm stating one of the machines are not working going off and customers out there are livid. And if you are alone, there is no way to do everything. Even if there are two of you there, it is extremely difficult. 

My advice is to avoid the service desk and cashier if you can. There are better departments. And once you get into the desk, it is very difficult to get out. It was too much stress for the amount of pay."

Some departments will go without needed Team Leaders and employees for months and expect other employs to cover it while management offers little to no help.  Taking a Team Leading position is a good way to get fired due to bad upper management which is why departments go without them for extended periods of time. They have a weird sense when it comes to hiring people in general (although speeds for hiring grunt employees have been getting a bit better.). When some managers try to help they tend to get in the way more than anything due to a lack of  understanding how departments run.

I've been with Wegmans for almost 10 years and still love my job as if it were day one.,"Full-time positions do not open up very often, but the benefits for part-time employees make up for it!"
2691,Wegmans Food Markets,Great place to launch your career if you're in your 20s.,2017-10-31,3.0,KBS,"Wegmans really looks to make lifers out of their young employees.  With aggressive promotions to their youngest Team Leaders, you could be poised to take on a management position by  your late 20s, regional management by your 40s. Your background does not matter to wegmans. You do not need that college degree to succeed here. If you're young enough, they will even help pay for college. They will shape you into what you need to be. They highly value company loyalty. Pay is slightly more than other equitable places. Generous relocation packages. Time and a half on Sunday's and paid holidays.","Hope you like working weekends without ever getting two consecutive days off because that's your new life at Wegmans. If you came to Wegmans over 35 yeas old thinking you might get a career... good luck. I've seen people with tons of experience in their 30s and 40s hired below their pay grade, thinking wegmans was a smart move being the number two ""best place to work"" Fortune 100 company under Google. But, then they get stalled out, unable to progress to management because younger people in their 20s get preferential treatment here. It's a real shame. I've also seen and heard of roughly 75 overqualified current full time wegmans employees applying for that rare time that a different full time position opens within the store. That's because once you're hired full time, it's very difficult to move around. Paradoxically, you need to move around to become a manager. The only way around this is to be willing to relocate. Fine if you're young without a family to consider, but almost impossible for those already established with a mortgage and a working spouse. Also, if you do work full time here and you want to apply for another open position, you have to get approval to apply from your manager. Then you fill out another application as though you're starting from scratch. Also you must submit a portfolio of your work successes. After all that, your manager takes a look at it and then fills out a form that either approves or denies your application to be forwarded to Human Resources. This is ridiculous and allows for managers to trap you where you are if they don't particularly want to let you go from the department because you're too good at your job or they can't easily replace you. In my case, I have a major personality conflict with my manager, don't thrive at all under their micromanaging, vengeful style of management. This person told me I could apply, then denied my application forward, cherry picking (what was mostly fiction) whatever was needed to justify the denial, all with a big grin on their face. It was their ultimate victory after months of conflict and they savored it as they were doing it. That's when I realized I needed to leave. Because wegmans will always support management over the full time employees, there was no point in complaining about it. Each store has an Employee Representative where you can take your grievances. In our store, they are rarely available and can hardly be found. Definitely not friendly! Our rep never follows up with you and is annoyed when you have to remind them to do what they said they would do. Also, a manager or Team leader can add something to your file without alerting you in any way. So it could be pure fiction and you'll have no way of defending yourself because you won't even know about it until it is brought up in a meeting where its being used as justification to deny you moving upward! Big flaw in the system.  Wegmans culture is a nice warm vacuum, where your past life and skill set doesn't matter in the least. All that matters is your commitment to the company. People with the best and most interesting jobs have been with the company for at least 15 years. There is no such thing as coming in at the top based on your work experience here. You start at the bottom and work your way up. Hope you're young enough to succeed here."

2705,Wegmans Food Markets,Pub Bartender,2017-10-09,1.0,Bartender,They pay $5.25/hr instead of the typical $2.83/hr,"Where to begin. The management has no idea what they are doing and will overwork you until you cannot work anymore. 

They are VERY stingy, they account for every cent. If your drawer is under they expect you to pay it back, if it is over (as in you accidentally put one of your tips in it) they yell at you but do not give you any of the money back from tips

If you request off they will most likely deny it and if you call out they will verbally discipline you. I requested off four months in advance, did not hear a word about it until one week before I was supposed to go on my trip, they said I could not go for that long unless I could find a way to get covered. 

Management does not listen to you and if you speak out they will get angry with you.

My store does not hire any managers from within, leaving there virtually no opportunity to advance

Manager's expect you to do their jobs for them such as writing schedules, printing menu's, etc. Once you do their jobs they take credit when upper management arrives.

It is like a cult. I am genuinely afraid to write this review because I believe there is a chance they will find out it is me writing these things about them and fire me. People are fired for much less."

If you get denied, it's on you to find someone to take your shift.  A little hard when full timers can only work 40 hrs.  OT is discouraged to the point of ""cutting hours""."

2748,Wegmans Food Markets,A Glimpse Of Wegmans,2017-09-13,4.0,Customer Service Produce,"•I've met some excellent friends and acquaintances through Wegmans. With a company this large, you're bound to meet people with whom you share common interests. 
•Your pay starts a little over minimum wage (for a part-time employee), but, Wegmans bumps everyone's pay up $0.25 every 6 months, which may not appear to be much, but definitely makes a big difference in your paycheck at the end of the week. 
•At least in my department, team leaders are willing to listen to your thoughts about how the department is being run, and are flexible making the schedule if you can only work certain hours/days during the week. 
•Occasionally there are times when you are permitted to dress more casually. For example, in the summer, you can donate a few dollars to United Way to wear jeans to work for the day, around Christmas, we are allowed to wear work-appropriate festive attire, and during football season, you can wear college/NFL team apparel on the weekends in some stores. 
•It is nearly impossible to get fired. I've heard stories, and known people who came to work drunk, smoked cigarettes inside while working, been on their cell phones all day, and there was no action taken by management for months, or even years in some cases. So, I guess that's a pro and a con depending on which side you're looking at it from. 
•Fantastic benefits for full-time employees","•Just like any other job, there are some employees/managers that you won't get along with all the time. 
•For part-time or full-time, there doesn't seem to be much room for career growth. You really have to be a manager/team leader to have any career opportunities. 
•You do get employee coupons to use, through the Wegmans App, but otherwise no discounts. 
•You used to get $6 Wegmans gift cards when you were given a customer compliment, did an exceptional job, or came in on a day off. Now you just receive a $5 meal coupon. Due to allergies, dietary restrictions, etc. I can't eat much of what I can buy with the coupon, so I don't feel valued when they give me a coupon which I just have to throw away, or give to someone else, since I can't buy something I'm actually able to eat.
•Yes, there is favoritism involved a lot of the time. Wegmans can be like a high school: there are cliques, gossip spreads at the speed of light, and there are teacher's pets, mean girls, and airheads who somehow manage to keep getting by.
•Often short-staffed, so you'll have to sometimes do the work of two people."

The Who We Are values aren't just for show, it really is a deep part of their corporate and retail culture and it shows.
They have a track record of hiring the best and helping them become even better; My coworkers here were some of the most friendly and dedicated individuals I've come across. I made friends with several of them and we were all for delivering the best products and services every day. Wegmans is also VERY BIG on personal development within the company, and has a well-defined structure for employees to move up the ranks within.","Stores go through periods of working on skeleton crews sometimes, even if it doesn't show outwardly. It puts a LOT of stress on the employees there when they have to absorb the roles of 2 former coworkers after they move up or move on. This is especially prevalent at the entry level positions; after a bunch of our employees moved up to team leader or management status we had holes in our coverage for quite a while."

This was never more evident than seeing the steps they took during Hurricane Sandy, in my years here, our finest hour. We fed and sheltered many in our community. Trailers of ice and food were diverted from other areas to all the Wegmans in the Sandy area. With many people without power, we set up charging stations, had a backup generator and helped many people get thru a difficult time. Even charging stations were available for free for laptops and phones. Customers really appreciated us being the only place around when all others were closed. I've never been prouder.","The grocery business is a difficult business, so if you've never worked anywhere but Wegman's, you may think the other companies are the same. Trust me, they're not.
It's a large, high volume business, and you're only as good as what you've done lately, which can be frustrating when called to task for  mistakes. It sometimes seems that workers get more blame than deserved. The bar is higher here, so that's natural. It's not rocket science, but it does take effort. Some employees expect it to be too easy, get off you duff and get to work."

The pay is comparable to other companies. There are alot of other pharmacists on duty at one time since it is a very busy pharmacy.,"The pharmacy has become more of a money maker than about customer service. They still strive for customer service, but they regulate how many prescriptions you check per hour or per day, and as long as it's enough, they would rather have that, and make mistakes, than have you check less prescriptions with no mistakes.

A sense of job security.,"This company totes itself as one of the best to work for, and maybe it is at other stores but from my experience MGMT cares only about payroll hours. They expect you to work like a robot, performing the roles of three people and it's unfair. I hate going to work knowing I'm going to spend the next 8 hours stressed and overworked just trying to keep up with the work load.

The company also promotes the idea of ""Learn and Grow"" and endless career opportunities but all that depends on being one of the ""favorites"" of your MGMT or their ""business needs."" I applied to opportunties for growth. First, I was denied for attendance (four tardies a month out of 30 days a month made my attendance so horrible to the manager) but I see others with equally blemished attendance records moving into new positions. Then when I posted again I was denied because of business needs - the department was understaffed and my departure would hurt. Which is unfair - why is my desire to grow a career blocked by the whims of one manager or business needs? I'm not one the 15 year olds they love hiring. I don't have years to spend in one position so if I don't get my opportunity to ""grow"" soon I'm going to apply elsewhere."

For a part time student working their way through high school and the beginning of college $10+ an hour goes a long way. I also was consistently recognized for the hard work that I contributed to the company even in my small part time role. The culture also focuses on the growth of all employees that add value. If you work hard consistently you will be presented with opportunities for advancement. Their culture focuses on retaining and training people to reach their full potential.

Full timers earn 3+ dollars more per hour for the same amount of work. On Sunday when part timers get time and a half, full timers get double pay. In the age of equal pay for equal work, it seems crazy to me that this store doesn't subscribe to that philosophy.
-Some of the managers are lazy. I understand that the higher up you are, the more of a paper pusher you become, but at least do the bare minimum of your job. 
-No employee discounts which is insane considering how overpriced everything is.
-The daytime crew do absolutely nothing. Everything is left up to the night crew who are in charge of breaking down pallets of product, separating product according to aisle, running backstock (which is day shift's responsibility), ordering, and conditioning.

3149,Wegmans Food Markets,Not Sure How They Keep Ending up on the List,2016-07-02,1.0,Department Manager,"Trying to be honest, I can say that for a retail job they are pretty good. 
- They offer competitive benefits
- There are options to move throughout the company.
- They are expanding geographically which is good if you are looking to relocate.
- Management tends to not act in a black and white manner, they usually show compassion for their employees, causing some grey areas in policies. (Some may see this as a bad thing).","Where to begin...the workload, inconsistent scheduling, lack of work-life balance, and unreal expectations alone is enough to make this by far the worst job I've ever had.
-While they do offer competitive benefits, there are plenty of other companies that offer much more, and don't make their employees wait 1 year into the job for them. The hiring process takes forever, and when you need help it can take months.
- Part time employees make their own schedules and aren't held to very high standards, which causes an immense workload for full time and management. 
- There are many more part time employees than full time, and the part timers also seem to be the ones that say Wegmans is a good place to work. I personally have only met a handful of full time and above employees who actually enjoy working here.
- People get promoted to positions when they have no qualifications, while many employees who deserve promotions can post multiple times with no luck.
- There are quite a few managers I know that have had sexual relations with their employees sometimes during work and nothing happens to them. They usually just get moved to a different store or department. 
- Wegmans is tremendous at self promoting. They constantly remind us that they're the best place to work and they hold annual ""Who We Are"" meetings where we watch videos of current employees talking about how great it is to work there.
- When I first started every employee I came across acted like they drank the koolaid, but as time went on you begin to talk to people and realize that for the vast majority it's an act.
- As stated above there is almost no work life balance. They claim there is, but even if you're just a full time employee, let alone management you are expected to be available 24/7, every weekend, every holiday. (this includes phone calls on your days off/vacations).
- There are plenty of days when the workload is so heavy we don't get lunches or breaks, sometimes working 10-12 hours straight.

Knowing that Wegmans is a retail company, I almost feel dumb for complaining about it. However, I think if they didn't spend so much time telling us it's such a great place to be, I would have known going in that it was going to be a terrible job."

The business is very political. There is plenty of room for growth, and the Management Internship program is a great opportunity for anyone, regardless of if you plan on staying at Wegmans. It is absolutely the best retail place to work for. If you don't have a degree, and you are not trained in a trade, this is a fair place to go. Competitive pay for the industry.","It's a grocery store, it's not glamorous. Brainwashy type meetings. It's good for a retail industry, however it's nothing special. If you have a degree, look elsewhere for better opportunity. Even store management (i.e. Area Managers) is paid relatively low ($55k-$65k) compared to other industries. It's definitely not one of the best places to work in the country. It's only good for people with limited education, or limited skills. Compared to some insurance companies, banks, etc. the benefits and pay are mediocre. Low education workers and management, mindless seemingly unimportant and insignificant work, retail, low skill, low pay when compared to other industries. And would you want to tell someone you work for Wegmans stocking shelves, or that you're a school teacher who has a Master's degree in a subject area and is an authority on a topic?

Answer, its not! their position is bought. wegmans is on the defence right now as the economy is very poor and most people are using technology to compare price before they purchase and are shopping around. wegmans refuses to carry cheaper products and only offers expensive organic options. Additionally, there giant store could house tens of thousands more products but instead the will have upwards of 20 facings of their own products, equating to a 10+ case pack out that are lucky to sell half a case a day."

They would scream at her, degrade her, tell her she was gonna get fired, made her feel like an awful person. And they wouldn't even let her explain the situtation that had happened. She wouldn't come to work sometimes because the management made her feel like such a terrible person. No one should make any other human being feel like that.

I started working at Wegmans when I was 15 and continued until my senior year of college, through their Wegmans Scholarship and flexible hours I was able to work in a job that worked with my schedule as well as me leaving for college. I definitely gained alot of experience through Wegmans that I otherwise would not have working at any other job throughout high school. The skills I picked up at Wegmans have now helped me at my new employer.","Even though I truly enjoyed working at Wegmans for most of my 5 years there however I feel that sometimes corporate and management changes truly affected my work experience at my store. About 3-4 years into working with Wegmans our store received a new store manager who set out to change the way things run at our store. Cutting hours for the most part and trying to make the store into his own.

3318,Wegmans Food Markets,Treat your employees equally!,2016-01-25,3.0,Bakery Customer Service,"-good health insurance plan
-flexible hours... in theory
-relatively easy to switch between departments if you so choose (though some departments are harder to get into than others)
-some coworkers and managers are decent people
-easy work
-most managers are cool with you learning to do other things within your dept and cross depts 
-got paid to watch dumb training/motivational/propaganda videos
-employee appreciation day (as long as you got there before the good food ran out)

For the record, I worked for 3 different bosses and 2 different locations. The smaller location I worked at was definitely better. Bigger store, greater stresses.","-takes a bit of time being with the company to get full-time and it's not guaranteed even if you're a reliable worker (took over 5 years from most people I knew)
-being looked down upon/assumed that I was lazy because I was younger (in my late teens-early 20s) despite pulling my weight
-sexual harassment of some higher ups and full timers toward part timers (not me personally, but my sister and coworkers told me stories)
-getting the worst hours (closing shift) despite having an open schedule and being able to work in any part of the department (I worked every weekend for almost a year before getting one off)
-getting assigned the worst and most work as a night shift person compared to the day shift people (I always cleaned up after their messes and was expected to do whatever they didn't finish plus my own assigned duties) EXAMPLES: 1- I had been in the department for less than 6 months and had to train 2 new employees on the weekend at night alone (which was a very busy time for us). It was absolute hell and my bosses didn't care the stress it put on me. 2- I ran ""create-a-cake"" alone at nights for weeks on end because nobody else was around to do it. It was very clearly a 2-3 person job on most nights, but I did it all by myself. Again, bosses didn't care that I was overloaded with work. Just wanted to see things DONE. 
-managers liked to play favorites (give some people better hours than others despite having similar flexibility in schedules and worth ethic)
-managers could be pretty lazy (would leave the dept for hours and I'd find them talking to other managers and laughing or roaming around aimlessly and I'd be working like a dog)
-some coworkers and managers are pretty awful people 
-salary (cap was at $9.15/hour for part time workers and $14-15/hour for full time workers back in 2012... kind of ridiculous to me)
-the longer I worked there, the more responsibility was put on my shoulders and of course, the pay didn't increase with more responsibilities. I had to more to do in the same amount of time. You were expected to just deal with this."

3323,Wegmans Food Markets,Front End Coordinator,2016-01-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Coworkers are awesome. Family-like environment. Reasonably priced health insurance. You will never run out of things to eat for lunch.,"Contrary to what they want you to believe, Wegmans' top priority is not people, it's payroll. Departments (specifically the front end) are purposely scheduled with far less employees than what's required for that day.  On top of this, there is constant pressure placed on front end management to cut more hours. The front end is intentionally understaffed every single day, and it is the front end coordinators' job to call other departments (who are also understaffed) and beg them to send a member of their department to cash. Imagine calling the same departments over and over again up to 10x per day begging them to send you help as they becoming increasingly annoyed with you. Well that's your job if you get hired as a front end coordinator.

Front end coordinators NEVER get breaks.  If you expect to get two breaks and a lunch with an 8.5 hour shift (aka the law) look elsewhere.  There are times it's impossible to even use the restroom. There are also times where you will be scheduled until 12:30am and then have to be back the next morning at 7am (also against the law, but it builds character, right?)

Wegmans does not care if you went to college.  Degrees mean nothing to them, they want you to learn the Wegmans way.  Oh you have a bachelors in business? We invite you to post for full-time produce customer service.

Upper management is completely out of touch with 'lower' management.  Typically the only time they acknowledge you is to tell you to open more registers (which wouldn't be a problem except there are no cashiers to put on said registers because you've slashed our payroll down to nothing.)

You will work every holiday and every weekend.

I do not hate Wegmans by any means, nor am I trying to bad mouth them.  But I do feel that these are important things to know if you're planning on applying."

3336,Wegmans Food Markets,Great company that believes in it's people,2016-01-07,5.0,Pharmacy Technician,"Working here has allowed me to see how grocery stores should be run. Management listens to those below them, because they were often once in their spot. The in-store pharmacy I work in is not understaffed even up until closing, and the training I received after moving there from cashier was in-depth and one-on-one, you're not thrown into the pool to fend for yourself. Another great aspect is the ability to use discretion in terms of keeping customer satisfaction, such as giving a free drink coupon to someone who waits too long, or not being concerned about being late back from my break if a customer needs directions, or help. Of course some things/rules are not bendable but the company understands and believes that some money lost here, helps them in the long run with customer satisfaction. The company mostly hires management and Team leaders from within so upward growth is always possible. The company website accessed by employees, lets you: ""ask Jack"" the VP of Store Ops questions, with timely responses, see your schedule, access pay-stubs, fill out W2, see customer compliments across the company, see new store construction pictures and new job postings before they go public.","One major problem I have encountered is simplification. Simplification is the idea that every item in every department should have a set, labeled place, and that the workplace should be cleared from clutter, personal items, and un-needed products. The concept of a set place for things is great, but during the bi-monthly audits of departments things like a corner of a label beginning to peel is a deduction. There is a paper clip in the rubber band bucket, deduction! Light-bulb above counter that has been called into maintenance, deduction! Anything, and I mean anything out of place is a deduction. If the department grade is less than 18/20 (90%) the department fails. Simplification is good in that it allows our departments to be clean, but do we really need to label the stapler ""stapler"", or Trash can ""trash can"", and stress for days before our audit so that we don't fail because a label corner peeled on something like a hand scanner, which is used every transaction."

Upper management only works 8-5 or 9-5s which isn't fair because everyone else's schedules is inconsistent. Employees aren't paid enough in terms of what they're expected to do. Most of the employees are from New York and they're rude and obnoxious. I don't understand how they're so selection as to who they hire when they only hire because there's no need.

Part time workers have plenty of scheduling flexibility, including working only summer's and school holidays. Wegmans has a good scholarship program.  Full time employees familiar with standard issue retail practices will find Wegmans no better or worse than Wal-Mart, Target or other similar businesses.","Emphasis on reports which reflect positively on upper management pressures department managers to compromise corporate values of caring, empowerment and respect.  Store management structure is confusing.  Full time employees are required to accept schedules which swing erratically from early mornings to late nights with no rhythm or routine, undermining Wegmans' professed interest in work/life balance.  As noted in NY Times article 'When bosses schedule hours that just don't work', scheduling is a tool for higher profits at Wegmans as it is in other retail environment s and Wegmans rewards managers for maximizing profits at the expense of sensible schedule s for regular employees."

As long as you drink their kool aid you will fit in fine. They do not like independent thinkers. I have personally watch management isolate workers and push them till they cry. The myth that this is a great place to work is done through their own marketing team not real  employee surveys.  I worked there for three years and no one ever asked any of us to take a survey.  They even make you sign an agreement that you will not talk badly about Wegmans on your social media account.  Be warned you will not enjoy working for Wegmans unless you join the mind bending cult that is constantly beat into your head with training videos after training video.  If you then get a glazed blank Wegmans look on your face you will be fine . They push respect as the number 1 thing you need to have but do not give you any.

Coworkers: Interesting and enjoyable people to work with, especially in the prepared foods side of the store.","Perceived job responsibilities: Essentially, your title does not actually indicate how much and what type of work you will be doing. Long story short, when you get placed with a sub par manager or one of the company's ""good old boys,"" you're going to be doing half of their work on top of yours. 
Company Culture: The usual hiring process, slightly more strict than most but still too lenient than what the company wants to show. Due to this, a vast majority of your coworkers can be extreme brownosers and get promoted like you've never seen, and then hail the company as the best to work for on the planet. Unfortunately, it seems as if what is desired is blind obedience and any employee outside of the ""ideal"" is given empty platitudes about promotions and pay increases. 
Scheduling: Quite frankly, its utter madness. Outside of office positions, pretty much everyone will be jumbling schedules that can range from 12-Midnight and a morning shift at 7 AM or vice/versa. 
Overall, the company wants to maintain a positive public image meanwhile keeping overhead to a minimum and reducing hours as they see fit to make sure those at the bottom are overworked and underpaid. Don't believe the hype. Shopping here may be great, but working here is a whole other ballgame."

Also expect your entire dept. to get their hours cut multiple times a year, making it a struggle to maintain benefits (30 hours per week/average required) and to survive. Also cutting back so much, makes it impossible to treat our customers with high standards, as your team is just struggling to get regular tasks accomplished.

Nepotism is humongous.  Good luck getting in the door.  Success at Wegmans requires a certain ignorance of reality.  Very akin to the stereotypical HR attitude.  Managers also do not help out AT ALL, nor do they know how to.  During busy times you may get a stray manager trying to look good that you have to instruct whilst trying to do your own work.  The hours are also very solid.  Part-timers CAN NOT go anywhere near 25 hours, therefore you get kept safely below twenty.  The main problem is behind the scenes.  The managers are very kind and forgiving on the floor but as soon as they get the opportunity to get you in the office you will most likely leave crying.  It's that rough."

The pay raises for advancement are minimal, if anything.  Getting a corporate job is impossible. The company used to be nice to work for before Mr. Wegman passed away. You get no employee discount on groceries and no one who works for Wegmans can afford to shop at Wegmans. That is just bad advertisement. Schedules are a mess and you never get 2 days off in a row."

free boots
free shirt
if your in the cooler, free coat/ overalls

over time if you don't have a family to be with!","You have to swipe into the parking lot every day via your pass card (takes 10 seconds but is a PITA)

You have security turn styles that requires badge swips, 1 for grocery 2 for frozen/perishable
Long walks to frozen/perishable, about 100 yards before you can clock in (more of your life wasted every day)

Team leaders have favorite employees that get special treatment (have spoken to HR about this, no change)

The goals are constantly increased to higher expectations without any incentive for reaching goals other than team leaders saying good job keep busting your butt guys while I sit in the office.

Safety concerns are sometimes very slow to be resolved. 

Employees constantly looking for a better employer, a lot of people talking negative about the company and the joke of how its in the top 100 employers. 

No union protection in Pottsville 

Team leaders normally don't listen or care about suggestions. We have had a few good ones but they moved up the rank quickly and we get stuck with lazy ones again.

Team leaders used to go around the floor and ask selectors how there day was going, what's going on in their life and generally connect with employees, this does not exist anymore, they only go around to tell you that your moving to slow and need to pick up the pace.   

They supply a lot of people with cheap equipment, the vocollect system they use is good but the vocollects are getting old and corroded internally from humidity/condensation/heavy usage.The headsets they normally supply are the ""black"" generic brand that saves money but gives selectors a difficult time paired with the worn out vocollect units. This is just a way they are trying to save money, but when your selecting and you need to reach goal and you can't verbally tell a command to your headset because its crap, it's pretty frustrating.

When they do mandatory stretches before getting back to work they sometimes (depending on team leader) do each stretch 2-4 seconds to get us back on the floor asap, doing stretches this quickly is dangerous and defeats the purpose of stretching in the first place.

The break room is on the second floor, for lunch and both 15 minute breaks. There is a elevator but it cannot be used going back to work. 

If you smoke you must travel to the other side near grocery about 100 yards away (200 yards total walking) to enjoy a cigarette. 

They recently hired a temp agency that has no idea what they are doing, they select incorrectly in so many ways it's laughable, yet they make more than the wegmans selector. 

The schedule is never the same, you have a rotation every month. 

Its a big company, it used to be ran like a small company and treat its employees like it cares about them, but times are changing and wegmans pockets are filling to the top, product selectors are easily replaceable, they say they care about you but I've worked for many other companies that have done more for me in 6 months than wegmans did in 4 years.

Our senior workers don't get treated right, I know everyone wants equality among employees but if your up in age none of us younger employees are going to say a word about a older employee getting a lighter duty task after being hurt. I've seen 20 year wegmans employees put into the hardest job we have right after getting back from a work related injury, why?!"

3503,Wegmans Food Markets,Two words: Great Culture,2015-08-07,5.0,Pharmacy Technician,"The atmosphere is welcoming, and quite family orientated.  The greatest pro, in my opinion, is that it is a privately held, family-owned firm that knows how to take care of their employees and cuts out the bureaucratized red-tape stuff that a publicly held firm would put you through.

No gimmicks and no games, but just sincere, honest work is expected and the company is your oyster.","You'll be asked get the store/your department in tip-top shape once the Wegmans and any other top brass arrive for the rare ""visit"".  I'm pretty sure corporate knows that the store isn't up to snuff 24/7 and I believe its quite deceptive and a waste of energy, especially when no one comes to your department!

They promote based on looks and personality more than hard work or length of time.  Most people that leave do so because they couldn't get full-time.  Do not post for full-time unless you are told to, they already know who they are hiring for a position.  A lot of college students, when they leave the departments are short and stressed out.

There is always room for advancement and they promote from within. They high standards and usually only higher the best. It is a privately owned company with owners that do really care about their employees.,"Due to the high standards in hiring it is hard to effectively staff the departments, which means you have to pick up the slack. Also managers usually have to be self-sacrificing to live up to core values of the company. We take care of our people no matter the personal cost."

3549,Wegmans Food Markets,Great Company and Great First Job,2015-06-17,5.0,Front End Cashier,"In my mind, there are so many pros by working here, but first, you need to have a willing to work hard. If you are not willing to deal with the (obvious) hard-work of customer service or value how Wegmans operates, you should not work here - because there is a 99.9% chance you won't like it. (This is mainly  towards teenagers for a first job -  I have met and seen many of you with the 'I don't give a f, and I hate Wegmans attitude, so do us all a favor and just quit if you have that mindset. Sorry, but someone has to say it).
For college students, and graduating high school students, the Wegmans Scholarship is one of the largest pros that you can have. Besides the money factor, Wegmans really strives to help you accomplish your goals, even if it is not in the future of the company. I believe that this is a great way to 'keep' your people, while also helping them pursue higher education - and keep the great reputation that Wegmans has.
The opportunities that you (can) have. Since Wegmans is always moving forward, especially with building new stores in new states, your chances of 'going up' in the company has never been easier. I have seen many people advance in their situations, such as from dishwasher to sushi or  from cashier to FE Manager, the opportunities are endless, it's just if you want it.   
Overall, the largest 'Pro' that I can think of is the family atmosphere. I truly believe that is why I come back, and why (many) people do also. The People, the atmosphere - you really can't get any better than that. 
Overall, Wegmans is a GREAT place to work. I see individuals who have worked there since they were 15/16 and stayed there, just because of what Wegmans values - showing how dedicated employees are to the company AND why we all want to shop there. 
As an extra note, who DOESN'T want to work at a company who is always on the Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For!?!","It is really hard to move departments if you are in college, especially in a 4-year college (locally or away). I respect the people who go to a 2-year and work during the school year, but for those individuals who want to pursue a degree in a 4-year school, we should not get 'penalized' for not working, and should give us some lenience if we want to switch departments. 
I have heard for many full-time employees that the benefits are tough to get, and the full-time employment opportunities are slim. Dear Wegmans, I know you like part-time, but not all of us want that. Yes, you have to give up some more extra money, but in the end, you can't rely on all Part-time employees. That's never going to happen."
3550,Wegmans Food Markets,Help your employees,2015-06-17,3.0,Front End Cashier,"Big and pretty store that is kept clean for the most part. A lot of things to choose from even if the price is not always the best. 
There is a raise system in place so you know after x amount of time, you are getting x amount raise. 
They celebrate monthly birthdays and organize employee appreciation day once a month and provide free breakfast. Option to earn free meals from customers reviews
Some STL really care and will help you achieve your goals","Prices are not affordable. And there is no employee discount though we are their top customers (get paid and paycheck go right back to them, pay for meals while working or grocery when leaving for convenience)
No fairness sometimes while resolving issues because of taking sides (inner circle is always right)
Spoiled customers to the point that they request an inimmagible level of service and expect to get free things and everything they want because they've made an exception for them once. Customers treat employees like their maids or servant and bluntly argue that's why they come to Wegmans.

First the upper management and the HR department are racist. I use to hear them say racial comments on an everyday basis and would get away with it. Then that place is so infested with mices that its not even funny. They try to cover it up so people wouldn't notice, but their are always signs of mouse droppings around the store so they immediately clean it up. Sometimes you would find molded food around and not even notice. Another thing I noticed that some of the employees there do not wash their hands after coming from the restroom and they serve the customers. This place was not very people friendly either so don't expect to get along with everyone. If this is an ideal place you want to work, then good luck!"
3558,Wegmans Food Markets,It was good but I can see the culture changing,2015-06-07,3.0,Wegmans Full Time,Benefits: I get 3 weeks Vacation per year starting my 6th year and I've been getting two since the end of my first year and I got one week my first year. 401k and they match 100% up to 6% of your salary. Free $50k life insurance policy. Pay is ok but is higher than most grocers.,"Culture is changing. When I first started their was an ""air"" about the company that really drove me to love it so much. After worked in several stores my current location is by far the worst I've worked in. The management just walks by and if they say hello it's a hey or a courtesy smile. They try way too hard to be fun and exciting. My department alone has seen 10-15 employees quit in the last 6-9 months. If they don't like you they will move you to an area of the store that you may not like to try to get you to quit. They play favorites with their little ""it"" crowds. Flexible scheduling for full time is non existent. 24/7 open availability is required at all stores. You are scheduled every weekend unless you request off. Must work every holiday. The store is only closed on Christmas Day and doesn't close until 6pm Christmas Eve. Most major holidays the store is either open normal or close a couple ours early. So much for a family friendly environment. So is there any surprise that the new managers being hired are inexperienced young adults that aren't married or have kids, and are young enough to not care if they miss an event because that's what's happening at my store. They just announced that they will be expanding into new markets, states without a store, in the next 3-5 years. Opening multiple stores per year. Average 500 employees per store times say 8 new stores; that's 4,000+ employees.

3649,Wegmans Food Markets,"Great Company, Easily one of the best places to work!",2015-03-14,5.0,Distribution Manager,"Stable, growing company with almost unbelievable success.  Great work/life balance and focus on the importance of family--getting time off is always possible if employees reach out.  Company has many programs in place to help its employees when needed, and is one of the few left that truly practices what it preaches with being willing to focus on its people first.  Family ownership means less focus on bottom line and ability to do the right thing for the customer always, as well as great job security.  Benefits are top notch and perks such as discounts and food events are fun also.  Great sense of pride for working for this company, and a strong sense of ownership at all levels of management.  Managers have protocol to follow but are able to make exceptions when it's the right thing to do, and aren't held to unreasonable standards or required to hold employees to something they can't be expected to meet.","Training and development can be hit or miss outside of stores; employees must own it themselves at times.  Though the Wegman family gives significant ownership to managers and do not ""rule from above,"" politics can come into play sometimes.  Decisions move slowly due to getting multiple managers to buy in, and promotions sometimes happen due to favoritism over results.  The focus on stores first is paramount to the company's success, but can leave support teams in HQ, supply chain, etc. in the lurch at points."

3654,Wegmans Food Markets,"Unappreciative, No benefits, Just cares about cutting hours and making more money",2015-03-06,1.0,Front End,I had one good manager that genuinely cared about his employees however he left to go to another store and other management took over that was not nearly as good as he was. He was truly a needle in the haystack at Wegmans. Even when he did his best and things where at the worst the company clearly did not provide him with the tools to make it right.,"Minimum wage pay. I had been with the company 1 year and asked for a $0.50 raise and was told no, I was told that the $0.35 raise (about 3% per year to equal inflation) was a major benefit and most companies don't do that. I am now working at a company that pays me double what wegmans was and has way better staff and happier staff. I remember they used to have a board called ""opportunity hours"" and it was the amount of hours that management was supposed to cut for that day to save the store money. The current company that I work for is the total opposite always looking for people to pick up shifts. Not much room for advancement. Just before I left Wegmans I was given the opportunity to transfer departments but it was a lateral transfer with no pay structure or raises. No employee discounts at all. The only thing we did get was a $1 coffee and that was the ""discounted price"" I was once told by a manager that the store loses money on this however I find that hard to believe considering I can go to cumberland farms (a local gas and mini market chain) and get a good cup of coffee for $0.99 and thats the regular price. When I was at wegmans I also recall a time when they where celebrating ""voted best company to work for 17 years in a row"" however I was never asked about this. It seems like the prices continued going up for this private company due to corporate greed and everything was driven by a dollar sign without any regard to employees."

The best thing about wegmans is the culture. Employee are empowered to suggest constructive change. Upper management is held accountable and expected to uphold wegmans values. You can learn skills that will help you in other careers and in life. Overall, a very positive atmosphere.",Sometimes the job tasks themselves were repetitive.

Amazing co workers",There isn't any cons at wegmans
3733,Wegmans Food Markets,"Diversity at its best, both in work and employees!",2014-11-09,4.0,Customer Service,"There are so many different departments at Wegmans. If you're a decent employee, there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to cross-train in a different department, broadening your skill set and keeping things interesting.

The benefits for part time and full time are affordable and great! If you are an employee for 5+ years, you get to keep the 401K they give you, if you decide to leave. If you stay with the company, there's a plethora of opportunities to follow. And they almost, exclusively, hire internally.

Everything is up-to-date technology-wise, for the most part. For a grocery store, at least.

Wegmans is a much loved, and quality brand. It looks great on a resume. 
Remember: You don't work at a grocery store, you work at Wegmans.

Depending on which department you're at, you may be able to set your ideal schedule. However, like any other retail establishment, open availability, and working unconventional hours, adds a lot of value to an employee.

Whenever I felt I was treated unfairly by co-workers, management, etc... (did not happen often, but hey, its retail), there was always someone that listened and took my concerns seriously. 
They also make a noticeable effort to acknowledge someone's efforts.

And why I will always respect Wegmans: They always place their employees ahead of customers.","Like any other workplace, favoritism is sometimes a little too blatant. While this almost never was an issue, if it occurs in a smaller department, it can undo relationships and work ethic effortlessly.

Management can get a little too full of themselves, and/or become jaded...
...which leads into the next con: Over-saturation in employment. No one wants to leave, which is great! But, on the other side of the coin, sometimes management gets stuck, where they're at, for years. Not due to lackluster performance, or ""risky behavior"", or whatever. There's nowhere to go. There are a lot of managers I've had that deserve to move into the upper echelons of Wegmans, but can't because everyone seems to be enjoying (or tolerating, I suppose) their job.

It's retail. Make of that what you will.

The benefits*, or lack thereof. Yes, that was listed as a pro, I know. While its not all Wegmans doing... to qualify for healthcare, you must work 30+ hours a week (it used to be 20+ hours). If you're part time, it's doable to meet those hours. But pretty rare. Good luck.
   *it is still great they even did this in the first place, and continue to do it for part timers."

I worked there during and after college.,2014-10-30,4.0,Deli Clerk,"When I was there, the pay was competitive for the position. This non-union job gave me more job satisfaction and benefits than my previous union job did. Supervisors recognized hard work; it was a generally positive environment.
I took advantage of the scholarship program. When I left for a job in my chosen field, I was able to cash out a profit-sharing account that I was unaware of.","Part-time work was not enough to support a household. If you're not planning on staying there long-term (5+ years), it's difficult to get a full-time position.

I left because the work did not stimulate me mentally. I stayed until I found employment in my chosen field.
Being on my feet for an 8 hour shift was also rough sometimes."

-Scholarship Program for Students","-They are a well ranked company, but I suspect this is only at the corporate level. If you're working on the floor, it's not a good experience. Managers are inconsistent and hours are too inconsistent. They're flexible, but there is no consistent shift. I was frustrated working 1-6 on Tuesday, 8-2 one Tuesday, and then not even working the next Tuesday.
-A lot of Manager Turnover
-All the managers seemed to have different rules. Somethings would be okay with one and definitely not okay with another- never knew what to expect when I came in.
-Forced employees to ask customers for donations during United Way Campaign (you would be chastised if you didn't which made me uncomfortable)

As a full timer-40 hours a week. You get medical, dental, and vision.  

Full-Timers are really the ones who get the best of the company.  In the NJ division:  FT receive time and a half every Sunday, and if they work on specific holidays, they receive time and a half as well.

There is a lot of room for growth in the company if you are favored.

If you want to make this your career, there are opportunities for growth and you do no need a college degree to make the 60k+ salaries department and area managers make","There is room for growth in the company, but only if you are a favored employee.  There is a lack of consistency where if they do not care for an employee, they will penalize said employee.  But if another employee does the same thing, but upper management likes that employee, they can practically get away with murder.

Lots of mixed signals.

You are required to work holidays and weekend, especially when FT.  If you have a family that you enjoy seeing, this may not be the company for you.  ""Black Out Periods"" for all holidays, including something like ""Mother's Day"", mean you cannot request off.  Granted, this is the life of someone working in retail"

However, when moving to floral I realized this is seriously the best company to work for. Once you get a chance to be apart of a department, mangers and co workers start to treat you as a somebody rather than a nobody when on cashier. Also the pay increase every 6 months is great and the flexibility with hours is amazing! After moving for college I'm so sad to not be able to work there right now.

Stalker behaviors from an employee in shipping, freaks me out so bad that I can't go in when he's working.
Store manager treats Latino employees horribly. ( Denying continued presence on the payroll when an employee had to go back to school. Firing another employee for being late, an offense  that most employees get away with.)
Moving employees into departments that doesn't work well for them. ( They moved a pregnant woman into the Coffee Shop for 5 am shifts when she had severe morning sickness. She was late for every single one of her shifts delaying customers from getting food and coffee.

3756,Wegmans Food Markets,"Amazing company, but little opportunity for growth",2014-09-02,3.0,Customer Service,"I worked at Wegmans for two years in their Sub Shop/Coffee departments. Some of the pros of working there are:
Free food (almost all the time!) 
Wegmans actually cares about their employees, unlike most companies nowadays
Good benefits
Friendly and emphatic management (for the most part)
Flexible with scheduling, especially around school schedules
40 cent raise every 6 months, including vacation pay and show for dough
Overall a fun place to work!! Especially around holidays and Christmas.
Will hold onto your job if going away to school, have other obligations etc. Good with time off","Almost little to NO opportunity for growth. If you want to move to a different department, best of luck to you. I literally applied to 7-10 different departments over the course of two years (and keep in mind, my availablity was open and I seldomly showed up late to work or called off) and got turned down for all of them for no apparent reason. Favoritism also has a lot to do with this, but this is just from my personal expirence. 
Constant interaction with customers and coworkers can be exhausting (On the other hand, if you like to be around people all the time, this job is definitely for you)
No employee discounts
Rude customers can sometimes outweigh the nice ones
Always seem to be short staffed, meaning long hours and being called into work a lot. I've had many coworkers work 7-12 days in a row before getting days off."

-Transferring departments is a pain. I'm in the process of a transfer. Not only will my current department manager not speak to me. The way it was handled was completely childish.
-No store discount for employees. Yet they are constantly sending coupons and deals to customers. 
-Nepotism. Managers play favorites regarding employees. Some can get away with everything(showing up late, constant call outs, not showing up for work) while others are reprimanded. 
-Long hours on feet.
-Mixing business with pleasure. So many Wegmans employees date or are married. In turn it gives other employees the idea it is professionally acceptable(As in pursuing a romance with a fellow coworker who isn't interested) There have been plenty of male coworkers that I had to blantently ignore for them to get the point I don't pursue work romances. 
This also relates back to nepotism. Also, they are very open about their relationships in front of fellow coworkers and customers(Hand holding, kissing, hugging whilst in uniform). I don't understand Wegmans policy on this, but at my previous employers relationships between management and employees was strictly prohibited due to conflict of interest. In my opinion I feel this should be addressed as to what's appropriate, and what's not."

If the store manager likes you you are set, if they don't, they won't fire you,  but they will pound on you until you quite.  There are some really good store managers, and there are some that have no business being in management.  Lots of politics.  And if you work overnights good luck, because they are especially brutal.  They will expect you to do a certain amount of stuff in an almost unreasonable amount of time.  Everyone overnight is timed.  The expectation is to hit a certain goal, and will scream at you if you don't hit it.  They will keep you until noon when you start at midnight if the load is not done.  They will tell you they want you to manage and they don't want you to stock shelves, yet because they hire you an 80 year old lady for stocking shelves, you have to to make up for what they don't.  On the plus side, when they keep you till noon, you are getting overtime and there have been times when they actually pay you time and a half to pull product forward on the shelf, something a part time getting paid a little over minimum wage can do.  

Best example of disrespect,  I once started work at 8pm, waited for management to come in at 8am,  instead of sending me home, the assistant store manager made me sit in his office while he finished writing personal checks to pay his personal bills.  Then walked me around the entire store until 10am asking me about every single out of stock item."

Two week required notice for requests off or availability changes. For some unknown reason FT's seem to have to do less work than PT's. FT's do the bare minimum while PT's come in each shift and are given a whole list of things to do that could've been done by the FT's that are there 40+ hours a week!
3789,Wegmans Food Markets,Great Company to Work for!!,2014-07-10,5.0,Front End Coordinator,The company involvement on employee development and encouragement.  Family environment for customers as well as for employees.  Increasing commitments to organic and local produce and grocery items.,Hiring Managers from within does not always keep fresh ideas and people flowing through the organization.
3790,Wegmans Food Markets,Great 1st job,2014-07-08,4.0,Cashier,Wegmans is a great company for younger teens and college students looking to work part-time. The schedules are very flexible and it's easy to find another person to cover or switch shifts with you. For college students who go away to school they are always welcoming of you when you come back for winter or summer breaks.,"There isn't a lot of growth in the company unless they think you're going to be there ""for life"", otherwise you will stay within your department until you eventually leave or go through a higher-up to get your transferred to a different department."

3793,Wegmans Food Markets,"What was once a great company to work for, has now changed drastically",2014-07-07,3.0,,"Incredibly flexible work hours, simplified, easy work, happy environment with lots of different people to get to know, customers and co-workers included. You feel more a part of the community and it's the kind of company you can be proud to say you work for in public.","They have changed their ideals and their benefit structure to compensate for their massive southern / eastern expansion areas. Full-time jobs in the Rochester Area are becoming a near-impossibility to get, because all of the employees who went down to help expand new markets now want to move back home, and they are given the full-time positions in Rochester first.

The store has also made a move to value front-end management over all of their departments. The food is shipped in frozen and each department simply assembles ingredients according to a chart and prepares them to be sold. Therefore, Wegmans does not feel a need to put people in management positions who are skilled at the type of department they are in. Let's say you went to culinary school to be a pastry chef, and you work in the Bakery. You will not be valued as a leader, you will be valued as a worker, but not considered for promotion. They have begun to put people who learned how to manage cashiers and helping hands workers in positions where they run a perishable food department. 

This is frustrating for workers because they have to teach their supervisors how to do the work in the department. I saw first-hand some people who had went to school for culinary arts get turned down for a management position repeatedly, only for Service Team Leaders to get the position. This has caused a lot of staffing problems and has lowered worker morale across the board, which is becoming more and more noticeable each time you visit the store as a customer."

It was/is a fun working environment.,One problem i had with working for Wegmans was that around any holidays it was difficult to get time off.

Management is also really good at playing to employee strengths. For example, I love to interact with people, so I frequently demo.","Sometimes the clientele are a little bit rude.

I feel like the pay could be higher but I know that they do do pay raises frequently. I have never been denied time requested off so that is convenient.,"No store benefits and I'm not really sure why. Training seemed to take forever but I still got paid the same rate for it so I guess it isn't that big of a deal. At the Wegmans that I work at it is very frustrating that some sectors of the store are very lax about their jobs and ignore customers even when they know that they are there. Because of this, people from other parts of the store have to pick up the slack and serve those customers."

3853,Wegmans Food Markets,Great to shop at; not so great to work for.,2014-04-14,3.0,Customer Service,"Overall they do provide decent benefits, but their main strength is in flexible scheduling for their employees. Some managers are wonderful to work with and truly believe in the core values of Wegmans, which is putting their employee's first and making sure customers always get incredible customer service. 

I have amazing coworkers and they are what have kept me in the company so long.","For this company, it really matter which store you are located in and in what division/state. They are strong proponents of the ""Who We Are Values"" which are either lauded or completely forgone by management. 

When I first started with this company eight years ago, there was a completely different culture. Management truly listened to their employees and followed through on their core values to promote teamwork and diversity. Nowadays, that is a thing of the past. Their emphasis on the ""team"" used to be a thing that made people want to work for them, but now if you don't conform to their thinking, you are considered a problem. You are also not considered a team player if you ask simple question of why. Don't ever ask why.  All they want to see is a smile and nod. 

I have seen rampant abuses of favoritism in my store and if you are not ""in"" with upper management, you will have no hope to grow within the company. Instead they will lie to your face or completely ignore you. I will stress that this is not the same in every store, but everyone had seemed to turn a blind eye to it in mine, and continues to do so. 

I am fortunate that I do not need to rely on this company for healthcare and other benefits, but I truly feel sorry for those people who do. In order to get healthcare as a part-time employee within the store you need to work an average of 30 hours a week (up from 24 last year). This would not be a problem except that the departments are being told to cut hours and don't have them available. Then they tell employees to look in other departments, except they have also cut their hours. So, how would you like part-time employees to gain those hours back? There is rarely anyway to fulfill your weekly average with the new WIG goals and employees are left wondering when coverage will be dropped for them."

Lots of nepotism, favoritism and general unfairness. Have felt personally abused by management and mistreated on multiple occasions. This was due to management not following policies and expectations set by Wegmans, but probably mild inconveniences compared to other companies/ comparable positions. That being said, when switched to the bakery I no longer felt like crying every day on my way to and from work. All in all this is still a great company to work for, though hard to advance in."

The pay is usually better than minimum wage.,"The higher ups usually know less than you, or are less competent and do less. If you work at At bigger Wegman Stores , you are usually treated horribly by customers, and Wegmans policy makes it okay for them to treat you like you are worth literally nothing. As a prepared food worker the pay is not worth the amount of effort and criticism you must put up with. No matter how hard you work or the amount of effort you put in, you will not be recognized for it. I go out of my way to make sure everything is done properly and looks above standards, yet no one cares to notice. There are many times when I get stuck alone in my department, which gets busy fast. On top of getting stuck alone I'm asked to do multiple things at once with no help from Chefs, or Management. They think its okay to shout things at you while you are in the middle of helping a customer and preparing something though. They make things so much more difficult too by adding in procedures you must do without taking into consideration how difficult it is to multi task in a hectic environment. You will be over scheduled. Many employees in my area get fired, or leave because he treatment is so awful that they just can't take it, or HR hires people who are terrible at doing anything because they don't care about making a good fit. The new scheduling system is terrible as well. They said you would have to schedule two weeks in advance, which you actually realize is false. You will realize it is more like three weeks in advance. If something comes up that you have to do you are basically screwed. Changing your availability takes even longer, which you usually have to do a month in advance. Benefits have gone completely down hill. You get better treatment from customers and management being a waitress in a busy restaurant. There is no room for advancement. Not worth the trouble. I also heard that some of the higher ups make around 50,000-200,000 a year (in-store employees), which seeing the amount of work they do not do makes me sick."

Be advised; other then a select few tokens from Mass, all you will be given is an entry level dead end job, empty promises along with contradicting reasons why you can't move up.  All the good jobs are saved for those working with Wegmans from New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey (in that order).  Those of us from Mass are just Native Help to fill in a holes and the bottom jobs.
* To a older works (over 30) forget about it.  Unless for example you want to work for a 23 year old Department manager that yells at you at the top of her lungs in front of co-workers and customers alike, throws meat or other objects at you, undermines any attempt to move up; worst thing, she is also unable to teach you a thing, because she does not know the first thing about cutting meat let alone managing a staff.  But don't worry you won't have to put up with this forever, her parents work for the company and she is from New York, she just got promoted to a new store and department.  Older works; it does not matter, even if you have worked years in the field of retail foods - you've got a least two strikes against you; your from Mass and you are older then 30."

Hired for Night Stock Grocery, placed in Dairy Department with no concern over health (relocated from Florida for this so-called great career opportunity). Lost 30 lbs and was sick on and off for three months. On the job injuries at a high level due to safety neglect. Co-worker wears face mask due to mold in dairy cooler that has been ignored. Worked every weekend for over a year with no ability to take even 1 weekend time off. Once you're on night shift, your stuck there (EVERY co-worker I worked with was turned down at advancing with Wegmans). No sick time available.

It truly is a great place to shop and offers an awesome selection of products.,"The customers. As a job, I have come to dread it. I've worked in three different departments over the span of 6 years. I am a recent college graduate, and was fortunate to be able to work at Wegmans over school breaks and summer. Now that I am done with school, I cannot wait until I am able to quit Wegmans and move on. The customers are some of the rudest people I have ever dealt with. Some days it is very hard to project the happy, proud image Wegmans wants us to, when we are berated by customers."
3957,Wegmans Food Markets,The Emperor's clothes sure have a lot of sequins.,2013-08-21,2.0,Maintenance,"In a city which has been ravaged by both anti-productive and anti-worker practices, Wegmans is a beacon of mediocre light shining down on us, constantly reminding us that they have paid substantial amounts of money to be named The Best Company to Work For, a useless and self-congratulatory title if there ever was one. 

If you are lucky enough to receive a full-time position, then you can cite some competent benefits, but that is a difficult status to attain with so many people vying for them, and so few openings. 

How about a real pro of working at Wegmans? ...Well at least they're not Wal-Mart or another corporate giant that aggressively sticks employees at minimum wage.

They also are slightly more respectful of work-life balance, but my experience only comes from their working around my college schedule. And how many companies can say that the CEO regularly stops by--and wearing a sequined vest, no less?","Making, at most as a part-time employee, $2 over minimum wage, isn't really much better. The constant self-satisfaction from the corporate heads and the company's in house PR team tend to grow resentment amongst employees who are skeptical of the company's actual merits. 

For those who say that part-timers also receive some benefits, you should look more closely. All but a select few part-timers, and none that I'm aware of at my store, receive them. Your manager(s) will work diligently to ensure that you never exceed points where you would begin receiving benefits. You will likely be capped at an average of 24 hours per week to distance your annual hours from the health care, vacation time, and other alleged part-time benefits flaunted to many a worker."

3974,Wegmans Food Markets,My Wegmans Experience,2013-06-30,3.0,Full-Time,"The best thing about Wegmans is their ability to hire genuinely nice people. Even though I would get mad about different things about the job, my co-workers kept me wanting to come back. The majority of people working there are very sweet and you really grow to care about each other, after a while it does feel like a ""family"".

The training process was awesome and the knowledge you gain about your certain area is pretty impressive. I've gained so much knowledge that I know I'll use for a lifetime.


I would definitely recommend Wegmans for a person looking for a part-time job. I may even go back later in life and work there part-time. Full-time, however, is a different story.","Wegmans preaches that everyone has such a great opportunity to move up in the company, but I found that wasn't true. Upper management picked people they previously worked with at another store for all higher positions. If someone friendly with upper management applied for a position, it seemed they would always get the position over another candidate. Upper management (especially the store manager) is super fake nice but doesn't really want to get to know anyone new which is irritating. It's so obvious that they are trying to make Malvern into their old store

The schedule (for full time) is ridiculous. Everyday your schedule is totally different, so much so that your life literally revolves around working at Wegmans and honestly you aren't paid enough to have your life revolving around Wegmans!  I understand that all shifts need to be covered but if Employee 1 has kids and likes to be out early and Employee 2 would rather sleep in and work the evening shift, why couldn't the manager make a schedule that accommodates both people? It seems the motto is ""This is wegmans, we work crazy hours, Deal with it!"" I think employees would be MUCH happier if the manager could sit with employees and see if they could work out a somewhat regular schedule while still covering all shifts.

Also, seriously can't Danny Wegman afford to give full-time employees lunch maybe just once a week? Or a $5 card towards lunch? How about some sort of discount around the holidays? That would really mean a lot. A coupon once in a while is okay but I think the employees deserve more!!!"
3975,Wegmans Food Markets,Great  hourly job for retired worker or students.,2013-06-30,3.0,Cashier Front End,The stores are clean and well organized.Management tries to work with the associates available times.Cross training in different sections is a  great reason if you look for advance in the store.,Working holidays and weekends.As a front end cashier you never get to attend the stretches that are so much pushed by Wegmans management to help with injuries to the back or shoulders.Sometimes the front end supervisor forget you have a break coming.And the break system is if working 5 hrs.you get a 15min paid break but working 6hrs. the cashier has to take a 30 min.lunch and this is not paid.

3980,Wegmans Food Markets,"No company is perfect, but Wegmans is closer than any I've worked for",2013-06-06,5.0,Distribution Manager,"Wegmans is a company that actually believes in the values it preaches about doing the right thing for people, allowing a work/life balance, and placing family needs above your work when needed.  Seemingly anywhere you go with this company you find kind, supportive folks to engage you and willingly offer to help you.  Most people who work for Wegmans realize what a unique company it is and the benefits of a place that really cares about the individual and treats people the right way.

Wegmans is privately held but the family that owns it takes a salary and reinvests the remaining profits back into the company.  This means steady, manageable growth without the ""profits or perish"" approach required for a publicly traded company.  There are 3-4 new stores opened each year in growing markets, and plenty of room for advancement through a steady stream of new job openings in virtually all business units.","The low pressure, seek-to-understand management that is prevalent in this company can be great for the individual, but also means the performance of bottom performers is often overlooked or ignored completely.  Though the company can make rapid changes when needed or useful, some large-scale decisions are made by a select group at the top and don't always factor in advice from lower rungs of the organization.  This leads to some inefficiencies that are difficult if impossible to overcome, and some of these decisions last for years.  This also may be attributed to the privately held status of the company, as there is little incentive to remove these inefficiencies if your budget is acceptable."

Not a Union, no union dues

Lots of people say the pay, but I started out just above minimum wage and got a 25 cent raise every 6 months if approved by management. in know means bad pay, but should definitely have better starting salary and raises then low level jobs at stores like ACME and Genuardi's, who bring in a lot less revenue","Wegmans gives off that lovey dovey, ""we're family"" and ""everyone's equal and given opportunities.""  However, once you work there, you realize that's not the case.
Very sporadic schedule, would work 25 hours one week, then be scheduled for 4.5 the next week, then maybe 20 the next week, always different days too, no sense of when you will work. (I'm a high school student and one week my schedule was Thursday 4-9, Friday 4-9 30, Saturday 6AM-1PM, Sunday 5 30 AM-1 30PM)
Breaks are awful, you get ONE 10 MINUTE break unless you work more than 5.5 hours, in which you get a 30 minute lunch. Not to mention the most common shift for part timers was 5.5hours.
Absolutely no discounts whatsoever. I realize that the company doesn't HAVE to give discounts, but cmon seriously? Most stores give some discount, (Lots that serve food include a free lunch), we work our butts off because the store is always busy, and things like the prepared foods are such high profit margin (eg 8.99 per pound for hot Lo mein noodles, $3.29+tax for 1 slice of pizza) that giving some sort of discount would be nice considering that the company wouldn't really be losing money, maybe just make 4x profit margin on employees rather than the 5 or 6x on customers.

MANAGEMENT AND FAVORITISM
This part of the cons needs its own section. Wegmans paints themselves as a company that has ""equal opportunity and treatment for everyone."" This is NOT the case. I like that Wegmans employees arent unionized, thus not promoted through just experience. However, I think it's awful that people who work hard for years at the company see no sort of promotion while some half-ass worker whose a kid gets promoted to coordinator within a year because they're part of the ""clique"" scene of middle management (yes this specifically happened at the store I worked for). In addition, management favors certain employees in almost all aspects. During a 10 minute break (often the only one you get after standing for 3 hours) some cashiers will be scolded for coming back a minute or two over ten minutes while it seems others were free to walk around the store and do whatever they want for half an hour or more. I recall a specific event where the lines were all 3 people per line (that's the maximum) and the girl next to me just turns off her light and says, ""I'm getting a drink"" then doesn't return for about half an hour, leaving me and the other cashiers to deal with the overflow of customers. The discipline: Me and the other cashiers were told to ""step it up"" and ""get the people going faster.""
There is a lot of management that oversees the front end (cash registers/accounting/carts) There are 2 Department Managers, 5 Team Leaders, and about 5 Coordinators. These people seem to do the least amount of work as anybody. They usually stand around the store talking and eating and drinking coffee. They really only have to tell us which registers to go to and answer when we page them to our register. Often times this can be a task in of itself to try to get someone to help you out when you page them. I would only page when there was a problem I knew that I could not do without managers codes, however lots of times when I would page, none of them would answer even if I saw them standing in a group laughing about something, in which I have to resort to shouting to one of them to come over, all the while the customer is giving me the death stare. I also find it odd that there are times when you page and literally NOBODY is to be found. NONE of the 10 people there in charge, often leaving you to dry with the angry customer. The only times you really see FE management doing anything, or more often pretending to, is when superiors are around."

4023,Wegmans Food Markets,Great career opportunities and continuous improvement support,2013-01-12,5.0,Front End,"After over two years of working at Wegmans I have began to get the feel of how great the company really is.  If you are willing to commit yourself to work at a fast-paced but friendly environment you will continually grow as an employee.  Wegmans is also very flexible with availabilities.  If you are short scheduled, you can ask for more hours and depending on how open your availability is, they are more than likely to call you.  The extra hours plus the show for dough is very beneficial.",The only one of two miniscule things I can critique about are that breaks can be a bit too short when you have loads of stuff to take care of.  If they extend breaks from 10-15  minutes it will relieve stress for the cashiers so they can get their stuff done and come back once they are done.  The other problem I have is the No Drinks at register policy.  They should make an exception to bottled water to keep at the registers because during the busy shifts the only time that we can make a run to the drinking fountain or the drink station is when there are no customers in our aisle.  Sometimes a rush can last over two hours and sometimes cashiers can get a little bit dehydrated.  Having bottled water at the registers can help cashiers greatly so that they can be able to continue to provide incredible service to our customers.

If you are full-time, it's a pretty good job with good benefits.","Being part-time is pretty terrible.  They give priority to full-timers, especially those that have been there a long time.  Also, the longer you have been there (some employees have been there since the store opened), it seems as if the more you can get away with (taking excessive breaks, taking long breaks, meandering around the store while talking to people in other departments, putting off work, etc.).  There are definite cliques within the store that help to contribute to this laziness and rule-breaking.  

Some managers work hard, but most just stand around, drinking coffee and talking to each other.  When higher-ups managers from other stores or corporate come to visit for one reason or another, they're very good at looking busy.

The company likes to say that they have an open-door policy when it comes to going to your manager with questions, concerns, and comments, but often times, your manager acts as if you're annoying or bothering them.

The company also portrays itself as a good company for upward movement, saying you can work your way up through the company.  Based on my experience and what I've heard from coworkers, it's near impossible, especially if someone above you dislikes you for any reason.

The company has made some recent changes to the healthcare program that seem to be negatively affecting a lot of people."

With only 2 exceptions, the supervisors (coordinators) literally stand around talking, go grab coffee, talk on the company phones to friends/family.  The managers (service team leaders) are much worse.  They stand there staring into space, sit in the office reading emails or talking to each other, etc - except when the front end manager is there or they see the store manager walking around.  The morale among cashiers is SO low - everyone is looking for another job.  We will sometimes be so busy and they're just standing there watching, laughing, talking, drinking soda and coffee.

Flexible scheduling makes this a great job for college and high school students. What's there to complain about a $1,500 scholarship? The management internship program is a great way to move up in the company to a Team Leader position. It's paid, and is guaranteed full time for the 3 years. Wegmans makes a point to hire from within whenever possible, meaning, in general, there's always going to be an opportunity to move up the totem pole. Upper management does a great job to make employees feel welcome and empowered.","For the division I work in (Rochester), if you want to grow in the company, you have to relocate to a New Market division. One of the jobs I do (Bottle Room attendant) is quite possibly the most disgusting jobs I've ever done. This wouldn't be so bad if I were trained and able to work the service desk as well (like management implied when they asked me if I was interested in cross-training to the bottle room), like every other Wegmans in New York does. Unfortunately, bottle returns are all I do. With that said, employee retention in the department is low.  The team leaders I deal with tend to micro-manage more frequently than a department manager would. It can make working very unpleasant."

4075,Wegmans Food Markets,You get what you put in to this company.,2012-06-26,5.0,Cashier,"Lovely company, we have an amazing reputation. Coming from a younger person still going through college, I'm never embarassed of telling people I work in a grocery store. I love working here. Although from other reviews I've seen people bothered by managment favoring certain people, my advice: managment will only notice you if you notice them, say hi, have a conversation, get to know them, it never hurts. 
We get payed very well for our area. Plus we get payed weekly, whenever we need a day off or need to call out, we are always heard, I've never had a problem with asking for a day off.
I love my coworkers, everyone is always very friendly, upper managment is very approachable, I'm very fond of  our store manager, the front end manager, and the STLs. The other cashiers are very nice, and we are very well trained.
I love that our uniforms are very versatile, any color polo we'd like, short or long sleeve, and black or tan pants.
Although we don't get discounts, there are a ton of opportunities to go through brand training and get coupons for free wegmans brand items.
Not unionized! in grocery stores, unions are a pain. Yes they show you that awkward 70's style ""evil union"" video, but honestly, I'm happy the way the store is now, and I wouldn't like it better with a union down our backs.","Fair warning, as a cashier, you're constantly moving, it's incredibly tiring, after 3-4 back to back 8 hour shifts, all I want to do is sleep.
Schedules are always posted last minute, VERY last minute, it happens often you get your weekly schedule 3 days before it begins.
Please please please implement a discount for prepared foods, I love getting lunch at work, but it would be amazing if we could get a discount... trust me the by-weight foods add up, you can easily spend $12 on a lunch (that's approx 1.5 hours work for me after taxes.)"

4079,Wegmans Food Markets,Working for Wegmans is way over-hyped.  Disappointed!,2012-06-06,2.0,Cook III,"Health Benefits are good.
Friendly co-workers.","---Anytime Availability --- 
Beware of this!!!  Your life will literally revolve around your Wegmans work schedule if hired under ""full-time w/anytime availability"".  Be prepared to work a weekly schedule with hours and scheduled days off that change more often than the weather.  If the ""Eat, Sleep, Work"" lifestyle is for you, then go for it, but if you are involved in any type of clubs/activities, etc in your spare time, be ready to miss a lot of these meetings/functions when working for Wegmans.  It's very difficult to plan anything in your personal life unless you know of it months and months in advance.

---Cook III & II positions in the Prepared Foods Department --- 
Wegmans says the ideal candidates will posses an Associate's or Bachelor's degree in Culinary Arts, plus have hospitality industry working experience.  Wow, doesn't that make it sound like a very interesting, exciting, challenging, good-paying job to all the hospitality educated/experienced people out there?? It sure sounded like it would be great to me -  but believe me, it's not.  If you know how to cook pasta, chop/steam vegetables, re-heat left overs to proper temperature, and would rather work with pre-made commissary food items, then you are good to go.  Very minimal cooking from scratch takes place during the course of the day.  In all actuality, the job duties for these positions don't require any of the advanced cooking skills and techniques that are learned in culinary schools or in nice restaurants.  A decent Home-Cook has more than enough skills to do the Cook III & II job, but unfortunately, would never get hired because of no working experience in a professional kitchen.  To be quite honest, I think all Wegmans is really after when looking at candidates to hire for Cooks is the ServSafe Certification that comes along with having a degree in the hospitality field, a good personality, great customer service skills, and the willingness to work crazy anytime hours at a low hourly pay rate.  Talented individuals with above average or advanced culinary knowledge & skills who are looking to work for a place that will let them ""flex"" their creative muscles and showcase their cooking skills, will more than likely get very bored with the limitations and ""franchise restaurant"" like feel the Wegmans culinary departments have to them.  Things don't get any more exciting for the higher salaried type positions like Sous Chef or Store Chef either, the Corporate Chefs in Rochester are the ones who run the show."
4080,Wegmans Food Markets,Needs to be unionized,2012-06-04,3.0,Customer Service,"Wegmans really allows a lot of slack for it's employees, and makes it very difficult for someone to actually get fired. As a student, the wegmans scholarship was an incredible perk. The bi-annual raise is pretty great- 25 cents each 6 months.","Because of the 25 cent guaranteed raise, there really is no incentive to do anymore work beyond the  required. As a part time employee, whenever I went ""above and beyond"" I never received any acknowledgement. And I realized by year two of working with the company it's much easier to just do what's expected of you and simply float under the radar. I know wegmans employees have a reputation of being ""so helpful"" but I always figured there's no point, and I would treat customers as little annoyances. I never received any compliments when I was super helpful, and I've never received any complaints when I was just stand-offish.
At the end of the day Wegmans is a grocery store, and it's not fun working in a grocery store. Part time jobs consist of doing the same thing over and over again. And customers seem to take advantage of wegmans ""niceness"" by always trying to get free things and complaining about anything possible to get their butt kissed.
At the end of the day, though, the worst thing about Wegmans is its complete fear to unionize. They are NOT a family run business anymore. This company is much too big. Employees need to be protected more. Although wegmans managed to brain-wash most of its full-time employees into thinking unions are the bad guys with weird videos, employees need to realize that they are at the whim of their employer, and nothing is guaranteed. Employees receive very little frill benefits from Wegmans beyond a free coupon every now and then, and frankly, with the amount of money wegmans is making, more of it should be going to it's employees... and not to all these frivolous sponsorships and community donations. I understand Wegmans is a huge PR machine, but they neglect their employees more than I think the employees realize. 
And basically everyone complains of rampant  favoritism in the company. Even though there are obligatory job postings, upper management usually already knows who they want- and everyone knows that. The only way this can be put to an end is if union officials can monitor the process.

4118,Wegmans Food Markets,Depending on your location - great place to work,2011-11-10,4.0,Cashier,"Scheduling is flexible and accommodates student hours. Clean, inviting atmosphere compared to any other supermarket. Very competent management. Good perks such as Customer Compliment Coupons (Free bagels, coffee, pizza, etc)","If you live in an area where jobs are scarce you will have some lackluster co-workers. Some simply do not care about their jobs and treat every customer quite lazily. Obviously as a Cashier the job gets tedious after a while. You may be called to work on other jobs like stocking, deli, etc, if that bothers you."
