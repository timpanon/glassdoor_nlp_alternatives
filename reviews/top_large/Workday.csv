14,Workday,Boy’s club,2022-04-02,2.0,Senior Account Manager,"Decent product; however, support is lacking.","While WD speaks a big game about value and and belonging, you have to look far and wide to find any diversity in sales management. The boy’s club is alive and well. 

Serious lack of leadership across the board. Company and culture is really keen on talking about making the place a great place to work; however, when corrective action is required, management simply does not know how to manage. 

HR is a bit of a joke - all good folks, but no influence. 

As a company, there’s a lot of lip service given about employee welfare - yet at every turn, they have fallen in line with the woke agenda. The utter lack of support for employee health is troubling. Follow the science people; folks who’ve had COVID are protected. The vaccine mandates are intrusive."

They took away $7,000 in PSRU stock and tried to cover it up like we are dumb. They claim to do market adjustments but that’s never been do.

- Really friendly and smart people
- Great company culture and WLB
- Comp is fairly competitive, with yearly automatic bonuses and refreshers and ESPP

This is the kind of company you can see yourself staying at your entire career.","- Things in enterprise software are slower, so product development doesn't have a ""ship fast and often"" and ""break things"" mentality

42,Workday,"Good work life balance, at cost of below industry standard pay",2022-03-22,4.0,Software Development Engineer II,"They care about their employees & their culture
Many teams at Workday allows for inter company mobility
Good leadership at the C suite level, company direction & growth is great","Below industry standard salary
Most good young engineers leave within a few years because company refuses to pay industry standard (something a lot of companies do that I will never understand, continuity & product knowledge is worth so much)

Promotions are slow to go to the deserving, years at the company is the primary factor. Promotion cycles in general are slow & locked to semi-yearly cycles 

Middle management is murky, not straightforward/honest/realistic about pay structures and hiring practices. Seems as though they are coached to not be transparent

Too much bureaucracy & too many meetings. Lost its startup feel & development can be slow paced at times

Very political about letting employees work remote, very few exceptions granted

Not really allowing remote work"
43,Workday,Turning into the competition,2022-03-21,2.0,Sales,The product is decent and there are some good teammates.,"Where to begin?  The company is more interested in national / global politics than in the company itself. If you are a leftist, this is the place for you. If not, then you will find yourself embarrassed to work here with their constant spouting off on whatever DNCC talking point they receive. 

Pay is mediocre at best.  OTE has not increased in about 10 years (if ever) so there are plenty of other places where the pay is better. They talk about RSUs but those get significantly smaller every year to the point now of barely noticeable.  

Product is still decent but they no longer innovate — except by acquisition which is generally the sign of a company past its prime. The Power of 1 (which used to be a differentiator) is long gone and they have become the same “Frakensoftware”  for which they used to criticize competitors."

All the jobs I've held have had a direct impact on our customer base","VERY liberal management team regularly tells us what to think, which causes to get behind, and even what to inject into our bodies if we want to fully participate in the company.  

Too much focus on DEI and not enough focus on producing world-class software.  People walk on eggshells for fear of offending someone.  Where we used to have bonding chit chat at the beginning of meetings we now just get down to business. 

Aneel has found great success being aligned with the controversial Davos Agenda, billionaires summer camp, and other high-tech movers and shakers.  These organizations lack ethics and were not elected by we the people, yet they believe they should be shaping a globalist future for all countries of the world.

In general, people genuinely want to collaborate and approach problems with positive ""we can figure it out"" rather than blame and finger pointing.","Product delivery is incredibly slow. Despite all the marketing hype, many areas of the product are many years behind the competition and at risk of falling further behind. 

The corporate culture and direction from senior leadership has noticeably deteriorated in recent years to be more aligned with the Woke narrative. A single monolithic narrative is actually the reverse of an inclusive culture where everyone feels valued.

When Workday announced its covid vaxx mandate for all workers, the email was like a kick in the teeth. Upload your vaxx card by X date or you will be terminated. The message was completely counter to the employee first message that Workday tries to promote. Workday's position on vaxx mandate is based on ""we want people to feel safe."" Decisions should be based on data, not emotion. Also the Workday from years ago would have said that employee's personal health data should remain private and should never be required to be shared to the company."

- no formal performance reviews","- some projects expect you to be available 24/7 and on call
- working with lots of different time zones, can have multiple meetings a week after 5PM
- PTO impacts utilization > impacts bonuses; leadership always wants people 100% utilized 
- pipeline of new work seems to be slowing down, this means you can be on 5-6 clients at one time with a few hours each week for them (but they all think they are #1 priority)

Forces employees to obtain Jab to keep the job even after its been blocked by a court decision. Violates 10th amendment. Violates 1st amendment by asking employees to detail religious beliefs as an excuse that the Employer can use to discriminate against employees, stating that an employee cannot be jabbed because of deeply held religious values and beliefs is all you need to know. Violates Medical Privacy laws by asking intimate health questions and presumably making employment decisions based on those. 

Workday touts that they want a diverse workforce but they are about to loose all of their diversity right out the door to companies who truly do put employees first ( like Oracle - who was the first competitor to stand up for its employees rights ).

Benefits are good, healthcare, pension etc …

If you are a white middle aged man your career progression should be a lot easier than anyone else","Biased organisation where leadership is at 3/4 white male. Whilst Workday is saying they are working towards a more diverse, equitable and inclusive leadership culture, make no mistake, there are very few tangible actions to get there and bias is so deeply engrained that it will take years to shift that culture.

Underrepresented groups have never been better labelled. The percentage of underrepresented groups leaders is so small that you could count it on one hand. Workday promised to improve their diversity at leadership level, but still recruit the same profiles again and again. 

This is a highly political organisation where almost all decisions are taken at the top and cascaded down.  This results in late actions on field issues and often a solution not being fit for the original problem we are trying to solve for. This also results in individual contributors not being empowered to make decisions without getting the series of approval they need first (too much trouble for most of us).

I believe there is a good intent towards people but at the end of the day you are just an employee number. The off-boarding (after resigning) was terrible and took weeks to respond despite them not doing due diligence to the process."

Overworked is an understatement. Very little work life balance is offered. Even during COVID, people were overworked and then scolded when the company felt like there was a decrease in productivity - demonstrating very little sympathy for people attempting to perform their job while managing children doing virtual school. They use this as a continual excuse to not follow the industry in becoming a predominantly virtual company and telling everyone they will have to go back to the office (this keeps getting pushed off because of CDC recommendations, but remains their goal). Meanwhile, their profits are up, their stock is up, but most people only got cost of living raises this year. They're giving out less and less stock, despite their ever-increasing profits. 
They push political views via company email and attempt to brand it as something everyone must agree with. Unprofessional political opinions are openly shared at the executive level and during company meetings that have little to nothing to do with the business. 
Entirely too much internal promoting, resulting in a large percentage of upper management and key leadership that does not have the experience or mentorship to make the right decisions for the business, resulting in many lost opportunities. Success is hinged far more on a good economy and very little industry competition than high level leadership."

There is plenty of career frameworks and tracks for everyone’s ambitions. Expectations for each role are clear and how promotions happen as well. 

There are a lot of people working in tech which leads to a lot of code being code and shipped on the releases. 

Lots of hiring and the ration of direct reporta is healthy. Work life balance was the best.

Comp package was really good with the stocks. Benefits also really good.","Culture somewhat diluted with all the hiring in last 5 years. A few bad apples can be really toxic and ruin it. Hard to deal with and harder to turn around.

Xpresso is sold as a proper development tech, and despite the advantages it locks developers down to non transferable skills and to a good comp package. That makes it near impossible to move to another company and compete with other candidates that have industry standard skills. 

Career moves into more senior roles is often linked to a magic opportunity or luck of being in the right place in time. Lots of hiring from the outside for senior roles but not enough promotion from within."

Office and amenities are good.,"Despite the core values on the front page of their website and talked about openly nearly every day you are an employee, I found Workday to be lacking in Integrity and putting Employees First. From the integrity standpoint, in our office there was an individual who was clearly bullying and intimidating others on the team. This individual was reported to management and HR multiple times by multiple people and absolutely no changes were made. In fact, on more than one occasion, when reports were made the reporters were intimidated by management and it was made clear that these reports were not welcome. As for employees first, this is a top down management organization. Despite the talk of collaboration and inclusivity, the day to day is not in the team's hands. It is dictated by management. Finally, there is a severe lack of Human Resources support compared to other organizations I've been in. Finding someone to talk to about HR-related matters was difficult and is clearly a part of the problem."

The reality is a terrible place to work. I've had more co-workers quit, have nervous breakdowns or just walk out crying than any place I've seen.

Not all orgs in the company are treated the same. Favoritism and politics are definitely a thing. Lots of discrimination (blatant and microaggressive) that’s just sweet under the rug. Also, full-time WFH policies are continuing to be super restricted for no clear reason, and that’s been the last straw for a lot of people.

Things like an enhanced snack program, matching charitable contributions, and decent health insurance keep Workday a competitive employer.","A lot has changed over the years, and it hasn’t really been for the better. In Workday’s growth it has struggled to keep the experience the same for all employees. Managers have so much control over their subordinate’s Workday experience that many rule like they’re kings of tiny hills. In my time here I’ve witnessed managers cut salaries when subordinates moved 50miles away (but still within the Bay Area), managers insist that subordinates checkin on slack before going to the restroom, and managers creating jobs and hiring their friends to fill them.  This type of behavior is just plain sad, Workday is supposed to be better than this."

414,Workday,Great Company but watch out Graduate Application Developers.,2021-07-13,4.0,Applications Developer,"People were great, building was a fun place!

Compensation and package overall is good!

The summer/Christmas parties were unreal!

The company has quite an employee centric philosophy overall so it is a great place to work.

The proprietary language/stack has one benefit for graduate.
Amongst new hires from graduate to senior, everybody has to learn the new language and stack. If you can learn it quickly an excel in it, you can become more valuable than a more experienced person with less experience in the proprietary stack. This can help you gain more responsibility and become a leader :)

These are great benefits and workday is a great place overall.","Workday is ahead of the curve in many ways, but for me in these areas it was sub-par and something I believe that needs fixing. The following cons come not just from my own experience but also from other colleagues and friends within Wday.

The proprietary stack is a double edged sword for graduates.
1. You aren't working with current industry standard tech, or building skills that are easily generalisable to other roles. 
2. It can therefore feel like you've pigeon holed yourself. 
3. This can leave you with a weakspot for technical interviews with other companies in the future. 

Joining as a graduate can mean you are artificially held back this a notional timeline that dictates how fast you can advance, be promoted or have compensation adjusted. A common thing is that you cannot be promoted within a year of joining or within a year of your last promotion. Since evaluations are twice a year, realistically it can be 18 months before you can even be considered for promotion or advancement.

The counterpoint of this, is that new joiners can get an aggressive package. Someone with the same amount of experience as you can join later and receive a better compensation package. This can leave current employees feeling less valued. This also encourages churn.

This also means that opportunities are given to people based on time they've spent with the company rather than capability. Past contributions or current performance. can't trump time spent with company. This can lead to frustration within teams.

The best way to break out of standard timelines or seek a compensation adjustment is to find a new job, get an offer and let workday know that you have other options."

426,Workday,A culture of 'phoning it in',2021-07-04,2.0,Software Development Engineer II,"*** by and large defined by the team you're on
- ***WLB is great
- By-and-large, really solid benefits (401k, insurance, stock options, mat/pat leave)
- Lots of small random benefits (e.g. SF Giants tickets, or discount on some clothing line)
- A really solid infrastructure for Diversity (will elaborate in cons)
- ***A lot of interesting tech opportunities, due in part to the proprietary technology (if you're not in App-Dev). A good stepping stone, or place to settle in for awhile
- Generation Workday Tools Intern rotation is good college learning experience
- Generally speaking, chill people","- There really isn't much clear direction. Things are just kinda, happening, and maybe you're doing the important work or maybe you're in a pigeon-hole. Problems are usually re-orged into obscurity instead of addressed in any meaningful way. It's additionally really chaotic for developers with constantly changing team-structure and vision
- App-Dev (Applications Development): The proprietary language really does limit how much one learns in the role, and management knows that. The tech stack is diversifying, but expect to fight one another for the opportunities, which are far and few. Initiatives meant for developers keep getting led-along (maybe because of poor direction)
- Cash salary is low, for the scale of the company. Compensation primarily comes from stock packages that lock you in for X-number-of-years (I'll acknowledge that some individuals seek out stock)
- Leadership is AGGRESSIVELY anti-remote work, come post-covid (the phrase ""remote work will be rare"" is the common phrase)
- Diversity initiatives haven't gone much further than step 1. Lots of corporate infrastructure, resources, etc., but individual/team experience is really hit-or-miss
- App Dev Intern role is not a good college learning experience
- The ""Workday Culture"" is just, weird... leadership talks down a lot, like a paternal figure, stuck reminiscing about 'The Good Old Days' (from like, 4 years ago). Personality precedes performance, persistently, especially if you can be 'One of the bro's' (really bad in some depts). And in general, you feel like an outsider if you don't view your job as more than a job, and the psychological toll is real. The unfortunate thing is that this also includes your background, as well as personality. 

DONT GET ME WRONG. There are some AMAZING teams, who respect one another, foster psychological/emotional safety for all identities, and have a constant curiosity. There are some AMAZING managers who are focused on the person, not your output. However, there are as many teams who foster an exclusionary crony-culture that strives for image instead of meaningful work. And sometimes those things are just a re-org away."

- Seasoned people are leaving and management doesn't even try to hold onto them. Ironic, because they were the ones preserving Workday culture. In my first week my manager who had been at the company for 5 years left and I had nothing to do for months as my new manager dealt with the consequences.

This goes against your core values such as diversity and integrity. If you're friend and drinking buddy with your people leader or director you're likely to have their favors.

Competitive base salary 
The employee shares are the best I have heard
Fantastic perks 
Great holidays","Management and even directors pretend to care but simply don’t. They want you to do your job and nothing else, they don’t like suggestions and they don’t like ambitious people. For a modern tech company their support organisation is extremely old style hierarchical and are not willing to change. They are always implementing ways that can benefit them or the customer but not the employees. Most of my team are very unsatisfied and management simply don’t care. Employees do get to submit weekly reviews however their questions are very specific and don’t provide you any open style feedback. Management are very skilled at covering their tracks so if there is a complaint they can demonstrate their actions to show they acted accordingly to resolve a situation. 

The learning is beyond poor and the people in charge of that while are nice to deal with have no actual sense of the work as they have never even done it. The learning is vague and designed for implementation but not for troubleshooting. Due to this and the complexity of the products the learning times are drawn out. Then if employees leave management replace the headcount but you can be several months covering for them until the new replacement is up to speed. This has been extremely stressful as half of the team left but management don’t acknowledge there is an issue as they are hiring more people.

I will not recommend this organisation to anyone. And the directors or leaders of this organisation clearly don’t follow all of Workdays own core values. The first one being “employees”."

I belonged to a great team and had an amazing manager. Once he left things went downhill. A new manager was promoted to SR Manager mainly because this was the manager with the most seniority. Sad but true. 

Things moved along not getting better but slowly getting worse. 4 years down the road, another new manager and things are really bad. I am not a disgruntled employee. I still love my team. I just can't work under a ""manager"" that is a bully. This person will target anyone that doesn't tow the line. This so-called manager has targeted not only myself but another employee simply because we question the manager's opinions. I, personally, reached out to HR. I was told that I needed to give the manager a chance to improve which I was open to but not hopeful. That went sideways as now that I went to HR now this manager has more issues. Went back to HR as this is perceived as retaliation and was told again that they would investigate. Gave HR the name of another employee dealing with the same issues and to this day 2-3 weeks later HR has not contacted that employee nor myself. It is sad really that they are promoting a hostile work environment but refuse to do anything. No follow-up at all. Not even an email saying they are still ""investigating"". I am very disillusioned by what has happened here. And the Sr. Manager over the lower level manager does nothing. I was told that there would be skip level meetings but nothing so far. The things that this ""manager"" is saying to employees while not illegal are demoralizing and inappropriate. This manager even blames the employee for the bad reactions. ""Saying you made me mad so I said those things."" Not an excuse. But again, sadly, HR does nothing. Other than this I have no complaints about Workday. I love what the culture is supposed to be. I love the team that I am on. They are all really great people and honestly they have our backs. Unfortunately, leadership can't be trusted."

Compensation is good, stock has good value. Employee stock purchase program pretty much always turns a profit (~+15% income at least)

Good work like balance if you choose.

Can be a good place to stay for a long time career path in company permitting. If you are in a role with proprietary knowledge that the company needs you have strong negotiation power to get a raise with real threats to leave(other opportunities). That in conjunction with staying to get stock is excellent financially. Working in services(with customers) can give you a good position to lead installations at customer companies.

Networking inside the company is highly encouraged and supported.","Performance reviews are more like a self review that neither the employee or manager knows how to do. If you want a promotion ask for it and make a plan or leave.

Your work (team reliant) may give you non-marketable skills unless you're going to stay within the workday product.

Your work may not be important in the long run due to decisions made by poor communication along the management chain. Always find out how you fit into the bigger picture and see if you and everyone else agrees with the value of your project.

Promotions can be less merit based and more if people like you based which can be good depending on who you are. Also very opportunity based. People want to support you, but you can only really move if there are spots. Promotions are very much possible and everyone celebrates it, only if you make it happen."

769,Workday,Toxic Environment,2020-12-24,1.0,Datacenter Operations Engineer,"Money Was Good But Don't Let This Tempt You, it just isn't worth it.","My previous review was removed Probably due to a complaint because my review was initially reviewed but the truth always hurts. I will write another review because I want People to be aware of what it's like working for Workday in the Dublin Data Centre. 

I worked in the Dublin Data Centre and if you are thinking of working here then don't let money tempt you because it's not a good working environment. 

I was victimised by other members of staff and they go around sneakily behind your back telling lies to management, delighted with the fact that I was completely powerless to do anything about it because as you know you have 0 rights as an employee in this 6 month probationary period and I think it's absolutely disgusting to be treated like this under those circumstances that people can take delight in potentially destroying someone's life knowing during probation there's absolutely nothing you can do about it and a month before Christmas, tossed out like a piece of dirt after breaking my back in those 6 months trying to make a good impression but that didn't matter to management because they took the word of those that were there longer and rather than trying to sort things out he took the decision to toss me out like a piece of trash fired and marched out of the building, humiliated and then all he could say was that he was sorry it didn't work out.

The work itself was decent but they are very behind the times as regards ticketing system, it's just not suited to Data Centre work and it's frustrating, there's far too much admin to do before you get near a server for instance having to chase people in endless slack channels to get server down time.

Their logistics is an absolute joke, (you are logistics ) you have to order parts and send them back, arrange courier etc, Parts come in and not asset tagged and no location entered into the system because they have absolutely no logistics system, yes, you wouldn't believe it but this company has no logistics system other than a spreadsheet!!!!! the spreadsheet that's supposed to reflect the parts in stock but half the time it's wrong, sometimes they haven't a clue where the likes of Networking equipment is for instance then there's panic. Yes they are very very backward. 

They have 2 buildings on site and deliveries usually some to one site and you are made drag heavy items to the other site, they have no Forklift or any other means of transporting heavy items throughout the site and are not happy when you request basic equipment like this.

I have been left severely depressed after the way I was treated in this Workday Dublin Data Centre, it could have been different, it should have been different but it wasn't so think very carefully before applying for a job here my advice is to look elsewhere. Workday Preach about Workday Employees coming first but this is complete nonsense you are treated just like any other employee anywhere else."

789,Workday,Not all teams share the same culture.,2020-11-23,2.0,Senior Integration Consultant,"Low expectations, generous PTO, benefits, remote work accommodations.","The core values aren’t equally valued across Workday. Workday likes to say that it values employees first but this gets lost in middle management. At least in my experience, I had to work incredibly hard to get promotions and still got passed up for one. Was given no actionable feedback and instead was told “keep doing what you’re doing, it’s just not your time.” When I applied to other teams, management decided they couldn’t let me go too quickly since they couldn’t backfill my position due to lack of experienced resources. Middle management is also not very inclusive, there’s a whole initiative team that was formed to address these issues but even that team isn’t too diverse. It’s a bit expected for a company this size but disappointing to say the least."
790,Workday,Corporate Political Nightmare with rogue managers & no HR oversight,2020-11-23,1.0,Sales Ops,The product is still the best in the market in terms of usability and has much potential in the market IF Workday can weed out the bad apples (specifically in management) before it brings us down.,"My manager is a complete corporate bully and narcissist and Workday does seem to have a clue. He is allowed to mentally abuse me for lack of a better phrase, has threatened my career and played mind games with me all in an attempt to make himself feel better and feed his huge ego. I feel this is an indicator of a bigger issue at Workday with management and the amount of leeway they are given coupled with the lack of management training and experience across leaders, even at senior levels. Coincidentally, the times when I have been extremely successful are the same times my boss has decided to berate me, belittle me and overall try to make me feel bad rather than lifting me up, motivating me and helping with my career progression. His comments to me are in complete contradiction with the very positive feedback I receive from everyone else which is clearly a huge issue that needs to be addressed but unfortunately there is no one to talk to as HR for individual contributors is outsourced (surprising). There is a serious lack of maturity which I would expect to have in a manager and it’s almost to the point that I feel Workday is allowing a hostile work environment by not addressing the issues. The sad part about all this is that I love Workday (the product), I’m an extremely loyal employee and thought I would be here forever. I’m self-motivated, a go-getter and I have tons of energy and excitement but unfortunately that is waning quickly given how the company is allowing me to be treated. It’s a classic case of top talent wanting leaving because of a bad manager."

These people are bright, humble, kind-hearted, and willing to go out of their way to help me be successful. I left Workday with many lifelong friendships and connections.

Although it wasn't so much the case by the time I left given the size of the company, I had many opportunities to make significant impact on customers with the various products I led, either from scratch or enhanced. Being a PM at Workday for 6 years gave the kind of enterprise experience that many other companies value and seek. Despite my no longer being there, I am very grateful for my time at Workday.","Leadership quality, from front-line all the way up to the executive ranks, is sorely lacking. There was no clear product strategy/vision, priorities were constantly changing, and politics were rife. Workday grew too fast and brought in too many external folks that had significant responsibility/power but had no idea what Workday was about. What's worse was that they didn't trust nor respect their employees' input and experience. As a result, the culture Workday is so proud of is rapidly deteriorating. Many talented people are leaving for other opportunities."
801,Workday,"Great people, good culture, becoming too big",2020-11-10,4.0,Account Executive,Workday has a solid focus on customer satisfaction.

804,Workday,Core Values have changed,2020-11-03,2.0,"Director, Product Management",The recent diversity initiative feels very genuine and I believe most leaders and individual contributors agree with the importance of this effort.,"I've been at Workday for over seven years and it's clear that over the past couple of years our values have changed. The two areas that have seen the most dilution are Integrity and Customers. The goal of being a $10billion company has clearly changed our priorities - to the extent that we no longer place a value on our promises. 

I was dismayed when one of the GMs said our focus is no longer on Customers. All our effort now must be directed toward opening new SKUs for sales at the expense of improving our core products. Leaders in other pillars have made similar comments that we wouldn't necessarily honor existing customer promises. These ideas are in direct contradiction to the company I joined.

If you're looking to join Workday, make sure you select a growing or new product line. And leave your integrity at the door."

You will not learn anything by using XO. There are no transferable skills to help you in your future if you work here as a Software Application Engineer. Workday knows this and are developing a layer on top of XO called YP. Don't be fooled, YP is not like any common programming language and will not help you in your future either.

While interacting with these individuals, it relates to a similar experience I had. Now, the company would rather hire externally than provide individuals who have been at the company with an opportunity to take on a new role. Years ago, people didn't look at your years of experience but rather what you were doing at the moment and whether you can deliver value in an area we needed to focus on. That has changed... It seems like to grow, you have to be coming from the outside. Folks that have been here for a while don't seem to receive the same type of respect they used to give or take the same amount of risk or believing in someone. I really hope this can be fixed because Workday is a great place to work but the people who helped get it there should not be forgotten."

I’m sure some people can go through their career there without a hitch. But I think I can safely say that if you want a great software engineering career, you need to do much better than working in the apps org at Workday. I think joining the Apps was the biggest mistake in my entire life, setting me back years in my professional development.

And it’s not just working in XpressO. At the end of my tenure I came to appreciate the things it did well. It’s more the lack of insight into any part of the technical stack, and the subpar technical leadership in Apps. Almost every manager I had during my tenure were Peoplesoft->Oracle->Workday, so several years away from the technical cutting edge. The lack of almost any technical know-how forces nonsense metrics to be the measure of an engineers ability, such as number of commits in a month, or how many comments were posted on a code review. Issues with my manager disappeared when I started committing near blank code to keep my number up, and started telling my peers to give me comments on my code reviews directly instead of on the code review tool. And I know for a fact it’s not just me who dealt with this.

Workday appears to hire three types of people in apps: college students who don’t know any better, older folk who don’t care anymore about being on the bleeding edge and just want a stable 9-5, and managers who worked at Peoplesoft at some point. Not exactly the ideal combination for what should be a high performance team."

""Employee first"" mindset.

Diversity and Inclusion is a real thing, not just words.

Strong compensation and benefits.","The clash of the ""Old timers"" who vehemently adhere and advocate the ""Workday Way"", and the ""new timers"" who are driving to ""get stuff done"" instead of focusing so much on making Workmates happy, is causing issues/conflicts. 

As a result, the culture is starting to break down - in some areas more and faster than others. Though there are executives who believe (privately, not publicly) that the shift to ""get stuff done"" is overdue and are actively taking steps to change the culture away from ""employees first"".

As a people leader, you are caught between keeping your employees happy (weekly employee sat survey and quarterly reports on the results) and driving for results. Managing through this (unofficial, unstated, and inconsistently applied) culture change is frustrating due to the mixed messages from senior leadership and executive leadership.

I recommend Workday to someone applying for an IC role. I do not recommend Workday to someone applying for a people leader position."

884,Workday,Exceeded my expectations,2020-07-17,5.0,Associate Quality Assurance Engineer,"- Talented, international teams (Dublin office was split about 50:50 nationals/non-nationals when I was there)

- The product is impressive, its also built in a way that is scalable so you avoid double work/things breaking etc..

- The package is great - compensation, RSUs, health insurance (dentists come on site) , office is on a luas line and inbetween Dublins 2 train stations, gym next to the office, nice canteen with free breakfast, snacks and drinks

- Top quality hardware and software available to you 

- Internal trainers who run courses/workshops regularly, some you do as a team (the agile workshop) but you're free to sign up for anything you have an interest in really, and you get to meet people in other departments during these and find out more about what other teams do and how they operate

- Possibility to change teams/roles/locations usually seems possible, as long as you give them enough notice they will try facilitate it for you

- Teams are allowed experiment with what works best for them and everyones input seems valued e.g. if you want to use scrum/kanban, how you want to handle tech debt

- Work/Life balance is exceptional (might not be as good if you work directly with clients as most of them are in US timezones, but if you have evening calls you can start later etc..)","- Since they use their own language, it can be frustrating at the start for more senior developers. After going through 5 weeks of bootcamp learning the language it can take a while to adapt before they feel theyre contributing the same way they were in a previous company. Not really a problem if you're in it for the long-term though.

- On the flip side, it might be easier for a graduate or junior developer to pick up the language but if you plan on leaving and all/most of your experience is in Xpresso you might have less options (there are dev teams in workday who dont use xpresso, but these positions are obviously limited)

- You work on 2 projects a year for the bi-annual releases, which can get a bit boring if your team is working in isolation on your project. Would be cool to set up additional smaller projects where you work with people from other teams one day a week on MVPing innovative ideas or something similar, but obviously product takes priority so not sure how feasible this could be"

2. XpressO is a career tramp. It adds no value to your technical skills and no one in the industry cares about XO. New graduates, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay away from Workday. I joined as a GW, and it is a nightmare for me in the last three years.
3. Politics is the ""root"" of this company. People complain a lot and it got worse and worse. Middle management is playing politics to bring friends and lay off those who they don't like.

A lot of people who helped build the company have left or been sidelined in the last couple of years, which is too bad. 

When both Dave and Aneel were in charge, Workday had a good balance between vision and growth. Now that Dave (the visionary) is retired, Aneel (the venture capitalist) focuses more on growth. 

Some of the recent senior leadership promotions are questionable. They seem to be driven either by proving that we treat our acquired companies' leaders really well, or by rewarding sales-focused people."

Being an entrepreneur, it was hostile in terms of not being able to move from one are of the company to the other (at least to learn) when not in any meetings. The people who hired me (4 at a time), were not on my team when hired, which made the team dynamic intensely different.

911,Workday,"A lot of hype, much less substance",2020-05-18,2.0,Senior Software Developer,"These are very subjective based on just a portion of the company, albeit a large one: engineering.

- good deal of autonomy in picking what you work on within the boundaries of team/org goals/priorities (but see cons)

- reasonably competitive pay at start - but it has to be, because the company is not seen as an attractive target by engineers on the market (also, see cons)

- work-life balance is good, to very good but varies across teams

- subsidised employee stock purchase programme

- pension matching

- health insurance coverage for the entire family on a good plan","- Poor location if you're commuting in from outside of Dublin City centre - lacklustre public transport, very limited parking spaces in the office, expensive on/off street parking.

- Office-centric culture, with little love for remote work

- No matter how hard you work, when it comes to promotions who you know trumps what you know and can deliver.

- Pay is only competitive at the start - forget about pay reviews. Five years later you'll be on the same base pay. WD prefer giving people bonuses/top-ups in their volatile stock, with long vesting periods.

- Constant employee surveys that lead to nothing.

- One-way performance review system that leads to nothing.

- Senior management in Engineering have no idea what they're doing - constant hires/fires/re-orgs that cause churn and chaos.

- Lack of trust in what the engineers are doing, with changes/deployments being micromanaged to death. Anything to massage the ""customer satisfaction"" number to where it will look great on an earnings call.

- The tech stack is old and boring (Ruby, Java EE), and a career dead end for many (GWT, XO, YP and other tech nobody else uses). Few teams get to work or experiment with more modern, or emerging tech.

- WD position themselves as a technology company, but the reality is they most often consume off-shelf products just to fail at integrating them.There is very little in terms of innovation, or it's not promoted enough to be noticeable. It is not actively encouraged either.

- The least agile company of ""agile"" companies I have worked for. You must love spending hours in meetings to do well here. Everything takes months, if not years."

914,Workday,Don't waste your life with this poor management,2020-05-13,1.0,Software Applications Engineer III,"- The CEO is really smart and awesome
- It's a big american company with an office in Dublin, Ireland so you can have the chance to get in touch with people with all around the world.
- The view from the 6th floor of the building is nice and also the snack program and the employees clubs are a nice bonus to make your day more enjoyable.
- Most colleague are friendly and there is a lot of flexibility in managing your time","- The CEO has stopped to oversee the hiring a long time ago, and the quality upper and lower management of the Dublin office is really poor (with very limited exception like Chris Byrne)
- Tons of big policies and procedure for everything, with several levels of approval. They clearly don't trust their employees and they want to get managers involved in every decision, even the technical ones. Most of the policy are so generic that basically leaves a huge discretionary power in the hands of a really poor management.
- The company is always saying that they care about you, but it's more true if you are a manager. We are all equal only when it comes to the snack program or a spot in the car park. If you are a individual contributor, you are just a resource to be allocated the a project/team every few months/weeks as they like.
- The structure is very vertical, with a manager every 3/4 people and multiple managers from different organizations with different okr, policy, procedures to handle a single team.
- They call the management ""leadership"", but it's just a word, they are not leading anything, they are not providing example, guidance, mentoring or coaching. They only care about their goals/okr/objectives and not about you or your career. They tell you that you career is in your hands, and they mean it, literally since they cannot care less.
- There are no quantitative goals to measure your contributions/productivity and no clear path/checklist to get a promotion. It's only based on your ability to sell yourself with smoke and mirrors and become friends of the upper management and not with actual quality deliverables to the customers.
- They are running a career check-in every year as an HR compliance exercise, but it's just a one way presentation. First you present you achievement, than you will be given the management review, unrelated to your presentation and with compensation/promotion package predetermined .
- If you are already a good friends of the upper management, you can be promoted every 6/12 months, without having to prove anything and you can also get you friend and family hired in senior roles. They call this connections, and they really value it, but I prefer to use another name.
- If you have an irish passport, you will get probably an higher level in the company given the same level of experience in the industry, so apply for one before joining the company. They are proud of having a mix of people from all around the world in the Dublin office, but almost all of them are individual contributor. Probably in Ireland there are a lot of managers and very few developer, tester, analyst, etc. It's clearly a coincidence. 
- There is a toxic culture where you are forced to comply and pretend that everything is awesome, if you try to point out a problem, you will become the problem since you clearly do not understand their magnific work and instead of fixing the problem, they will focus on explaining to you why you are wrong.
- If you are unlucky enough to work with xpresso for 1-2 years, your career in the real word is ended. They believe they have created (acquired) a powerful proprietary language/system that it's ten of years ahead of everything. Even if it's an interesting technical solution, it's clearly limited and there is no proper tooling to support the code development. There is a huge ecosystem of plugins written by devs in their spare time to improve the gaps of the language, because the company does not care to have the xo team spend time to improve the dev experience. They are just totally blind and full of themselves"

Great break room with free coffee, soda, juice, tons of difference snacks, food in the fridge and free Einsteins bagels every single morning.","Things change drastically, way too often and once you’ve been able to get a grip on those changes, they change again. The Corporate Sales Development department in particular is forcing its way to becoming a call center. It is no longer prospect driven it is now activity driven. It doesn’t matter if you’re hitting, or in my case, exceeding your quarterly quota within the first month of it. If you are not meeting the leadership placed requirements of calls during their “Power hours” you will not be recognized or recommended to get promoted or change roles. They purposely hire young kids fresh out of college with no prior job experience and pay them a decent base pay plus commission so that they can mold the kids to their way. They want “yes” people who say yes to any changes even if they are terrible ones. The minute you speak your mind about how wrong pushing these changes on people is they start treating you differently, and the difference is VERY evident and even uncomfortable. They will praise the person with 100 dials a day and 30% of quota and use them as an example of what is expected while the person with 20 dials a day and 130% of quota gets told they “are not performing.” Its truly sad because as a company is truly an amazing company. I would recommend working at Workday in any other department but CSD. They dont accept people who have their own style and experience in sales development that works. You won’t be appreciated."

933,Workday,Really is a great place to work!,2020-04-13,5.0,Product Manager,"* The culture is really great, in practice what this means is that people are easy to work with, management doesn't (typically) micro-manage, people are trusted, benefits are generous, if you need time off you can take it, etc. Also plenty of interest groups, competitions, socials. Team outings are encouraged.

* The product is a sticky one that has a big impact on the world. The biggest companies in the world use our product and its exciting to build products that can impact millions of employees for the better. There's a lot of growth to be had and we are continuously expanding our product lines.

* There is a lot of room for internal mobility! You are not stuck in the role you were hired into (at least after one year of serving in that role). You can move to different teams or even different roles altogether. This is a great place to grow your career if you are motivated and willing to speak up for yourself with your manager. Some examples I'm aware of: Developer -> PM, Pre-Sales. QA -> Developer, PM

* Compensation is about average for the bay area, but that is still pretty good! You typically will get decent base salary and RSU package (e.g. 40k over 4 years). This grows each year as you get a ""refresh"" (e.g. another 40k over 4 years). After 4 years you have 4 grants vesting at the same time in April (our comp cycle). That can be 10k raise each year even if you don't have a boost in base salary.","* Volatile stock means volatile compensation when much of it is from RSUs. But this can also be to your favor if you hold long term. When I joined my RSUs were granted at a local maxima price and dropped shortly after, only recovering (and then dramatically surpassing) that price 2 years later. But the following year or two was a surge in Workday's price which led to significant inflation of my compensation. 

* Don't expect significant base salary raises unless it is a major promotion and you are a good negotiator. Often you won't get any base salary increase, and other times you might get 1-3%. It is difficult to negotiate once you get your annual review and compensation update, the budget has already been allocated and agreed to a month+ prior. If you negotiate successfully you may only see a bump months later.

* Depending on your team you may have FREQUENT re-organizations, even up to 2-3 times a year. Which could mean new manager and change in your charter. If you are an IC, you are usually not consulted on this and simply have to deal with it. Even director level folks are sometimes not consulted with on these changes, and we have seen turn over due to undesirable changes from a re-org (for certain people). I've been at workday for many years now and have had more manager than years employed. It has its pros and cons, and it has to do with which teams you join. 

* The team you join MATTERS. If you join a team that is focused on a legacy product, you can chill more and could be a good place to be to ""rest and vest"" and have time to take care of your family (leave early to pick them up from school, etc.) If you join an innovative team that is pushing through new product lines, there is a higher expectation and just cruising will look bad. If you are a motivated individual, I urge against joining (or at least saying long term) in a team that is of the ""cruising"" archetype. Take advantage of the internal mobility and join an innovative team to grow your career.

* Office locations aren't ideal. Depending on your values, Pleasanton HQ can be good or bad. If you live in the east bay, it's obviously good. If you live in SF it's less good. There is an SF office, but you should assume you will not be working there (unless you're joining Scout, or are in corporate comms, marketing, etc.) There other offices are Boulder, Portland, Victoria (BC), Dublin (Ireland), so if you want to live somewhere warm Pleasanton is the only option. Boulder seems to be the second most active office after Pleasanton and we're doing a lot more hiring there if that's your interest.

* Occasionally, management talks politics (US politics), and I feel like this can alienate many employees. Even if the majority agrees with the politics, there are at least 40% of employees who feel alienated. I don't think this company should involve itself in controversial politics. It's certainly not as bad as some other tech companies though in this regard though!"

Middle managers weaponize OKRs for their personal gains. Middle managers are constantly looking for scapegoats, shifting blames and unwanted OKRs to other teams. The business unit constantly misses targets and therefore applies incredible pressure to the teams. Poor communication amongst managers, the constant need to fulfill one manager's requirements while the other is upset that your unable to fulfill their requirements. Managers publically insulting other teams. The software code is incredibly poorly written. Numberous security holes, use of very old software.

Very good snack programs. 
Great opportunities within the company and career growth, at least this is how I feel. encourages internal transfers and personal career growth but I think it is expected that employees has to be initiative.  
A lot technical challenges to overcome,which presents opportunity to grow and improve. 
Managements constantly engage with employees to find out pain points and challenges using skip level meetings, which shows they truly care or at least they are trying.","A lot of pros I mentioned might be listed as cons in other reviews. 

However it's very hard to give a very objective views in general about the company so in this case look at how the company fairs in ""Great Place to Work."", which I believe speaks volume. 

 Depending on the team and location same thing can be positive/cons at the same time.

Lately too much politicking happening around and too many nice ppl start leaving. Personally for me had good and bad managers (company growing, a lot of changes happening) aka good and bad experiences in the company. Still would recommend to consider the company as a workplace but be careful who the manager is and what the team would offer in term of career and learning opportunities. 


--- If the manager is good, as everywhere, the overall experience with the company will be really good 
--- Possibility to change the position/department inside the company 
--- Usually management is supportive around learning opportunities 
--- Flexibility (in my case, but not on the company level)
--- Complex software so challenging enough (* but some monolithic parts of it not so interesting to work on)
--- Possibility to travel and collaborate with US based teams 
--- Multicultural environment and a lot of nice ppl 
--- Volunteering opportunities 
--- Good base pay + Stocks 
--- Good office space","--- Inconsistency across the departments on remote work, wfh, career development 
--- Really bad HR department in Dublin office: all through the tickets even when urgent things are happening, easier to search for the help from colleagues as they are more responsive, no easy way to engage with HR when situation requires it as it's hard to find right person even to ask (again usually the response is 'Create a ticket'), no exit interview 
--- Core values are written but the actions are not aligned lately 
--- Company is growing too fast so a lot of toxic ppl came in the company and destroying prior really good work place to be (sad) 
--- Very unfair treatment in some departments around the company (like making ppl aim to ‘be visible’ to be promoted (I always thought it should be around contribution, quality of work and etc.), one of my managers for example was really arrogant, unprofessional and did a lot of micromanaging, others were from ok to great, in some teams socialising after work influence your ‘visibility’ - very non inclusive I’d say for certain categories of employees )
--- Company doesn't fire people more like making them leave. Those 3 who actually were fired (I assume they were) disappeared without a word. Which is really weird for me. 
--- Slow delivery to production (it's kinda good everything is tested and etc, but annoying to wait half of a year or more to see something be delivered)"

Encouragement for People Leaders to grow and training for them on a new way of managing
Senior Leadership optimism and support for new ideas","Regardless of HR/People & Purpose communication, organizational and leadership changes are selected and appointed based on their tight network, which creates the inability for others to see a path forward toward leadership.  Additionally, those leaders select people like them (in style, view point, color, gender, background) or that they've known a long time, which feels like the same ""good ol' boy network"".
Many of the appointed leaders are white men, with an occasional nod to a (white) woman or man of color.  And as they senior leadership is shifted around, creating potential opportunities for workmates to show interest in management, those management spots are also appointed. 
It's beginning to feel like the senior leadership is excited for growth and changes, but in the end leaving those of us who are looking for opportunities feeling like we have none, and we're expected to rally behind the changes regardless.
The ethnic diversity in senior leadership and in management is so minimal that it's discouraging to believe in their words during VIBE week of diversity being important."

Good snacks program","People: 
Some nice people, some very arrogant and toxic people, depending on which team you join. 

Technology: 
The core application is a monolithic one, old technology for the teams working in core application, except for some new teams that are using modern technologies. They are trying to update technologies used, but this is moving very slowly. 
If you end up with working in the monolithic app you will experience all the drawbacks of a monolithic application, like: 
- Massive code base that is really hard to understand, 
- Hundreds of developers working in the same code base, 
- Pipeline blocked most of the time,
- Tricky to debug,  takes some time, 
- Poor test coverage, 
- Bugs can slip out easily, etc… 

If you will work with XO, their proprietary language, not that bad as a concept, but it's not done in developer friendly way, it has pros and cons.

XO Pros is that it helps building features quickly. 

XO Cons: 
Takes lots of time to learn it.
It limits your thinking to the capabilities it has, which is limited compared to any other language. 
Tools around it is not great, for example the code review tool is not good. The automation framework that is done on top of it is very bad to work on as well.
The UI for the development is not developer friendly, which is basically inside the browser and UI based. 

People - details
Managers hell: 
I had bad luck and joined 2 different teams in which I didn't have a good time over there.
I have seen very poor soft skills, especially communication skills among senior people, and managers, within my team, i didn’t find respect, i wasn’t valued, i didn’t find psychological safety which is very important important for a successful team, Instead I found pointing fingers, blaming, undermining others. 
I have worked with 2 managers. 1st one was fake, too formal, a kind of person who gives too many instructions which he doesn't follow half of them. A kind of manager that you feel the 1-1 meeting is something you need to prepare and worry about. He used a google doc to track what we say and ask about it next time, which gave the meeting the formality style, which is not good for 1 to 1 meetings, he had very poor communication skills, he would joke about people's mistakes rather than trying to give constructive feedback.
Second manager was worse, he looked very nice, funny, friendly, until any mistake happens, or anything that he doesn't like. He turns to the other face, aggressive communication style, blaming, comparing to others. All the things that it is not recommended for professional communication, he was doing it. he has offensive and harsh communication style, that you would feel offended after. Some of our meetings would turn into arguments, shouting,  blaming game and whose fault it is. 
After some time working with this manager i would go to work, feel anxious all the time just thinking that I could have done something wrong that would result of him talking to me in un -pleasant way. 
Working under these 2 managers in Workday are considered to me the worst time in my life, which turned my hope of working in a great place fades and turns into a nightmare. 

Disrespect and exclusion
Being in these 2 teams, I didn’t feel much inclusion and respect, i was different in terms that I don't like going out to their outings, I don’t like parties or fun the way they see it. I don’t like drinking, I don't talk much about other things than work. I was looked at like I am weird.
The culture they advertise is talking about things like value employee, and inclusion. But the true and actual culture is different. There isn’t much stress on applying this culture.
I was advised by my manager to try to mingle more and talk more about any nonsense, and to go out with the team for drinks. He didn’t really understand my personality and was as if asking me to change my personality to fit more into the company. Once he mentioned that this how it is in Workday and this is what i need to do to fit the fun culture. He didn’t understand that every person have fun in a different way.

Other than managers, i have seen senior and principals that doesn't respect others, talks about other in their backs, not patient, all of these things are missing from them are necessary for someone with such senior position, which makes me wonder how they were promoted. They were hard workers, have been in the company for some time, but that is not enough for someone to be promoted, senior person as well need to be a role model and be able to mentor others. 
Once one of the senior managers had an org meeting and he was bragging and joking about how much he curse, which just reminded me with high school time. I just wanted to tell him, come on, grow up - how immature!!!"

Depending on who you are assigned to work with, can often be a hostile work environment. If you have one off day at a meeting, expect to be given zero to minimal opportunities for a foreseeable future, and especially not with any sort of deal ownership/leadership capacity.

1065,Workday,Revenge of the Nerds,2019-08-30,1.0,Csd,"Being one of the first 500 employees, I got to see how a Enterprise Software Company was built from the ground up.  At the time, Workday was the only company its size delivering Cloud Products.  Back then, the industry was fighting change and its interesting to see how the climate has changed.  Being involved at such an early process, I was able to see how many systems and processes were implemented.","Looking back years later on my experience as a CSD in the early days, there are still some things I am still processing.   Years later, I am able to accept the the fact public beratings were normal and accepted.  I am even able to accept the fact that my manager at the time couldn't even name all 50 states the team was responsible for calling into.  I even came to grips with the fact the marketing team was sloppy with messaging and email campaigns.

Years later, what I still cant wrap my head around is the fact that I witnessed ""corporate professionals"" well into their 40s and 50s use Workday as their second chance at being popular.  I felt like I was witnessing a bad fraternity.  People would tell stories about he old Peoplesoft days and refer to themselves as Rockstars.  Employees would name drop and badmouth each other like they were fighting to be in some sort of inner circle.  Employees would vacation together, and get their unqualified family members hired.  Being recently out of college, the entire culture seemed very pathetic.  

I had to ask myself, did any of these people have a social circle outside of Workday?  Did they have any hobbies?  Was Workday their only means of self esteem?"

1090,Workday,More hype than great,2019-07-06,2.0,Software Engineer,"Fruits in the cafeteria.
Clean and neat office space.
Work life balance.
IT help-desk is very helpful and efficient.","First of all ""Great place to work"" gimmick is mainly a BS. Company is not on par in terms of benefits with other large tech companies around  (like Google, FB or MS). Culture and work conditions varies largely depending on the department and team you are working at. I've seen examples when the whole teams were leaving their jobs in a course of less than 1 year. It's just shows an example how extremely unhappy people can be at the ""Best place to work"". The sad part is that nothing was done on the higher management side to correct the situation. Instead managers report how everything is ""great"", ""positive"" and ""amazing"" which totally contradicts reality. So depending on department/team it can be a good (I wouldn't call it great still) or bad to terrible place to work. Therefore if you are looking to join Workday ignore this ""Best place to work"" - it really means nothing, it's just a job at an average company nothing more.

Also I should note that there is a lot of hypocrisy on different levels. On the lowest level managers and recruiters can lie straight in the people's face and give them fake promises (while knowing they are fake). On the company level good example is that company claims that they promote internal mobility (and there are a lot of talks about it from HR and management) but in reality recently they changed rules increasing minimum required length of stay in the team before people can transfer to another team. Before you could transfer after 1 year of work, now you have to stay at least 1.5 year. Also transferring process isn't simple: they don't make a difference between internal and external candidates. Which means internal candidate would have to go through the same set of interviews as external. So if you were thinking that you can get to random team in Workday and hope that you will be able to transfer to a better team/project/department later you should understand that:
1. once you are in you are locked (in potentially horrible place) for 1.5 years
2. even after 1.5 years passed you will have to go through the same process as if you were applying for the job externally.

Point 2 means that being in Workday gives you no advantage in getting to a good team/project over the external candidate.
Paint 1 means that you would have a DISADVANTAGE over external candidates b/c you would be locked for 1.5 years and people from outside are not.

Given the above:

1. Be VERY careful when applying for the job. Best if you know someone who works in that team or department and can tell you how things are. 

2. Don't trust what recruiters say. 

3. Remember that it would be more beneficial waiting for a better job opening to come up rather than applying to a random job opening in Workday.

Special notes about technologies: 
Workday has a proprietary piece of something (full of bugs and unpredictable behavior) named Xpresso (XO). They call it ""programming language"" but it's really not. It is some sort of ""platform"" where App Developers define business logic by clicking checkboxes and picking items in the listboxes in the web browser (that's correct no coding involved). For the whole day... Every day!
Read the other reviews - people described it well there. Basically if you spend couple of years in such project (while not doing any real software engineering on a side) you will hardly be able to call yourself a software engineer and therefore would not be qualified for an adequate position in the market. Read the restrictions on transferring to another team above and you can see that it's a dead end if you don't escape early."

There is almost zero HR in the company and are only here to act as guards. I’m pretty sure it qualifies as mental abuse. Many top talent individuals have already left and more are on-the-fence and it really boils down to management.

There was a big push to have an HR presence in SLC, but this has quickly fizzled and turned out to be nothing but disappointing. HR rep is friendly, but is afraid to address issues head on. From my experience, and other managers in the office, HR expects YOU to solve the problem. Although serious issues are raised, it seems that they are not interested in creating any real change to the office issues. Employee morale issues all lead back to bad management.

1) Other consultants that do the bare minimum for their customers leaving them extremely dissatisfied and wishing they went with a partner

3) Management and project leadership caring more that people get along and keeping the peace then actually making people accountable to deliver for customers. Customers continue to get screwed over in the process while high performers have to pick up the slack for the dead weight. 
4) Customers telling me that Workday Services is going to be screwed over long term if the quality doesn’t improve

Perhaps customers are getting wise to the fact that Workday cares more about doing everything possible to sell subscriptions to the detriment of services.

No updates are given, and it's really hard to even distinguish if an applicant even has an edge with my referral tag on their name.

I have referred interns and FTEs and not even a single screen. Perhaps you may say my candidates are just not qualified. Okay, fair, then reject them, don't string 'em along in ""review"" stage for eternity. Recruiters have told me they're put into common piles for job positions and would get sifted out eventually. My past colleagues were excited to apply to Workday as a result of me telling them how great it was, but it's radio silence until the application abruptly closes months down the line. Recently, my friend I referred into an internship back in September heard nothing until March, which was a generic decline. It makes me as an employee look pretty darn bad to talk up Workday as a great company then proceed to not have anything substantial in terms of progress to offer my referrals until they get the decline MONTHS later. Shame on you Workday HR. Take some notes from how Google recruits. They give you timeframes of when to expect responses and are willing to at least provide some sort of a technical test to start things off. Workday is a blackbox, I can't figure it out and I'm a bit weary to refer talent here because it makes me look like a schmuck."

Overall the organization encourages employee flexibility and flexible pto options and believes in work life balance","Work-Life balance 
Individual departments do not buy into the overall organization policies. You are constantly questioned if you come in beyond 9am (like at 9:05). There is no empathy for working women or men who have kids. You are questioned if you take morning calls from home or work from home because you had had a extremely busy day with a lot of meetings and did’nt find time to commute to work. 

Processes
Our department specifically, management hands over work to individuals at the very last minute when they don’t want do that kind of work. Everyone in the team is afraid to talk to top management. 
Processes are put in place to slow us down rather than to enable us. And these processes are not followed by management and they constantly override it. 


Career Enablement
You are constantly compared to your peers who have more experience and told that you are not performing to a peer who has way more experience than you. We are supposed to have a career enablement model, how is comparing self to peer a career enablement model?"

1185,Workday,Beware the hype,2019-02-01,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good snack program, drinks and pizza gatherings, other company parties. Nice modern office easily accessible by public transport. Option to work remotely once in a while (but not full-time remote.) People aren't too strict about time so you can be flexible to a degree.

There are some genuinely good people who work here and they embody the ""Workday culture"" the hype is all about. Mostly they're older employees. New hires are a mixed bag.","Pay is lower than comparable jobs in other companies. Compensation includes stocks up to a cap each year, but they're more trouble than it's worth.

Some roles have 100% remote management which means people who are far removed from the Workday Dublin realities make all the decisions. Not all of these decisions are good.

No possibility to work remotely full-time. No commute stipend, extremely limited parking facilities on-site.

After about a year you will stop learning new things and the job will become routine. Some skills you gain will be non-transferable in other roles because of proprietary coding languages etc.

Some of the managers are bullies, which includes senior management. You can get shouted down in very public ways for bringing the ""wrong"" ideas to the table, where ""wrong"" = ""that the highest ranking person in that meeting doesn't like."" Teams are very hit-and-miss like that. You can have a terrible manager and someone in the same job as you can have an amazing people leader on his/her team.

If you raise concerns about management you'll basically be told to deal with it. HR are nice in person but useless. Serious concerns are being raised and not listened to.

Problematic managers in general are promoted out of their teams rather than fired or disciplined. They can be the absolute worst to their teams, they can bully and belittle, but at the end of the day it's a big ole clique at the top and if you're not a part of it, good luck.

Some managers are down right incompetent and make business decisions that hurt our product, but they're free to do as they please (again refer to the ""loudest voice in the room"" principle). There are a lot of empty slogans and corporate talk while we pat ourselves on the back for a job well done, but there is no vision and no direction. Another review said it as well: the loudest customer wins.

Very fast paced environment that keeps life interesting and challenging. Extremely supportive local management that puts in tremendous hours and effort trying to build something great. 

Seriously if you aren't happy here - you need to take a look in the mirror. It's highly collaborative, and management really sincerely cares about you.","You may have read a number of negative reviews about Finance Ops in Salt Lake City. It's obviously a smear campaign from a jilted current or former employee using multiple accounts to post what they want you to believe is representative of an overwhelmingly negative atmosphere. The problem is - that's the polar opposite of the reality which is obvious if you spend a few minutes talking to anyone in the department about their experience. 

Don't believe this is an orchestrated campaign? Read all of the finance reviews chronologically in SLC. You'll see 1-2 posts every month, most of them positive. Suddenly there are 10 posts in a 10 day span in November - all with similar themes.  Coincidence? You be the judge. 

If you can't do well here, why have you not pursued other opportunities? The market is very employee friendly (lowest unemployment in decades), you are obviously a self-appointed superstar, and having exposure to Workday software is a hot commodity. No? You'd rather stay, be miserable in this *awful culture* and just complain to the world about it? Makes perfect sense."

The benefits and perks are just as amazing.,"The culture in the Salt Lake office, specifically the Finance department, does not align with the Workday culture that the company prides itself on. The issue stems from the upper management and the way they treat individual contributors in their organization. It is very rare that management participates in office activities and events. Although we are given unlimited paid time off, some managers make it extremely difficult to take any time off. Employees are constantly bullied by upper management and it starts to affect the entire department morale. There is an obvious problem with favoritism as well."
1234,Workday,Horrible work culture...,2018-11-13,1.0,Operations,There are some good co-workers,"The culture itself is horrendous.

1237,Workday,Culture of fear runs rampant within the SLC Finance Group,2018-11-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, including decent pay, stock options, snack program, unlimited PTO, typical tech company benefits","The culture within the SLC Finance department is far from what the culture is in Pleasanton. There is a culture of fear that runs rampant within the group, it is clear that middle management does not take responsibility for decisions that are made because they are afraid of what upper management is going to do with those decisions. There is a culture that individuals do not have the freedom to make decisions without getting the okay from management in some way. 

Over the past few months with the acquisition of Adaptive Insights there has been a major shift of the priorities of management from caring about their employees and putting them first. It is now a priority of meeting deadlines and making the company a quick dollar instead. There used to be a set of meetings set aside to discuss issues in a round table setting that have now been cancelled indefinitely, this gives the perception that employees and culture are no longer important

In the past there would be weekly/monthly 1 on 1's with managers and their employees and now those don't ever happen unless the employee insists on meeting with their manager to discuss issues. Even then it is clear the manager is bothered they have to take time away from their day to meet even for 15 minutes.

Many hiring decisions are being made before a position is even open and then the position will be filled by a new outside person with the first couple days of a position being opened, not giving any opportunity to an internal employee first.

Promotions are always said to be given not just because you checked off a few boxes but because there needs to be a ""need"" first and there needs to be an opportunity for it. There have been plenty of need and opportunities that have come as of late and no one is receiving promotions or even given a chance for one. It has been said from Sr. Management that they will come and we need to just ""trust"" that they will come but will not give an insight into what they mean by that."
1238,Workday,Salt Lake City Finance Department.  Sad but True,2018-11-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work life and family life is highly respected
Co-Workers are hard working and care about their team members","Upper Management is disconnected with what is really happening and does not have the desire to stay in step with the expected Workday Culture.  The majority of employees in Finance are salaried employees yet still must turn in time sheets.  Working from home is only an option for some people in some departments.  There is no ""give"" in work hours.  Pay and titles are given to favorites and very little upward movement is even offered.  Jobs are posted AFTER upper Management has already made a hiring decision.  Rarely are these management jobs open or offered to those already in the Workday environment.  Talent is wasted and squashed by Upper Managements inability to see what is in front of them."
1239,Workday,Great Company - Terrible SLC senior management,2018-11-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I love the company and what it stands for. The product is amazing and would consider it the best on the market. The company perks are fantastic!,"The majority of the issues in the Sat Lake City office stem from the finance senior management. The middle managers are mostly great but do not have the freedom to manage how they see best; it is dictated by senior management. The environment is difficult due to the negative attitudes and how cut -throat it can be; the company in general is not cut-throat but senior management is. Senior management can be condescending to underlings which is widely known throughout the office. One example of this kind of behavior is the senior director ‘asking’ employees to do personal tasks (for the director) which are not work related. 

Many of the promotions have been due to being in the 'inner-circle' or by being a 'suck-up' it is sad to see a company that is so great be tainted by poor management.  Policies that do not make any sense such as mandating which hours have to be worked have been put in place. These policies are NOT dictated by Workday but by what senior management desires.

The feeling is many people would leave not because of the company but because of the management. They stay in order to vest their stock options, myself included."

4. If you are from a certain country, you are in the in crowd","1.  Bad managers 
2.  Hr dept
3.  Unethical Behaviors 
4. Bad Managers

It seems people who get promoted have NO people skills whatsoever. They are promoted into positions, and then their bad behaviors  are covered by higher ups. 
A manager can tell you not to rank him/her on the Pulse Surveys negatively. 
A manager can  tell you there's no room for two seniors on his/her team. 
A manager has people skills about the size of a cuticle. 
When asked if I could transfer, I was told I could and she/he would make the connections. Well, here I am, unemployed thanks to that manager. 
Did you know if you report something that is against company policy, you will be led out the door? 
This place favors young people. If you are 40 and above, watch out. They will try somehow, some way to get you out the door. 
What kind of HR company does not have an exit interview? 
They really don't care what employees (former) think. they only care  about the best places to work surveys, and will only send them to people who they think will respond favorably to them. They after all, have a reputation to uphold. 
The culture has really gone downhill. It's ruthless and cut throat, especially in financials teams. 
HR does not care about employees. Only the bottom line. If you report something to HR, be prepared to lose your job. 
They tout the whole process of the employee review and being in charge of it now, but it's really not a good process. 
If an employee needs to transfer, management should be more supportive. Not take it personally and usher that person out the door. 
Lots of people protect each other because they all used to work at PSFT together. If you aren't part of that crowd, watch out. 
think twice before accepting a job here, especially in Financials."

- Great work life balance 
- Stock is doing well, good ESPP plan, stock refreshers
- Generation Workday new grad program is a good way to make friends","Workday’s App dev teams are the product engineering teams and they build the app using a propriety GUI-based language called Xpresso. The tools teams work on infrastructure and they use traditional programming languages like java and scala. This review is about app dev only.

Hate to say it but working in Xpresso is a very bad career move for engineers coming straight out of college. Unless you are proactive and work on side projects or continue to learn in your free time, you will forget your traditional coding skills. You will also not be exposed to industry-standard practices and tools by working in a proprietary stack. If you ever decide to leave, you'll likely struggle to find a traditional coding job. Workday probably has good retention rates for app devs not because app devs don't want to leave, but because they can't leave. They tell you that you’ll still learn high-level concepts like design and OOP but I don’t think it’s enough to make you a competent engineer. They also tell you that you can eventually transfer to a tools team, but it seems like you have to spend several years doing app dev first before you can switch.  Also, I think the salary for app devs is below industry average."

Some people are helpful and some people will completely ignore your pleas for help.  It's hit or miss honestly.  Thats definitely what I was sold during the interview process.  Also, diversity is an issue when it comes to African Americans.  They have hired a new diversity officer but that just appears to be a ploy to get a higher rating on the various best places to work lists out there.  There has been an increase in the hiring of people of color, but again, that just appears to be a ploy to look more attractive on the best places to work list.  All in all, I would still recommend Workday to friends."

They demand accommodations for people who do not attend events in addition to demanding changes to plans which only benefit their team. They discourage their employees from joining local committees and blackball people who question their authority. They complain that our culture isn’t where it should be yet they won’t engage or work with our other local leaders and stakeholders.

By not attending events and not participating on a larger level (outside their department) they send the message that we as employees can’t or shouldn’t participate either. 

They want to be “more like Pleasanton” but have a single minded and holier than thou attitude about themselves.

1255,Workday,Everything is Good in General - A Couple Things That Could Use Improvement (Financials),2018-10-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good Work/Life Balance
I like most of my coworkers
Generally Nice/Helpful People
I think generally good vibes and folks with good intentions
I think we do our best to deliver good product for customers","As the group is growing they are adding new management layers and trying to measure our performance in various ways.  Management is also always trying to ""improve"" things so you are constantly having to explain yourself to various people and prove yourself over and over again.  Every time we get a new manager (PM, Dev or QA) they try and change what we are doing and we have to jump through hoops only for them to realize it was unnecessary and we were doing just fine the way we were.

We have grown really fast in Financials Apps over the last 2+ years and I feel like some hires have been good and others have been pretty terrible.  Those folks who  immediately show themselves to be a bad fit are not shown the door and drag everything down. 

Work/Life Balance and WFH is good but some people take advantage and are going to ruin it for everyone else.

Seems like management is always soliciting cross functional feedback but this leads to feeling like you are constantly being talked about behind your back.  I am not the only one who feels this way. 

In general in my area I think the PMs have struggled to hire and adequately train folks before throwing them into the fire.  It slows the team down and results in frustration."

Can easily go on cruise control if thats your thing
Unlimited PTO
Flexible wfh policy","Coming here right out of college as a SDE really set me back in terms of my skills and my career path. The biggest obstacle is using xpresso, workday's proprietary language that is specifically designed to make building workday application features  very VERY easy. Try explaining xpresso during interviews - you will be met with a lot of confused looks. It is also a  skill that isn't transferrable and it silos you as an engineer - you don't get exposed to the full SDLC nor do you get exposed to industry standard technologies and practices.

Too many engineering managers are questionable at best. MANY of them do NOT know how to code, nor do they have technical knowledge of how software is developed. QA is a complete joke, many QA / automation engineers don't have engineering backgrounds, workday gets away with this because WATS (another proprietary tool) is a super straight forward GUI point and click tool to write test scripts...which is why if you want a career in engineering, you most definitely do NOT want to join as QA.

Obviously, most of my cons are targeted towards career and skill development. Workday's hiring bar is INCREDIBLY low, don't be fooled by getting an offer from them while you are still in college. Also, due to their rapid hiring - their culture that they were once known for is also rapidly deteriorating, maybe the higher ups don't really care since the stock price has surged?"

As you can infer from my title the management staff seems to be better trained in lifting heavy weights and flexing their so-called ""muscles"" than they are in the area of leading.  There is this false hope that there will definitely be a spot for you after your 2 years, but not even the management can get a job anywhere else in the company.  Like any good sales staff, you are a bunch of trained monkeys who make dials dials dials!  Have fun with the power hour!!! Nothing motivates you more than a bunch of gym bros yelling power hour via slack.  Additionally,  there seemed to be very little constructive criticism until things get so bad that you are put on a performance plan.  In summary, this place is filled with false promises that no one in there can keep and they are just looking to trap you for as long as they can until you get smart enough to bail.  With all the tech companies in the area, I would highly recommend looking somewhere that may be able to back up their claims of having great success at moving up in the company after your time here.  If you are unlucky enough to get a job there at least fight for some equal pay.  Chances are that chump next to you is making 15 K more than you."

Less than 20% of AEs make their number at Workday. Although to management’s credit, quotas were finally reduced in some market segments to right-size this issue. No 360° feedback and lots of incompetent RSDs. Overhired reps in most territories so patch shrinks every year or shifts slightly. Deal velocity is slow at times so being mentally prepared to deal with the “valleys” as well as peaks is key. Not hitting your number is a very real possibility. Definitely a “boys club” so if you’re into that, WD is the place to be. Lack of female mentors and leadership in sales is a problem.

Senior Leadership has a vision for where they want to take the company (something completely & utterly lost on middle management). Good thing is that Senior Management : CXO level is aware of the bad management cancer that is eating the company from within, and is taking some steps towards addressing the rot. Unfortunately for the organization as a whole it might be too little too late. Great work life balance especially if you have kids. Lot of talk about Workday culture, but, not a lot of folks other than senior leadership that truly believe and follow the values. 
Great for folks that have pets, this is a truly pet loving  company and they go above and beyond in giving back to the community.","In the Bay Area where companies pay top dollar for top talent, Workday is stingy on both stock & salaries for most employees, although senior leadership rewards itself very well with stock options.  The company does not aim to retain top tier talent, most top performers chose to go elsewhere since there are no career opportunities. Promotions and raises are reserved for friends and family.  Frequent re-orgs to move bad management around and try to resolve long festering issues.

Also, when accepting original job agreed to travel of 5-10%, was part of a reorganization where I had no choice on what direction I wanted to go so all customers are outside my home city, nothing local any longer.  On top of traveling for customers (2-3 times a month)  have to travel for group events putting my travel at 75-90%.  Tried speaking to my manager about said topic and I’m told I need to think about my career and instead of helping me prioritize the travel  insinuated that my job is not secure and that I’m letting my colleagues down.  On top of a day to day job where I’m getting beat down by customers, I have no support of my management chain, related to work and the amount of the workload OR my personal life.  I want to laugh at the great place for parents award, I have nobody on my immediate team who is a parent, including my manager so when trying to speak about the above and sharing the impact to my family I am told  I need to think about my career options.  And, performance management.  If you happen to take maternity leave, don’t do it in H2.

Free stocks and drinks","Management is deceptive; they will say one thing to your face, but their actions show otherwise. They ask you to be transparent with them, but they will use the information you give them to their advantage (ie. if they know you will eventually be moving on from Workday, they will not give you any raises or compensation for your past year's review even though an annual review is based on past year's performance and not what you will be doing in the future). DO NOT tell management anything regarding your future plans. 

Some workers on certain teams are incompetent and lazy. Will take long vacations and knowing that their vacation date is coming up, will delay their work and not finish because they know someone else will pick up their slack. Some will always wait until the end of sprints to log bugs or start work so that they can pretend that they were super busy the whole sprint; therefore, the need to roll over stories. 

People are being hired just because they are related to someone who already works here or is someone's friend. For example, the qualification for a QA Engineer job here is at least 5 years minimum in QA. In the QA industry, if you have actually been working for 5 years, you would know what TDD or BDD or other commonly used QA terms mean. I have seen QAs in meetings ask what TDD or BDD mean and have asked for explanations. This tells me that they probably got the job through a family/friend and/or faked their resume to get the job. 

Annual raises is based on how much you suck up to management, and how much they like you. Even if you do all your work and take everything they dump on you, if management doesn't like you, your raises won't be as high as someone who did less work but is a friend of management. 

People using all sorts of excuses on a regular basis to work from home or not come in to work. Here are a few that I've seen: 
-It's hard to turn my steering wheel, I'll be wfh 
-I need to stay home for a package or go home to sign for a package
-I need to go feed my dog/cat
-I have a haircut appointment today, i'll be wfh
-Traffic is heavy right now, i'll be wfh

The best place to work for award? That's total bull. It's what management sends out to their employees every year and asking them to fill out. Of course most employees will always give the company they work for a super high rating."

1370,Workday,Not as advertised,2018-04-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Very talented and hard working coworkers
- Free bagels, snacks and occasional after work perks with your team","- The culture is very toxic, very cliquey made up from former PeopleSoft employees. 
- Management is incompetent, they will lie to your face about ""work culture"" and work values and not live up to integrity that they try to sell to you on day 1. 
- Work/life balance? If it's with the wrong team, you should throw that out the window. There is an unspoken rule to stay as long as you can after work and work as hard as you can on weekends without ""being asked to"".
- If you have a disagreement with management, better keep your mouth shut otherwise you will be blacklisted and blackballed for stating the obvious to make your team better. They can't take any criticism and if you manage to say something, be very wary of the rest of your career at Workday. They are bullies and will single you out at every chance they get. 
- The management training program definitely needs work, these managers are ruining culture not creating it. Diversity only means that you are a person of different ethnic background. Keep quiet about your hobbies, interests and side hustles, it will be used against you forever. You definitely can't be yourself."

• Peer-level colleagues are very good, friendly, open to new ideas
• Good snack program
• First, two year is really very exciting
• Great company for college graduates","• Working days are very long, for a senior engineer position you can expect meetings with the USA till 7 pm (sometimes till 8). And day starts at 9 am. Too many meetings.
• Career growth is very limited (if you have the ambition to grow in  technical ladder, then this company is not for you) -- Some people already complained about favouritism (read other Glassdoor reviews).
• Majority of the managers are good at talking and has less technical knowledge. As this company grows rapidly, this becomes a major issue. Management value people who is a good story teller.
• With the growth of the company, they are becoming more process oriented. This is too much sometimes. 
• Dublin App dev team depends heavily on the USA. Dublin team don't have enough freedom for a technical decision (this is one of the reasons to have so many late night meetings).
• After two years working as an application developer, your learning scope is very limited. Once you have worked in (almost) all xpresso frameworks, there is not much to learn and the job becomes less challenging. 
• Technical interview processes are very easy this is one of the reason lots of candidates (who are not so good technically) got offers."

Remote work opportunities and flexibility.,"Remote work comes with its own challenges, and often groups or individuals can feel very isolated or disconnected from the company at large. Far too many internal systems and communication platforms further confusing where to go for information."
1375,Workday,"It's Good, But . . .",2018-03-24,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Worked here in Workday's Dublin office as a manager for a little while.  Enjoyed my time here but the company is suffering from many of the same issues other company's that are growing very quickly face.  I experienced a lack of cohesive strategy from our VP.  I was often asked to plan for my department's annual strategy without knowing what the overall company objectives would be; asked to prepare a full annual budget two days before it was deadlined to be submitted, and then told to increase headcount in my team and then after months of effort to have it snatched away to be used for another line manager for a new strategy direction that seems to have been plucked out of thin air.  People stay at Workday for quite a while.  I have a feeling that three or four years ago when the company was smaller, the teams were closer and more coherent, and I daresay more in line with the culture that the senior management of the company espouse on a very regular basis.  Now, with so many new faces, that ethos is being diluted and eroded, and the culture is beginning to slip.  But that notwithstanding, the people are great, and I would recommend it as a place to work.","Working as a manager, I found it a difficult environment.  My own manager set for me no goals or objectives, and yet when my end of probation came I was hung out to dry for not making any of the objectives I was not set.  The upper management seems to me to be confused.  The product is good, but a bit buggy, and we have frequent customer outages.  As the company has grown, these outages have increased as the company has been slow to adopt high availability networks and systems, and so the stress is beginning to show in the workforce.  There is also a feeling when discussing with other managers that the flexible working conditions are sometimes abused by those less motivated employees who frequently work from home, and leaving those in the office to prop them up."

I know it’s good to promote internally but sometimes they could look outside for new hires at management role. I found my manager was overally concerned with people’s title and promotion as opposed to leading the team. Perhaps because they had begun their career there at a lower level. I met other managers and was flabbergasted as to how they passed the “culture interview”. My time at Workday was not a happy time down to my manager.

1402,Workday,lucky little corner,2018-01-26,5.0,Security Engineer I,"I've heard and seen people from other teams over-working and rightly complaining about their work-life balance. I've read a couple of bad reviews referring to the security team in the US. That is why I'd like to state how different is my experience instead, within the security team in Ireland, since - as some have pointed out already - it depends on the team you work with. I work in Security in Dublin, Ireland which is divided into different branches: Security Engineering, Risk Mgmt, Security Operation Centre. My team is absolutely awesome. 
Our direct manager is great. We have:
- 1-1 meetings every week and they're always very helpful.
- team sync meetings to keep each other updated on progress (since we often work on distinct projects while collaboratinf with only 1 or 2 others in the team but not everyone) which are very useful. 
We are: 
- encouraged to propose change and innovative projects
- given time to work on PoC the above ideas
- collaborating with other teams to improve the internal security assets.
Whenever there is a problem, we always do as much as we can to mitigate it rather than closing our eyes and ignoring it (as done in some other companies). 
Not only my own manager but also all the others in Security in Dublin are friendly, respectful, approachable, supportive of bottom-up ideas, of work-life balance and of advancing team member's knowledge and career. 
My job is extremely interesting and varied, since we balance between securing loads of different technologies and developing our own security tools plus often running internal pentesting. 
Even though it is hard to find senior sec people we have never lowered the standard in the hiring interviews. 
My manager also gives each of us clear goals for promotions: if met you're in, otherwise out -which is absolutely fair. 
Finally, I've never experienced any sexism at all - which is great nowadays. Indeed, our org and the whole company is full of inspiring women. We even have our own women@workday global group and local ones, which are all fairly active and full of useful initiatives. 
Not to mention:
- perks, snacks, fruit (piles of berries, figs, mangos and avocados), benefits, bonus, stock
- dentist/optician/massage on site
- facilities to work and for entertainment (playstations, xbox, nintendo, table tennis, pool table, etc)
- employees clubs well funded and supportive - help meeting other colleagues while exercising (many are sport-based) and having fun
- giving&doing program - you get money based on the time you spent volunteering for a charity, which can only be used for further donations + your donations to a charity are doubled by the company every time
- the nice people around you wherever you go: in the corridor, kitchen, etc. and all the nice people in the security team in Dublin.","Since in my org the majority of managers are based in Pleasanton, US, there seems to be a bit of a disconnection between the teams over there and us."

We hear it for most of our company meetings -we see people holding up ""I love Workday"" signs as soon as we sign in to Workday software.  First year in or so, things look really good about the company.  It doesn't ""look"" political upon first entry. But oh, how deceiving those first impressions can be.

Many managers and even some higher ups are where they are because they are friends or friends of friends of the people in charge -- not because they are skilled managers.
There are tremendous amount of private clubs in Workday and if you are not in one, of those clubs, you are not a value to the company. Most everyone is out for themselves.

Working for Workday was like a dream.  We are a great company and we are all nice people ... But then ... There is a dark side behind that picture perfect image. The company is full of politics. Your performance mostly doesn't matter (and nobody is really trying to measure it!), it's all about whom you know.
Leaders and managers are not held accountable. HR has done their best to facilitate feedback sessions within organizations. The ending results end up being nothing, as the leaders who receive poor feedback either push back or never change, and even worse, are not required to by their own leaders. As leader is connected with higher up. HR or HR leader are all lip services, not supporting at all and if you go and talk to HR or your leader, you end up losing your job with tag “RIF”. It is heart breaking when you work hard and give your 150% and they treat you unfairly and poorly. 

Management in all area is highly unsupportive of career growth, mid-tier management ""leaders"" are malicious towards their employees. There is a lot of office bullying, public shaming, favoritism and leaders try to form cliques to secure their power. They do not care about their employees, and the work environment is depend on whom you know and how well kiss your management or agree with ""Yes or Sure"" word.

Best advice I can give is if you come here keep your mouth shut and don't try to make a positive difference. DO NOT stand up for what is right because it will only make you a target. You  will loose your job with “RIF” word. Just work on your time and then leave at 5pm."

- near BART and mall","- Come here if you want to sink your engineering career. This place is filled with tech garbage no one really cares for like gerrit, openstack, and nagios. Their platform is built on proprietary language, xpresso, that is useless outside the company.
- Many people come here from companies like SAP, DELL, and EMC to seek shelter and safe heaven under the illusion the Workday HR promotes as the company's ""core values"". 
- Most groups are filled with garbage tech workers - Workday tries to recycle them by placing them into roles they are unfit for.
- Many managers are unsuited for their role. Promotion is run if you have influence in the Peoplesoft's boys club - former Oracle employees.
- The salary is very low, low 401K matching, and subpar benefits. There is no free meals aside of bagels. You will have to spend money around to eat and it is not cheap!
- This place feels like an unionized train station - no one says a negative word about the company, everyone goes ""yes, sir"" or ""yes, ma'am"" to their unqualified supervisors.
- Reviews are completely biased. If you are good friends with your manager or someone above him/her, you will get good reviews.
- HR is useless and a complete waste of company resources. Many don't show up to the office for days, only if there is a team meeting or company event. Many are spending time writing fake great reviews on public sites about Workday's culture.

Overall I've had managers that were promoted from the within and had very little experience in actually developing their employees. Every time I asked for a promotion, my managers would give some sort of excuse as why I am not eligible to be promoted to even level 2. I have mentored others and developed features with absolutely no help. What's even worse is that people on the same org as me get promoted because they have better manager.  Over the years, I have become demoralized with all the politics and excuses. Workday falls true to the adage that you have to jump companies to get those promotions/raises.

It’s pretty amazing to see any customer’s business challenge somehow overcome with success.  That happens at Workday.

A lot of people are genuinely trying to always have fun (it’s part of the culture).","Workday has a great story.  A rise from the PeopleSoft ashes after big bad Oracle came and ruined their party.  The values Dave and Aneel brought and put into Workday at the beginning are great.  The extreme growth of the company has made it near impossible to keep those values in-tact over the last several years, allowing it to unfortunately only exist in pockets.  

If you can find the right team, it’s possible to find a happy home at Workday.  While this is often true at any organization, the risks are greater at Workday, as their leadership has done a poor job to hold managers accountable and keep that culture together.  This is especially true in the Support organization where micro management reigns.

Leaders and managers are not held accountable.  HR has done their best to facilitate feedback sessions within organizations.  The ending results end up being nothing, as the leaders who receive poor feedback either push back or never change, and even worse, are not required to by their own leaders.

The leaders of customer support are notorious for extreme micro management.  It’s common practice to see the VPs and Directors actively commenting on support cases and internal incidents, often when the case or incident is already under control and being processed successfully by an analyst.  When their own people have pushed back to complain that this limits their growth and autonomy, they have been ignored or no action has been taken to try to correct, it’s just the way it is.

There is an extreme lack of accountability and collective team attitude built into Workday’s culture. When things are running smooth, everyone is happy.  Hope and pray you aren’t the one who makes a mistake, because the mindset across orgs is the blame game.  I was shocked to see common attitudes of “This is X’s fault” in this org rather than “How do we work through this together and prevent it in the future”.  This is a cultural problem that stems down from the top.

Career growth and progression are not clear.  Culturally the mindset has been to put the manager in charge of facilitating growth and feedback within their own people.  This is great when the manager is comfortable having career discussions with their people and meets with them frequently.  Given Workday has struggled to coach and train their managers to be successful at this, many managers do a poor job, leaving employees confused on where they stand, and what their future options are, both at Workday and within their existing organization."
1476,Workday,Great Company - awesome talent team,2017-09-27,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"Workday overall is an amazing company to work for. For example, great people, values, culture, work life balance, and steadily increasingly market share. It's tempting to sell your RSUs every quarter, but I could easily see our market share double if not triple in the next few years.

The Talent Acquisition team has gone through a great deal of change over the last year, however, it was much needed - we needed to put on our big boy shoes and build for the future. The leadership team and front line managers have a clear path and direction for the future. Where doubling down on our employees, culture, and building scalable hiring processes that will help us double and triple in the years to come.","Sometimes it's easy to get frustrated with the lack of urgency and passion from  a minority of colleagues, but I feel like our recent hiring has emphasized quality over quality and we are finally getting the talent the company deserves."

Software is updated every six months and the employees are required to update their certification.","The problem is with the employees themselves. There seems to be an unwritten rule to never ask a question if you need help. The response you will receive, if you ask a question, is to dig deeper into the software and you will find the answers.

The consultants are given the same training the clients are given, the examples in Community. This needs to change as Workday signs larger clients. Workday needs to invest in training consultants and the more complex issues of larger clients.

There is really no training for employees. If you come from a company that really trains employees on the system, has a mentoring system where you can reach out to others for answers and really has collaboration among it's employees, then Workday is not for you.
There are tremendous amount of private clubs in Workday and if you are not in one,  of those clubs, you are not a value to the company. Most everyone is out for themselves and the next promotion.
I have personally attended meeting and events and never had anyone even speak to me. Not even a current or former manager.
People will not hesitate to stab you in the back or throw you under the rug to protect themselves or to elevate themselves in front of management.
 You will be unable to reach utilization because of partner involvement. Partners will get the biggest majority of the work at Workday.

1495,Workday,Great Company- Talent Acquisition morale at an all time low and no longer cohesive,2017-08-29,3.0,Recruiter,"I love Workday, I love the people and up to recently the values.
Workday has a great company culture with an exciting and emerging product range. I truly believe our founders and CEO's David and Aneel believe in the company’s values as do most of great people I have had the pleasure of working with. While challenges naturally exist when you are partnering with business stakeholders I can say without hesitation that recruiters in Workday are respected and valued by business partners/hiring managers. This review is not something I could ever have imagined writing abut Workday.","Previous leadership team was not perfect; many of us were excited for the next stage TA and the new challenges ahead with new leadership. While not perfect I must say we had transparency and a clear road map of our goals. Morale was high and 90% of us were committed to delivering above and beyond for our hiring managers.  The goals were challenging but we faced them as a team. Many of us faced long hours and we were extremely busy but we didn’t care because we had a united team and believed we were a key cog in creating one of the greatest companies on earth.

In contrast the last 8 months have seen a gradual decline in morale, team cohesiveness and job security.  We no longer feel like we provide a valuable contribution to the growth of this awesome company and now feel like a cost to the business. Permanent team members feel their job security is diminished and that their contribution over the last few years has been forgotten; some vocally and others privately are actively looking for new roles. Contract employees who joined believing that if they contributed they could have an amazing future here now feel that their stay is temporary.  New managers and old have been asked to promote and implement new goals in our “transformation” without any road map or idea of how it will happen in reality.  

The toughest part of the current set up is that we are becoming less motivated, less willing to go the extra yard for the company and it is our partners and hiring managers who will be impacted.  Unfortunately it is very easy to create “wins” and a perception of successes when the reality is we are suffering and it will impact how we deliver to our customers and promote Workday to our candidates in the medium and long term."

I took a pay cut to enter into this seemingly culture and employee focused company. The truth is, my dreams quickly became a nightmare once I joined. Management in Services is highly unsupportive of career growth, they are doing massive layoffs masked in different phases, mid-tier management ""leaders"" are malicious towards their employees. There is a lot of office bullying, public shaming, favoritism and leaders try to form cliques to secure their power. They do not care about their employees, and the work environment is highly hostile. I come into work everyday dreading and hoping that I will one day get out of this black hole. Life keeps getting worse as more malicious leaders gain power in the company. At this point, I, as well as many other co-workers are suffering and have a gloomy outlook on our future here. Many have left, and many are getting laid off. No one knows about their tomorrow."
1510,Workday,Applications Development (QA) 1.5 years in...,2017-07-13,5.0,QA Engineer,"There was a dark point less than a year after I joined where I thought maybe I would be better off somewhere else.  They had grown so rapidly that things were becoming chaotic and we didn't have enough folks who knew the product well and we also had very demanding customer commitments.  Even though I liked my team I felt like I did not have the resources to be successful.

This all sounds like a con but its not...because s**t happens and at some companies nothing would ever change and eventually you would just give up and find a better job.

HOWEVER, at Workday I have seen coordinated effort from management (mid-level) from Dev, QA and PM to get our product area back on track including changing peoples roles so that their skills are maximized and adding additional headcount to fill open roles (who have the right skill set).  I have also seen team re-shuffling (in order to increase cohesiveness) as well as managers on all teams being aligned in goals and counseling their teams to ensure we all work together as well as possible and are as successful as possible.

Things are not perfect but our direct managers have made swift efforts to address things that are going wrong (with support of higher level managers).  I have confidence that as issues crop up our managers in dev/qa/pm will be able to work together to make things right.

Additional Pros:

-Management (high level) has made significant investment in providing training to development teams on a multitude of things (product area, agile principles etc).
-We are constantly being surveyed on various topics so that management can get a better idea of our needs.
-Pay was so-so when I arrived but I guess management realized that they needed to pay better and I saw a generous adjustment to get me to a more competitive pay (and I didn't need to ask).
-I really like my teammates.  Even when we have disagreements we ultimately can find common ground because we truly want to do the right thing for workday and the customers.  It is like our north star.
-Managers got feedback from the folks working for them and I don't know the exact details but high scoring public managers were publicly recognized and folks seem to know who the low scoring managers are through word of mouth.  This has put pressure on those managers who got poor marks to do better. 
-Promotions do not appear SUPER hard to get if your boss thinks you are a high performer.  You might have to jump some hurdles or put in some time but its not like its not going to happen.
-There seems to also be lateral mobility between qa/pm/dev (depending on skillset).
-People are for the most part smiling/happy/nice/friendly which really brightens your mood.
-Lots of employee-centric events.  I participated to bring your parent to Workday and Bring your dog to Workday and they were a blast.
-Lots of wellness offerings (new workout center, meditation classes etc)
-People who are passionate.  You will find likely find some sort of Workday sponsored group/event in something you are interested in (Volunteering, Ping Pong, Book Clubs etc)
-If you work in App Dev you may never need to buy another t-shirt as we are constantly getting them for some event or another.","-Management seems to be following their own version of agile for the way they run their teams (ie fast iterations and fail fast).  That is good and bad.  They are willing to try new things but it can also be distracting because it feels like there is always something new coming down the pipeline or scrapping some way of doing something etc.  You definitely have to be able to embrace change.
(as a side note the pro side of this is they are not scared to throw something out the window that is not working for people and they are open to trying new ways to do things if it could make things better in some way).

-I've seen some arrogant managers make some doofus decisions despite getting an absurd amount of feedback that it is a bad idea (and yet they do it anyway).  Workday is not a perfect utopia and these people exist but I'm thinking/hoping that there are less of them at Workday."

There is a lot of finger pointing and political games.  Workday is a mini Oracle.

1520,Workday,"Good people, fair work, better than I expected",2017-06-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've been with Workday for about six months now, and figured it's as good of a time as any to leave a review. Before working at Workday, I was at an agency making mobile apps on contract, and before that I was with a robotics startup that had an awesome product, but killer hours. Coming in to Workday, I was a more than a little skeptical  given that it's a fairly big company in a not-so-exciting field (HR software). The main reason I decided to give it a chance was the recommendation of a former co-worker who also works here. Overall it turned out to be a great decision. A few of the pros:

* Reasonable working hours - you're not constantly working like a startup
* Great pay/stock - they know how to use the carrot to motivate, and I'm OK with that
* Awesome people - I work directly with a lot of good engineers, and have definitely learned a lot/grown in just the last few months that I've been here. There's definitely a focus on creating maintainable and extendable software
* Not stagnating with latest patterns - there's been a lot of new tech coming out for our platform in the last year or so, and we've been able to incorporate it into our product so our skills aren't just stagnating and getting stale.
* Pretty flexible with time spent in the office - I have some medical things that can sometimes stop me from going in pretty frequently, and it hasn't been a problem. We can take our laptops home and there's systems in place for being able to get up and running as if I were hooked up to the office network.","Surprisingly, no major cons. I was just talking about work with my girlfriend the other day and didn't have anything major to complain about (aside from the obvious ""meh, I had to work and deal with things"" that you'll have anywhere - that is why we're paid, right?), and I don't think I ever have.

Three different VP's in 11 months. I would only work here if your direct manager is someone you trust and will give you the time it takes to get your deals off the ground.  On average it takes 1.5-2 yrs to close a deal.  There are way too many AE's covering to few accounts.  All the low hanging fruit is covered and it still takes a very long time to close those deals. As much as they talk about Workday core values they do not apply to sales.  AE's are way to competitive with each other because they are desperate to close a deal.  Not very collaborative.  Managers work on deals independently of their AE's. Seems crazy.  I don't understand why they don't assign them to an AE and focus on managing, leading and supporting their team."

Our product offerings are best in our space, and the overall temperament of the company culture is above average.  I also truly believe that our CEO's, Aneel and Dave, genuinely believe in our core values.  This review is solely based on the current Talent Acquisition team/leadership.","Previous leadership in Talent Acquisition, while it may not have been perfect, was unifying, empowering and positive.  The team felt driven and supported.  It was indeed a ""great place to work.""  There was transparency in the communications out to the team,  and consistency in  their message, mission and the treating employees with fairness and integrity.  There has been many changes within the last 6+ months, and the general consensus is that our current leads/leadership is impersonal, calculating and cold.  There are managers who would be prefer to not have to manage people but who are forced to in order to move up the ranks, and there are managers who should not have been promoted to a lead role because of a lack of experience.  Along with that, there is a reorg going on in the group, and lots of movement.   Both contract employees and full time are being treated as if they are quite disposable and feeling very unappreciated and unnerved.  Morale is at an all time low and the overall vibe is quite toxic.   Even people who act as if they are content have their eye on the market.  A lot of us that have been here awhile feel if it wasn't broke, why try to fix it?

Really, how could you roll something like that out to 7500+ employees.  It's not cheaper than going straight to airline websites and recently I've experienced I can't even rack up hotel points on certain reservations through the tool because of the website the tool is pulling from.  For example,  members can earn person account points when booking through the workday travel tool and the tool pulls their rate/reservation through Expedia.  How is that my fault as an employee??  Further more, certain teams at Workday force you to use the corporate card because it ultimately gives Workday cash back. 

So let me get this straight...I have to book through the travel tool (corporate policy) can't earn any points at my hotel, and then can't earn any credit card points because Workday needs the points back?  Really takes out Employees come first to heart huh.  This company is still as cheap as the pre ipo days...it's sad"

The company has employees as their core value but this is just a ride to the uninformed and the outside world. If you need support from your manager, he's not there. Favoritism runs rampant in the office and not the best or most deserving person gets promoted, but the person who brown noses most."

This is honestly a great place to work. The company and the people genuinely care about you. Management gives you all the tools you need to succeed, and they are generally very open about encouraging PTO (it's unlimited) to make sure nobody is overworked.","There's really no two ways around this, but the proprietary ""language"" XpressO is not going to do anyone with further career aspirations any good. There are little to no transferable skills, and in general, it is just frustrating to use. Even the more ""traditional"" software engineering roles are hamstrung by the fact that the company revolves about XpressO. This creates an environment where people are either frustrated in their current positions or have been resigned to being stuck in those positions -- either is not ideal."

Expect to have a lot expected of you and to be surrounded by people who strive to better themselves and learn something new every day.  Also, the work/life balance and flexibility is as good as it gets.  Work from home whenever you need to, as long as you get your job done.","Workday is still a fairly new company and is still growing and learning.  I think they need to focus on their benefits offering at their regional offices.  Headquarters may have free parking, but in Boston it's pretty standard for a company of Workday's size to offer a commuter subsidy.  However, only the pre-tax deduction is offered.  The 401k match just started in 2016, which is great.  But, I hope it grows to be more than the cap of a $3k match.  Also, the company has an unlimited PTO policy, which is great for anyone who is NOT in the professional services part of the organization.  In professional services, there are billable hours targets that must be met to receive your bonus, and they only give you a 3 week PTO ""credit"" (i.e. any PTO time or other non-billable time, including the mandatory training and meetings, over 3 weeks has to be made up to achieve your target)."

1547,Workday,Workday has lost sight of what they claim to be all about.,2017-04-29,1.0,Engineer,"* The employee perks are very nice.
* The compensation is competitive.
* Work / life balance is good.","Here is what Workday supposedly stands for according to their website:

""Our core values give us a framework for leadership and daily decisions, and help us enjoy our time at work.""

""Most fundamentally, people are the core of our business. Without them, we would not have a business. We hire the best and expect great accomplishments.""

""Every investment and decision we make has our customers in mind, and we pull out all stops to make the satisfaction of our customers paramount.""

""We say what we mean, and mean what we say. We stick to our commitments, treat everyone equitably, and communicate openly and honestly.""

Unfortunately, absolutely none of this is true.

For one thing, there are way too many managers and they only seem to care about what they are told to do (from other managers).   They don't take advice nor do they listen to the people that make the company go.  The company has lost sight of what's important.  It's only a matter of time before the internal failures start to break down causing degradation of customer satisfaction.  This in turn will be what causes Workday's eventual demise. 

If you want to go to a place where your opinion doesn't matter.   
If you want to be at a place where you work your tail off without any recognition.
If you are a YES SIR and YES MAM person.
If you want to go to a place where the internal workings change from day to day and nobody seems to know what's right or wrong from day to day.
If you enjoy finger pointing and blame.
If you want to work under the bad management.
If you enjoy being called out for mistakes and not being recognized for the things you do right.

Then Workday IS the place for you!

But if you want great leadership,  people who listen and respect you and believe in team work, I'd recommend going somewhere else where they will actually appreciate you."

1549,Workday,Sales,2017-04-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Good money and excellent application. We use Workday at Workday and it's a great system.,"Terrible culture. Sales is cut throat. You are merely a # and it's a terrible mentality. Treated like slaves. If you don't work in the CA office, you are not getting the ""great culture"" experience the company preaches."
1550,Workday,Generally Best Company To Work For,2017-04-25,5.0,Product Support Analyst,"Product: I worked in Support so I deal with bugs and issues all day. I still think it's a great quality product. Amazing and constantly developing to become better. Truly is industry leading and the leadership/ talent involved with product development is truly inspired. Workday releases new features every 6 months, which keeps them on the cutting edge and crushes competition. 
Company: The leadership really does focus on the company’s core values in order to have an amazing culture. Recently there have been complaints that culture was slipping because of hyper growth. What did leadership do? They flew every manager in the company and hosted a conference to help managers lead with their strengths and improve their weaknesses. For a company to spend time and money on something like this, truly shows their dedication to improve Workday. They really do focus on employees, the best they can.
They do so many activities and contests to make things fun. I'm pretty sure every department is encouraged to hold quarterly events, whether it be the team going to a movie or helping out at a local food bank. 
Workday also is VERY big on service and gives you money towards your charity of choice as you spend your time. Every year Workday has ""cangineering"" which is a canned food drive. Every office has a chance to build a sculpture out of cans of food. Then the company votes on which one they like most (just a fun competition). After, all of the food donated is given to the local food bank. Workday even gives money to each office to spend of cans of food.
Employees: Workday truly cares about your career growth. Now, I'm sure that may vary from department to department, but I feel generally it's true. They would like you to stay at one position for at least 18 months before transferring to another.
Support Position: Even though you are expected to work certain times to support issues, management is flexible with your schedule and understands you have a life out of work. I feel it's a great work life balance. However you are currently required to work a ""late shift"" for a week, once a quarter. It's not the best, but they give you 2 comp days off and $500 bonus for doing it. You can also work from home during that time if you want. I think that's a pretty fair trade off.
Benefits: I think the benefits are great! There are a few insurance options. For about $500 a month for a family, there isn't a deductible, $20 co-pays, $150 co-pay for hospital visits (Cost me $300 for a baby!), ""Free"" outpatient surgery. For around $70 a month, you can get a high deductible plan, however Workday puts the whole deductible in your HSA!

It was amazing working for Workday. Definitely a winning product, team and culture. Maybe someday I will return! :)","There is pressure to perform and sometimes it can feel like your being micro-managed instead of trusted, especially when you are a new-hire. It may be just the sub-culture in Support. However, if you have a positive attitude about it, you will become better at your job quickly.

It seems that unless you work at a major office (Pleasanton, Dublin & New Zealand), your career development seems limited."

Workday has proven time and time again it's committed to both it's employees and it's customers.  The second is a product of the former and Senior Leadership knows it.  I have never seen any company invest as much time and effort in making sure it's culture remains in tact as it continues to grow.

The technology to some may be a stumbling block but that's only because they allow it to be.  For those who see it's value it molds them into better engineers who take the skills they learn in this technology and apply it elsewhere.

Overall, I enjoy getting up and going to work.  Partly it's because of what I do, mostly it's because of where I do it.","Too many smart people!  It's hard to stand out in a group of engineers who are so talented and passionate.  It's not a very good ""con"" but it's the hardest part about working at Workday but also one of the parts that helps me grow as a professional.

It is very possible to pursue different departments, though we are notorious for the tough job transition months where you're holding different roles. The work is increasingly interesting as we fight for market share, and our product just keeps getting better. From our Product and Support and Strategy organizations, to Product Marketing, Corporate Marketing, Services and Sales - people here care and are highly competent compared to industry counterparts.

Management incredibly transparent/honest for the most part. Definitely some politics and reorging, but to be expected in our growing pains stage.

Benefits are solid, and we got 401k match last year. Perks are good. We do have a snack program, but actual meals would be better. Cafeteria coming when we build out our new building in Pleasanton.

Much of the company is flexible with working from home - however, this doesn't permeate to every department. Over my three years here, I've had several family emergencies requiring me to take time off, and WDAY truly felt like a family checking up on me during these times. Even on bad days, I walk around and think ""these are just plain good people.""

We're all shareholders and that is taken seriously. Everyone driving toward the same goal of having happy customers. 

Diversity of interests is welcomed, and you can get involved with a lot of different clubs and interest groups.

Workday is on the up and up financially...we're growing responsibly at a fast clip.","We've had surveys about benefit improvements, have signed the equal pay pledge, and some are receiving comp adjustments accordingly. However, pay is still below average on balance.

We're improving at this, but haven't always had a solid process that is consistent across teams for development/promotion. It can be difficult to get fair raises, keep pace with inflation within the cyclical reviews, but even more difficult (but possible) to get comp correction off-cycle.

If you're not happy, this is a tough place to be, as there is a strong culture of having fun and being the best place to work. Sometimes it feels like overkill. Lot of koolaid drinking. :) But it is delicious koolaid.

Politics within Senior Management - As with any company, there are a few bad apples. Don't tolerate this behavior - it isn't aligned with our core values. Seen some situations where HR didn't always do ""the right thing."""

1598,Workday,Sales Unfriendly,2017-02-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Has potential but things are shifted around way too often. It is difficult to maintain consistency to be effective when momentum is stifled.,The best accounts are shifted to certain favorites. A plan is developed and then changed without giving it a chance. Knee-jerk reactions would be the best way to describe it.
1599,Workday,Software Applications Engineer,2017-02-15,3.0,Software Applications Engineer,Follows Agile/scrum practices well and good collaborative/team atmosphere.,Technology is too difficult to learn quickly.

1600,Workday,Not a sales friendly company,2017-02-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are by far the best I've ever seen.,Constant shifting of territories so you never are able to create or keep prospects that you have nurtured over many years.

1601,Workday,"Join Workday at your own peril, all that glitters is not gold...",2017-02-14,1.0,Product Specialist,"1) Cool and modern looking UI
2) HCM product sells itself, not so sure of the other products especially Financials.
3) Free snacks; but come-on how much snacks can you eat?
4) Great Halloween party","1) Level of politics in a company of this small size is simply unbelievable especially in the product side.  Most of the old timers who architected and designed the products and brought the company to the level it is currently at, have left the company.  This is a playground of extreme politics and blatant favoritism.

2) Success came too easy for Workday since SAP & Oracle apps sucked big time with the general trend to the cloud. This easy success has caused many of the management folks here at WD to get really arrogant and play extreme, petty politics.  The fact that there are far too many middle-aged white women in  management positions across the company, helps in increasing the degree of workplace politics.

3) In an attempt to grow fast, WD let the guard down and opened the flood gates while hiring; and promoted people to management levels based on who they knew/their connections rather than abilities.  This has caused WD to become a ""garbage recycle center"" for ""rejects"" from Cisco, Oracle, Amazon and ex-PeopleSoft (the old boys club of PeopleSoft!).

4) CEO and top management are obessesed with company ratings on this website.  Rumor is that, it is someone's full-time job within HR is to flag any negative reviews and get them removed.  The CEO also sends out emails to employees ""encouraging"" them to take part in the ""best places to work"" survey.  By hook or crook they want to paint a pretty picture of the company.  Are they planning to put this company up for sale?

5) Based on an internal employee survey few months back, to identify reasons for poor employee morale, some managers were moved out of their management positions to other individual contributor roles.  These managers should have been fired but instead, they were offered other roles.  If by any chance you set up a skip-meeting with the VP/SVP of your group, your immediate manager gets to know about it instantaneously!  So much for their transparency and open door policy!  Almost everything seems to be an eye-wash or fake.  Other companies that do not claim to be employee friendly have better processes and do not put on a show."

The Workday system is definitely not something you can grasp overnight and then put a feather in your cap.  And my experience has been that this was never the expectation.

Many of the old peoplesoft guard get the plum management positions and they are not nearly as qualified as the women who have proven themselves capable and are not even considered for the roles.

Generally speaking the management is terrible. They are lucky that the teams are motivated and love selling the product in spite of their management team.

Exposure to a lot of technologies.

Free snacks are great. 

Easy to work from home. For the most people no overtime.","The elephant in the room is the below market compensation. Bay Area is a very pricy place and it's hard to be a happy employee excited about the company when your paycheck is below what your peers in other places make. The days of dreaming about Workday stock hitting $500 are gone and the harsh reality is settling in. 

Low efficiency. You think that Workday is a cool company and you think I can get by on a low salary but I'm going to learn something, how about that? Workday does have some nice tricks to learn. It's core HCM product is competitive, customer support is great, finance team is above and beyond, there are bright people here and there. But overall Workday is extremely inefficient. While its major competitors are highly profitable, Workday just can't figure out how to make money. It drags a lot of useless individuals and whole teams, its data centers are underutilized, it's acquiring other companies and developing products and they just don't bring profits in.  

Career dead end technologies. Workday tries to reinvent the wheel in many ways. A lot of developers are using a proprietary language called Xpresso - stay as far as you can! It's core products are using in house developed software - same story, very proprietary, not being used outside of Workday. I guess it helps companies to keep salaries low because after a few years it's hard to find jobs outside - this is something to consider.

What happens when you put together a lot of people who can't find jobs outside of this company, keep them working on reinventing the wheel and under pay? Yes, right. Politics, secrecy, nepotism - other reviewers have mentioned it many times and it is true."

There are cool company events (the latest picnic and Halloween were below average but still not bad).

On a more serious note, it's a large company with a lot of people and projects, it is well known in ERP world and has some very competitive products.","Speaking about irony ...  Workday  sales pitch is based around helping customers to make data driven decisions. You give us your data and we help you to make sense out of them. Not just review, but analyze and react, or, even better, be proactive. Great! However, for some reason internally Workday does exactly opposite. It avoids making data driven decisions. Setting clear goals and measuring the results? Feedback on the managers? Defining clear requirements for a promotion? Review of the projects? Measuring efficiency? Public metrics? No! Secrecy becomes an integral part of how the company operates. Sometimes we get people hired nobody knows why. Then people disappear without any explanation. Projects get started then cancelled - no explanations either. Security is increasingly based on obscurity. The technical debt is exploding. We are doing more and more work with less and less progress. And as many reviewers mentioned, the compensation is below market. 

If a lot of pointless work for little pay doesn't scare you away - you're welcome to join - and it should be easier by looking at the turnover numbers."

It's not like they are failing, but there is much more to be achieved, and we will see if the gamble will pay off. 

When it comes to recruiting for engineers, the hiring bar is wildly inconsistent. I know some crazy talented people who got rejected first round, and then some mediocre people who breezed their way in. This is unacceptable if we want to grow the company in a healthy way. There are some crazy great engineers here, who are balanced out by mediocre talent.

Like everyone else has said, pay is below the market. This can be fixed if we stop hiring masses, and choose engineers more selectively."

Quality over quantity should be the mindset in recruiting, but as a new grad, I've seen extremely brilliant (and friendly) people get rejected from this company, and not-so-brilliant people get in, which astounds me. 
Salary is a huge issue; everyone knows the Workday does not pay enough, probably 15k under the market for new grads alone. If we want Workday's engineering reputation to increase, you cannot continue paying people so little. You are giving the truly talented engineers less reasons to choose Workday over other companies."

The people who built it were visionaries and their vision will be paying off for years to come and keep the company going.,"This is surely not a company it used to be. 

For example, security. It was one of the foundation stones and the security team had a strong unified voice influencing key decisions. Now it's fragmented, pushed down the org chart, confused and powerless. 

The management is in denial. While HCM is going strong, Workday new products are just not competitive.  Ask sales about the Financials. And there is no accountability.

HR is ignoring nepotism and diversity issues. The compensation is lagging. Highly political culture."

The product is more modern than competitors, so the company is in a very good place to expand. Culture and values are decent as a whole.","The talent pool is diluting as the company is trying to expand and hire as quickly as possible. Nepotism is rampant...family members on other family member's teams, alumni going to their respective schools and recruiting mediocre people because they like them, or they know them...it seems like nobody is kept accountable for the new hires. 
this company is truly on the path of becoming Oracle if there is no change...PLEASE look at all other companies who have expanded correctly...Google implemented hiring committees to stop this nepotism from ruining their talent, and look at where they are..their name still has that prestige, people know they are a good company, and that they make great products."
1659,Workday,Workday / Should be Work All Day and Night,2016-10-31,2.0,Regional Sales Manager,The darling HR product but definitely not the darling Finance product.,"The good days are gone. No Work life balance. Worked all day and night.  A lot of people that are just fake.  Sales Management uses the ""F"" bombs and a lot of pressure which is not motivating.  Remote sales reps get bullied into going into the office which is mostly empty for face time except for certain meetings.  Pushing their financials which is not top rated with finance folks.  Unfortunately the culture is turning into Oracle.  Look elsewhere."
1660,Workday,"It's a legendary company, but mostly due to its past",2016-10-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a huge company. There are a lot of opportunities here. Some are better than others. And there are a lot of interesting people. When you read the other reviews and find something really positive or really negative - they both could be true. In a company of this scale your immediate team/project/manager may have more impact on your personally than ""the average"" company culture. Yes, not everyone gets lucky to find a golden nugget, but some people do and Workday still has a lot of golden nuggets to be found.

While Workday is becoming a typical large corporation with a lot of doublespeak, paranoid restrictions to prevent liabilities (hey, what have you done to our coveted Halloween party? With all new restrictions like now power extenders, nothing too scary, etc - a lot of top teams from the past years just took this year off completely. It was probably middle school grade level this year with a bunch of paper decorations hanging on PVC pipes... Really!?), it still has some really good values.

It does value families.  If you need to take a day off or adjust your schedule because of your kids - they managers do accommodate. 

It helps students to start their careers. 

It values the customers. 

I can keep this list going.","Having said all these good things about Workday, why do I have so negative opinion about Workday? Because it is really frustrating. Yes, it's a nice workplace with a lot of meant-to-be-right statements. But do they make workers happy and satisfied? Based on what I see around me the answer is predominantly No. There is a lot of dissatisfaction and frustration in the air.

Why? 

People want to make a difference with what they do. For the most of us it is not an option. We are given confusing directions, no clear planning, no clear goals or metrics. We do a lot of work but a lot of that work is pointless and feedback is not welcome.

Then the tools. Just imagine how a good cook would feel being asked to prepare a dinner with a dull knife. Think about it. Imagine a ripe tomato in your hand and a dull knife and instead of slicing it nicely you get that ugly squashed red mess. Would it be frustrated? Or yeah! This is how we feel here every day. Or basic internal ticketing system is having issues. Our builds are failing. Our internal language is so weird - a lot of people see it as a career dead-end-move. 

Then the policies. The ""do what I say not what I do"" mentality is everywhere. We have a very few documented processes and procedures and they are routinely violated. 

Career path. Some people do get promoted. I just don't know how and what to do to be promoted. Can someone tell us?

The the compensation. It is below the market. In the early days it was all about we are going to build a successful company and it's going to pay off. Now we've built a company and guess what? We need to be profitable ... One reason after another, but our compensation stays low.

Finally, the overall ""doublespeak"" from the top managers. Back in the days we had open door policy. With a very few exceptions It was ok to go to meetings you're not invited to  and learn what is going on. Skipping levels of management was ok. Talking to your bosses boss was normal. Now all those things are gone. We see things go wrong and the answer now is secrecy and obscurity. 

It all adds up."
1661,Workday,"This is not the company you're looking for, move along",2016-10-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work-life balance but depends on your group. Somewhat good culture but again, depends on your group. Nice people. Company cares about customer satisfaction and seems to be a disruptor in the ERP space.","Used to be a darling among startups, now just another company. Was once great, has potential to be great again (haha) in a few years, but avoid right now during this awkward and undesirable time. Workday sells their culture but that is nebulous and depends on your group. Workday uses the culture to cover up issues that would turn people away. Proprietary code only goes so far. Rampant hiring without being purposeful. Immature recent college-grad workforce and inexperienced managers. Deadweight pre-IPO people. Salaries embarrassingly below market. Don't expect to be rewarded for being a good soldier or even promotion. Location is so far away from the Bay Area and no shuttles to help out with this. Parking is actually becoming a real problem. Impossible to find a spot after 9:45am, high rate of break-ins, and a history of cars being stolen."
1662,Workday,Great company culture and top-notch engineers,2016-10-28,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"If anything, Workday is great at three things - having fun, rewarding talent, and creating a great product. The engineering staff is brilliant and great ideas are rewarded and embraced by management. The engineering culture is 'no divas, no cowboys' and this encourages teams to cultivate growth in new members as opposed to isolating them in the shadow of senior team members. Workday engineers are less concerned with job titles and more concerned about collaborating to create a stellar product which we can all truly believe in.","As is the case with cloud computing, there are a lot of moving parts which make up the Workday product, and many of them are Workday proprietary. So, if you do not like to learn new things, this might not be the job for you. But if you love being on the cutting edge of tech and enjoy new challenges, then you will thrive."
1663,Workday,More than just a job,2016-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked with some great people and for some great employers.  Workday stands out among the other organizations in my personal employment history as a place that really cares about treating employees well.  Yes, our goal is to deliver software that delights our customers, helping them manage various aspects of their business.  My daily reward comes from the terrific group of people that I get to work with on this journey.  Through the various recruiting pings that I get regularly, I'm reminded that there are many places I can go and work, probably many of them would even pay me more.  I choose to go to Workday everyday, to work hard with smart people I call friends for a company that cares.",No doubt our company is seeing some challenges as we grow.  I see some employees having what I think of as the wrong expectations of what the company should do for them.  This place was made great by hard working people that help one another.  Follow that lead and we'll all be fine.

1666,Workday,"The old culture is gone, now it's just another boring ERP behemoth",2016-10-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Workday had an excellent chance 10 years ago when it was way ahead of the market with a great product and more importantly, outstanding culture. And it did manage to capitalize. The IPO was great and it is a big name in HCM business now.

The product is still very competitive and the customers love it.","Unfortunately, it looks like the best days are over. Workday is kicking off more and more projects, but they don't get completed well and don't integrate one with another. There are a lot of things I can't tell publicly, but under the hood the product is becoming a mess with more and more holes. 

The culture became very weird.  The management states the values it used to honor but no longer does. We've been asking about management reviews and it's been promised many times but just never happened. Probably too many managers are not interested to make it happen. The management keeps constantly changing marching orders and it results in many projects in flux.  

As many people stated, the compensation is way below the market. And the career growth - it's not like it's not happening, people do get promoted, but if you want to figure out what you personally need to get done to be promoted - good luck with that. One day we have a campaign to promote GWs, then we hire from outside, then promote from inside. It may played out well for people who got promoted like this, but if you're an average hard worker - you'd be completely lost of what your career path is.

While on average people don't work much, some key people are definitely worked until they get burned out. I see a lot of stress due to that around. But HR is ignoring that.

I can keep going on and on, but I think you see the point. Sure, it's not the worst company in the business, but it's not a top tier employer any longer and the culture is deteriorating.  More importantly, the top management is still in the denial stage where they believe that they are almost perfect and ignoring systemic issues (like lack of management accountability/reviews), that means it's going to get much worse before it gets better."
1667,Workday,The party is over,2016-10-20,2.0,,"Early on the this company was exciting to work for, smart people working together. The ethic was more about exacting revenge on Oracle, they were the enemy. People did 'whatever it takes' to make Workday successful.","The last couple of years has seen a massive influx of mediocre talent, with a very bad dose of company politics. One of DAD's ethos is to never be afraid to speak up and question something that doesn't seem right. Sadly, doing so in today's Workday is career ending. Nepotism runs rampant, age discrimination and did I say mediocre talent are much the norm."

Workday has excellent student programs, it's actually so good that some people are complaining that non Generation Workday hires feel left out. There is a lot of diversity on the lower levels (what about the top level? Just go to the company website and open the leadership page and make your own opinion ...)","A lot of issues were repeatedly brought up in the previous reviews. For some reasons the company is refusing measure results based on some objective data. Instead it is all about subjective opinions. While Workday is proud about the good things it does, it is in complete denial about numerous failed and mediocre projects and teams and they continue to produce technical debt at very high rate. We routinely try to solve the same problem in many ways and instead of trying to choose the most efficient ones we keep dragging the obsolete and inefficient things on. Over time it's becoming increasingly frustrating when instead of doing something productive we end up burning most of the time on politics, reinventing wheel and getting through ever growing mess of technologies and policies. 

Yes, our HR products are still very competitive. But our internal culture is deteriorating quickly and it will eventually impede our ability to move forward.

Many of the negative reviews seem to come from Pleasanton, particularly on the development side and from longer tenured employees. I am a bit newer and do not work in Pleasanton. 


Here's a frank review:


The Workday infrastructure is incredible. They provide you with a tremendous amount of resources in order to succeed: mentorship programs, constant training, multiple weekly optional webinars to learn, a learning resource complete with courses, guides, and very detailed videos, an incredible amount of material from research reports to best practices, and a culture of helping. All my coworkers (or workmates as we like to call them) go above and beyond to help - the culture is really to try and remove ego and collaborate. Perhaps I got lucky with a good location and a good manager. 


There are many Oracle, SAP, and ADP transplants which may dilute the culture as some have complained, but as a newer employee, I think the culture is wonderful. The interview process is very collaborative to ensure that talented team players with a positive mentality become a part of the company. I initially interviewed with 5 people and had follow up mini interviews with 3 more. 


A competitive culture: this company wants to win. They celebrate wins and take a honest look at losses. The organization believes in its vision and I love how we stress 'Taking the High Road' and winning with integrity. There is a lot of mud slinging out there.


The software is supported with attentive care and it shows in the product. Like any software, its not without its flaws including proprietary technology - but it works well. From what I can see, Workday is heavily invested in their clients' success, I feel this is a rarity amongst  older software companies I've worked for.","There are many smart people here - you will feel dumb or outclassed at times. Track to promotions can be difficult because of the talent. 


Workday seems to provide a modicum of autonomy across different geographic areas. Different geographies have different ideas on how to achieve goals while maintaining Workday's guidelines. 


Yes there does seem to be some cliquishness between the old guard and the newer folks - this is understandable because they've worked together so long, have become friends, and had to struggle when the company was much weaker competitively. Some older tenured employees do seem to be riding the gravy train at times. In this day and age, you can't just ride tenure. You have to back it up with performance. Your tenure may buy you a little respect initially but if you can't back it up, you'll lose it quickly and then some. Any interactions I've had with older guard have been neutral or positive. Forming meaningful relationships takes time but there is always an underlying level of respect. It is hard to get hired here, afterall. 


Workday has been scaling tremendously and with that comes growing pains and more layers of management. I believe this is necessary, however. It simply does not make sense to have 1 manager oversee 50 employees. The structure is broken down so that individual managers help 5-10 people and can give attention to their reports. Due to growth, some got promoted to managers while others didn't. Missing out on that promotion can be a source of frustration which is understandable. Again, tenure should not be the sole metric of promotion. Performance matters.


Like any organization big or small, there's politics. If you're naive enough to believe any company, organization, or even church doesn't have its own internal politics, I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona to sell you."

1718,Workday,Thinking about joining Workday?,2016-08-05,2.0,,"Workday has some bright sides. If you're graduating and not sure where to go - Workday could be a good place. The Generation Workday and Internships programs here are excellent. You'll be surrounded by care and given many chances to find what suites well. 

I'm also proud about our facilities team. The free snacks and drinks are excellent and the offices are clean and nice. Employee programs are well above average.

There are some bright and sharp people here and there and if you're looking for a mentor or a good teammate - that's possible. 

However, I do talk to a lot to students and while a few years ago Workday was one of the coolest places to be it's definitely losing it's glory now. It may help you to get started quickly, but it won't get you far. A lot of processes and technologies Workday is using are either not marketable or far from being cutting edge or best practices. So make sure you absorb the best and not the worst. Bad habits might be hard to break.","I've been around for a few years and here is the situation I ended up in. The technology I'm working on is very proprietary and getting outdated with every year. If I decide to look for another job ... it will be hard. So it will be hard for my manager. And probably for his manager. We all kinda stuck here. And the company knows that. The pay is below average and a lot of people are focused on job security. The managers are picking direct reports based on the personal loyalty, they manage up, they sabotage introducing data driven metrics, we keep adding more and more new projects and growing technical debts - you get the idea, right?

Why don't I stand up and say something about it? Let's see ... If I tell my manager that he is not being efficient - I'll likely get fired. I can't really prove I do my job well because - remember, no metrics!  If I go to HR - the same will happen. At this point so many managers are all interested in keeping status quo - no single individual can change anything. 

Why don't I just pack and leave? At some point I probably will. A lot of employees who have marketable skills have done it already. But if you're working on something like Xpresso - you're stuck. And if my manager sucks - why do I have to leave?"

- Comp/bonus/stock is not to the ""top tier"" levels but it's pretty good overall"
1720,Workday,Let's be fair,2016-08-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"In all fairness to the negative reviews Workday has been receiving, there are certainly good things about this company that many other companies lack. Snacks in the kitchen, very friendly and helpful Workmates, and a brilliant program for recent college graduates make up some of Workday's greatest strengths. It's definitely not a Google or Facebook in terms of these perks, but hey, it's better than what most companies would have.

Workday also has many clubs to help you connect with people that have common interests. For example, there's a group of Workmates that play board games every Wednesday night, and last I saw, some Workmates were gathering periodically after hours to play Super Smash Bros.","I do think many employees take their negative feedback to Glassdoor more recently is because some of these issues are true..negative feedback cannot be provided without retaliation from a manager, or more commonly, changes will either not occur or would not come as quickly as one would hope for.

I also understand the frustration of working day and night, trying to achieve results, only to be met with no change in compensation, while someone else on your team gets it because they happen to be on more ""visible"" projects. I also know it may be difficult to trust management, during my 1 on 1's with my old manager, he had serious integrity issues, where he would slam someone else on my team behind his back, and pretend to be all cool and friendly with him.

Unfortunately, as someone who was here for quite some time, I can say that the culture has definitely regressed, and that doesn't come as a surprise, since Workday believes in sacrificing profitability to keep hiring at such a rapid pace; with such rapid hiring it becomes difficult to nearly impossible to maintain the culture that Workday was once well known for.

I do agree that in the end, if you are not happy at Workday, it definitely is in your better interest to seek another company where you think you will be happy at."

To say that Workday is not the best company you can be a part of would be an understatement. It's a shame that people who are still employed with the company could have such harsh words for an organization that puts their employees at the forefront. Workday spends alot of money every year to make sure that our families are involved in events, provides us with awesome perks and emphasizes work-life balance. In addition, Management is extremely honest and approachable. What other large corporations can you call the CEO, Presidents and others by their first name when you see them in the elevator? They are always quick to answer a question and truly want to know what's going on. Sorry, they can't always sit down to have a personal conversation with you about your issue, they are busy RUNNING A COMPANY to make us as successful as possible.  We are grown ups, use the appropriate channels provided to you.

It's unfortunate that Glassdoor has turned into a wailing wall for those that no longer work at Workday probably for valid reasons. If you do still work there, I hope you change your minds.

Dave Duffield is definitely no longer around, and he took his culture and values with him, no matter what the company wants you to believe.

The company culture is a great foundation started by Aneel and Dave. What other companies have Fun and Employees as core values? 

If you are driven but not a bulldozer, work well in a team but don't need to be micromanaged, care about your customers, whether internal or external, and treat people as you'd like to be treated, with mutual respect and empathy, then Workday is the place for you.","My cons aren't with Workday. They're with the Workmates who are here and don't appreciate what they have. They lack one thing – gratitude. Instead, they’re entitled and it’s shameful. My friends and family are in awe of everything we have here because it doesn’t exist for them in their workplace. 

It's unfortunate to see negative reviews of Workday since it makes me wonder what the person who wrote it is doing to rectify their own situation. If you have a problem, address it with someone who can help (and that’s not venting to a co-worker, although that does feel good). Don't hide behind a keyboard with anonymous posts. It won’t get you anywhere. And if you don’t like it here, it’s pretty simple; find your dream job elsewhere and we’ll wish you well."

Workday was once a very special place to work..but no longer.  Now upper management has placed many people in leadership positions who have NO leadership skills.    There is an abundance of weak, ineffective leadership that leads through fear and would rather keep talking about days past instead of making the tough choices needed to succeed in the future.  

If you speak up about the toxic environment that is stifling growth and causing talented, smart folks to leave, you will be branded a ""problem"" and bullied into leaving.

Workday pays lip service to diversity.  How many minorities are there at executive/senior level positions?  Hint you only need one hand to count them!  There is more to diversity than having a woman CFO.

1737,Workday,Things are changing-not for the good,2016-07-18,2.0,Engagement Manager,"Snacks, if you are near a regional office, good medical benefits decent software","I have witnessed a significant change in the company theses last 6 months, maybe it is due to the focus on profitability, or the company getting bigger and more difficult to manage as it scales worldwide.  The biggest change is the culture, where it used to be ""Happy Employees, Happy Customers-makes for a great company"".  Now its,all about the customers...for example, services folks were generally told (and it was on the recruiting) travel would be about 25% and scale up on occasion as needed.  Now its 50% and higher, and if you note that this is not what you were told coming in, the answer is tough, too bad, that's your problem.  OK, so much for respecting the employees. Being away from home double or triple the original expectation is not a small matter., but managers do not care.
In addition, the software and approach was originally seen as nimble, light on low value documentation, and quick to react to customer needs..  Now the direction, as least from a services end, is to mimic the bigs, (more wasteful documentation, being onsite, billing and doing very little  while onsite).  Sales may sell services that are not part of the standard methodology, so you try to work with the teams as best you can to figure out how to implement what was sold, with very little, if any help from management.  And when it doesn't work out like you would help, do you get support from management, NO!  But you sure get a lot of finger pointing.
There a number of good, long tenured people with one foot out the door...and these are people that have produced and continue to produce, but the work life balance needs are just not important anymore...so, watch the exodus."

People stab you in the back and straight up lie and are dishonest.
1739,Workday,HR is CORRUPT,2016-07-13,1.0,Manager,"Workday was founded on the right core values with the right mission statement, and for the most part the employees are good people.","HR has participated in cover-ups of harassment and discrimination as a way to ""save face"" and sweep incidents ""under the rug"".
These are ""red"" situations where the harassment has been both pervasive and severe against members of a protected class. Multiple managers, per our Unlawful Harassment Policy, have stepped forward to report the issues. In return, they have been threatened, ostracized, and retaliated against. Meanwhile, the managers who participated in the harassment have been promoted, awarded, and received hefty increases in compensation.
The standard tactics for the harassment and retaliation are below:
Corrupt management gives a targeted employee an insurmountable workload, belittles the employee's efforts to achieve the impossible, then uses the ""lack of performance"" as a way to retaliate in the annual, or off cycle, calibration reviews. All of this is with the hope of forcing the employee to quit on their own accord. Any objection to this abuse of power is framed as insubordination and HR is called in to carryout their process for pushing the employee out of the company. In order to push the employee out of the company, management and HR work together to eliminate any internal transfers for the employee to other departments so they either have to endure the ongoing harassment, or quit.
What is most concerning about this situation is that we are an HR software company that tracks ALL of this activity, and yet the behavior continues. Promotions, financial rewards, spot bonuses, etc. are not correlated with performance, but based on how well a person keeps their mouth shut. That either makes HR complicit with the behavior, or grossly negligent. Either way, it's not only illegal, but it is a clear violation of our Employee Code
Of Conduct and our Unlawful Harassment Policy, and you need to know about it.
This company is one step away from a complaint with the EEOC, the DFEH, and/or the ACLU, and I am well aware of the statue of limitations in a harassment-discrimination case. The only reason why it hasn't already occurred is because despite seeing all of these infractions over the years, I still believe that Dave, Aneel, and Workday upper management will step forward to do the right thing."

Workday does have a lot of shiny pieces.

Workday was originally designed by some very smart people and it can survive a lot of abuse. The core HCM app is still very good comparing to the competitors. The company can still deliver high customer satisfaction. There is reasonable diversity in the workplace. Workdays top people - Dave and Aneel - are very well known in the industry and have produced very impressive returns for the investors. The offices are nice and shiny too.","Here comes the other side. All these shiny pieces are held by feet of clay. It's like eating sausages - for most people it's better not to know how they are made ... Workday technology is getting old, there are more and more short cuts in the processes. The HR practices are really bad. There are people who get away with anything because they are friends of someone or used to work together. Meanwhile other people are trying hard but getting fired. It looks just so unfair and demoralizing and the top management seems to be doing nothing about introducing merit based reviews and restrict cliques and nepotism.

Workday has never made any profit selling its products and it's very inefficient. We have spent years on useless projects and built whole data centers  sitting idle for years - again, no accountability or personal responsibility.

Most of our developers using Xpresso are going to lose their professional skills because that languages is so ""different"" ... Now we are into frankensoft business buying and trying to integrate startups ...

Workday is not the top dog in ERP space anymore. Yes, it's HCM product is still good and has some unique advantages. But so it has weaknesses and the ratio is getting worse. And our FIN products - the future will tell when they will be ready.

It is extremely difficult to get promoted from within. There also seems to be too many levels of management especially on the sales side. This is resulting in an overly bureaucratic organization with limited opportunities for advancement. There also seems to be a preference for those coming from Oracle.

2. Fake Workday's ""aloha"" culture. Employees feel pressured into answering positively to numerous surveys Workday imposes on them to boost up its image as ""the best employer"".

The stock price has been lagging to compensate for the difference. Administrative processes are becoming a burden and it is hard to get things done so agility is negatively impacted. There is a clique of employees who joined the company early and they make the majority of decisions like promotions etc outside of the formal process."
1762,Workday,Fantastic team - working with cutting edge technologies,2016-06-23,5.0,Senior Software Development Engineer,"1. We work with best of breed bleeding edge tools in big data world (streaming and batched) dealing frequently with 10 billion+ rows - needless to say choice of technologies we use is therefore derived from our needs.  Work is extremely rewarding and satisfactory.

2. Independence to using choice to technology that we'd like to use for any initiative as long as it's efficient, fast and best of breed. 

3. Great learning environment within team where every member fosters excellence by reading and applying best practice principles, algorithms etc. 

4. Very nice patient and understanding team members who take whatever you say very seriously no matter how trivial the issue might be on technical side that is. 

5. Great place to learn and explore new technologies acquire great skill-set for long run. 

6. Excellent perks, benefits and salary :-)","1. Sometimes change is so constant that it may tire you - you'd have to read, read and read and still get a feeling like you don't know much and still have a lot of catching up to do. 
2. Often we have tighter deadlines and so choice of tools and skill-set in things for implementation   is highly dependent on few team members who know a lot and therefore can run away with tasks that would take you say 3 days and finish them off in a day - I.e there is a learning curve to follow. Once you've crossed that barrier with a year under your belt it gets easier. 

3. Lack of opportunity in my team to build things from scratch especially if you are an engineer, since there's already a lot of things that have been explored and best practices figured out - rightly so, however doesn't give you that opportunity to start afresh make mistakes and learn from those rather than relying on others telling you of a way to do it. If you like building things from scratch you might wanna look for other team perhaps.... Although there are attempts to circumvent this but it cannot be avoided. 

4. Tensed team - there isn't much fun or joke cracking amongst team mates - this is different for other teams though (direct observation) - our team rarely makes a loud joke or plays any sport etc. socialization is restricted to a few events that are organized - not a healthy place to be in long run if you are looking for a balance. Again this is team specific other teams are very different from ours but then the work is different. 

5.  Lack of communication with managers and reports - often manager relies on few senior engineers to express anything - and ignores advise of other engineers.  This can happen in any organization but it's rampant in my team. It may not be so for other teams though I cannot say."
1763,Workday,Workday takes blind eyes to awful teams,2016-06-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Awesome work/life balance. I work remotely most of the time and have a very flexible schedule. Also, have been able to take a lot of PTO :)","I wouldn't recommend Workday to friends, for the following reasons.

1. No 360 reviews of management
My team started off great, but due to complications all my managers were removed and we got completely new ones from companies I didn't want to get managers from. These managers are awful and there is no way to give them feedback nor improvement. My managers don't even meet employees once every two weeks like they promised when they first joined. I've only meet mine when I scheduled an appointment. Over half of my entire team has left due to frustrations with management. If there was a 360 reviewing system, perhaps upper management would have been able to prevent all the departures. 

2. Whatever fun you get at Workday you are paying for significantly in your salary
At Workday, they use the excuse that you're being paid lower than market value for the ""fun"" environment. Not all teams are fun at Workday, so it sucks to be on a team that is mediocre at best in terms of happy work environment and then to be paid lower for it, even if you are a pro at what you do.

3. Sexism
I had to add this in, since the only critique my manager gave me during our company's feedback cycle was that I needed to smile more. There's nothing wrong with being quiet and serious; it's only wrong when you stand out as the only female in the room.

Obviously there is going to be worse places than Workday, but I still believe the 1 star is justified since I was not given at all what I was promised and yet somehow got a 15k salary cut compared to market value."
1764,Workday,Capitalizing on the old technology,2016-06-20,1.0,,"It's ahead of the competitors. The old technologies from 10 years ago are getting paid off now. The finance team did incredible job of converting all hopes into high stock price. Reasonable work hours. Nice offices. Yes, free snacks!!!","When Workday was founded 11 years ago, the technology was revolutionary. In-memory storage, NoSQL, Xpresso - those and other things were way ahead of it's time. Workday added a great UI and customer support and produced an amazing HCM product which was a great success - and still is! Unfortunately, 11 years later that technology still sells, but it's showing it's age. Some, like in-memory storage , are no longer unique. Others, like Xpresso language - they've become more a liability rather than an asset. Workday had it's days when it was bringing disruptive changes to the industry but now it can't adapt to the latest challenges it's facing itself. More and more projects end up in stalemates when the powerful old timers (the self proclaimed ""guardians of the code"") block the new ideas (maybe the fact Workday is using very proprietary technologies like Xpresso with no jobs outside of Workday has something to do with that) and the new people have no power to push the changes through. It results in a lot of politics and turf wars. The company keeps hiring more people and it doesn't help at all and just slows everything down further. 

The compensation is below market (thanks to the stock price been stuck for years). Also, it's ironic how bad the HR department is giving Workday is a major payer in HR industry. 

I'd say Workday is doing good job on monetizing it's cash cow HCM app and it's going to be able to milk some cash out of it for years to come.  But Workday future is getting cloudy as the internal conflicts heating up, the ability to innovate slows and the morale is sinking."

1772,Workday,New Employee Perspective,2016-06-10,4.0,,"Wow, like night and day from my past employer.  Perhaps the Workday that exists now is not as magical as it once was when it was a wee startup but honestly, this is still an amazing place to work.  Perhaps it is because I came from an old school company but to me I see such amazing qualities in Workday.  It has earned its spot in best places to work for sure!  Why, you ask?

-Management seeks feedback from employees.  What?  In other places I worked most management is closed-minded and entitled.  At Workday the attitude starts at the top.  What can you say bad about Dave/Aneel?  My newbie coworkers and i attended our first Company meeting and we were so impressed.  I am ridiculously impressed with Aneel's ability to give off an aura of authority but also warmth and humor.  I would probably give up an organ to have that gift.  I look around my floor and the folks who are in Director roles are the nicest and the ones who smile the most and will greet you and say hello.  They are busy but they are kind and warm (in many cases).  I am crazy about the kindness and humility of the leaders at Workday and the fact that they solicit feedback and value their employees.  They truly get it! They are not just paying lip service.  
-There are many opportunities to get involved if you want it.  There are a lot of groups and volunteer activities.  There are fun events like mixers, Bring your dog to workday, team building.  For folks who truly just wanna clock in and clock out go ahead.  If you are looking for a social life at work they have that for you too.
-Great product and inspiring vision.  Its wonderful to work for a Company that is driven by building a great product, serving customers and making a profit rather than only making a profit.  I have worked at too many Companies that are driven by the bottom line exclusively.  It makes you feel dirty.
-Mostly nice coworkers.  With so many employees an occasional less than pleasant person will slip in but in general folks here are nice, passionate people with a good spirit.  Even a developer who totally seems quiet/serious will send you a message saying that he enjoys working with you and appreciates your work.  Even if the folks are not outwardly smiley happy super gregarious they are good people (or at least the vast majority).
-People come and go as they please no one is monitoring other folks business hours.  The most important thing is getting your work done and doing it well.  You can roll in late or leave early but you will almost 100% sure have to log hours on weekends/nights at some point just due to deadlines for things and especially if you are taking vacay.  So far I have taken two vacays and both times I had to work Saturday in order to get my work done and support my team.  Working from home is very normal.
-Unimited Vacay is not unlimited but you will be encouraged to take it.  A coworker of mine was at Workday a couple months and had not scheduled any vacay and got called out.  ""you need to book vacay"".  Your boss will be checking up on you to make sure you are taking advantage of this policy.
-Dog-Friendly! How much you can bring your dog just kind of depends on your dog and the people around you.  This is not micro-managed just use your judgment. (at least if you work in a dog-friendly building which I do).
-Snacks - for me this is a con.  Perhaps you will gain the Workday 15?  That being said I have heard rumors of GWs (gen workday) who are new college grads who fill up their backpacks with snacks (and presumably take them home?)  Clearly someone is loving those snacks!  They are almost always nearly cleaned out by the end of the day.
-Proximity to Bart especially with the new building they are building. 
-Reverse commute from SF (although 580 is getting congested and not quite as great as it once was)","Sadly, I have to agree with other reviewers that upward mobility seems almost impossible.  As much as I love the Company I can't help but feel I have found myself in my own version of golden handcuffs.  Its a wonderful company and I am completely inspired by management so I would love to stay forever but there are so many people it is hard to get recognition and so far it appears upward mobility/development is one area where perhaps it is just lip-service. (Maybe not even lateral mobility?)
Mid-level managers seem to be a mixed bag.
The lack of privacy in cubes can be a huge distraction.  I see folks with massive headphones trying to drown out the noise.  I've seen others take their computers to a quiet place to hide and get work done."

- The trickiest part is that they don't pay as well as some of the other tech companies local to them, and don't have very clear career paths.

At Workday its all about paying it forward and keeping that friendly and collaborative environment alive. 


One thing I love about Workday is how approachable everyone is. Even the CEOs are approachable! They usually hang amongst the employees at big events like the pool tournament. 

You can skype or slack someone and ask them for help and next thing you know you guys are hanging out at the next company cantina. 

Which brings me to my next pro: Cantinas. These are end-of-week parties where free food and booze are provided for the sole purpose of socializing with coworkers. Workday really cares for employees and they want you to be comfortable with who you work with so they encourage any and all socialization. 

There's so many other pros like company meetings and bonuses and clubs and affinity groups and benefits and RSUs and working from Ireland etc., etc.","Parking. 😓 but we are growing to accomidate our growth in the market 🙌 soon parking spaces for all.

I'll admit, I think Workday is one of the higher paying companies in the East Bay at the moment. You may even climb the ranks, fast, if you're interested in constant politicking and back-scratching. But if you want a company where voices are heard and personality is valued, this isn't the company for you.","I'm going to preface this by saying that I've been an employee of Workday for 4+ years. I've had close to 10 managers, been on many distinct teams, and grown with Workday through numerous reorgs. Workday is vastly different now than when i first joined. It is no longer a ""startup"" culture, but recruiters or hiring managers will try to convince you otherwise. They'll say we're a successful company but without the bureaucracy of large corporate culture. I don't know if they've regurgitated that line so many times that they're starting to believe it themselves? Truth is, Workday is definitely a large company with many micro-cultures and so much bureaucracy. Your experience at this company will vary from team to team, it will be entirely dependent on your manager. And internal transfers are hard. With internal transfers, they will try at any cost to chip at your salary since they are certainly not going to compete against themselves (and trust me, I've been a part of many internal transfers). 

I'm not comfortable disclosing what team I work on, but let's just say my team has hemorrhaged an astounding number of developers and QA (let's just say we've lost more developers than the number of fingers on both your hands in the past year alone, and we've lost 80% of our QA), and the only answer management has for us is that there's nothing wrong. 

That said, I've been on awesome teams prior to this - in Workday. It all depends on management. I hope this helps!"

Below market pay
Promotions are few and far between (lots of lip service from managers) and very little transparency into how compensation/performance cycles really work


All of the reviews about it not being the same Workday in as little as 2 years+ ago are true. The company has been growing extremely fast which isn't necessarily a con, but in the case of Workday, I feel like it has been especially in how the culture of the company has been affected. Workday used to be a great place to work with very much a startup like vibe and the culture that also reflected what I felt was Workday's true culture. However, too many great employees that have been loyal to the company are beginning to leave or are looking to leave because they get passed up for promotions and instead end up with the responsibility of training new colleagues and managers who will make more than them for doing essentially the same work. You see this trend in multiple departments within the company. Most of the mid-upper management positions will be hired in from the outside and most of those managers will manage up and delegate menial tasks to their direct reports. 

The 'company culture' isn't really enforced and most of middle-management probably could not care less about it, at least that's how it feels now and I've been watching this trend for 1.5 years.

I truly believe that executive management has employees bests interests at heart and talks about being transparent and gathering feedback often, but there hasn't been an environment that's been created where employees feel comfortable with speaking their minds because usually their managers are also in the room when these topics are mentioned. Aside from a few solid managers (true leaders as I like to call them) that truly care about their teams and work tirelessly to mentor, develop, and grow their members so that they succeed, it seems as though the rest are just concerned about themselves and making sure they look good for their managers so they can move onto the next best thing. Some managers are really nice and great people, but they don't fight for their employees when issues arise or when it comes to compensation and promotions, which is disappointing.

There's a reason why employees are taking to Glassdoor to express their frustrations because there really isn't any other avenue aside from complaining to your co-workers (which happens often). I truly hope to see this change and that we'll get back to being the same great Workday we once were."

They will not be honest with you about job performance or opportunities and won't take the time to help you grow.

The irony is that this is a company that provides human capital management technology and yet this is not a very human-centric company.  No 401k match."

- nice office (including pool table, ping pong table and XBOX 360)
- company provided MacBook Pro","Workday's products are build by teams that only handle one part of the entire app, so it's very likely that you will not get to know the entire picture or how you interact with other teams. Application developers ""code"" in a proprietary language called XpressO. All the coding part is abstracted away and they only get to fill in some forms. If you develop in XpressO, you will eventually lose all your programming skills and in a few years become unemployable anywhere else (even though the company claims that XpressO helps you focus only on your problem solving skills without having to worry about the actual syntax, XpressO is not similar with any programming language).

Not only the app developers have it hard. There is an entire team of people that builds a parser that takes XML and outputs JSON. The whole UI team's task is to create different components (text boxes, prompts, list details) which they rewrite almost every year in different technologies (Flex, HTML5 etc).

Apart from the technical side in which you will basically end up doing the same thing over and over again (even though they proud themselves with being innovative), you have to know that the managers in Workday are not technical. Their only job is to supervise you, make sure you are doing your job. Probably it depends on the team and manager, but I had the misfortune to have a manager who micromanaged, who didn't want his team to work from home, who kept track of how much time we spent taking breaks (what's the point of having a pool table if you can't use it?!). Everytime there was a blocker, we had to go to him to explain the problem, go fix it and then go back to him to explain the fix. If you want a manager from whom you can learn, this is not the place for you.

Workday mostly hires people straight out of college because they can pay them less and train them to have the expected mindset (""yes"" people, that do what they are told). They don't want very technical people because technical people will leave in a very short time. Workday is the place in which you are evaluated by your attitude, and not your technical skills. 

People are intimated by their managers and are afraid to speak up. In the office everyone seems happy, but once they're on the bus on the way home they start complaining."

If you are a fellow Workday employee please up vote thus if you agree.  Where should I begin?
There are an influx of Oracle-like managers.  They are in development, sales, and director roles.  They don't care about their employees.  They spend all their time making themselves look good rather than worrying about the culture, its employees and the best for our company and customers.  It's become really corporate and political fast.  A lot of the original Workday people are being pushed out because of this.
These managers are hiring senior, principal roles externally rather than promote within.  Most likely hiring people who agree with their agenda rather than based on merit.  In Support one Senior integrations engineer was overlooked for a managerial position.  They hired some one much younger with no integration experience.
HR has a history of not doing anything.  I've had multiple colleagues complain to hr only to be reprimanded by thier manager after they found out.  You have to complain to the head of Hr Kim roa to get anything done.
Trying to change or improve anything is frown upon.  VPs and directors are where they are at because they insist on using antiquated systems and procedures  They don't support innovation since it makes their day to day activities obsolete.  They strive in this broken system because thats how they remain visible and relevant.  You improve or fix the system and they basically aren't useful anymore."

Our customers are making a decision to tear out a core system of record, be it HR or Finance or both - so regardless of how much they like Workday, timing really does drive the sales cycle.

Work life balance and probably good managers  can be found if you are lucky enough to work in the right department.  The company spends a lot of money on Workday Generation so if you are a young person, that is definitely a pro for you.  The company has recently had a lot of various workshops for management skills, managing priorities, etc. which I think is a step in the right direction.  There are opportunities outside of your department to move into.
Things can be a lot worse.","In reading some of the more critical but most useful reviews, I realize I am not alone.  I am only talking about my personal experience and not putting down anyone who has truly had an amazing experience here.  This is a very political and clicky culture and people seem threatened by talent, and afraid to step on the wrong toes.  Workday tries to give the appearance that they have this great culture but maybe what once were great ideals have warped into this superficial, passive aggressive one that promotes weak leadership, and a follower mentality.  It would be a much more conducive to work in an environment where people are truly team players and want to do what's best for the company and the investors.  
When WD talks about being collaborative, they just mean shut your mouth and don’t ruffle feathers.  They say they promote innovation and thinking outside of the box, but that's all lip service.  And I sometimes wonder if the people who are coming up with product ideas and functionality have ever even used similar products.  There are very basic problems in the product but no one is willing to listen and use the resources that they have right underneath their noses.  
There are too many leaders, but none willing to truly lead.  You have so many different ""leaders"" in one end to end process.  Leaders don’t get together to align their goals, resulting in very unscalable processes and frustrated employees;  you can't report on useful metrics timely because the information input at point A isn’t defined and agreed upon.  The decision that wins often is not the one that makes the most sense.  Ideas that benefit the company or are innovative are disregarded if the top people in power are against it.  People are not held accountable for their actions.  Leaders don’t enforce any sort of discipline, which you need to have at any company in order to be successful.  You have leaders who are incompetent yet they are let loose to run organizations the way they deem fit because they are friends with so and so, making things even harder to clean up as the company grows. 
There is no opportunity for promotion or growth.  They hire leaders from outside of the org that have no clue as to how things are functioning specific to WD; and to top it off, the leaders from the outside seem pretty disengaged with their own departments when they get here. 
For a company who is all about HR, you’d think relationships among their employees would be a primary concern.  The leadership here seems more concerned with making alliances with other departments to further their own position, rather than taking care of the people working hard directly under them.  I read a review here that talks about how toxic and abusive the leaders of the sales ops org are, and I can see that.  You would have to be blind not to, but once again, it's about weak leadership turning the blind eye.  I read a review that one person was shocked about the negative reviews in the sales ops org – again, this type of myopia instead of trying to understand why people are feeling this way is the exact problem.  I was once told by an employee about how this employee was being managed; I told my manager about it and was not believed."

If you're into fun and like to live at work, the culture is great. 

The leadership is top-notch. Some visionary guys are in power here that help spurn the company forward.","When it comes to engineering, IT, and development, this place is a dead end. If you want to work day and night, spent 60 hours a week at a job that underpays you for 40 hours, this is your place. 

You will spend the rest of your life here in proprietary-language programming, finding hidden bugs in the system beyond your domain of knowledge. You'll spend most of your time tracking down people who caused a particular issue, not learning anything new about technology. Documentation is terrible here. Better become best friends with key people to know what's going on.

They say they have career advancement opportunity here because you go nominally from associate, to engineer, to senior engineer, but these titles don't mean anything and they don't come with much pay increase. 

They do pay ok but that's only because their stock benefits are doing well ""for the moment.""  The stock prices has been continually slowing in growth since I started and the lofty promise of And do the math and you'll realize that even if you worked only 40 hours a week, you make less than half the hourly pay of the average contractor.

Don't be fooled by the fancy cars some workday employees drive. Seniority is the single most important factor here. If you are employee 500 or less, you're doing well. Also don't expect to design anything because all the important decisions are made by 6+ year seniors. If you worked at a startup or medium sized company you'd be doing the same job as them and make more in the long run."
1895,Workday,"Built for the future, brought to you by the past",2015-11-09,2.0,Associate Applications Developer,The Generation Workday program really does do its best to acclimate new grads into the workforce. It's an easy way to meet a lot of really cool people. Workday also tends to hire really honestly nice people as new hires. The snack program is fantastic.,"Make no mistake: Workday is PeopleSoft, Peoplesoft is Oracle, and, no matter how much they try to convince themselves, Workday is Oracle. 


There is zero career advancement at Workday, and it's designed that way. The management chain from the bottom-up is almost exclusively ex-Oracle, ex-Peoplesoft folk. Oracle employees are actively recruited for management or high-priority roles. There are very few people (to the point where I don't know any, but I've heard of them) who came in to Workday in management positions. If you are not PeopleSoft alumni, your chances of advancement are very, very slim. Internal transfers are slim-to-none despite the constant talks they give new hires about them occurring after their first 12 months.


That'd be fine and all if this is just a stop-gap in a career, but as an engineer, Workday has designed a tech-stack that essentially tries to ensure employment solely at Workday. It's all proprietary non-programming, and resembles nothing even remotely similar to programming. It's entirely useless for any future jobs. Don't buy into the ""Well, there's a lot of similar ideas and principles with traditional programming languages"" talk they give: it's nothing like programming. It's just clicking, and clicking and more clicking. It makes things easy for them, and much harder for the worker, as it's extremely easy to become complacent and your forget traditional programming skills.

I was brought in after 3 rounds of interviews - recruiter said culture fit is important to this team.  In my interview, I asked “what are you looking for?” I was told “team player attitude, detail conscious, collaborative, and humble”.  Most of the team has shown exactly these qualities so far.  The work is fast paced, and intense, and mgmt has high expectations of everyone - ""be proud of the work you send out"".  The team’s involvement in deal strategy & contract redlines goes a lot beyond an average deal desk job, and it’s rewarding to see YOUR deal come in, and be included in the company-wide “win” email.   Management does a lot to recognize good performance – emails, MVP awards at quarterly team meetings, “Outstanding Contributor” and “Workday Hero” awards.  1-2 people from the team have been going to Sales Club each year.  At my previous company, NOBODY from the deal desk got to go, E-V-E-R!  There is no lack of helping hands, and the team is constantly encouraged to learn from the managers, experienced team members, detailed published guides.  Weekly meetings frequently have guest speakers from other groups, which is always a great learning experience.  Every level in this team mingles freely with each other, and upper management is down-to-earth and friendly, not at all “abusive and abrasive”!!  Feedback is taken and implemented quickly – if there’s something that’s not working, there is openness to changing it.","Pay is quite a bit under what Silicon Valley companies will pay for similar work.  Great option for those living in the area, but everyone realizes that there is some trade-off in terms of salary.  The culture in this team is clearly to promote from within, but there are not enough leadership positions to be promoted to!  If you really want to explore another group within the company, management will help you (which is a relief, because managers at my previous company did not behave like that), but if you want to stay in the team and move up, the path is not clear."

Continuously growing and expanding the service to meet the needs of our customers. The team of people from pre-sales through customer management and executives want to help customers succeed and be overwhelmingly happy with the service.,"Fast paced growth has lead to some challenges in scaling, specifically in the mid-level and front-line sales management ranks.  In a perfect world, it's better to promote experience from within, however that isn't an option at Workday.  Thus, it's taken some extended time to ramp up mid-sales management."

Management is scared of innovative thinking and thinks evolve very slowly.
1931,Workday,Corporate Sales Development,2015-09-10,3.0,Sales,"Workday was an amazing company to work for. They took care of me as an employee and gave me my first opportunity in the software industry. For this I am immensely grateful. The culture was truly a famlly. I was one of the first 1k employees and must say it felt like a family reunion every time I came to work. The quarterly company meetings, annual company picnic and bring you dog, kids, etc to work days made work fun and motivated you to do good for the greater good of the team.","IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MOVE UP IN YOUR SALES CAREER DONT COME HERE!

Let me explain. If you are just starting off in Software sales and are looking for a robust training and development program that will give you the fundamentals to move up in your career, this is not the place. The Workday recruiters will sell you on the idea that they have a program in place and that many CSDs have moved on to promising careers insde the company. Athough, this is somewhat true it is not the complete story. About 80% of CSDs leave the company to different organisations. Less than 10% get promoted to other teams and the other 10% stay in the CSD org as managers. The people that leave aren't incompetent but rather complete furstrated with the inability to move into a proper sales role. 

If you do decide to take the role be aware that it is incredibly hard to move out of this team and most of the jobs offered to you, if you are selected to move are NOT in sales (Pre-sales, low level consulting, operations, etc) I would be giving Workday a complement if I said this is one of the worst sales training programs out there because the fact of the matter is the sales training program is non-existent. 

If you are an ambitious young graduate who is serious about a career in tech sales don't come here. There are many organisations that have the tools in place to develop and mentor you. Look at SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, Zuora. These organisations have the tools in place to build your career in sales. Don't make the mistake I did and take a role as a CSD at Workday."
1932,Workday,Sales Operations - Beware,2015-09-08,1.0,Sales Operations Analyst,Workday overall is a great company and has a bright future as long as they continue to deliver on their expectations and goals. Many of the departments at the company are held in good standing and truly embody Workday's core values while others do not.,"Sales Operations is one of the departments that doesn't embody Workday's core values and at times has the illusion of a functioning department all while the reality is much the opposite. Business etiquette is childish and there is a constant ""tug of war"" of consistency between management. Good ideas are taken and executed by others and credit is rarely given where it is due. Management talks down to employees who are treated as if they are expendable and pawns apart of a larger bureaucratic chess match. Overall, it is a disaster."
1933,Workday,workday is pretty sweet,2015-09-06,4.0,Software Development Intern,"Full-timers get unlimited PTO, work from home whenever, paternity leave. Great people, easy to move around to other teams, very open office culture","Compared to other Bay Area companies, our perks aren't as great: no free meals, no gym, no shuttles, no 401k.

1934,Workday,Know what you are gettting into,2015-08-31,3.0,Associate Software Engineer,"Good work life balance

very few benefits
misleading and often lying about expectations at work"
1935,Workday,Excellent culture,2015-08-29,4.0,Applications Developer Intern,"People are super friendly and super smart. I was really impressed by how willing to help and ask for help everyone seemed to be, the open office really worked. There was a great sense of comradarie and everyone always seemed to take everyone seriously but still had a sense of humor.I felt that even as an intern if I had an objection to bring up, and sometimes I was solicited for my opinion, it would be taken seriously. 

Also people really did use the vacations and remote work options, it seemed really indicative of a very good work/life balance

Despite being a very large (and ever expanding) company Workday is not afraid to try new things and roll out new processes. This is the way we have always done it is not a good enough answer at Workday.They don't roll things out for the sake of rolling things out but only do it if things are found to add value to the company.

Good pay on an internship and provided housing. Snacks and a very friendly welcoming work enviroment. 

There are a lot of little things that make employees feel cared about. Employee programs host plenty of events to keep things interesting and there are automated external defibrillators, first aide kits and instructions and sharps disposals as well as nursing rooms. It is truly very welcoming and inclusive.","Their proprietary language has a steep learning curve as it is very different from any of the standard programming languages. You will spend a lot of time in training and then still need a lot of guidance. There is also a lack of documentation.  I would be afraid of getting trapped into it and forgetting how to program in more conventional languages. In order to keep up with what is new in technology and keep conventional skills sharp you have to make an extra effort outside of work. 

Also while pay is great for interns it is not amazing for fulltimers"

1939,Workday,"Gets many things right, but Sales support needs an overhaul",2015-08-21,3.0,Sales,"Great product that can truly make a meaningful impact on the business operations of customers.  The implemented product lives up to the hype...and there's a lot of hype about Workday.  Very good training, tools, assets, and ongoing education if you have the time to leverage them.  Marketing, particularly the field marketing organization, is very good and do an excellent job positioning the product.","Field Sales representatives, at least those that aren't based in Pleasanton, aren't provided anywhere near the resources they require to consistently run successful sales cycles.  While reps are provided a fairly good customer engagement ""playbook"" and tools, they aren't provided enough resources (product demo support, RFP response support, etc.) to actually execute on the playbook effectively.  It's not unlike having a good football coaching staff but not enough talented players to win as much as we could and should be.  Those that are on the field are often exhausted.  The lack of support and resources doesn't go unnoticed by prospective customers and reps have to constantly deliver news that frustrates the customer - it is not uncommon to have to ask for a meeting to take place 3-4 weeks out because there simply aren't enough resources to support customer requests.   Enterprise Sales in a highly-competitive market is always going to be high-stress/intensity, but far too much of the stress is created from lack of resources and from fighting for the resources we do have.  As a result, reps are left on their own to try to figure out ways to 'hack' together ways to support customer requirements and this leads to some quick burnout."

1946,Workday,Workday Dublin management is confused,2015-08-14,2.0,Software Engineer,"1. The product is really good and stable.
2. Hiring process is intense so most of the new hires are actually talented.
3. The work culture in general is good (changing now though- see cons).
4. If managed well, there is a great potential in this company.","The company is hiring a lot to meet the declarations they had made about overall growth (especially in Europe). This is not sustainable and is detrimental because of the following-

1. Although we boast that we prefer to nurture internal talent, since last one year most of the managers have been hired from outside. This has not gone well with many of the star employees who have been with the company for at least more than a year and have worked day and night to make projects successful. No one works hard for free and good employees deserve to be promoted!

2. Attrition has increased since last few months because of the professional dissatisfaction in employees. Another reason for attrition is most of the programmers in Workday work on a proprietary technology called Xpresso. Many feel that they get pigeon holed and won't find another job in Java or whatever background they came from. An Xpresso developer can work ONLY for Workday.   

3. The 'Workday' culture is fading away. Logical because most of the managers are being hired from outside who do not know what the Workday culture is and they try to implement their own ways to run their teams. 

4. The management has created an impression that it is one of the best places to work and the company is very employee centric. To be honest, most of the successful companies are so unnecessary bragging is meaningless! When someone joins Workday, his mind is sort of brainwashed that it is the best thing that could happen to his professional career :) 
This is just a gimmick and most of the guys start working crazy hours believing it. Not sure whose fault is this though :)

5. If you are good in job A and you have proved your mettle in it, but you are more interested in doing job B, they will find a hundred reasons not to move you to job B. I have seen a case where an excellent resource has decided to quit his job because he was not moved to a different role he wanted to (he had prior relevant experience for that job) and instead someone with less relevant experience was hired from outside. Fun part- he was told at the time of interview to join in his current role and he will later be moved to the role he desires as there was no opening back then.

PS: I am not a victim (yet) to any of these cons. It is just my perspective of things that I have seen here."

Steep learning curve, but once you get over that hump it becomes easier to make new applications. Overall a great company to work. The company has lots of perks and great team outings. The company tries to keep a happy and very comfortable atmosphere.","The technology used puts current employees into a pigeon hole. Software engineers are using a proprietary coding language that is developed by Workday. Everything is done in two specific graph like languages. If you stay to long in the company your coding skills will get dull. Workday puts their employees in a comfort zone that can be good for some but bad for others trying to increase their knowledge in the coding and tech world. My advice would be that if you join Workday's apps team, experience it for a year and either transfer to another group or look for something more challenging elsewhere. Many will say there is no company politics but from my personal experience there is quite a bit. The company portrays this image of happy and everything is great but that creates more of a frustration for others, because instead of saying the problem out front issues and discomforts just get bottled up. Lastly the company encourages employees to seek out different groups within the company but unfortunately since each team I have seen has such limited resources that it can take up to 2 years before any kind of talk about moving occurs."

Most of the people I worked with felt a lack of confidence in their product knowledge, but they would never say that to a manager. operations are hap hazard, and there is no clear path to success. What are employees supposed to know / do and when?

People are promoted based on their ability to talk the talk and come off like they know what they are doing. Then they are rewarded for being a one man show and put in charge of a team even though they have no leadership abilities. There is no training for new leaders and  new direct reports pay the price.

Senior Leaders are more concerned with how thoroughly you fill in your JIRA fields vs. actually leading and ensuing their teams are trained and productive. There is a lot of time spent on non-value work.

In order to keep up with the chaos, people are working 7 days a week.

2024,Workday,A Cult Cleverly Disguised as a Software Company,2014-12-27,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The snack closet. Alas, that was as short lived as my ""Career"" at Workday.","There is palpable sense of falseness and fake frivolity that permeates the entire workday experience and work culture. Similarly, there is the same disingenuous tone to most of the positive reviews about workday, no doubt the product of some poor intern recruited by HR to game the review average with glowing accolades of the Workday Experience. Those young men hired right out of school (yes, Workday has the same extreme gender bias like the rest of Silicon Valley) and the interns seem to enjoy this culture of fakeness, perhaps because growing up they always got ribbons and trophies just for participating. Folks like myself, with 20+ years IT experience sense the falseness the moment we walk in the door and start coding. 

I liken the Workday culture to a cult. Cults typically prey on the young and naive and always have very rich, super controlling charismatic leaders and fiercely loyal lieutenants. And like any good cult, Workday doesn’t want you to leave. I had 4 exit interviews prior to my departure. When I handed my letter of resignation to my boss, instead of taking it graciously and professionally, he instead handed it back to me and said “Oh, we can talk about that later”. My immediate sense of that was, well you didn’t value what I did while I worked for you, while should you value what I say when I quit! 

As most of the negative (and in my opinion) decidedly accurate reviews indicate, Workday doesn’t pay that great. Their initial salary offer was a lateral increase in pay, justifying it with RSUs that vest over a 4 year period for as a yet unprofitable company. I held out for more salary (a 10% increase in salary), and much to my surprise they met my asking price. Unfortunately, it was all downhill after that. 

Overall, I felt my time at Workday was frustrating, confusing myriad of half-truths and promises made but never fulfilled, expectations set without timelines, time wasted and on an almost endless cycle of code re-working with out proper guidance, planning or direction. Oh and I did I mention that much of this wasted time occurred on my weekends or during the evening, that time, when according to all the positive reviewers written by that Intern from HR, I am balancing my life with work.

The first sign that things were off to a bad start, was ironically my start date with Workday.  I tried to push it back about 10 days (in order to get my semi-annual bonus from my previous employer), but the hiring manager was insistent and I stupidly agreed to it. A few months later, I was then hurried out equally quickly of the group I hired into and dumped into another group without prior consent.  

I strongly felt I was never given a chance to succeed or any kind of feedback on the work I did do. After approximately 2 months I did a performance review of myself that I wrote myself and never received any kind of feedback on that as well! I offered a co-worker approximately 30 documents (in addition to my daily coding tasks) I had written while trying to acclimate into the group. I even gave this same set of document to my Manager, only to have it summarily ignored.  

My genuine impression is that I was hired merely as a placeholder until the real candidate was available a few months later. The timing of my transfer to the other group I was put in left no question in my mind. This replacement candidate had previously worked with all the other members of my group (did some reviews say clique). The only other outsider within my group was accepted mostly because he seemed to fill the role of the team mascot and cheerleader. I was the true outsider in my group and for this, I was summarily banished because of it.

Meetings were another cult like ritual at Workday. The first group I worked in met 3-4 times a week, and the 2nd group I worked in met daily for a 15 minute scrum that always went on for over an hour. All told, I would spend 10-15 hours a week in meetings and these meetings would spread throughout the day. It was genuinely difficult to establish a solid work rhythm when you’re periodically interrupted to talk about the work you’re trying to get done.

A few months after I started at Workday, accrued vacation was rescinded. It was announced via an email, of course. 

There are of course, many more negatives – many of which were expressed in other honest (negative) reviews, such as the chronic back-stabbing, the lying,  the Workday HR department that wouldn’t know a hostile workplace environment if they themselves worked in one (and they do) and so forth.

I genuinely think it’s a good place for young people to work, especially those right out of college or interns. They can continue to earn their participation ribbons and trophies in the form of RSUs but for experienced IT folks (i.e. those of us who really know what we’re doing), I think it’s fake, it’s a facade, a cult trying way too hard to be(profitable) .Software Company."

Irrespective of that if you are a smart technical person there are tons of reason why you should NOT join here unless you want to work for a government like job

1. innovation is highly discouraged and you can not change anything in the architecture/code unless you are one of the very few who joined the company in the initial stages. You are highly encouraged to be part of status quo and do whatever they asked you to do in the way they asked you to do. 

2. EVERY decision has to be stamped by the few architects. If they don't understand it or don't wanna do it however compelling it is or how much of data you have to prove it, you can not do it. 

3. You will sometimes encounter situations where you come up with ideas and they get shot down or ignored. But later, in few weeks, when an old timer suggests the same thing, everybody applauds it and rush to do it. 

4. Unless you are part of one of the core teams, you will be working on their proprietary language which is about ""clicking on sh*t"" as they say it. It will make you a slave of the system and you won't learn anything. In fact, your value and your thinking abilities will go down drastically over time. You won't be able to use that experience in the future for your next job. 

5. A lot of leaders in groups are either unaware of or afraid of new technologies. They don't want to even experiment with those and prototype new concepts unless they are comfortable with it. Always think in terms of how its gonna make there work complicated. 

In general, they have an old system even they are sick of keeping. But none of them want to rock the boat too much since its gonna affect their stocks at the end. The founders are wonderful to talk to and listen to and talks about the importance of innovation. But sadly innovation is really discouraged as long as the old timers are around. They have gotten comfortable with keeping a patched system and failing system than taking risks to improve things with new blood. 

If you want to improve yourself in few years, not afraid of taking risk and do innovative things don't even think about joining here. But if you want to find a place to peacefully retire, come at 9am and leave at 5pm, this is an ideal place."

- The nickname - WorkDaynNight is very true. Hence no work life balance at all. 
- Don't expect your manager to help you figure out your career; strengths or weaknesses. She will have no interest or intention to contribute to your professional growth.
- Benefits are the worst a Bay Area Tech company can ever offer.

They are on course to become market leaders in a very competitive space with room for growth and expansion. There are some good coworkers to be had with lots of industry and technology experience. Good place to grow your career and explore (especially for younger new grads).,"Pay is horrifically below industry standards (especially for the Bay Area).  Even being here for over a year, the promise of a pay raise is just a dream that's teased by upper management and HR (many people can attest and have left because of this). Even post-IPO, many people had hoped that pay raises and compensation normalization would come quickly, as of this writing, this has yet to come. Like many reviews here, unless you were here in the early days, you will not be cashing out a ton of money from the IPO. 

There are 'in' crowds and 'out' crowds, your experience here will vary by which crowd you get into.

The 'best company in the bay area' claim is such a joke. The bagels (which you get sick of), free fruit (which only come 2x a week) do not offset the bad company benefits, lack of any other relevant 'extras', lack of bonuses, promotion, etc. The claims in that 'award' is a lie and is clearly a  bribe from HR to boost applicant volume.

Joining Workday two years ago changed my mind about everything that a corporation can be. I wake up every morning excited to get to work and feel fulfilled by my job. I have no desire to move into management but that decision has been respected and I have been consistently rewarded for being a top individual contributor.

I feel fortunate to work with fantastic people on all levels of the organization. My peers in sales are excellent and they respect the value that I bring to the company. My direct management has always been very supportive of my work and me as a person. I feel this is a company where people genuinely care about the people that they work with, and that starts at the top with Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri.

One of the exciting things about my job is that I work with many different companies (in pre-sales) helping them understand the value of Workday. I get to experience the corporate culture of these companies as we go through the sales process. How do they treat vendors? How do they talk to each other? I get to see these aspects and many more as part of the sales cycle. That has given me a deep appreciation for just how few companies are like Workday in how they treat employees. I feel very lucky to be a part of building such a great organization.

I work from home on the days I am not travelling and I feel well integrated even though I am in the field. My work-life balance is respected by both my peers and management. I recently took a week off during the busiest time of the quarter and my management didn't complain.","We have been trying to hire an additional person in my position for over a year now and still have not found someone who can satisfy all the requirements. This means that I been very busy (and getting busier). My management has gone out of their way to ensure I don't get overworked, but at some point we just need more people to do the job. 

I am also still somewhat confused about our commission compensation, how it is calculated and how long it takes for us to get our compensation plans. I understand we are a growing company, but for variable compensation to be a motivator the plans need to be clear and delivered on a timely basis."

Hard to meet/get to know coworkers.  But, I think this has to do with the fact that they in such a big growth phase right now and they're trying to get procedures in place to handle this."
2114,Workday,Good break after graduating from UC Berkeley,2012-04-20,3.0,Software Engineer,"Laid back attitude, allowed to work from home sometimes, good work-life balance are all great parts of working at Workday. Also, the company is successful and generally people are upbeat. Also nobody gets fired here. So considering the company outlook, this is a great place to work if your priority is job security and low stress.","Limited exposure to widely used frameworks and development tools--this is especially true for Application Developers. On the Tools team you get more exposure, but it's mostly just Java and a little bit of XML processing. The problem is a ""Not Invented Here"" attitude, that results in more work for you and fewer employable skills to gain. A little too much company kool-aid; sometimes the hype gets to me. Not all managers are top notch (they get fired more rarely than employees) and some are just plain ineffective and annoying (but most of them were at least developers at some point). Also pay is low."
2115,Workday,The Right Place To Be,2012-04-16,5.0,,"I feel fortunate to be working here. Workday is one of the most exciting places to work right now, and has a very bright future. I have a fantastic relationship with my supervisor, and the work is fun and interesting. I've never been afraid to say what's on my mind, which is rare.","It's a fast growing company and changing quickly, so only join the ride if you can handle the speed. With all the new hires, there is a bit of a ""land grab"" for ownership of things, but that's what happens when  a lot of ambitious and smart people come together. Not really a worry since there's plenty of work and opportunity."
2116,Workday,Workday has an outstanding work environment,2012-04-12,4.0,,Workday is a wonderful place to work.  I love the work that I do and the people I work with.,"We are growing so fast, it can be hard to keep up with the new hires week to week."
2117,Workday,"""Bait and Switch""",2012-04-09,3.0,Corporate Sales Development,"Disruptive technology
Impressive brand name customers
Top leadership well respected in the industry
IPO on the horizon
Chance to make a mark on a promising new company","The term ""bait and switch"" comes to mind when thinking about my experience at Workday. I was sold on the idea of joining up with a hot company that values building and grooming talent. That is the whole premise of what Workday's very own product is supposed to provide...isn't it? I was promised that there would be ample opportunities to explore different areas within the organization and grow my career. Soon after joining the team, I came to the harsh realization that was not the case. 

The leadership of the sales development team quickly proved that they make empty promises. The idea of ""talent management"" and helping employees to grow is nothing more than a feel-good slogan on the front page of the website. Employees are not treated in a respectful and adult manner, and are openly criticized in front of peers. Team morale only continues to decrease, and there is no improvement in sight."
2118,Workday,"The IPO Train is full steam ahead..Hang on tight, or you might get run over",2012-04-01,1.0,Applications Developer,"Next to Facebook, Workday's IPO is the most exciting in Silicon Valley.  Cutting edge technology.  The rate at which Workday can develop product is unbelievable, leaving our competition struggling to keep up.  Vacation time was increased this year, and if the company hits its goals.  Company meetings are fun, celebrities such as Captain Sully and Steve Young have attended in the past.  We poke fun of our competition at the meetings,portraying SAP employees doing the goose step, and there is even art work of Larry Ellison being flushed a toilet at the company headquarters.  Needless to say, product confidence is very high.","There is a lot of money at stake at Workday.  Not only are the investments of our founders on the line, several millions of the famous Bay Area Tech funders and CEO's have there money wrapped up in Workday.  As a result, things have tightened up.  Salaries haven't been raised in years, and stock is being guarded tight.  As it stands, the amount of work vs resources is stretched thin, and every overhead cost is scrutinized."
2119,Workday,"Challenging, Innovative and Exciting place to work",2012-03-29,5.0,Manager,The company leadership and products are stellar. Prospects are blown away by what Workday brings to the table. The acumen of people this company is able to attract is top notch. The ERP industry is at a tipping point and Workday is a contributor to that tipping point.,"The pace is fast and you need to be able to continuously engage,learn and be prepared to stretch.
Workday is a start up and you need to be a jack of all trades due to resources."
2120,Workday,"Great company, bad department",2012-03-26,3.0,Corporate Sales Development,"Workday is a great company, has a phenomenal product, and is for the most part very well managed. It also has very good values that it tries to embody in every aspect of their business and how they treat employees","The values I just mentioned don't seem to be equally carried out in every department.
The inside sales department is run in a fashion that doesn't represent the values the owners work so hard at implementing, which is a shame.
Also, there seems to be rampant nepotism going on."
2121,Workday,"Great Technology, Great Vision - Poorly executed..",2012-03-22,3.0,Financial Development,"Great Technology
Great Vision
Fun People to work with
Strive to do your best","Inexperience Management
Decisions come from one person with little room for feedback
No Career Path - after entry level - you are stuck in a path to no where
Internal fighting between development (engineering) and product management (business)
Everyone reports to one person -- that one person has no time to talk and eventually ignores you."
2122,Workday,"Exciting, fast growing organization which will be very successful",2012-03-20,2.0,Corporate Sales Development,"Great core values
Company is striving to be the best 
Leader in technology innovation
The software helps our customers save time and money
Top executives truly care about employees
IPO","Interview process focuses on next steps after CSD, this rarely occurs
Marketing takes all the credit for pipeline development which is very inaccurate 
Hit your goals quick or you're gone
No true career path into outside sales
""Fun"" place to work"
2123,Workday,Great Place to Work,2012-03-12,5.0,,"Great Place to Work, talented leadership team",Long hours but this is understandable given company's stage of growth
2124,Workday,"Work hard, play hard.",2012-02-21,5.0,,"Fast pace, smart people - we're changing the game of enterprise software.","Long work hours sometimes, understaffed for the amount of work that has to be done."
2125,Workday,"Fun work atmosphere, but no intellectual stimulation",2012-01-11,2.0,,"- Great people
- Company really cares about their employee's happiness (halloween events, bring your dog to work, etc)/ Fun work atmosphere","- Not very challenging work
- Discourages mobility within the company
- ""In crowd"" vs. ""out crowd"" (out crowd is shunned)
- They push you to vote for them to be one of the best companies in the bay area."
2126,Workday,"Hard work, good people, even better product!",2012-01-10,4.0,Education Consultant,"IPO this year is a very good reason, great product, cutting edge, we sell a superior technology, product, and service. SaaS is the word!","Minimal benefits, no raises in years, hard but fun work, insufficient recognition."
2127,Workday,"It's an innovative company with a lot of potential and a good sense of humor, I'm excited to be here!",2011-11-11,5.0,,"Everyone works hard, coworkers are friendly, I feel like I'm part of a team rather than competing with my coworkers.","Everything moves very quickly, it's difficult to keep up.  Once you think you've mastered an area of the software, it changes."
2128,Workday,Great company with great opportunities,2011-11-06,5.0,,"This place is on a roll...the product is awesome, the new business is pouring in, and the clients are very happy.  The senior leadership is very impressive: humble, extremely bright, and most of them have already managed organizations through very rapid growth.  Workday is filled with very smart people who leave their egos at the door, instead focusing on making our product and service great.  I never worked at Peoplesoft, and I don't think it matters.  I've never felt like an outsider for a moment (contrary to other comments posted here).","This place is moving very quickly, so expectations are high.  We're pushed out of our comfort zone - those with faith in themselves can handle it.  Workday isn't for those who want a slow, relaxed, ramp up period."
2129,Workday,Would have been better if I was ex PeopleSoft,2011-09-29,2.0,,Great product. Company soley focused on going public and anything that gets in the way gets chopped.,Nepotism reigns supreme here as it is a family run company. I have never seen such classlessness in the firing of some employees for no reason aka wrongful terminations. Management would look at this as just a means of growing the company. There are some Directors/Managers that are toxic to the org's culture.
