That is not the case.","""So here's my idea. We've beat the pants off of RingCentral for years. We gotta hire their entire exec team! That'll show em... ""

Now we're RingCentral2. Ran the exact same way. We prioritize process rather than innovate. We've gone from not only playing to win, but playing to blowout the competition to playing not to lose. I have never been more disheartened in my professional career. We are objectively being turned into little sales robots. This has to be a deep cover OP with RC sending in the troops. I can't wrap my head around anything else. Blink twice if you're okay, Eric! You've had to been kidnapped!"

If the customer says, I won’t pay there’s nothing you can do about it. NO legal support
They can cancel whenever they want to even if they are under contract.
No work life balance, you take 2 days off and the 3rd day you won’t be even able to go for bio break. That’s the level of work and unnecessary activities"

24,Zoom Video Communications,Great company and people - just wasn’t the right position,2022-03-17,4.0,Technical Support Engineer,The people at Zoom are genuinely wonderful. They pay is competitive and absolutely fair for the positions. They really mean it when they say “open door” policy too. Benefits line up better than many others in the area.,"Promotions happen prematurely for some. Managerial skills not fully developed, but genuine care for team members still consistent.
It was a call center support position and that simply wasn’t my background. I had never worked in that support environment and underestimated what it meant. Lots of focus on numbers when it comes to the actual work. Quantity was prioritized over quality in some cases."

34,Zoom Video Communications,Start up vibes,2022-03-08,4.0,Senior Product Designer,The company culture is one of the best i've ever seen.,A little micro-managing. Designers still need to get direct approval from CTO and CEO. I'm pretty sure designers at Tesla don't need approval from Elon Musk. Zoom is trying to grow out of startup mindset into a more enterprise system. This will take a while.

- CEO truly cares about employees and consumers, makes this the biggest pro of working here as a sense of belonging is communicated","- no 401k matching YET, they're working on it :)"
40,Zoom Video Communications,Delivering UNhappiness,2022-03-02,1.0,Account Executive,The brand name. Looks ok on the cv.,"There is a lot of internal fighting over accounts. Everyone sells into each other's territory - no repercussions for this. There is internal bullying - this is also overlooked because all that really matters to this company are numbers. So let's talk about numbers- if you hit 150% of your quota, the following quarter's quota will inflate by 150%. Zoom give quarterly quotas and they are not strategic in how they decide upon the targets. Its just whatever you achieved previously becomes your new quota. The hiring has become so aggressive despite the demand for Zoom dwindling that each person's territory is shrinking WHILE their quota is increasing. 
There is no accountability. As an AE, you need to work closely with other stakeholders in order to Deliver Happiness to your customers. However, the culture at Zoom is very much one of 'passing the buck' or simply ignoring requests to collaborate which can seriously stall deals and ruin your opportunities to earn. People just don't want to help.
Your territory will change every time someone new is hired. You will have to accept that you will lose accounts month by month despite any opportunities you are working on. If a rep is caught selling into your account, you will be advised to split the booking with them, so you must accept that your accounts will be worked by others. 
Leadership are fully aware of all of the above as most reps are totally honest in the Glint surveys. Nothing has changed. 
There is no structure, just madness and chaos. There is no strategy, just greedy finance and sales ops who are trying their best not to pay out on commissions by increasing quotas to the point they are unattainable.
No career conversations which is fine cos who'd want a long tenure here?"

49,Zoom Video Communications,US engineers are second class citizens,2022-02-22,2.0,Software Engineer,Perks are good. Pay is good (excluding RSUs).,US engineers are treated as second class citizens. It is difficult to get anything done without China engineers and they are not usually motivated to collaborate with US engineers. It is frustrated to work in this environment and senior management doesn’t seem to care or even publicly acknowledge it as a problem.
50,Zoom Video Communications,"Great people, was a great place to work",2022-02-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, everyone likes to help anyone there. I loved my team and everyone on it.","A lot of long time employees have left which doesn't reflect well on the long term outlook. It was a great place to work when I started but towards the end, the company isn't the same. The job was not what was advertised and it had not changed in the year+ I was there."
51,Zoom Video Communications,A mixed bag,2022-02-18,3.0,Technical Writer,"Dynamic work environment

Middle manager competency varies
Career growth path is somewhat mysterious"
52,Zoom Video Communications,Don't join Zoom.,2022-02-17,1.0,Sales,They pay $400 for your fitness per month.,"Shares are down, management is immature and does not know how to lead a team. The debookings system is a joke - it takes your comp away. You will not make what your OTE is, even if you hit your target. Rules are everchanging. Opportunities for growth are very minimal and basically non-existent."
53,Zoom Video Communications,Great company if you're not in sales,2022-02-15,2.0,Account Executive,"Small 401k match, RSU's, unlimited time off if you're not hourly, friendly coworkers, great healthcare options, financial advisory service provided, mental health services, fertility benefit, reimbursement since we're not in office anymore for food/wellness, cell plan reimbursement, life insurance. High payouts IF you can exceed quota.

It's a fun company to work for given the culture they built.","If you are in sales I would look elsewhere. This company does not know how to set quotas properly. For the last year our division had quarters where 23, 40-50, and 67% of reps with a full quota hit quota (roughly). Because the division hits their numbers leadership doesn't care that so many are struggling. We are just here to fill the gaps so they don't have to pay us out fully but the division still looks good. As much as this company does to provide happiness to customers and employees in other aspects, they fall short here. You would think when 23% of people hit quota that they'd curve it but they didn't. Statistics don't lie, this company wants 60-70% of their reps to hit so that they don't have to pay out as much. Don't get excited when you see your base and OTE offer because it's HIGHLY unlikely that once you're off new hire quotas that you'll hit it. The people that do usually say they got lucky on some big deals. The RSU's are nice but a MAJOR tax burden to employees that the company gets a write off for. Morale is also down over our stock falling but there's not much the company can do there.

There are massive pay gaps amongst teammates carrying the same quotas. Some of us make 30-40k less between salary and OTE than others on our same team doing the same job, though for some it's more like 14k. This is unreal. They said they were going to level us over a year ago and it never happened. I don't even think our managers know what to do with that."

- Collaborative colleagues 
- Culture is superb 

Action speaks louder than words. There are a few equity related programs which are super amazing. Zoom cares about employees and take our feedback seriously.",Overly caring - Does not encourage Zoomies to gather. Zoom does not allow managers to expense team meals or drinks due to Covid - 19. The old finance policy is due for a review.
60,Zoom Video Communications,Poor management,2022-02-04,1.0,Senior Accountant,Great swags and decent benefits package,Absent-minded new CAO. He is as clueless as it gets! He doesn't provide support or advocate for the people in his organization. Extremely poor management within the finance teams.
61,Zoom Video Communications,Sales = sinking ship,2022-02-02,1.0,Account Executive,"Eric is great - a great leader, great engineer, and great human.","-Sales policies regarding downsells, debooks, and commission payments feel unethical/immoral.  Zoom is making AE’s take debook and commission hits for deals the AE was never a part of initially, and was never paid on initially.  How can Zoom take commissions away when never paid to begin with?
-Sales ops:  Most AE’s spend a large part of their day managing broken accounts, and doing so with non-existent tools and processes.  This is the place to be if you want to become an expert in invoices, billing, statements, collections, and fixing licensing provisioning and other problems, rather than selling.  We cannot manage large, complex accounts via chat, opening tickets and tracking them, stalling our clients while we mess around with it internally, etc.)
-Quotas:  It is shocking how few reps (enterprise and majors) made the number.  The quotas are unrealistic and difficult to hit, especially when sales policies in place constantly work against the rep (see item 1).
-Leadership:  CRO is nice guy, but no smarter than average bear.  Exec under him is a highly paid cheerleader and little more.  The bright / good execs are leaving or have retired
-Strategy:  Our primary competitor did an excellent job putting a pricing and go-to-market strategy together against Zoom.  Zoom does not have a cohesive sales strategy at the moment (we are selling a platform talking about features/functions, we have no great answer to the competition we are currently facing, our sales motions are inviting prospects to a never ending series of webinars and cold calling, etc.).  It feels archaic and frantic/desperate.
-Support:  Support org and success org are backed up causing reps, SC/SE’s, and others in the field to try to support clients.  Again with nonexistent tools and processes.
-Morale:  Feels pretty low at the moment across the board."

Good health benefits","First of all, if anyone hasn't 't noticed the influx of reviews around 1/14/22, that's because Zoom's executive team asked all employees to right a review on Glassdoor in order to boost their persona. Truly pathetic. 

I have been with Zoom almost a year and am so sad at how it functions and the lack of support from the incredibly terrible and disconnected leadership team. They all need to be fired. This team has made millions and millions of dollars over the last few years and they can care less about their employees at this point. Just take a look at their history of selling off all of their stock (which is currently in the toilet right now). I'm just waiting for our next earnings report to be released in which hopefully our investors will demand a change to our leadership.

They are remarkably terrible."
92,Zoom Video Communications,Amazing Company,2022-01-18,5.0,Technical Project Manager,"The people, the benefits, the stocks, the leadership, the opportunities, the sincerity and honesty of everyone there.","Unfortunately during the pandemic, we grew so much that it did become a little bit of a hassle to get facetime w/ managers like we used to prior the Zoom Boom as the media called it. Otherwise great company."
93,Zoom Video Communications,"Amazing Culture, Exciting Company",2022-01-18,5.0,Account Executive -Majors,"The culture at Zoom is INCREDIBLE. There is truly a culture of happiness and self-improvement. The company has a fun, forward-looking mindset. Benefits are fantastic.",The fast pace of the industry keeps us constantly working to stay relevant
94,Zoom Video Communications,"Fantastic company and culture, room for improvement in engineering",2022-01-18,5.0,Software Engineer,"From the CEO down, leadership has been authentic and made best efforts to walk the walk. They answer hard questions/comments from employees, come up with solutions, then actually up and make sure it is working. 


For example, ""No [Internal] Meeting Wednesdays."" People were feeling burned out with meetings and they implemented this policy. While it was probably never meant to be a black and white rule, I guess it wasn't always being respected by different layers in the org. So the leadership has continued to revisit it and ensure it is actually being respected (even if there are some that don't follow it still).

My managers have also embodied these traits, even being proactive about noticing things like late meetings for our timezone, then reaching out to let us know we can push to have it recorded to respect our evenings.

I've yet to have an issue with a coworker, so far pretty much everyone has been talented and pleasant to work with. At least on my team, working remotely has been part of the DNA of the team, so I don't feel disadvantaged in any way being remote even in a different time zone than most.

The core ""delivering happiness"" value is also seen in our benefits. There may not be the same, perhaps excessive, benefits compared to other big tech companies, but they are still really good from my perspective. They feel generous and intentional.","Day to day work as an engineer leaves a bit to be desired. So many engineers and cross-functional team members are new to Zoom from the last year or two. There is a a lack of institutional knowledge in a lot of areas that leads to a fair amount of inefficiency with the product development process. Little information to go on at times, little dev environment or biz requirement issues that are hard to find someone that has the answers, etc. It has been somewhat difficult to drive significant fulfillment from the day-to-day work personally, so far.

Working with coworkers on the opposite side of the globe is difficult as well. While we do have support for maintaining a work-life balance, it is difficult to balance maintaining boundaries but also coordinating to ensure project success.

That being said, I don't believe this is unique to Zoom, and do believe in the active work being done to improve matters."

100,Zoom Video Communications,Great Culture I'd love to stick with forever,2022-01-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined Zoom a while after quitting my previous job, which happened during pandemic, and I took 6months off just to detox from my former company's toxic culture. When I was in Hawaii attending these beach ceremonies to toss your troubles away into the ocean(which was a rock carrying all your negative energy, don't worry), I thought to myself ""what do I care the most about next job?"" And the answer was clear: An Enjoyable Company Culture.

Fast forwards, I've been with Zoom for several months now. I love the culture, the company's mission goals, and the people I work with on the daily basis. It's a fantastic group with the most diverse executive boards I've ever seen, plenty of internal opportunities, open discussion, great benefits, open space for anonymous suggestions/questions/polls, etc. Zoom is indeed a fast-growing company that makes you feel like riding a rollercoaster. But I also love that everyone just holds on to their duties and carries mutual accountabilities to make a hybrid work environment a reality, to make everything better-internally and externally, as well as being so understanding and supportive at the same time. 

It's not hard to tell you're working with good-hearted people when you're with Zoom.

Also, shout out to my super helpful and caring recruiter Anthony Alexandrou and the whole recruiting team for patiently guiding me through the whole interviews/onboarding process. They even checked on me after onboarding.:) Thank you guys! So glad I joined Zoom!!",Not I can think of so far.

114,Zoom Video Communications,So far so good... with room to improve!,2022-01-14,4.0,Customer Success,"I've been at Zoom for about a year now and here are my biggest 'pros' so far:
- People: we hire are hardworking, thoughtful, and scrappy individuals. The people I work with are hands down some of the most knowledgable and talented I've experienced in my career.
- Brand, Mission & Values: I love working for a company that has such great brand recognition and is truly changing the way people work and live for the better
- Products: are second to none and it's exciting to see how they are evolving to fit the new hybrid enviroment
- Benefits: it's evident Zoom truly cares about its employees. Our benefit package is generous, although there's room for improvement (no matching 401k!)
- Leadership Transparency: I love how regularly we hear updates from our executive team and appreciate their thoughtfulness in how they approach our All Hands and other meetings
- Work/Life Balance: I personally feel like I have work/life balance. I'm encouraged to take time off and it's clear leadership cares about my mental health and wellbeing.
- Flexibility: I appreciate how as long as I'm getting my work done, it generally doesn't matter from where, during what hours, etc. (within reason)
- Focus on DEI: Zoom does a fantastic job supporting DEI with our various ERGs and associated events","Here are some areas I think Zoom can improve:
- Internal Processes/Cross-Collaboration: while I wasn't here during 'peak' Covid, it's apparent a lot of structure and organization internally was put on pause just to keep the lights on at the company. There's a ton of work to be done to streamline processes, make data more reliable/available, and generally speaking with how teams work together instead of rowing in different directions
- Customer Centricity: linked to the above, all departments and teams should have goals/KPIs linked to customer success and customer happiness. It's very clear some departments care about the customer (particularly those on the front lines), while those behind-the-scenes often don't approach their work in a customer-centric way.
- Career Progression: is very opaque for me. I've never worked at a company where there isn't a formal performance review process and I don't have a strong sense of how bonus/pay/equity decisions are made
- Middle Management: insanely busy. I rarely meet with my manager and when I do, it's clear she's always distracted, not fully paying attention, and at times feels like she's using our time together to simply check the box. I wish we received more strategic vision/goals from our senior leaders.
- External Company Vision: candidly speaking, we do a very poor job of marketing ourselves as a 'platform' company, which is what the entire exec team would tell you we are trying to become/currently are. Everyone knows us for our Meetings product because most have used it, but few are aware we have products outside of Meetings. We could do a lot better job of painting a picture to investors/prospective customers/current customers about how we position ourselves and product suite as a platform, not a single product.
- M&A: what are we doing here? We clearly have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and the Five9 deal fell through. I appreciate the diligent approach to our financials, which has undoubtedly put us in the great position we're in today, but I actually question if we're being too stringent with our cash reserves?"

I appreciate that Zoom promotes inclusivity and equity. They really do invest in people's mental and physical wellness. It is not just about work but the positive social impact we make professionally, personally, and around the world. I'm very impressed with the transparency and regular communications that the executive leaders and their staff model. I've never seen so many diverse people in a workplace from different ethnic backgrounds, gender, and all backgrounds. It is very common for many happy Zoomiees to say they felt like they just started last week, even though they have been here for a little while. I love that they support giving back to our communities. I've also never seen so many heritage holidays and diversity, equity, inclusion-related initiatives be so well promoted and the level of participation that people have in Zoom. I really do feel like a co-owner when they inform us and give us the power to make a positive difference in the interactions we make as a Zoom family. I could not recommend Zoom more and I wish more organizations would follow the examples of culture-building here. If I had to be honest, I felt like after joining Zoom, I was doing detox on all the previous toxic environments I worked for before. Almost everything that most employees did not want in many bad companies we get the good things here. It is so refreshing to be treated with respect, love, and care.

- Benefits that truly translate the value of care, especially during this pandemic. 
- Amazing ERG groups that reinforce the diversity vision of the company and that welcome everybody with amazing events and a sense of community.
- Compensation for my field is great, above the market and has great progression plan. 
- Sellers are not just a number or expected to compete with each other. Everybody wins when the other wins, it's a true team spirit that's rare to find in the market.","- Leadership even having great individuals, could use more trainings on building trust and feedback. 
- More People from People. It's a huge company now and it's needed to have more professionals who can act as advisers in HR related matters - in all regions. 
- More opportunities for Zoomies, sometimes roles are opened first externally and not internally. Why not have people only focused in developing employees internally?
- Lack of recognition is something that can be trigged by the amount of people in the company now. Once again, having more prepared leadership can help influence this in a positive way."

Colleagues are good people.,Upper management has gone down hill since the company went public. They have redacted the best benefit that most people took this job for which is MTO(unlimited time off)+ sick days. When Covid-19 hit the company took our sick days away and moved us from salary to hourly. Constant changes that make things worse. Unclear guidelines for work and unmanageable work load.

180,Zoom Video Communications,Think twice before you join,2021-10-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Best product in the market and lots of potential
- Good Perks","It will take forever to share but here's the summary
- HR- Many interviewees and existing employees who were interviewed had very bad experience. Other than that HR is non-existence, almost forgot there is a HR function in this company. 
- Sales- Runs like SME, Wild Wild West, do what you want because no one cares as long as you hit your numbers. There are many rules in place but no one follows or even enforce them. The structure can just change without discussing with the team involved because the top management approved it as long as you pitch the right information he wants to hear. One of the messiest sales team. Many leaders are good in theory and storytelling, very few that really understand what is happening on the ground or maybe they don’t even care at all as long as you deliver the numbers. Managers who set direction but always changed due to lack of confidence(capabilities) and pressure from the top.
- Sales Ops- Does it exist? I thought they are interns that just know how to copy and paste excel sheets whenever people ask them to do so, a team with 0 values, database and account are in a mess and getting worst everyday
- Operation- Billing, IT, etc, sometimes your questions or ticket logged will never be resolved. Everyone is pushing responsibilities because many of them are contractors. You will end up at a dead-end and not sure what to do next because even the expert in the department pushes it back to you.

Overall:
- No transparency in this company, any information you ask for will never have an answer, such as how we set our quota/target, how they evaluate the market, which data are we using etc. Structure and strategy can just change without involving or even communicating to the people who are affected. Top management can just decide and execute. You only realise the changes when it hit on your face.
- Love to use the excuse of “growing too fast”, “growing pain” for not improving, nothing has changed, but many things turn out to be worst.
- Too many millionaires in the company, they don’t really care about the well being of the company, that’s why no one will bother to feedback or make any changes. Those who can make changes don’t bother as well since they are at the top and not affected.
- Promoted many unqualified leaders
- If you are from an old school company, a lucky person, good in theory and storytelling, good in politics, looking for a so called “growing company”, this will be the best for you. Those who have been working in a real growing company before, want to learn and contribute more, this might not be the best place."

The only region that might hit their target is the US, however, the targets in my segment are not based on regions and therefore are not fair which will bring me to my many cons","- Targets are not achievable
- Management is becoming more micromanagers by establishing new tools that can track how many emails you've written, your time on the phone etc.

Eric is a truly great CEO who cares about employees as individuals. He has his faults (priority pivoting too frequently, some micromanaging) but I believe in him as a leader.

The core zoom products/platform are really, really strong (meetings, chat, phone, rooms). I use zoom tools all day. I believe in a very strong future for the platform and the company.","Since covid, you cannot take a breath. Every day there is some kind of crisis or urgent priority. Priorities shift so often that you get whiplash. Everything should be done ""yesterday"", and long hours are the norm. Regular planning cycles are a joke because no one has the foresight to know what will be asked of you in a month much less next quarter. 

The culture has significantly degraded from its pre covid days. This used to be a fun, joyful, and collaborative place. Now everyone is burnt out and passes the buck (not my problem, talk to this other person). Processes are bogging us down so much, and new processes are introduced with no training or analysis on how it will affect workload and time to market. Yet still everything is expected to get done overnight. 

Management talks about the book Speed of Trust but won't implement that way of thinking. Every decision and contract is micromanaged, so subject matter experts cannot control their own programs."

They claim to care about the employees but do not demonstrate it in anyway. Lots of talk, no walk. Upper management might as well be non-existent, with no vision and hoping multiple UCaaS products magically align. They are completely disconnected from the current state of the company and act like it’s still a ten person start up. The CEO calls meetings to yell and vent at employees about having a sense of ownership, and then simultaneously bypasses them disrupting multiple months of planning and schedule, causing complete chaos. No annual refreshes, and if the stock does well, they’ve made it clear you will be punished during your review because “the stock you had to pull teeth to get initially is doing well.” Recommend: look elsewhere. Many other companies offer similar (or better) perks without the non-sense."

Between 9 rounds of interviews (with lots of miscommunication involved), to my managers and counterpart all quitting in my first 9 weeks, to a severe lack of process and transparency, to adopting two jobs I was not hired for, Zoom was not what I was looking/hoping for. 

I have no doubt that there are areas of the company that are amazing to be a part of, but there are also lots of areas that need attention and improvement. The culture of 24/7 chat and 6-7 days of work is not sustainable and I believe the company needs to address this ASAP."

Headcount has doubled in the last year, and so there is a lot of change happening in a short amount of time, and everyone is trying to keep up. So far it feels like we are on the right track, but there is a risk that the growth causes some long term damage. Also, if you work with the engineering team, it is difficult to coordinate overlapping working hours without overworking yourself, because the majority of the engineering team is located in China.

I’ve been in sales my entire professional career and never worked for a company like Zoom. I’ll list the three major reasons that Zoom blew my expectations out of the water. 1. When the C suite said it, it was gospel. No matter what they promised or offered seriously or casually they came through. Every time. 2. The C suite lead by example. Too many places have CEO’s or CFO’s or whomever deep into their god complexes that will bark objectives or require their employees to walk a line they never had any intention of walking themselves. If management asked it of us, they too operated as such. They said what they were going to do and then executed it and lead us by example. 3. The C suite genuinely cared about their employees and took personal concern when issues arose that needed to be dealt with. No passing it off to HR to trickle down through the ranks. They owned shortcomings and did their best to keep the company culture paramount.",There are some low level managers engaging in scumbag behavior but no organization will be without these folks. Unfortunately some always slip past the radar. Overall all levels of the org are healthy and working hard to maintain the magical culture creates there while experience super growth.

Those who will thrive here must have a growth mindset, the ability to deal with ambiguity, and patience, as Zoom is heading for its next exciting adventure.

315,Zoom Video Communications,"Still the best, but with growing pains",2021-03-22,4.0,Account Executive,"Great benefits, the best CEO, great culture, and the best product. Easy to reach out and get help from any team you need. Company is understanding about time off (though with high quotas it's a little hard to warrant time off) and accepts input from employees. One of the few companies left I think that actually reviews all-hands submitted questions and answers them. They seem to take employee feedback seriously. Very focused on diversity & inclusion, though as most tech companies are, Zoom seems to be more liberal/democratic minded than conservative/independent/republican friendly. You have the benefit of working for a company that is helping to change the world. They give us great sales tools, and the equipment we need. Once you've made friends they're great here, but it's still hard to come in as a new employee and burst the small family bubble that existed. Excellent shift of benefits during COVID since not needing to host lunch in the office etc.","MASSIVE pay gaps between employees with the same experience levels on the same teams carrying the same quotas. Leveling has not taken place as we were told it would and it creates serious friction between teammates, to the point where some employees will probably seek other employment if vested. Some of these gaps are ""small"" at 13k between base and commission, and some are as large as 47k from what employees are aware of. I truly believe Eric Yuan has the BEST intentions and goals, but some of the other executive leaders coming in from other companies are carrying their intentions/ideas with them. Ryan for example adjusted the clawback period and extended it during COVID so that employees took huge hits on cancellations when we knew people were going to go up and down on subscriptions due to the state of the business. Bringing in Cisco and RC leadership has had a negative impact all around. Quotas appear to be mis-aligned and leadership seems to have forgotten that the Zoom Boom is over. You aren't supposed to miss quota, but supposedly they're also set so that only X% of employees hit, which doesn't make sense. No 401k Match right now. A lot of outside hiring was done for promotions available during covid rather than promoting within and starting brand new people at the bottom, which seemed like a slap in the face to Zoomies who have been here for years. There has been a lot of talk about going back to the office, which seems hypocritical given that we are THE work from anywhere company. There is a lot of uncertainty for employees here right now, which would be more understandable if we were any other company, but none of us should be forced into a hybrid option when we return. Leadership is not on the same page and some make it seem like you won't have a job if you don't return to the office, while others make it seem like remote work will be fine. Our territories in sales are a disaster. We need these to be better aligned and graded."

326,Zoom Video Communications,Best Culture,2021-03-19,5.0,Online Account Executive,Best company culture and great benefits.,Cannot think of any cons.
327,Zoom Video Communications,We deliver a superior product and customer experience.,2021-03-19,5.0,Project Engineer,The underlining principle with Zoom is deliver happiness. Happy customers and happy employees. Zoom has been delivering a superior product for years before the pandemic took hold in 2020.,"There are no cons. Our product remains to be super simple, reliable, easy to use solution versus complicated products offered by others."
328,Zoom Video Communications,"Best place to work, extremely bright future!",2021-03-19,5.0,Senior Enterprise Customer Success Manager,"Great CEO, who pushes delivering happiness from the top down. It's crazy to work for a place where you don't have to live in fear, but really concentrate on delivering happiness to your customers, yourself, and your teammates. Great benefits. Successful company with a bright future.",A lot of applications coming in so it's hard to get a job.
329,Zoom Video Communications,Come Zoom with us!,2021-03-19,5.0,Senior Counsel,Culture of happiness for customers and employees,Have not found one yet
330,Zoom Video Communications,Happy and feeling lucky to be a Zoomie!,2021-03-19,4.0,Customer Success Manager Lead,"Eric Yuan is an amazing leader. I believe Zoom is so great because the leadership truly leads by example, Ryan Azus, Aparna, Janie Pelosi Kelly Steckelberg, Damiem Hooper-Cambell, all of them! Lynn Halland, Lynne Oldham, all of these people make me want to be a better person. Zoom is just a solid platform, the people here are amazing and genuinely happy to help and ready to deliver happiness to customers and to others across the org internally.",A few in middle management could learn from our leaders in terms of leading by example.
331,Zoom Video Communications,Zoom Cares,2021-03-19,5.0,Product Manager,"Zoom has been an incredible place to work at. I've been at Zoom for over 4 years and it truly has been a phenomenal company to grow in professionally. Management in each department I've been in really cares about its employees and the new employee growth program that the people experience team is implementing is incredibly exciting.

Zoom's ""Care"" values are everywhere. Everyone cares for each other immensely. If someone's having a rough time there are people who reach out and help. The idea of ""See a need, fill a need"" really shines through in the people that Zoom has hired, and I've seen a bunch of new people join over the years who continue to grow this part of our culture. 

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this company. It is phenomenal to work here and I am never sad about going in to work every day.","We have had a lot of rapid growth, particularly recently. Workloads are still high while new team members are onboarding."
332,Zoom Video Communications,Best company I have ever worked for!,2021-03-19,5.0,Account Executive,Challenging work keeps me totally engaged. The company empowers me to do the right thing in everything I do to make the customer happy. The benefits are amazing. But the best is leadership truly cares about us.,Not any I can identify
333,Zoom Video Communications,Best place to work at,2021-03-19,5.0,Talent Acquisitions,"Great sense of community
Amazing support from managers and colleagues
Long term job performance opportunities
Ability to grow in your own field or try something new",Sometimes the workload can be a lot to handle
334,Zoom Video Communications,"When you treat your employees like real, individual people, your company will thrive.",2021-03-19,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,"Zoom takes care of its employees better than any company I have ever worked for. I have been in the workforce for over 15 years, and have held just as many jobs if not more. In that time, not a single company I have worked for can come close to rivaling Zoom in regards to how well they treat their employees, pay, benefits, and opportunities. Nobody is perfect, yet Zoom continues daily to outperform the rest delivering happiness not only to their customers, but to their employees as well. The happier the employees are, the stronger the company which is why I believe that Zoom will continue to thrive from here into the future because it truly is the best place to work.","The only con I can think of is that with a company that has grown as big and as fast as Zoom has, processes, procedures, and quality has a possibility of starting at ground zero. Whereas prior to the massive surge in hiring, people who started had good experience and were truly fit for the role. Post hiring surge, some new hires are going to need a whole lot more ramping up compared to how it was prior. All in all, they are getting the training they need to accommodate for the growing issues, it will just take some time."
335,Zoom Video Communications,"People first culture, positive and challenging environment",2021-03-19,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"Genuine compassion, empathy, and respect for all individuals from the top down
Passion for high quality (and highly secure) work is part of the DNA
Very easy to be visible day to day, lots of opportunity to have an impact beyond the basic job description
Competitive comp. package
Tons of work to do, very hard to be bored
Work/Life Balance is more like Work/Life Integration due to distributed nature of the teams. This is a pro, IMO","Growing pains may not be a fit for every individual, but IMO is hardly a ""con""
I wish we had 401k matching, but it's a minor thing. Comp. package and perks are solid beyond that minor point
Work/Life Balance can be an issue if you allow it to be, as with any hyper growth company"
336,Zoom Video Communications,What you read and hear is true!,2021-03-19,4.0,Enterprise Sales,"Great company, great perks and great leadership. Eric does truly care and it shows throughout the leadership team. It makes a difference especially during the ups and downs of any career. I would recommend Zoom to anyone.",The possibility of having to go back to office. They have created a product that allows the world to connect and collaborate worldwide. It wouldn't be a good look or make employees happy if they force a back to office.
337,Zoom Video Communications,Zoom is Happy,2021-03-19,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Zoom works hard to communicate to its employees with transparency and value. For a company that has grown so fast so quickly, leadership has done an amazing job being honest with where we can improve while keeping a keen focus on what's important to the success of the business and its employees. Zoom is an amazing place to grow your career. I have seen an impressive number of colleagues promoted, and we've all been given incredible opportunities to contribute to projects we are passionate about. The team culture is one of support, camaraderie, affirmation, and sharing. Everyone seeks to promote each other, and the more support you give your team, the more you are recognized as a leader. I truly feel safe, seen, and important in my role. I truly feel that everyone has each other's best interests at heart.","There are some needed process improvements, as Zoom has scaled so quickly from a smaller community to a massive workforce. However, this is recognized by leadership, and there are several improvement projects completed and in the works. Best of all, everyone has shown grace during the growth and change."
338,Zoom Video Communications,Everyday Grateful at Zoom,2021-03-19,5.0,Senior Manager,"Package, Work-Life Balance, Work Environment",Since I am still new. I do not see anything bad yet.

Sounds like slogans but I have experienced toxicity in other workplaces and I have worked also for nice companies too, but nothing compared to what Zoom delivers to their employees.","Only things I can think of cons are not Zoom's fault: Working shielded at home and I am almost a year now here and I have yet to visit an office. 

Looking forward to what the new normal will be!"
341,Zoom Video Communications,Everyone should deserve to work in such caring and empowering environment,2021-03-19,5.0,OEC,"Zoom really cares for its employees, their wellbeing, their ambitions and their families.

350,Zoom Video Communications,"Best Company I Have Ever Worked For (like, not even close)",2021-03-18,5.0,Acquisition Sales Representative,"This company truly has a vison to change the world, for the better. It is the most collaborative workforce I have ever seen. The standards for employees helping each other on literally an hourly basis are incredibly high...but that was not set by management, it is the employees who hold ourselves to these standards. We are growing to be a very large family, but there is no one in the company at any level that I don't feel like I could reach out to with a concern, question, or compliment. Even at 4,000 strong we all feel very close and it's something that other companies talk about, but I have never truly experienced it like I do at Zoom....and I have worked for several multi-billion dollar SaaS companies. I always say we are very spoiled, emotionally speaking (and often with food and money too). Our CEO is probably one of the nicest people you will ever meet. Our leadership most of the time exudes humility, happiness, and proudness in their staff.

Zoom has ruined me for other companies :)","Zoom was forced to grow at an almost uncomfortable pace this past year due to covid. But it was good growth, and exciting growth. But with all rapid growth comes a bit of confusion and adjustment sometimes. Management did make us feel like we we all in it together to build a company that could serve the world for decades to come."
351,Zoom Video Communications,Great company to work for!,2021-03-18,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,"Genuine company that really cares about you and your happiness, lots of flexibility, they do a good job translating the company culture even remotely. They have implemented a lot of changes to allow for more growth and structure in the TSE role.","Went from ""unlimited"" time off to accrued time off, starting the job completely remote can be a bit of a struggle at first, working remote can make it hard to judge work standards, and sometimes I feel there is a lack of communication."
352,Zoom Video Communications,"Company that cares for Employees, Customers and Community !!",2021-03-18,5.0,Head of Business Applications,"Visionary and empathetic leadership, opportunity to disrupt several markets, great execution, support from all levels to be the best !!",You always have to prioritize the priorities because of the demand

357,Zoom Video Communications,Best company I have worked for during my 20 years!,2021-03-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture of care and innovation is at the core of everything Zoom does. People managers are trained to have empathy for their employees and I have never felt so connected to a company in my entire 20+ year career. I have never met anyone face to face at Zoom due to starting at the beginning of pandemic, but Zoom provides so many opportunities to feel connected, to socialize and learn all at the same time. I absolutely love it and grateful for the opportunity to work here.",Some back end processes could use some tidying. That is to be expected with outrageous growth Zoom has experienced.

And the Growth potential here is so substantial that if you have the opportunity to be here and be part of the team it is definitely going to return dividends in regards to experience and growth in your long term career. Also, Eric is one of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. The leadership being brought in from other competitors is doing a great job of challenging the ""original reps'"" thoughts and way of doing things and it is exciting to see.","It is never enough, leadership and management always want more, more, more. If you hit 120% they want 150% to make up for those who couldn't achieve the goal. If you are working 10 hours they would LOVE IT if you worked 15 hours and weekends if you can manage it. It is always a message of all hands on deck, now is not the time to rest, never is the time to rest! They leave it ""up to the individual"" to take time for themselves but then tell the sales team that if they take time off to make it up after you return and work extra to make up for the time off."

422,Zoom Video Communications,Great Company to Work For,2021-01-11,4.0,Sales AE,Sales team sets you up to win. You have several opportunities to be successful and the team is happy to help.,Not many but new sales leaders in SMB do not seem fit for the job. They use big sales terms and give you a peppy speech about sales. We need and want real leaders who are willing to put some sweat into managing.
423,Zoom Video Communications,Great start to sales career,2021-01-11,5.0,Business Development Representative,Zoom supports each of their employees personally and professionally.

Employees are well treated and rewarded with bonuses with perks like $300/month for extra expenses, Internet and Bring Your Own Device reimbursements and great benefits package. The Zoom products are great tools for customers to help make their lives better during Covid and beyond. This company cares about people both internally and externally and it shows. I would highly recommend Zoom to anyone looking for a career and not just a job.",The growth is tremendous and we sometimes forget how fortunate we are to be a part of this opportunity. This perfect storm of growth is not normal and we need to take a step back and count our blessings daily.

433,Zoom Video Communications,Mostly amazing,2020-12-04,5.0,Account Executive,"-  Market leader with frequent updates and innovation
- Massive market awareness and most clients love us
- Overall competitive package when factoring in RSUs
- Great sales tech stack
- Unparalleled commission and perks structure, better than I've seen at any tech company
- High hiring standard means most colleagues are capable, smart and helpful
- Mostly realistic ramp period and targets, though this appears to be changing a bit with the Zoom Boom
- Extremely flexible and accommodating with COVID
- Massive focus on creating a helpful, caring and inclusive team culture at all levels of the company
- Frequent gifts, events and surprises 
- Excellent online knowledge base, takes two seconds to find an answer for a customer most of the time
- Massive flexibility to approach deals the way you want with minimal red tape or quota retirement penalties","- Not necessarily a con, but life at Zoom is extremely fast paced and it may be hard for some to keep up 
- Base salaries are definitely on the low side and could use a review, though the perks, RSUs and commission structure mostly make up for this
- The culture is shifting towards a more corporate environment, inevitable with such large growth, but definitely needs to be managed appropriately
- Clawback structure needs a fairness revamp. As it currently stands it heavily discourages reps from selling an entire product category. 
- Marketing needs a boost to combat Teams and raise market awareness of Zoom Phone. General market awareness shouldn't be a rep's job. 
- Support and sales ops need more resources
- CRM needs to be managed better. Lots of duplicate and dead accounts/contacts so territories are distorted. I'd say only about 30% of my accounts can genuinely be sold to. 
- Currently there doesn't seem to be much ability to move between departments (jumping from Sales to Sales Enablement etc), though initiatives like Zoom Bloom appear to be addressing this"

The worst dev process i've ever seen at a company. Every step of this process is built to suck up days of time and management acts as if your agile and gives you very little time to do work. Zoom is about as agile as a lead brick.

DOES NOT USE VERSION CONTROL. Sure they have git, but they don't use it! Enjoy finding out master isn't really master and having to copy paste work manually from one branch into another.

Dependence on overseas teams will make you wonder why they have any US workers at all considering everything has to go through China."

All-in-all, this is a great company and opportunity. The Pros outweigh the Cons, but there still are some.","Some of these may be unique to sales...

- Unprepared leaders being thrust into management positions.
- Taking time off is looked down upon, unless you are crushing your quota. Unlimited MTO is a bit of a scam.
- CRM is extremely unorganized, with plenty of duplicate accounts and very unbalanced territories."
440,Zoom Video Communications,Great company but even better CEO,2020-10-26,5.0,SMB Account Executive,Just watch an interview with our CEO and know that he is the exact same person off-camera. Zoom genuinely cares.,Standard growing pains but the company constantly evolving to keep up

Inexperienced managers - scattered and executing without proper strategy. Anxiety and stress are written all over faces. Finger pointing, no accountability.

-Incredible company culture from the jump
-Job security to the Nth degree
-The CEO is an incredible person and it shows
-The business sense is solid, product is amazing, the company is killing it here for sure and will for a long, long time","1. ""Unlimited PTO"" is an absolute scam. Time off isn't possible when your workload resembles 2+ people's worth
2. Management is scrambling and prioritizes the wrong things constantly. Some are being carried by an excellent product. (Not all, of course. Some are outstanding in their roles, some are throwing darts at a board and seeing what sticks)
3. The company is running far too tight of a human capital budget and it shows (see point 1)
4. The 'Zoom boom' has caused a dramatic shift in the company culture. We've lost sight of valuing time with our family, time and investment in our community(was this one ever there?), and practicing self-care
5. Constant meetings, often without a purpose or without benefit or to talk about talking about ideas instead of just digging in and getting the work done
6. Things don't get fixed or addressed after the fact at nearly enough urgency. Future and change is the constant
7. The company's stance on remote work is actually garbage - COVID forced the company to rethink it and they still can't commit to it definitively"

-Unlimited Vacation (if your manager will let you take it)
-Fun Culture, but only in the Denver Office","-TERRIBLE LEADERSHIP (absolutely awful, they promote people to leadership roles based on length of time worked with the company, and not on their qualifications or quality of work. Most leaders have no idea what they're doing and are more like dictators)
-Poor Work Life Balance --> Expected to work more than 40 hours a week/ look at your chat all day even on weekends
-Company is filled with unintelligent people (no Doers, just a bunch of Delegaters, --> causes so many things to fall through the cracks)
-Leadership never fixes things for the better, just look for quick fixes constantly (the downstream effect is that you'll have to contact 5 different teams just to figure out a simple problem)
-Cross team communication is a nightmare, every team thinks they're the most important (they either won't answer you, tell you they're super busy even though everyone is busy, or they'll ask you for something with an unrealistic turn around time)
-Don't get to take that much vacation time
-No career opportunities (most vacant spots are filled by new hires, rather than hired within) -- promotions for non leadership roles are pretty non existent"

The benefits are amazing and we are constantly spoiled with fun events, gifts and opportunities to attend interesting and relevant events!

Zooms support teams are some of the best I've worked with and go above and beyond daily to help our customers and fellow team members, they're amazing!

In the current climate, Zooms messaging to employees has been clear about putting our safety first and, providing additional benefits to help as much as possible. Zooms response to Covid and helping us through such a challenging and busy time has been remarkable.","With fast growth, challenges are expected and it can be difficult to keep up with the frequent changes and updates.

In such a fast paced environment, finding time to improve product knowledge can also be difficult.

Although benefits are amazing, base salaries would benefit from a solid reveue and realignment. As recruitment is often managed from our international offices (they're a great team!) it can be difficult demonstrating value and justifying salary negotiations."

-An awesome culture of collaboration and winning as a team, and also a culture of promoting from within.

- Excellent benefits, free lunches, team bonding events and they're always adding more perks!
- I work really closely with my manager to develop my skills and my career. We have an open dialogue about my needs and wants, and how we can get there. 
- Not to be dramatic, but Zoom has changed my life in so many ways and I'm so happy to be working here!","- As we grow, we are starting to lose a little bit of that start-up feel.

There have been massive changes at Zoom in my 1.5 year tenure, but I feel confident taking those in stride because I know at the heart of those decisions that our exec leadership was thinking about its people.

480,Zoom Video Communications,Zoom checks all my most important boxes,2020-04-19,5.0,Data Scientist,"The culture at Zoom is very positive and truly happiness-focused. 

There is a willingness from leadership to be fully transparent, from all the way at the top on down. Sometimes someone might have to ask the question ""Why?"", but I have never seen an issue or question ignored or denied a response, no matter how uncomfortable it might be to do so.

The people and teams I have personally worked with have been fantastic. The strong connection I had with all the people I met during my hiring process was a major selling point when choosing Zoom, and my impression has not changed.

So many awesome fringe benefits! Some jobseekers like to think that they'd rather have an extra couple thousand in salary, but the value that these benefits bring for motivation, encouragement, and personal growth cannot be replaced with incremental cash that you would never even think about. Some benefits aren't even advertised -- fireside chats with famous business leaders and celebs, monthly treats, random gifts...","If you can get an offer from all the top tech companies, Zoom's comp probably won't be the highest.

While working from home is not uncommon on an occasional basis, working fully remote is not an option for most roles. (There are exceptions, but very rare for non-sales.)

Some teams do not yet have a clearly defined career path for all roles. 

No 401k match... BUT I think people way overvalue 401k matches."

490,Zoom Video Communications,A Dream Job and Culture,2020-04-18,5.0,SMB Account Executive,"BENEFITS:
+Very generous health and wellness benefits that go beyond most company benefits policies. This includes gym reimbursement,  free mental health counseling, free book reimbursement, lunch served 4 days a week, a fully stocked kitchen in each office, free virtual workout sessions, and much more.

+Ridiculously low healthcare insurance costs (you get to choose between HSA, PPO, or HMO [if in CO or CA]),

+We also have MTO (unlimited time off) and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) which you can put 20% of your paycheck towards for a 15% discount on Zoom stock.

+RSUs are provided to new employees to vest over 4 years and you don't have to purchase them!

+Even if you didn't get hired pre-IPO for Zoom, we are just getting started on being #1 in our industry worldwide. There's a lot more money to be made from any department member at Zoom if you want to make a 10 or 20 year career at Zoom.  Every employee at Zoom does make a difference internally and with how we are received by our customers. 


AS A SALES TEAM MEMBER:
+High energy sales team in most offices, especially San Jose and Denver. We have high expectations for our team members to work hard, put in a solid 8 hours a day, and deliver customer happiness. What does customer happiness look like? It means getting on Zoom meetings with your customers/prospects and being able to solution sell the benefits of Zoom's meeting, room, and phone technology. Get a customer in a trial + have great follow up/customer service and you have a good chance of winning the customer over. The product sells itself!!!

+There are so many resources to count. You have a dedicated Phone Product Specialist that will help you on any Zoom Phone deals and they have competitive info that can give our customers confidence in testing our phone product. Also, you have access to a solution engineer for any pre-sales opportunities so that you don't have to be technical with the product. We have partners who can help you through the channel of resell and hardware partners. We also have a dedicated CSM team that will help you train your higher paying accounts with training and onboarding.

+Managers want you to be successful. They will not make every sales person happy but the good ones (there's a lot of them) will fight for you when it comes to quota relief, bookings, conflicts with other sales members, difficult customers, and escalating requests to leadership and other departments. My manager does all of this and more. She knows the strengths of our team and is always figuring out new ways to engage our team and connect us. Funny part about this whole COVID-19 and working from home is that our team is actually closer now than ever before. And this is because of my manager. She brings the best out of us.

+As big as Zoom is getting, you still have access to leadership to help you. A simple ping and hop on a Zoom meeting with even our CEO is possible at Zoom. A lot of employees don't realize this. On top of this, our leadership team is very transparent in listening to our concerns.

+Promotions are up for grabs every quarter. I've been promoted several times because I applied and prepared for my internal interviews with hiring managers. If you really want it and show through your work ethic and performance, Zoom will promote you and increase your income/salary/stock rewards.


PRODUCT:
+It just works! Have you tested our competitors? Imagine if you couldn't use Zoom anymore? How devastated would you be in being able to get things done?

+Zoom allows our employees to add/suggest/escalate product requests no matter what level position you have. We use a company called UserVoice to up or down vote product/feature enhancements and concerns. You can put in your own suggestion and it may find its place on the Zoom product roadmap. It's newly implemented in the past 6 months so I am excited to see what that looks like by the end of 2020.

+We have an exceptional product that I believe some employees don't even realize. Many of our competitors do not innovate at the pace that Zoom does. Our engineering teams are working 24/7 around the world to develop Zoom. Our engineers in San Jose are the BEST in the world at what they do. I'd highly recommend every employee to visit our San Jose office and get a tour of the engineering floor.  Meet some of the men and women who work on the product and then talk to our product team led by Oded. You will be AMAZED to hear what we are working on. The future is not too far away with Zoom's roadmap.","+We have MTO (unlimited time off) - only con is that we can get so busy and passionate about our work at Zoom that it's difficult to take off without lettings work stack up and projects get delayed. Customers need us!

+No 401k match yet - but it's not that big of a deal because we have the ESPP and RSU plans!"

531,Zoom Video Communications,"Authentic, Transparent & People Matter!",2020-04-17,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Everyone talks about culture and creating a wonderful culture for your employees to thrive. Everyone talks about being customer-centric and putting customers first as a mantra. VERY few companies actually deliver on those promises - and even fewer deliver on BOTH fronts. Eric values and appreciates his employees and understands that if we are HAPPY - we will truly DELIVER HAPPINESS to our customers. We CARE about our customers, we care about each other, we care about our teammates, we care about our community. Eric always wants to do the right thing - for his employees, for our customers, shareholders, and for the world. Zoom is transforming the way people collaborate and communicate and Eric wants to help as many people as possible have access to our technology to make the world a better place. At first glance, I can understand how some people would perceive these statements as cheesy. Once you are actually here experiencing the culture, you will understand the value of what it means to DELIVER HAPPINESS!",Better onboarding and training for new hires - that is more specific to your role.
532,Zoom Video Communications,Best Job with the Greatest CEO,2020-04-17,5.0,Account Executive,"I've worked at Zoom for a little over two years.  Before joining the team I spent much of my time evaluating leadership through online content.  After many hours of watching YouTube videos of Eric Yuan (external interviews & internal marketing content), I quickly knew that this was the type of leader that I wanted to work for.  He seemed to be a genuine, thoughtful, caring individual that wanted to better connect the world. And that's the truth - Eric is freaking awesome!

Over the past 27 months, I cannot recall a single decision made by Eric that I have not supported.  He was been nothing but thoughtful, caring, and empathetic to his workforce, clients, and the greater community.  I would take a bullet for that man.

As far as other leaders within the organization, the vast majority share his core value of CARE.  The team is always doing the best that they can to put the interest of the employees first. 

The day-to-day in my role has been very fun & rewarding.  Zoom has built a brand that customers trust, so overall the sales/customer relationships have been fantastic!  It's rare to have to deal with clients that are upset with us, which makes the daily grind easy.

Overall, it's the best job I've ever had, and highly recommend working for Zoom.","We've had significant growth over the years, and that of course comes with challenges.  It's difficult to maintain the start up culture feel when you're on-boarding so many new hires each month.  Therefore, if you're looking for that start up culture, at this stage, I do not feel that Zoom will provide that.  We do our best, but it's just not the same when an organization has 10s/100s of employees vs 1000s.

Some of the new leadership have fallen short in making decisions that align to Zoom's core values, but overall, it has not been tremendously damaging to my experience at Zoom.  It's more along the lines of corp change that comes with growth, and I believe any organization would struggle with this."
533,Zoom Video Communications,Happy and Delivering Happiness,2020-04-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company culture and emphasis on work-life balance and happiness of employees are not just slogans, they are the core values. At Zoom, executives believe that if the employees are taken care of, then they will take care of the clients. 
The product is the best and when you face clients every day who are very pleased with the product and keep coming back for more or write thank you notes, it gives you so much satisfaction and makes you get up every day to strive for more. This is multiplied by millions now during this strange time. 
Business process and structure in departments are designed the best to fit each department and hence interactions among the different functional departments are quick and efficient in most cases. People truly work as a team and opinions are respected and implemented if appropriate and in sync with the direction of the department.
Thanks to everyone at Zoom for working so hard and making a difference in the world.","Compare to the speed of growth, there are no cons and it is all opportunities to learn and develop."

619,Zoom Video Communications,I have won the lottery,2020-04-16,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Having worked for Zoom for over 4 years (always in sales), I can truly say I have won the lottery. Since I started, Zoom continues to stay focused and committed to  delivering happiness to employees, customers, investors and now pretty much the entire world. It is amazing I had to  explain “who Zoom was” a mere 4 years ago to now seeing it be used by EVERYONE to stay connected.  Recently leadership rolled out ZoomCares which gave a matching bonus to EVERY Zoom employee to make a donation to their charity of choice. Our leadership team did have to make a difficult decision to adjust our comp plans due to the incredible unprecedented demand we have seen due to COVID. But this is business!

Outside of sales, we have a dedicated incredible team in all roles across the company working tirelessly to support our customers. It is truly humbling to see the commitment of everyone working at Zoom.","We have grown and continue to grow at a rapid pace. There can be a lot of noise because of this.

- With that though almost all areas of the company have room for improvement and everyone is so positive I feel like sometimes these really don’t get talked about. Ironically gripes over much smaller gripes that may only be affecting individuals get brought up and discussed in all hands.

He also wants Zoom partners to win. He pushes the idea that when they win, Zoom wins. Happy employees who believe in the company also leads to an incredible environment. Everyone is working toward a communal goal; not for simply a paycheck (though they make sure everyone is compensated well above market rate).

- Good balance of pushing sales reps to suceed and understanding that we can't control everything. Zoom emphasizes the inputs & employee effort and trusts that the outputs will happen. As a sales rep, I really like that.

Also, don't look at a partnership as a negative, that is what Cisco & Polycom did, and they went all proprietary with a lot of their equipment only allowing API access, we need to do better about partnering with companies that offer a solution that is comparable to ours.

There are way too many salespeople - upper management is starting to notice, and doing drastic things to get people out. There aren't real territories carved out, unless you're in a higher segment. It seems that the lower segments are at the bottom of the totem pole in the organization. There is a lot of hostility among salespeople that include cheating, stealing accounts/reports, etc. Zoom is growing so fast that we have SO many tools, which comes with a growing company.

I have reason to believe Zoom Video is the exception, not the rule, due to how well the sales organization is run and structured. This culture starts from the executive suite, and trickles down. They have chosen exceptional sales leaders (big shout out to Ben Volkman in Denver!) who have created an atmosphere of trust, support, personal development and understanding, as opposed to the ""fear"" based sales culture, which is so common. Everyone is working together towards the same goal, selling a product we  all believe in. The Proof is in the pudding.

Zoom is an exceptional place to work in all aspects - it's flawless! It's an honor to be a part of Zoom's mission. Here are a few reasons why Zoom is a happy place to work:

- amazing team members: everyone is cool, happy, and caring
- lots of opportunities for growth: the company is growing on the lightning pace
- fantastic product: it's easy to write true compelling blogs, market and sell it

729,Zoom Video Communications,"Simply the""Patriots Way"" in the Corporate World, With Happiness!!!!",2018-06-20,5.0,Commercial Account Manager,"If you buy into the theory that customers don't buy what you do but why you do it, then Zoom has the best WHY in their industry. Started by an unbelievably humble but extraordinarily intelligent man Zoom strives to deliver happiness to its customers. Happy customers = happy employees = exponential growth! Here are a few things I love about working at this company. 

1) The culture - I've never worked at a place where people are always smiling and will stop what they are doing to introduce themselves (CEO included). Everyone is very willing to help, and I feel like being part of a team here rather than just a company. 

2) Familiarity / Reputation - As an account manager who's sold plenty of products from companies you've never heard of, it's a breath of fresh air when speaking with prospects and strangers who know about your company and what you do. Even better, they LOVE the product! I always get stopped at the airport when wearing my Zoom t-shirt or backpack. 

3) Office - if you've ever worked for a bay area tech company you will understand what I'm talking about. They have a good stock of snacks, amazing coffee machine, and even an infused water dispenser. To boot, they provide a lunch allowance for the awesome cafeteria downstairs for 4 days a week. 

4) The Leadership- We work with genuine people, who listen to your concerns and implement action when necessary. There is no competition amongst managers, just a well-coordinated team executing on the plays. Finally the CEO, who after being surrounded when he concluded took time to answer everyone's questions after sincerely listening to what his employees had to say.","Onboarding is a little tough out of the gate because you are expected to produce right away while having to attend mandatory training meetings and complete mandatory training modules. Still, they are helpful and the discussions always leave you better than where you started, but they can really fill up a day."
730,Zoom Video Communications,Great Place and Lots of Growth and Opportunity,2018-06-20,4.0,Sales Associate,"Lots of Opportunities to win, team-oriented, great management team, challenging but attainable quotas, phenomenal product. Everyone is working towards the same goal which is awesome and the buzz in the office every day is infectious.","Needs streamlined training - no real support after you are put on-ramp, some bitterness (occasional animosity)  from ""old"" employees who feel like the hiring is making their jobs harder."

Some of the pros include great benefits, free lunch Mon. through Thurs., unlimited MTO, corporate kitchen with snacks and drinks, very fun and happy culture, monthly events, and management that cares for their teams well being and professional growth.

- GREAT, innovative
- Job perks are mostly on par with other Silicon Valley startups","- Poor management on both C-level and mid-level will slowly but surely hinder the company. There are some kind, talented, and caring managers but there are just as many old-fashioned sales slime (generally ex-WebEx people and the like) who are looking to make a buck and without regard to their people or the company 
- Innovation is mostly limited to product, other areas are very far behind the times and they struggle to catch up despite pressure from below"

- free lunch 4 days a week

745,Zoom Video Communications,"Great company to work for, busy but fun",2018-04-25,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,I have worked for other employers and have found that Zoom really cares about its employees. If I ever have a problem I feel like I can go to a lead or a manager to help get the issue resolved.  The colleagues I interact with on a daily basis always work hard and are always very helpful when answering questions. This environment has been the most cooperative environment that I've ever been in,"- Growing pains of having a lot of new hires in a short window makes it challenging to get to know everyone

752,Zoom Video Communications,A company who cares for everyone.,2018-04-11,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,"-  Excellent managers.  Always willing to work with you if you are willing to let them know you have any concerns or questions.  They will walk around to make sure everyone is doing okay.  They aren't mind readers, if you need assistance, their door is always open and I appreciate them always fielding any questions I may ask them.

- Excellent co-workers.  Everyone is always extremely nice and always willing to help you with anything you may need.  I've bothered people on their days off and they would still answer me.  

- Everyone is treated equally.  Bottom line, they treat you like a grown up.  They cater food for you and all they want in return is to throw your own plate away and pick up after yourself if you make a mess.  Just like you would at your own house.   They are not our maids, so just be respectful.  You also get beverages, snacks, coffee, etc etc.  Get ready to put on your freshmen 15!

- Promotions every where.  I joined the team in December and so far I've seen 4 promotions to team leads, 1 to CSM, 1 other to another senior level role and another to our IT department.  That's just on our Technical Support Engineering team!  I've never had this experience at any company.  Normally it takes a few years before they even consider you for any other position.  Kudos to Zoom on this one!

- Respect.  Never heard any bad talk about anyone.  Everyone is courteous to each other and will respect your boundaries.  My last job we had a lot of cross talk and gossip all over.  I haven't heard anything since I joined here.   

-  Money.  Great competitive pay.  I worked at a company for 5 years just making more than I do now, but with the bonuses/weekend work here, I'm going to surpass that this year easily.","One con and I'm not even sure it's a con, is they will only let you work 2 weekends in a row then you need to take one off.  This is to prevent you from burning out.  Hey, I get it, they don't want you to get burned out.  Makes sense, I just wish I could work more."

-Benefits are off the charts awesome! Lunch provided Mon-Thurs every week + much more 
-Deliver Happiness isn't just a PR play, it's really what happens every day at Zoom.

It's an absolute joy to come into work every day.",Some of the hiccups of a business moving from start-up to bona fide company worth $$
762,Zoom Video Communications,Amazing Place to Work,2018-04-09,5.0,Account Executive,"When Zoom talks about Delivering Happiness, they really aren't kidding around. I haven't ever been happier professionally or more fulfilled. I am not only delighted every day to sell a product that works so well, but I am supported by a network of colleagues who respect each other and will go out of their way to help each other no matter what. This is genuinely a community and not just a place to work - I can't say enough great about Zoom. The management is invested not just in making this company incredibly successful, but ensuring we as employees have balanced and healthy lives. From top to bottom, this company delivers!",Only downside is that I didn't know about Zoom earlier and wasn't able to benefit from this company for my entire career.

771,Zoom Video Communications,Don't believe the hype... this place is not a team.,2018-03-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great TECHNOLOGY.  Customers love it!,"Ruthless SALES team in San Jose; they will cut your throat and knees at the same time as saying how they are one happy team.  

Every person is out for their own agenda and they are NOT team players.   It is a BRUTAL sales floor environment.  Oh and if you want to USE their technology and WFH, nope.  You have to be on the sales floor.  

It's like being in a fraternity.  Music, throwing things, dudes w bromance making noise.    Totally like college -- but I'm in my 30s.  (I think the women hate it more)

Sales reps are highly territorial by nature but they are NOT any team players.  No one will help you with anything.  They set you up w a mentor versus having a manager actually help you out. 

The management team is totally UNAWARE of any of this as they are fed the ""happiness"" story by their executive team members and old buddies."
772,Zoom Video Communications,A company that cares about their employees,2018-03-22,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,Zoom is awesome. They listen to their employees and go way out of their way to make sure everyone is happy. Delivering happiness starts with being a great place to work. Having happy employees leads to happy customers. It works.,The company is growing super fast. The training doesn't appear to be scaled to the growth just yet. The good news is they are aware of this and improving the processes.
773,Zoom Video Communications,Lives up to the hype,2018-03-21,5.0,Account Executive,"I had heard of the amazing things around Zoom before I started, but you never really know how it is until you've been at a job for a while. Zoom lives up to the hype and then some. 
I've never been at a place that actually cares about the happiness of their customers and employees like Zoom does. Our CEO, Eric, says that he learned quickly that in order to have happy customers, you need happy employees. 
From the start, you are set up for success and literally, every employee in the company will give you assistance if needed.",No more Redbull's in the Denver office :(

In the sales organization, I've been able to work at our San Jose, Denver, and Santa Barbara offices.
No business is perfect, but the one constant that makes this company the best it can be is our leader, Eric Yuan.  With his leadership, innovation will always be a top priority. And even more than that, his employees and customers are his #1 priority.","From a company culture and business standpoint, it's hard to find flaws."
785,Zoom Video Communications,Incredible place to be,2018-02-12,5.0,Sales,"Sooooo many pros. It’s a very flat organization - I would be very comfortable going to the CEO, President, SVP of Sales, or anyone in the chain of command to pitch an idea. The support is incredible; my manager and his manager encourage sales people to invite them to calls to help win deals. The product is incredible and the mantra of Delivering Happiness is completely legit. The perks are amazing, from snacks and drinks in the break room to subsidized lunches four days a week, Zoom does a great job of caring for its employees. A virtuous cycle has been the key to success here.","Only two things come to mind - 1) its still a startup, so things change constantly. If you are not comfortable adapting, there may be frustrations (they do a good job of explaining that during the hiring process), and 2) no future job will come close to the culture Zoom has created."

Great location in DTC. No travel.,"Most employees are not trained sales people and create favoritism amongst the sales floor that hurts the team. I witnessed tenured employees giving potential new prospects bad reviews and blocking them from jobs based on the fact ""they didn't like them"" I left this company for that reason.

788,Zoom Video Communications,Best. Job. Ever! #blessed,2018-01-12,5.0,Sales & Leadership,"Selling a product that is undeniably leaps and bounds ahead of it's competition is a slam dunk. The best part, however, is without a doubt the culture. Being surrounded by a family of colleagues, striving toward a common goal, and having boat loads of fun in the process can not be beat. We are in the right place, at the right time, with the right people. I never, in my wildest dreams, imagined I would love what I do as much as I do at Zoom.",It's hard thinking it will ever be as good as this.

Not enough of promoting valued, eager, driven individuals from the inside to higher roles. 

Growing pains with processes and employees, management and teams not being on the same page. 

Unlimited time off (which should be a perk) but there is no quota relief so it's not easy to take advantage of this perk."

800,Zoom Video Communications,"Awesome work environment, Amazing Work Culture",2017-12-06,5.0,Senior Contract Administrator,"I wanted to wait to write a review because I wanted to make sure that I could provide a thorough review of the full experience.  Having read the company reviews, I was surprised by how almost cultishly enthusiastic the workers have been.  However, after having been here through a full year, I can say without hesitation that this company has been a great place to work and everyone with very few exceptions have been as much of a pleasure to work with as the reviews state.  It's exciting to be a part of the growth, to see the company develop new processes and innovations and to be a part of the solution.  The work culture that has been developed really has been the lifeblood of the company.  The company motto of ""Delivering Happiness"" really is a part of the work here, and it is not just lingo.  In making every decision, from deciding company benefits, to deciding whether or not to pursue a business deal, from the CEO to the new employee, we are encouraged to consider whether we are ""delivering happiness"" to the customer.  Work life balance is good.  While Zoom is a start up company requiring its employees to wear a lot of hats and fulfill a lot of different roles and responsibilities, this too is a bit of a benefit in that there are always new roles to step into and new and exciting work experiences to grow from.  Company management is not looking to point fingers and to assign blame; people genuinely care for each other and are looking to further the company and each other's needs.  It's been about as fun and enjoyable an experience as work can be.  
     The management go out of their way to reward hard work and to assign credit.  They are always looking for ways to provide new opportunities for the company and for individuals to grow.  They look to push the envelope on growing while staying true to the company roots, delivering happiness to everyone.","As a startup, resources do not always compare the the ""huge"" companies, but management always tries to compete."
801,Zoom Video Communications,Best job on Earth,2017-12-06,5.0,Sales Representative,"You are a human at this company and they really care about you as a person!

The energy does not die down and company culture is a real thing, not something that is talked about only during the interview process. Selling a product that I use everyday/all day and works so well is very fun to sell.  What's made Zoom so unique is the leaders, they are truly the best of the best.",Can't think of anything right now.

The org structure is too flat."
810,Zoom Video Communications,"Smart people, killer product, and a fun environment",2017-09-29,5.0,Account Executive,"I have been at Zoom for about a year and have been impressed with the company culture from the start. There is a strong focus on community, and it is amazing to come to work every day knowing that your peers, managers, and executives care about your livelihood, rather than your contribution to their bottom line. 

The Sales environment, which I am a part of, is focused, competitive, and resourceful. However, we work as a team to train up new employees, close deals and discover new strategies. 

The executive team is truly First Class. Very transparent, and easily accessible since the organizational structure is very flat. 

There are too many good things to say about Zoom. Competitive pay, a lot of Free Zoom swag to wear, and sponsored lunches 3 days per week are just icing on the cake to an all-star environment","Typical startup problems and growing pains, sometimes as a sales professional, you feel the pressure to overwork/stay longer than is right for you."

Co-workers seem to check their egos at the door, help each other out and just the appreciation everyone shows for each other is just amazing and contagious.  It's an exciting atmosphere and a completely new area for me.  A driving force in the future of communication and technology, just the shear talent is amazing.",I think the only con is growth.... growing fast.

Unlike other places I have worked, I do not feel that there are many politics. Everyone is treated equally and your voice is heard. All the offices are amazing and filled with great people. I feel spoiled by how great they treat us (trips, happy hours, team outings, catered lunches 3 days a week, in office snacks and drinks, end of quarter they give out amazing prizes, zoom swag, casual dress code, and so much more)!

•	Sell an amazing product! Every time I get to show someone Zoom that has never experienced the power it has to offer I get excited. It's truly the best in the market which makes it not only fun to sell but you feel confident in everything you are selling.

•	Management! The management team is outstanding and everyone is more than happy to help whether you report to them or not. They all truly care and it's great feeling that your manager has your back.

•	Tools! Zoom is always evaluating new tools/processes to make our lives easier.","•	Focus more on promoting from within - not saying this does not happen because it does but the process can be drawn out. However, I also understand we are currently trying to get some of the best talent in the industry to join our team but we need to make sure to focus on the talent internally first and getting them to where they want to be.

•	401K which will come with time

•	Constant change - this is a given when working for a quickly growing startup but at times can be frustrating."
834,Zoom Video Communications,Best. Job. Ever.,2017-09-19,5.0,Account Executive,"I absolutely love what Zoom's core mission is: Delivering Happiness. This means to its people, customers, community.. you get the idea. 

I have never been apart of a company where people are genuinely happy to come in every day and are eager to help their teammates. Zoom has built an amazing company culture, which is impressive considering the rapid growth. It really has been the most positive experience in my career. 

Not only is the culture amazing, but the PRODUCT is leaps and bounds ahead of anything I have experienced at other companies. When I talk to the customers I hear that they are happy with not only the quality and the fact that it actually works, but that they feel taken care of and heard by Zoom. 

It also doesn't hurt that we are backed by Sequoia.

All and all, if anyone has a chance to become apart of this company- DO IT!","Because we have had such rapid growth, it's hard to find places for people to get set up at. We just got another floor in the building though, so this problem should be solved for now."

I love being at Zoom because the company is full of life and energy (much like a start-up), which is one of the reasons contributing to our success and growth. But the biggest factor for why Zoom so unique is because of the amazing motto we live and work by daily: delivering happiness to our customers.  All of the reviews on Glassdoor that state how awesome Zoom's culture is are 110% accurate and reflective of what it is like to work with the most supportive, intelligent, humble, charismatic, customer-centric, and driven workforces around. The sky is the limit for some companies, but at Zoom, we are reaching for the stars and getting closer every day!","Processes change on a regular basis, but it is because we are routinely improving operational efficiency and seeking better workflows/systems to make everyone more productive."

You can always reach out to management without permission, and they always respond with insightful, helpful, and great advice and help. The benefits are outstanding, and I truly feel like I am more than just an employee here, I have a sense of belonging and a ""family"" feel to Zoom.

Zoom is exactly the kind of company I was looking for in my exhaustive job search. It has the family feel that makes communication flow easily between teams and departments. The CEO is genuine and cares for your personal and professional development.  As I meet other teams to understand their needs, it's very refreshing to see that we're all working toward a common goal.  We are growing together as a family, and working as a company to deliver happiness.  

Thank you Zoom :)",The only con I find so far is having to wait to see what the future holds for all of us.

It's really hard to describe how positive of a working environment and company culture Zoom has, but let me try to put it this way... I have worked at a number of companies, where I've held this exact same role,  and this is the very first time where I've found myself getting excited on Sundays because I know that THE WORK WEEK IS ABOUT TO START UP AGAIN. Almost bewildering...","As we continue to grow and hire more people, it's going to require more of a commitment from each individual to preserve the culture that makes this place so special."

- Easy to work your way up through the ranks
- Product is amazing so it's easy to be passionate about your work. And if you're in sales, the product practically sells itself!",-Not really any cons working here. One of the best companies I have ever worked for :)

852,Zoom Video Communications,Everything you've heard is true!,2017-09-18,5.0,Sales,The management from the top down really strive to keep a 1 of a kind culture. Everyone loves to come to work and is smiling all day.,They are growing probably too quickly. There are already some signs that they may be getting in over there head. However this small red flag is waaaaaaay worth the risk.
853,Zoom Video Communications,Mid Market Account Executive,2017-09-18,5.0,Mid Market Account Executive,"Where to begin:  CEO is a truly caring and thoughtful person.  He went out of his way to come by my cube just to see how I was doing and I thought that was awesome.  He encourages anyone at anytime to reach out to him directly with ideas/thoughts to help Zoom become better so you don't get that ""top down"" structure - its very linear and all execs are accessible.   

Its from our CEO that the culture emanates from - ""happiness"".  People here are really happy and you feel like its ""your family"" after the first few weeks.  

The product is second to none.  Its shows well and is so superior to anything else in our space that you feel incredibly proud.  The Zoom engineers never take their foot off the gas either and the innovations they are making to Zoom make selling it super-fun.  

Training I thought was executed flawlessly.  I felt great coming out of it.  The people around me have been so helpful and with such a collaborative product, getting a hold of anyone within the company for help is a click of the mouse.","Its hard to be critical of a company doing pretty much everything right.  Obviously with such fast growth, there will be those growing pains but I'm not going to knock the company for that. We're growing because we're WINNING and people love our product. Can't find any fault in that."
854,Zoom Video Communications,Zoom is the real deal,2017-09-18,5.0,Customer Succes,"Competitive pay,  quarterly bonus plan, leadership who are willing to adapt and change.

855,Zoom Video Communications,"Highly touted, still better than I expected.",2017-09-18,5.0,International Sales Executive,"INCREDIBLE product that customers adore. Zoom works every time with amazing quality and is the clear leader in the space. 
Pound for pound, Zoom has the most talented people I've ever worked with. Best part is, the culture of sharing knowledge and mentorship to new blood is genuine and far surpassed any experience I had previously. There is a selflessness about teamwork here that doesn't exist anywhere else I've worked. I feel excited to come to work every day. Our CEO and President always keep their doors open to us...they listen and take care of the employees here very well. Our roadmap is largely defined by our customers and their feature requests, so happy customers make for happy employees!",Lots of great tools to learn. Processes are getting better and faster all the time.

The leadership is transparent and forward thinking.  If you're looking to grow yourself with the company this is the place to be!,"None really...but if I had to say the cons are what any other fast growing company goes through (which can be a good thing). Like any growing company the workload can build up and can also be challenging at times, but personally it has been a tremendous development and growth opportunity that I have not gotten at any other company."
858,Zoom Video Communications,Sales Recruiter - Talent Acquisition,2017-09-18,5.0,Sales Recruiter,"Job and career opportunities, good culture that we've been able to maintain, top notch Executive leaders and managers across the board, investment in employees with continued and consistent internal training, team oriented/ supportive and collaborative work environment, lunch catered 3x a week (I've never worked for a company that does this), the coolest backpacks for our laptops (that matters), great location, and overall a good place to come to every day.

860,Zoom Video Communications,Delivering Happiness to Customers and Employees,2017-08-27,5.0,Account Executive,"The company if very employee/customer centric, with the notion that if employees are happy, they will deliver happiness to the customers, which in turn, will create a successful business.  This comes directly from the CEO, President and other Executives, and it's created a culture that is very fun to work in.

Right now, Zoom is growing rapidly with success and leadership has the strong belief to continue innovating the product to keep ahead of the curve.  Unlike other products in the market who have been stagnate for some time, CEO, Eric Yuan, preaches we must always be paranoid that someone will catch up to us.  It's this type of leadership that allows Zoom to continue to raise the bar in it's performance. 

I'm very excited to come to work everyday, as all of my colleagues are inclusive and willing to help a fellow colleague out.  You'll never felt like you're out on an island, not knowing what to do.","-  Zoom is a startup company that is rapidly growing.  This combination means there's a lot of changes in processes and tools, which can be hard to keep up with.  A person must be flexible and able to pivot quickly when working in this environment.

-  Zoom is becoming big enough where internal decision making has slowed a bit.  I still think Zoom acts faster that most companies, though I started when there were many less employees and (for instance) could go directly to a support / operations team member to help push something through.  Now there are a lot more internal checks & balances that have slowed us down."

862,Zoom Video Communications,The hype is very real. No Kool-Aid necessary.,2017-07-06,5.0,Sales Development,"There is huge room for career growth here. Every month and quarter, there are new roles that open up in new segments and business functions. Like anywhere else, it's what you bring to the table and the genuine relationships you build with people that matter most. Zoom is no different in that regard. That being said, there is (almost) zero office politics here. The leaders and people here truly care and want you to succeed, whatever career path you want. I've felt supported and valued from Day 1, and have never felt that I was competing for attention with my peers. Zoom gives you a voice and they listen that voice. The pay and compensation is above average for the industry and respective regions. The management structure is very flat and leaders are so very accessible & approachable. The culture here and onboarding is very unique. I can't speak highly enough of it, it's just something you've got to experience yourself to understand. If you join the rocketship that is Zoom, don't worry about where you're sitting - we're all going to the moon. Don't come here if you're not ready to hustle though - We don't work 40-hour weeks, and that's surprisingly not a ""Con"" at all.","The Cons are few, but they're there.

Not only is the company growing at 300%+ YOY, but I could not ask for a better culture and team to work with.

I have been at Zoom for almost 4 years now and I can tell you that there is no where else I would rather be. My CEO has the biggest heart and truly cares for his employees. He's a first time CEO but his mentors have really help guide him when needed. He has built the best engineering team which separates us from our competitors. We have risen to a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant and because our software is better than our competitors it makes selling easy and thus I can't complain about comp.,Since we are growing so rapidly we are building new processes. Not everyone always agrees with the new processes but if this is the only thing I can complain about leadership must be doing something right!

Furthermore, the product is simply phenomenal and the passion it brings out of me has LITERALLY changed my life. Nope, we're not a cult...we're Zoom!","Nothing outside of some typical ""startup"" growing-pains.
