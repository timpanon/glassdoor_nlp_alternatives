23,Zscaler,Sacrificing Ethics in the Name of a Higher Stock Price,2022-03-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you were hired from AppDynamics, or someone from AppDynamics has decided they like you, then you’re likely going to be successful. 

Stock was nice (until it dropped by $100 and has yet to recover)","You’ll be working less than the industry average regardless of role. Get an internal promotion? Now you’ll make 2/3 of what an outside hire makes in the same position. 

Benefits are mediocre compared to other tech companies in the same position. Except for Stock. 
Which, hopefully, you can stick out 4 years to see most of without needing to take a sabattical from the lack of work life balance here draining your mental health. 

There was a huge hiring front of leadership from AppDynamics following the appointment of the current CRO. This has created a huge culture issue within the company and the exec team has done nothing to address it. 

Work/Life Balance is a pipe dream peddled by the executive team. Do you have a salary? Expect to work 65 hours a week minimum, even in an individual contributor role. 

Hiring sales people like crazy, without scaling Sales support teams (marketing, Ops, channel, CSM). Support is minimal because everyone else is spread so thin. 

Literal product support sits overseas and garners frequent complaints from customers. 

A surprising amount of dollars seem to go toward the sales enablement team( look at the most recent SKO for reference) but I don’t know a single person who really understands how any of our sales tools work. 

The stock price is God. Every single thing revolves around it, at the expense of culture, common sense, and decision making. Things change constantly with seemingly no explanation. Decisions and tool purchases feel RUSHED simply to appear cutting edge to the market. 

And for the love of God, before giving any more money to people.ai , someone in this company figure out how to make their tool work in the ZS ecosystem if it’s going to be the Bible for tracking sales activities."

Usually when you think of start-up culture, you think of long days, nights, and weekends. Being on the support side, and working globally, I have had to take a few off-hours meetings, but I'm consistently told by my management to leave early on a Friday to make up for it, or take a half day.

The management across all orgs are all tuned into this culture as well. The org isn't siloed at all, and everyone is willing to step out of their role and help at any given time. The company feels like one big team all working towards the same goals.","The pace is fast, and the staffing is lean, which is sometimes great, but when you run into issues it can be tough to get people focused on them, as opposed to moving on to the next project. Being lean also means QA teams and documentation teams are often slower than the release schedule, which can present some challenges."

Strong sales enablement team and world class SE’s.,"I don’t think it’s a systemic issue, but there is a fair amount of mid-level (AVP/RVP) to frontline manager (RSD) dysfunction, which leads to trust issues and ultimately micro-managerial behavior. Again, I think / hope what I’m seeing is isolated and not a widespread culture issue. The customer-first core values preached at the top are often lost in translation during the sales process. Often pushing customers to work within our sales process (which is supposed be all about the customer, but it’s really just about us getting a sale) and timelines, not the customers. This can be highly effective for a first sale, but exudes a traditional transactional SaaS selling motion, not a long term strategic partner."

I came from infrastructure, network & security industry for more than a decade. Zscaler has built a disruptive technology which is very hard for anyone to replicate. I would consider Zscaler as the 'Apple', 'Salesforce' or 'Tesla' in the CyberSecurity market place. 
Leadership understands the pain of managing in the infrastructure; and have found a solution which delivers a simplified and uber-secured experience; rather than throwing one more security appliance on to your stack.
Recruitment process was very transparent and tough one to crack. Best I have experienced till date. The Onboarding is taken seriously and it's all for good reasons. 
Company benefits are industry standard; but most importantly they offer an awesome ESPP plan with 2 year rollback lock price.
We are in growth phase, all ideas are welcome and listened to.","Since the company is in growth phase, the stock is very volatile. It was considered as one of the highest ranking growth company in 2021. So the only con I would consider is that the equity value differs a lot.

115,Zscaler,Real picture,2021-12-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Compensation and Stocks - US and EMEA
Popular SASE solution","1. It is more like a ""family owned"" business rather like a publicly listed company. Most operations are run from a single country in APAC, to minimise costs, enjoy exploiting people due to weak rather no labour laws. Literally, no defined working hours. Leaders flaunt overwork and it is wore as a sign of honour.

Covid has accelerated adoption of SASE technology for companies (both based on need and panic) and this has benefitted Zscaler. The product has been majorly unchanged before and post the outbreak but the market demand has steered things in its favour. 

2. State of core teams within the company:

Sales
Most of the RSMs/SE's/SA's are from larger companies and have brought dearth of valuable knowledge with them. This clearly translates into the work they do. Massive pressure on Sales, and lot of focus on ""Value"" based selling than against actual needs of a customer. 

Product Management:
Chaotic product ownership. There are no existing product specifications/drafts or documented knowledge of how features operate under the hood. The information resides in someone, who does not want to document it, since it would make them less relevant. Features are released silently, without clear steps and customers are left to fish for themselves, spending countless hours with Support (who're equally clueless behind the curtains). 

Engineering:
Massive gap between PM and Developer functions. Both seem to operate in their own silo. Never have I witnessed these two functions in so much of disagreement for GA features

Services (Support/PS/CS):
State of each team is dependent on the local leadership, no established process for a decade old company, overworked teams, poor work culture - majority of the services staff are based out of a single country in the APAC region, flooded with incompetent managers. They force employees to spend their free time outside of work on working extra, attend trainings while working at 100% capacity.

There was literally no activity done over diwali whereas we kept on receiving notifications for Halloween. The management needs to see this


Also, they do not have a permanent or hybrid approach for WFH. Alot of new employees have joined from various locations and would prefer to have an open policy around this so that we all can literally work in peace post covid."

All the CEO cares about is his stock prices and will do whatever it takes to keep driving it up. Sales culture is lacking, too much control is given to individual reps, who again only care about selling as much as possible. They say they're ""scaling"" which just means hiring so many people that there isn't enough work to go around, so you're stuck doing busy work for a majority of your day. Very distant leadership, don't expect anyone above your manager to know your name or what you do. Lots of marketing gimmicks I couldn't stand behind.

Everyone is friendly, helpful, they try to make you feel welcome, they get involved if they think they can assist you or an effort, and l truly have felt set up for success. I have all of the support, people, training and resources l need to do my job, and if there is something l need that l cannot find l am either pointed in the right direction and/or it is built. Everyone is collaborative & open to feedback. Plus, starting a full time remote job during COVID (particularly as a people manager) is tough, but Zscaler has really done a great job to go fully virtual and stay connected.","Like any fully remote company there are existing pains. People tend to work hard but in a vacuum, which results in silos. This sometimes has created duplicative efforts/work. Communication could be better. Company initiatives and goals beyond revenue targets would be great to understand in depth, as they are not expressed in a way that helps drive individual team goals. Benefits packages are another point of stress. Great job getting diverse candidates, more women in leadership, etc., but in order to attract more women & diversity l think taking a closer look at things like maternity/paternity leave are very important. Particularly for a Bay Area based company this package is not competitive, and what l would call to be lower than standard."

259,Zscaler,Good products and team,2021-08-02,5.0,Regional Sales Manager,Products are really nice for EU. So we concentrate communicating value of our products. And ecosystems are really supportive.,"As for the benefits, I think there is room for improvement."
260,Zscaler,"Great product, but terrible leadership and management making people very unhappy at work",2021-08-01,2.0,Regional Sales Manager,Very good product. Good salary but difficult quotas so you wont never get your bonus but they have a good RSU’s package to compensate that.,"The obsession with the process and worst with the reporting are making people to be fed up. They are loosing the focus in customers. They dont care about employees for them people in the company are not assets. Anybody can do the job if you follow the process, you report everything all the time the report of the report in the report….and you do not have any value. Worklife balance is impossible and if you try to find it they will “invite you” to leave….any success in your role is not recognize by the management, the merit is that you have follow the process, however, if a deal is not happening then the problem is not the process that is magic! It is yours that you wont apply it well. When you need to step out the process to win a deal, then you are blamed also….they are fundamentalist with the process and do not think that we are people selling to people.

Rules are not clear neither , middle management do not know well the process neither so they are not able to transmit nd engage people with the company. Poor leadership and terrible communication and feedback skills.

Many people are leaving due to this."

263,Zscaler,Culture Getting Worse with each passing day,2021-07-26,2.0,Customer Service Manager (CSM),It WAS an amazing company to work with but can't say this anymore,"1) Culture ""WAS"" great -
When I joined Zscaler the culture here was extremely great. The entire focus and attention was on the employee's mental heath which no doubt turned in the favor of the company and everybody pushed their limits happily and willingly. But, that doesn't hold true anymore.

2) Benefits do not percolate to IC-
The Senior level management is great, the company policies are great, the CEO is great. But, the benefits do not percolate to the levels of individual contributors.

3) New Managers are the worst-
The new managers have made the lives worst, they are pushing the team members for everything and themselves have no knowledge to match up to the level of a manager. You can't go to them for any assistance but for they'll keep reminding you about the processes.

4) SFDC is more important than the customer - 
The environment is Zscaler has become such that filling ur sfdc is more important than the customer itself and you could get penalized very severly fir the not maintaining ur sfdc hygiene.

5) Assets leaving the Organization-
It is being seen that the Senior level employee and the assests of the organization who had been working in Zscaler for 7-8 years have started leaving the company 

6) Too much Micromanagement-
The micromanagement part has increased a lottttttttttt, the best part of te orgnization was the freedom to make mistakes and to do your work as you please but, that is slowly fading away

7) P&C team-
The P&C team is also not that proactive and concerned about the mental well being of the employees like before

Summary : To sum things up, Zscaler used to be a great organization to work for but that does not hold true anymore, it has also become like any other money minting organization who doesn't give a damn about the employees"

One of the top qualities we seek is empathy, and this shows with the engagement that management of all levels brings to the table. Our founder and CEO sets the tone with his hard work, open communication, and employee focus. He is super effective on customer-facing sales calls.

The sales process is highly valued here - we do it not because it's ""the process"" but rather because it is proven to bring positive results. It provides guardrails and a common language for Reps, SEs and management to collaborate. You will earn serious cash if you embrace it and work hard.

And the solution set is excellent - like ""only one in upper right Magic Quadrant"" good. The platform approach we bring to customers is well-received: it solves actual problems they have today, and in many cases hits the trifecta of ""reduces costs, improves performance, easier to deploy.""","Not sure, I consider that a con, but It's not easy to get hired here. You have to really want it, and you have to demonstrate it effectively."

They then must rely on partnering with other cloud security offerings to fill the gaps. Not truly a ""cloud offering"" as much of their budget goes to building physical data centers to match MSFT footprint. This limits on-demand scalability which ultimately results in latency (not ideal conditions for financial transactions). Management DEFINITELY has favorites, which is not fair to newer employees.

PM managers are busy labeling their subordinates work as their own to get more credit (writing email to ceo without acknowledging those who are doing work) but same people lack depth when technical questions are asked.
There are 2 layers of management and then a functional PM and those are now leaving one by one. Expect more yes men and few doers in future, feel bad for engineering though.

It's toxic and stay away, unless you have godfather who are joining from certain companies (even then introspect and ask yourself if it's worth it)"

The greatness started from the interview process, then using the cutting edge tools and people supporting me to be successful. Competitive pay, amazing platform and vision.","Because they want the best in the industry, the interview process tends to be a bit long and in depth.

2. Always short staffing, too much caseload and they want an engineer to do everything, take care of your bin, your team's bin, and whatnot, they expect us to be superhuman.

3. Get ready to put your Mental Health at the back seat, zero work-life balance, only work work work, and your appraisal and promotion based on your extra hours, not on your talent or expertise.

4. They want you to learn every product in one month and assume that you have taken training, you can do wonders without any assistance

5. No proper training plans or onboarding process, they will put you on the floor without role-based training and you will keep pinging everyone to get even small help.

6. You have to spend an extra 1 and a half hours every day before the shift to get trained as you cannot do anything in your shiftime.

531,Zscaler,Best place I've worked!,2020-12-02,5.0,Senior Technical Account Manager,"Zscaler does a great job of finding the right people. Everyone I work with is really smart, works hard, and is willing to help and collaborate. Egos are checked at the door for sure! The technology is exceptional, and there is a LOT to learn, but the resources you need are available. There are no barriers, you can reach out to anyone top to bottom and you will get what you need. Communication is open, honest, and frequent from the executive team, and employees are valued.","When you're new it can be tough to navigate where to go to perform certain tasks, but like I said, everyone is willing to serve as a guide and help out when you get stuck."
532,Zscaler,A True Industry Visionary,2020-12-01,5.0,Regional Alliances Manager,The leadership team and support ecosystem is the best I've ever been a part of in my career. The leaders truly invest in your growth and provide many tools and resources to help you be successful.,"There's a few manual processes and reporting platforms that can be difficult sometimes to correlate data, but they are steadily working towards a more streamlined way to gather information."

536,Zscaler,Best decision I ever made!,2020-11-30,5.0,Technical Account Manager,"The onboarding process with Zscaler is top-notch. I have worked for companies in the past that focus very little on the on-boarding steps that help with a successful transition; the same cannot be said for Zscaler. The attention that has been given to ensuring that the new staff are well-versed, well-trained and comfortable is outstanding. I love that politics are not a part of the everyday life here at Zscaler; there are no egos, no power struggles, no holier-than-thou mentalities here.

537,Zscaler,My first 90 days at Zscaler,2020-11-30,4.0,Solutions Architect,"Great on-boarding process. Zscaler knows how to bring on new hires and get them up to speed, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. They got me what I needed (laptop, credentials, etc.) a few days before my official start date which let me hit the 1st day running. Team collaboration platforms are great. Team culture is fantastic. People are open to observations from the 'new guy' as well as dumb questions that inevitably get asked from the 'new guy'. I'm really looking forward to my next 90 days and beyond!","Some areas for improvement could be internal documentation management is confusing and fractured - there's a lot of documentation, but it's everywhere and not clear what is definitive and most up to date. The surge in new hires means there are a lot of new people to the sales process and selling the solution without a complete understanding of either the process or the solution. A lot of hands are required to sell, which is confusing. The sales process is well thought out at the high-level, but at the lower levels, needs more work."
538,Zscaler,Good but cheap roots,2020-11-28,4.0,Software Engineer,"Great product and lots of growth.
Alot of work where you can make yourself look good.
Great espp and rsu stock grant refreshers","They do some sneaky stuff with comp packages that should be mentioned before you join.

Rsu’s are only granted 4 times a year so your first vest could be late 3 months.

401k employer match of 2k is dollar for dollar BUT you must be employed on the last day of the year December 31st. No exceptions.

There benefits list makes it sound like the perks are included, what they mean is they offer it with premiums. 

You hear free food once a week? I think they should disclose it as free Indian food once a week. Completely lame if you dont like it."

The addressable market is huge and growing. Security is a must buy, not a nice to have and there is no better place to be than the number 1 ranked Security company.

The third leg of the stool was our ability to sell the product and differentiate against the cheaper or legacy players who competed on price or their ability to bundle within an ELA. With a new Sales leadership team in place , this has been addressed head on and the sales team is becoming word class. 

The company is also changing rapidly. There are so many new roles being created as we rapidly grow meaning there are plenty of opportunities for career progression. Overall, this feels like a great place to learn and develop, the product is great and the future holds a number of exciting developments.

It is still early days for my Zscaler ride but the signs are positive and I am expecting great things from the company in the future.","with rapid change comes a number of challenges. We still need for some systems and processes to catch up with the new reality of Zscaler. This will take some time.

With the platform we have and the recent change in Sales Leadership, it feels as though we are unstoppable. Yes, there has been a lot of change in the last 6 months and there has been a lot of churn, but everyone now is very clear on why change was needed and understands what we have to do. For me personally, learning and starting to practice MEDDIC has been a game changer. 

I have recently been promoted into my role. I hadn’t been seeking promotion, but was offered the role based partly on my success at Zscaler. When I reflected on whether I wanted the role, I saw it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, given the coaching I can leverage from the new leadership.

There has been a lot of organisational change, which was initially unsettling. However, the dust has settled now and we're already a different animal. We've always educated the market well and had a unique and defensible value proposition. Now we've added a world class sales process that helps customers realise the full value of what we offer whilst mitigating our own business risk.  The coaching going on inside the sales organisation is of a very, very high standard. If you want to be the best sales professional you can be, then coming to Zscaler is a step in the right direction.  The new recruits have injected even more energy into what was already a motivated team. They've come here with the knowledge that there is limitless support and patience for those who commit to what we're trying to achieve. The execution and character shown in recent months is unlike anything I've seen before and we're already seeing the output of that.",My original downsides with Zscaler have gone. The professional coaching was much needed. The new Enablement team and sales process has been a reinvigorating addition to the sales org. That was the obvious gap that's now been plugged.
724,Zscaler,A place to grow and become the best professional you can be,2020-02-10,5.0,Regional Sales Manager,"I wanted to challenge some of the recent poor reviews posted by disgruntled ex-colleagues, despite most of them being friends of mine.

Due to the hyper growth we're experiencing, changes are inevitable. Until recently, we had no global sales process or methodology to work towards. Quite remarkable when you consider the growth we've managed to attain.

Our CEO went out to find the right people to take the business to the next stage of our development. This starts by finding the right CRO who can implement valuable change to continue our upwards trajectory. And we hired one of the best in the industry.

Some of the changes include; introduction of value-based selling methodology, MEDDIC framework and rigorous Pipeline Generation initiatives. All of these have brought immediate improvements to how we go to market and the results we are seeing. The disillusionment from previous employees comes from a negative reaction to change. Reps are now expected to own pipeline generation, rather than rely on inbound/marketing. The MEDDIC framework highlights gaps in the sales cycle and holds reps accountable for steps missed. And the value-based sales methodology requires a new way of thinking and communicating our value without relying on personal relationships. If the previous sales team stayed in Zscaler and adopted the new practices, I have no doubt they would be more successful. But not everyone is willing to do what they need to, to be the best version of themselves. That's all what is being asked.

The new KPIs mean that the previous average of less than 2 meetings per week per rep is unacceptable - which seems fair. And each rep needs to book a meeting to a new route of money per week - whether that be cross-sell/upsell/net new logo - with the amount of services and modules we have, this should be achievable.

The leaders truly care about development and the promotion path within the company has greatly improved in recent months.

If you're hungry for success, looking to be the best sales person you can be, make a load of money and have a load of fun - this is the place to be.

With the shift to that new world order, companies need methodical and processes to succeed.  The days of gut feel need to be replaced with analytics and proven workflows.  What the new management have brought in is the rigor and predictability needed to maintain the aggressive ambitions of the company.  We can’t look back at what got us to this point, we need to (like a good software company) innovate.  This innovation is much like the evolution of life, from a child to an adult.  While now being an adult, doesn’t mean you can’t have fun and celebrate success.  In this transition I have seen a very positive step from a singular person winning, to the team celebrating victory!  We have set a goal and with the new team in place we will not just meet our targets, but crush them.

Customers are mostly happy.","I joined the UK team over a year ago as the original management team were excellent, but consequently they all left to be replaced ‘en masse’ by a team of relevantly inexperienced, arrogant, aggressive individuals whose management style is to belittle you instead of encouraging your personal growth.   
As far as I could gather they came in telling the CEO and Leadership team that they could drive revenue up exponentially and quickly.  This hasn’t been the case and their methodology is to bully, humiliate and disregard experienced professionals, driving a culture of fear and intimidation. 
They have successfully ‘managed out*’excellent people, to replace them with cheaper malleable recruits, whom they can manipulate into their ways.
*Managed out – with abusive behaviour, told pretty much you are useless, moved your earning accounts, and opportunities to the new ‘clone’ recruits.

Please search on the most recent and UK negative reviews here for the absolute truth to verify my statement.  They are reviews from colleagues.  

New recruits are very much encouraged to write reviews weeks after starting (with managers standing over them as they write them), as I was (but did not), so you find lovely glowing reviews.

If you are considering a role at Zscaler, then do your due diligence, look on LinkedIn for recent departees and reach out to them for their honest opinions.  Sadly not HR or the talent / recruiting team as their job is to cover the cracks.

If you join under this management team, then it is likely that your accounts and deals will be moved at a whim, to ‘manipulate’ the numbers for HQ, the game is for sales and targeted folk not to earn money.  
Despite reassurances about work/life balances you are expected to work every evening and weekends, so say goodbye to your personal life!  You will be expected to attend the office every Monday to make cold calls under supervision, even if you live in the Outer Hebrides!"

This new management is arrogant, unfriendly, they have a massive superiority complex (that will be their undoing) have no willingness to learn the product and actively tell new recruits NOT to learn the product. They have brought with them a new sales process that is being indoctrinated into the staff in a disturbingly cult-like manner.

An important point is, it doesn't matter whether you are dismissive or even only have reservations about the new sales process - you will not last in Zscaler. It is not hyperbolic to say, either you BELIEVE 100% in the new sales process completely or you are out. 

To be clear, this new asinine management isn't telling granny how to suck eggs, oh-no, they're telling chickens how to lay eggs. And the chickens aren't happy. If a chicken raises an objection, well, you can guess the rest... (Not many chickens would choose KFC as a career choice...)

This has resulted in a mass exodus of existing staff via either resignations or dismissals or demotions. People who have only been with the company less than a year have been treated with appalling contempt and an almost inhuman lack of respect. 

Anyone thinking of joining should seriously think twice before doing so.

767,Zscaler,"4+ years in, still being challenged to get better!",2019-12-06,5.0,Director,"This company continues to grow and continues to invest in getting better.  New leadership is top notch and the focus is on growing revenue and customer bases without sacrificing the culture.  I cannot think of a time in my career where I have been surrounded by people willing to do their own job + more.  Fast paced, reward for risk, and ok with failure as long as you are willing to learn.  Humbled to be leading a team where my directs are often better than I am on the job.  This company has not lost its passion for leading edge tech, taking care of customers, and constantly educating everyone in how to dominate a marketplace.  Right time, right leadership, disruptive tech, and unlimited growth opportunities if you can handle them.","Expectations are high and the pace is frenetic; still run like a start-up.  You must be agile, able to take criticism, and comfortable working within a bit of ambiguity at times.  This company expects you to take an idea or role and run it as if it were your own company.  Not for the weak and the pace does not let up.  If you need to be told what to do, this might not be the place for you."

772,Zscaler,Still Great,2019-12-04,5.0,Senior Director,"Been at Zscaler for 4 years and have not regretted the move.  This is turning out to be one of the top 2 places I've ever worked.  The employees are what make it a fantastic experience. You go home and feel good about not only what you accomplished, but how you accomplished the job.  It's still very much a start-up mentality with little to no politics, just good people focused on doing a great job without a lot of ego. However you want to measure success Zscaler has it - products, revenue, growth, disruptive technology, great place to work certification, and the list goes on.","I've read the negative reviews on here and honestly, I have not had the same experience.  Sometimes makes me wonder if we work at the same company.   Zscaler is what you make of it and certainly isn't for everyone.  The pace is really fast and expectations are incredibly high.  You have to be able to thrive (not just cope) in a founder led environment without a guidebook to tell you what to do all the time.  Most of the cons I've experienced are growth related - having the tools and resources you need can be a challenge."

- people who joined before the IPO got a great pay-out and the company benefits are gradually improving, like 401k matching, sick days.","- technology shifts made Zscaler and will break Zscaler. IPv6, DoH, TLS 1.3+  are all breaking platform functionality and increasing required workarounds
- recently announced features are lame-ducks on delivery - ZDX is to reduce support ticket CASB functionality is feature poor, not competitive
- Zscaler has technically smart people with zero understanding of effective enablement and a sales team which doesn't have any market understanding all the way through to having no basic IT skills
- training and marketing material is focused on creating and delivering a message for delivery by the Zscaler CEO and no one else. Even master decks look like from 2013 and as a mix tape of other decks
-  this is a poor foundation as product expands and new hires are started. Execution erodes while personalities with little output fill the void of those who are fired or move on to something better
- the IPO was successful and many employees lazy waiting for last heavily discounted ESPP payday
- there are few paths for progression in any part of the organization that don't require office politics"

Some fantastic colleagues to work with, which, to some extent, help to deal with the cons...","With a company that promise to Wall Street a 50% growth, the targets and strategy to reach this becomes absurd: Far too many Sales are deployed on a territory resulting in frustration when it comes to target achievement/personal accomplishment.
Some recent recruitment at Manager/Executive level that make me question the sanity of the people who hired them. Culture in the company seems to take the direction of bullying and harassment which was not the case before.
If you plan to make a career here, prepare to please the management and be very political. 
Depending where you'll be based you will be more or less exposed to this.
There's supposed to be a People and Culture team in the company, but except prompting you to post a Glassdoor review on your very 1st month (which explain the high ranking) they really don't do much to help with the bad atmosphere and well being of their employee."

Management has been visionary now for eleven years, and show no sign of slowing down. New products complement old ones, and selling them is straightforward since basically everyone will need them in one form or another over the next five or more years. The competition is scrambling to catch up and are at least two years behind for even the best ones. My colleagues are always willing to go the extra mile, and the environment is as close to family as I want to get in the workplace. I fully expect this will be the place from which I retire in twenty years!","Selling from a technical perspective is straightforward, but it takes a different type of salesperson seemingly as some of them are very successful and others tend to leave more quickly.

893,Zscaler,The Devil Is In The Details - A Sales Perspective on ZS,2019-06-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"You will work with some of the best and brightest technical minds and engineering talent in the industry.  Almost all of them, while absurdly overworked, are always willing to lend a hand and be helpful if it means closing business. I did not work with a single technical resource during my time that left a bad taste in my mouth. 

The technology genuinely works as advertised, and many large companies are taking advantage of the Zscaler cloud today, and will continue to do so. 

There is plenty of positive coverage of ZS now that the company is public. There are use cases and case studies abound, and many extremely credible companies that are willing to be references.

With large opportunities, there is an abundance of internal executive resources willing to help you close business, meet with prospects/customers, and bridge gaps needed for you to be successful.","While all of the above at a macro level rings true, like I said, the devil is in the details:

The company is a logistical nightmare internally. Many are brought on under the guise of a scope of responsibility, and then immediately handed twice that in work/responsibilities. One would intuitively think that calls for additional headcount, but the hiring process is far too long and cumbersome, and because of that, critical roles (new or existing) are left unfilled for months at a time.

Travel is still booked through a travel desk, even for upper management. You are not allowed to make any arrangements yourself without prior approval. Not the biggest deal in the world, but annoying nonetheless.

Training is mediocre at best. Fairly unorganized, goes off topic quickly, and leaves much to be desired in terms of understanding what is needed to successful within the role.

Now, before I get to this next point, I want to call out that many companies put out difficult KPI's to their sales reps, challenging quotas, etc. and sales reps tend to gripe about them regardless.  That said, the KPI's and quotas at Zscaler are not just challenging, they are wildly outlandish. Unless you cover large or major accounts, there is virtually zero chance you will hit your quota.  The overwhelming majority of reps here do not. When I say overwhelming majority, I mean >75%. I implore anyone interviewing for a sales role to ask the question: ""How many of your reps hit their quota last fiscal year?"" Knowing that, you can also deduce that whatever you're given as an OTE potential, you absolutely will not come close to it.

Work-Life Balance? Ha. Non-existent. I can personally attest to know multiple people working 60-70 hours a week, and still sending/receiving e-mails on Saturdays & Sundays. I have personally witnessed these same people get verbally berated for lack of performance.

Senior Management cares about one thing now: the share price. If your activity and sales do not demonstrably impact it in a major way, you are effectively ignored. While not the case for me, I know of others who had ""mentors"" appointed for them that were so busy and stressed trying to handle their own job, that newer hires were left to fend for themselves and figure things out on their own.

Look at the average tenure of a ZS employee. Doesn't that seem alarming to you? It shouldn't shock you that I know of at least a handful of employees who are literally counting the days until their stock fully vests so they can leave.

Overall, I can't say as though I regret my decision to join, or to leave. I learned plenty along the way, and also learned what red flags to look out for when considering a company.  I can unequivocally say I have never been more stressed at a job than I have working this one. Working at ZS is fantastic for you if you have the patience, time, and dedication to put in an insane amount of hours, and can handle being constantly micro-managed. Is it rewarding? Yes, in some cases. If you land in the right patch, or close the right deal. Will you sacrifice more than you think getting there? Absolutely. While not always the case across the board, it's also not by coincidence that many who do well here are single and/or don't have kids. 

For the rest of you, my advice is to look elsewhere."

We don’t have execs or leaders who are above doing something whether it means helping set up tables for an event or taking the extra time to explain something to a more entry level person. There is a strong sense of integrity here and from time to time our company values have gotten challenged, but in the end our leadership proves that we don’t just slap our values up on a website or a PowerPoint, we actually live by them.","Some challenges are that processes aren’t always in place and aren’t always followed if they are in place, however, sometimes that’s the fun in working here - you get to make the process. Teams are open to new ideas and are willing to hear you out. One major con would be that there is a no work from home policy. There can be flexibility if you need to stay home for say something being delivered or someone coming to your house to fix something, but for the most part, teams are discouraged to WFH “just because”.

922,Zscaler,The best professional experience I have had since 2008,2019-04-25,5.0,COE Engineer,"- Focus on the result and not activity: I believe all organizations will sooner or later need to understand the importance of this principle. Not only does this give you the liberty to think out of the box, but it also improves productivity of the team.

- Flexibility to work from home (and to update your role once you realize what you like best): it somewhat chimes in with the first point about reporting being result-based but it's a game-changer for many people like me who'd rather avoid the transport time every day.

- Ultra-sharp vision: a product without a practical use case isn't a useful product. I have learned a lot from the product management team here in this regard.

- Open communication policy: everyone is actively encouraged to reach out to any team for any queries and it works really well with just a little bit of process. 

- Very accessible and innovative management: I have only seen successful adoption of strategic processes since I joined and I have always been able to get a prompt response from management for my queries.

- Passionately curious colleagues: last but not the least, never have I had the opportunity to work with teams that are so invariably eager to learn all the time. I believe this is what makes our teams so cohesive.","Being a healthy critic, I was able to spot some but those disappeared after I reported them to my managers over all these years."

I haven't met a co-worker who isn't willing to take time to share ideas on a project to make it the highest quality possible.,"The commute is a bit long for me, but there are opportunities to work remotely."
926,Zscaler,Lots of learnings and customer interactions,2019-04-23,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"- Managers have similar duties as employees, besides managing the team. This is a big plus in my view as enables to speak the same language when discussing operations

931,Zscaler,Excellent place to work,2019-04-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"I have been working at Zscaler for almost 3 years, as an engineer, in the San Jose headquarters.  Therefore, I can only speak to my experiences regarding the engineering side of the company.

This is an excellent place to work.  The engineering teams are incredibly dedicated and tight-knit.  People here work very hard, but more in the sense of wanting to do a great job and not letting your colleagues down, rather than because your boss is breathing down your neck.

There is an intense focus on doing what you have to do to keep our customers happy.

They treat you as an adult here.  You can have flexibility as far as ""face time hours"" in the office if you need it, but of course you are expected to get your work done regardless and behave responsibly.

This place is not for everyone.  If you're not that dedicated to your job, it's not for you.  If your attitude is ""I work hard from 9am-6pm, but after that I shut it down and make it difficult for anyone to reach me,"" this place is not for you either.

But if you have the passion and the dedication, and enjoy working with like-minded engineers in a (mostly) bureaucracy-free environment, I strongly recommend this company.

Also, it's not all work and no play here.  There are plenty of celebrations and fun events (on-site and off-site), formal and informal gatherings in the break areas, once-a-week free lunches, endless free snacks and drinks, etc.  I think it's the right balance.","I have heard that the pay is just average for the Valley.  But I cannot personally vouch for this, as I'm satisfied with my salary (no idea if I'm average or below-average) and don't know what others make either."
932,Zscaler,Great Company for Challenging Rewarding Work,2019-04-02,5.0,Senior Regional Security Engineer,Zscaler is not afraid to reward hard work that translates into successful outcomes in customer engagements. Excellent sales and technical leadership for transformational network and application access.,On boarding with Zscaler is challenging as the platform has many features that span the complete suite of secure cloud computing. It is easy to get frustrated while learning the platform.

The product roadmap does not have clear timelines,  which impacts customers perception of the company and is hard to manage from a customer-facing role.
You need to find people who have been within Zscaler for a few years to know the ""people to know to get the job done"".

We re small enough to be agile and react fast, and that’s down to the mindset of the people who work here.","With being a new company, who have only just gone IPO, it’s not as mature around some of the processes, but I actually like it.

The best part about the place really is the people - they take great pains to ensure they hire for not only competence but cultural fit as well, and now having helped in that process as well as having been through it, I can see how rigourous they are in applying their standards. The work itself is challenging (and there's plenty of it) but work/life balance is well maintained. Compensation and benefits are comparable with other companies in the geography and vertical, and have even recently improved, at least in the UK. They have, and mean in practise, an open communication policy, and are serious about getting things done for customers to improve and secure their move to the cloud.

The company has a mature view and perspective toward telecommuting and this is a major plus for the workers not located at/near a corporate site.

Leadership is extremely poor and the CEO cannot seem to get out of his own way to allow people to do their job, not to mention trust anyone to create success. Everything is slow to happen here and budget approvals are nearly impossible to get because everything comes down to penny pinching. Pay is low and Zscaler's intention is to low ball everyone as much as possible and deny raises when they are deserved. They also like to hire someone to do one job function or manage one territory then pile on more once they are hired. That person must ""prove themselves"" until the next evaluation period to secure the title or raise they deserved that previous year. They cannot keep good talent and have seen extremely high turnover. Working at this company is like being in an abusive relationship where you are gaslighted,  slapped around and made to feel like you are not worthy.

Company claims a large number of customers but appears that a percentage of those are actually ex-customers having dropped the service, yet are still counted as customers in the marketing slides.
Customers complain of complicated deployments, outtages too often.  As a Cloud-only company the top priority should be stability and UX.
Sales seems to be a dizzying revolving door, mostly from reps leaving vs being let go.  Most companies are intrigued with the solution, but when it comes time to purchase, most find it too risky to move away from existing solution, or deem it a low priority project.
Micro management, daily updates in Salesforce lead to too much time spent on CRM vs selling.  On more than one occasion temporary change in a forecast has led to an immediate call from the manager, even when the change was temporary.

1142,Zscaler,Fun People,2017-01-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Everyone there was very friendly.,I can not think of any.
1143,Zscaler,Reported for fake reviews - here's the truth,2017-01-09,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,"For customers that are able to get it deployed without a ton of issues, the product itself is very solid and robust.  When going through a demo with a customer showing what the solution is capable of, I frequently hear things like “wow!” and “that is awesome!”  Though difficult to deploy (much more on that below) the technology behind Zscaler and the capabilities of the solution is most impressive.","Customer support is terrible, especially during the initial deployment phase, and returns are through the roof high.  When you close a sale, you then have to hand hold the customer and support through the entire deployment process to keep things in line, and then escalate, escalate, and escalate some more when things get out of hand, which happens on almost every deal (not exaggerating).  Many (though far from all) of our deployment technicians are technically capable, but are very difficult to understand, have terrible communication & customer support skills, take forever to respond to inquiries, etc.  I’ve had multiple customers commenting on their deployment experience saying things like “the entire thing has been a sad comedy of errors” and “it’s getting silly, to put it nicely”.  The return rate is the highest I’ve ever seen at a company.  After you close a sale you’re then sitting on pins and needles hoping it doesn’t come back.  This isn’t so much a knock on our deployment team as it is a commentary on the refusal of leadership (specifically Jay) to adequately staff and train the reps.  Multiple requests have been made that would help resolve this issue which Jay has shot down.  

As if the massive returns were not enough, even if everything we sold stayed sold, the team would still be well below 50% of their number due to a combination of a refusal to invest in marketing and an insistence on setting wildly outlandish quotas.  Executive leadership expressed to Jay, with data supporting their case, what quotas should set at.  Jay stubbornly refused and insisted on quotas that were more than double what was proposed.  On a team of more than a dozen tenured seasoned sales professionals, not one made it even halfway to the number this past fiscal year.  (Again, not exaggerating.) 

These returns have had a very negative impact on our relationship with channel partners.  Word has gotten around at CDW & SHI not to waste time selling Zscaler as there’s a good chance it’ll be returned and you’ll have a customer satisfaction issue on your hands.  There are some things going on at a high level to grow these partnerships, but at the ground level where the rubber hits the road, it’s ugly.

Another true story regarding returns: It has happened more than once where a rep would close a deal, then leave Zscaler or move to another role, and then when the deal got returned, the rep that was then covering the territory when the return came took a hit.  They never got paid for the initial sale, yet got dinged when the return came.  That is not right, yet it has happened more than once.  Add this to the list of other shady & unethical things others have reported in their reviews.

If you happen to work in sales for Zscaler, be very sure to keep track of what you earn and triple check your paychecks.  More than once a reps commission check was wrong.  We would have to call out the error, fight to get it corrected, then they acted like everything was fine all along.

One shining light in all the deployment issues was the director of deployment, who was phenomenal to work with and did the best he could with what little funding and resources he was allotted.  He recently left the company, and I can’t say I blame him.  At least when things went south with a deployment, which they often did, we could count on him.  Not any more.  

He’s far from the first director/executive to leave.  The turnover rate at the executive level is unbelievably high.  The CFO that was supposed to help the company go public recently left.  Several area directors have left.  There’s been a high turnover rate with SE managers, CMOs, VP of sales, VP of sales ops, etc.  So many executives leaving is clearly a telling sign.  Why are they leaving?  The word from many of them has been that Jay is an extremely difficult CEO to work for.  He micromanages everything, sets ridiculous expectations, does not empower you to do what you need to do to be successful and meet said expectations, and is stubborn and arrogant beyond belief.   It’s funny - the “Z” in “Zscaler” stands for “Zenith”.  We’re the “zenith of scalability” and when it comes to web security, we offer a level of scalability that others don’t and can’t.  It’s amazing how Jay can understand the importance of scalability in that sense and yet not understand how his micromanagement style is preventing his company from scaling the way it should.

This mass exodus of executive leadership is not a new thing.  Though I believe the recent/current round is likely the worst the company has seen, it has been the modus operandi to have a major shake-up every couple years.  As some have put it “At Zscaler I’m never at a startup - I’m always at a re-startup.”  Jay burns through one round of leaders and then rather than learn anything just replaces them with another set until he burns through them the same way.  

I’ve noticed a trend here on Glassdoor where after an honest detailed negative review is given, a very generic positive review quickly follows.  It seems that something dishonest is going on here to prevent future candidates from seeing the truth about the organization they are considering joining.  For example, sort the reviews by date and notice how two detailed reviews titled “""This a promising company with significant problems on multiple levels"" and “""Difficult place to work"" were quickly followed by the very generic ""Proud to Be at Zscaler"" and ""Happy at Zscaler"".  If that’s not enough, notice the reviews on December 14, 2016.  Roughly a dozen five-star reviews on the same day?!?!?  Clearly dishonestly and unethically gaming the system, and reported to Glassdoor for such.  

As an interesting aside, whoever it was on the Austin team that wrote “""Proud to Be at Zscaler"" is either no longer around or on their way out as they are shutting the Austin office down per Jay’s refusal to invest in mid-market.  The aforementioned former CFO told him that he wants this thing to take off and go public, he has got to invest in mid-market.  The former CTO he hired from GE said on a webcast in front of the whole company that mid-market was the biggest area of opportunity for growth.  Many other leaders in the organization, and throughout the industry, have stated the same thing.  Their response?  Refuse to invest in mid-market and kick that team to the curb.  

If you click on “rating trends” above, you’ll notice things peaked around May/June of 2015 and have been on a steady decline ever since.  This can be attributed to several things, but here’s what I see as driving the rating trends: Leading up to and including the May/June 2015 timeframe, there was a lot of excitement.  A new global VP of sales had recently joined.  A new CFO that was going to help us go public.  A solid CMO that was literally smashing our appliance based competition.  A phenomenal sales director was building out the mid-market team to help the company get a steady stream of smaller deals to get to the predictable/repeatable/sustainable place shareholders want to see.  There was a feeling throughout the organization like “this rocket is about to really take off!”  Then everyone gradually started seeing that it was all for naught as Jay stubbornly refused to take any advice from the new leaders he had hired and would not enable them to do what he hired them to do.  It was all downhill from there.  

When it comes to tech companies, Zscaler will go down as one of the greatest blown opportunities by a founder/CEO in history - an exact “what should’ve been but never was” scenario.  He literally had everything he needed to fulfill the vision and then some.  All he had to do was get out of the way.   The right product, at the right place, at the right time, with the wrong leader.  The blockbuster IPO that was touted for so long was not a pipe dream or empty words.  It truly could’ve and should’ve been that way.  

What I have expressed in this review is far from my own isolated opinion.  Most everything I’ve said is right in line with the general consensus of many if not most Zscaler employees.  Anyone who paints a different picture is most likely either being deceptive or is still drinking the kool aid.  Don’t buy it.

Everything I’ve said here has been said internally a thousand times."
1144,Zscaler,Sales,2016-12-24,1.0,Regional Sales Manager,"Good Proxy Product, ABA, DLP are more Marketing hype. In comparison to market leaders lack of innovation.","Be aware, some of the positive reviews are pushed by management. So, to give you real overview about the ""culture"", I will tell you a real story. I was once in a panel interview with my line Manager and his Boss as well as some other people (Channel, SE). After the panel interview we all were supposed to give a rating of a candidate. I was giving a top recommendation, and my line Manager as well, but then, my Managers Boss gave a ""No recommendation"", and when my Line Manager saw this, he immediately changed his rating to ""No recommendation"", only to be in line with his boss. And thats a perfect example about the ""culture"" there. If you always agree with your boss, you always laugh at his jokes, you never think on your own, then you will be doing good. If on other hand you are a performer who thinks, you will be punished.

-Mktg/comms: If you are thinking of working at Zscaler in either of these teams, run. Each CMO has about a 2 year stint and is then replaced, and this has been consistent for the past several years. Current CMO micromanages people to make them feel inferior and like they are entry level employees, rather than individuals that are seasoned in this industry. CMO is more interested in keeping tabs on when you are coming/leaving/taking lunch/ working remote than your quality work and what you are getting accomplished. The current CMO has created an environment where it is impossible to please him, and the company has lost a lot of great talent because of him.

For anyone in the sales and marketing orgs, beware that there is high turnover with the CMO and CRO roles turning over every 2 years or less with their high-performing staff soon following (and leaving the employees who can't get jobs elsewhere).  Even the CFO has left recently putting into question the IPO timeline they have been continually touting.  

Even with a great technology, the company gets in its own way in terms of executing well to capture market demand.  The company started a team to go after the mid-market, for example, and it should have been a market they could have won but recently they dismissed the whole sales team and it's clear they will re-group and only serve the large enterprise.

Finally, Jay is an accomplished serial entrepreneur but is a micromanager.

1191,Zscaler,Happy at Zsclaer,2016-04-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'd say Zscaler is a 4+ star company with solid potential to be a 5 star company.  

It's a late stage pre-ipo company with the typical pros and cons that go along with that.  If you like that type of environment you'll love it here.  Know that it's not a like a Google or Facebook that spend enormous amounts of money on free everything everywhere. But it's also not an uncaring environment that takes advantage of its employees.  I'd say its a good balance that is run smartly.

Yes there is free food, snacks and drinks.  They bring in lunch for everyone on Thursdays and celebrate milestones with happy hour type celebrations. But that's not what makes it 4 stars - What makes it cool is people actually stay and hang out together.  They don't just grab food and go back to their desk. You can see that people are friends and like to spend time with each other. 

The network security market is the place to be and the cloud approach is clearly ahead of the game.  There is no question that in 5 to 10 years' time cloud based security will be the primary approach to network security.  It's a good feeling to be at a company with products that are ahead of the game.","Again, its the typical late stage pre-ipo stuff like lack of tools or people to get things done as quickly as you'd like.  If you are used to that you know how to deal with it.

Core benefits are competitive but having some of the fringe stuff would push the rating higher - more generous time off policy, lower out of pocket expenses, education reimbursement, etc.  I suspect more will come as the company grows."
1192,Zscaler,Difficult place to work,2016-04-15,1.0,Sales,"The cloud-based product is unique and has a chance to make a significant mark in the security field.
Many wonderful, talented people working here.","Others have said it before. This is Jay's company and he is not the person to lead it into the future. He has a small group of trusted insiders and many of them are in that circle because of their ability to pull Jay's strings. Many people are frustrated, not only by the lack of what seems to be an IPO that is constantly pushed further and further in to the future but because of the seemingly constant need to navigate the political waters of Zscaler.

Zscaler may still succeed because they've built something unique. However, making money is not the only measure of a company's success. Jay doesn't balance culture with the other aspects of running  a company. Unfortunate."
1193,Zscaler,This a promising company with significant problems on multiple levels,2016-04-12,2.0,Sales,"- Without a doubt, Zscaler's core technology is superior to nearly everyone we're competing against, particularly when you compare the Zscaler Cloud against more traditional appliance-based solutions. If my review were based on the tech alone, it would easily be 4+ stars

- Product Management and Development team is really responsive, both to internal suggestions and to customer feature requests. Numerous significant feature enhancements have grown rapidly from feedback from real customers, which is awesome to see at a company growing this quickly

- Internal communication from product management / product development teams is typically really good - those groups are staffed by really strong engineers who are doing fantastic work on a rapid refresh-cycle

- Product pipeline is very strong, with service enhancements and new SKU's coming at a steady clip, and all in response to actual customer demand 

- Partnerships with resellers like CDW, SHI, etc. are growing rapidly

- New Headquarters building is great, and a significant improvement over the old location","- The entire Sales organization is imploding, and senior management are apparently unwilling or unable to do anything about it. Quality people are leaving at a steady pace and either being replaced by lower-level talent or (in many cases) not replaced at all

- Overall communications from upper management tends to be awful. Sales org employees *never* know where things stand, and typically have to turn to the rumor mill to get a sense of what's going on. Zscaler has a serious cultural problem with poor internal communications (other than from engineering / PM teams as noted above), leading to seriously poor morale and high staff turnover

- Current Sales Org leadership has adopted a severely antagonistic stance toward their employees, announcing brutal changes that severely reduce the potential earnings of commissioned salespeople, and concluding the announcements with, ""...and if you don't like these changes, you know where the door is, please show yourselves out.""

- Sales management have repeatedly set sales quotas wildly out of sync with pipeline, resulting in sales teams missing their quarterly quotas by 50, 60, even 70%, with no quota relief. All concerns about quotas are treated as a personal failing of the employee, rather than a systemic failure of management

- Marketing efforts have been highly ineffective. Executive team took nearly a year to hire a new Chief Marketing Officer after the previous person left

- Exiting managers after share the same advice with trusted subordinates: ""avoid taking any sort of middle-management role at Zscaler - you will be micromanaged to death from the CEO down, given no room to grow or develop your team, and then pushed out for failing to hit wildly unrealistic goals""

- Stock options are extremely skimpy - if you are granted any stock when you are hired, you'll never see another share however long you stay

- ""Benefits package"" is painfully bare-bones - if you're hired here, expect significant and recurring out-of-pocket medical expenses, no retirement funds matching whatsoever, etc. I've seen fast food jobs with cushier benefit packages

- HR team is highly ineffective. Expect no support, encouragement or guidance from them

- Many of the ""5 star"" reviews you'll read here on GlassDoor are specifically requested by Zscaler management, and many of them incorporate specifically-selected language from internal-only training presentations and videos. Zscaler management are very aware of their coveted ""Unicorn"" status and actively encourage employees to leave glowing reviews. I don't care *who* you work for - if you can't think of a single specific ""con"" to share about your complex and struggling late-stage startup, your review is worthless

- Look through the history of Zscaler reviews posted here, and you'll notice several which prompted responses from Zscaler executives. Example: note that the criticism that one reviewer shared of the Sales organization was met with assurances by a high-ranking officer that states, ""... our VP of North American sales is a superstar and has been at the firm since the beginning of 2014. We are bringing large numbers of great new salespeople into the company - and we expect to keep them for the long haul."" In the time since that reply by the executive was posted, the person he was referring to was fired (or was pushed out), the executive who posted that reply was fired (or was pushed out), and numerous other salespeople and middle-managers were fired or quit. Not exactly reassuring"
1194,Zscaler,"Great product, smart employees, poor compensation package, ethically questionable",2016-04-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Innovative product which competitors can only hope to mimic through workarounds and shortcuts. Competitors might match on basic features but not performance, feature richness, ability to scale, or reliability.
- Strongest product management and engineering team I've worked with - forward moving, communicative, with a clear direction.
- The hiring process on the whole works and there are a lot of experienced employees who can execute on the vision.","- Miserly stock options with no ability to gain more through service/rewards/recognition. If you weren't at Zscaler prior to 2011 you are outside the circle.
- India based support, while technically competent, provides a poor experience. Larger customers are pushed to premium support to offset this while smaller customers complain constantly.
- Executive micro-management breeds contempt and inability to function. Replacement CMO took nearly a year to hire while the pipeline became bone dry. Upper management communicates unreliably and the rumor mill is often weeks or months ahead of any significant announcements.
- Poor compensation package - no 401k matching, cheapest healthcare plan available (expect to significantly pay out of pocket). Stock options don't make up for this disparity.
- IPO has been carrot on a string for too long - start opening up that this isn't happening until late 2017 at the earliest."

There are a few very smart directors and vice presidents that have learned to navigate the minefield of Zscaler politics.,"Horrible culture, driven by politics and back-biting. Petulant CEO has no respect for anyone and serves as a huge bottle neck (supreme micro-manager; won't approve projects; won't approve expenses; schedules impromptu meetings at 5:30pm or on Saturdays).

Good product, 
Good vision, 
Good manipulations to let the employees work with them specially in Chandigarh branch. 
Good packages.","Management keep grudges with their employees if they leave the company. Telling management that this is wrong means you and your job is in danger, and if you leave the job with all the required formalities still the Management will suck your blood to the core. This is not a company where an experienced person can work as they do not have growth options, they do not have any positions where they can let their old employees get motivation and bring the zeal back to work with dedication. Working in zscaler is like, being a slave. They do not have proper induction by the HR, no training method, nothing. Still if someones wants to join then they suffer the same on real time basis."

1212,Zscaler,Exciting place to be...,2015-07-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is a great vibe and buzz to working at Zscaler. The company is growing rapidly and the cloud technology is on the cusp of wide market adoption, all this creates a can do culture where almost anything seems possible. Its what salesforce.com must have been like 8 odd year's ago, it feels like a special place to be.","With the growth there comes some growing pains.

And at the end of the rainbow is a blockbuster IPO coming down the pike. This is definitely a place I would recommend and recruit my friends and colleagues to.","The environment is a bit chaotic at times due to high growth, and sometimes people from bigger, more sedentary companies will struggle with this. The company is located in a well-worn building on the Alviso side of 237, and the place is getting so crowded that its impossible to book a conference room during the middle of the day."
1214,Zscaler,About to have a massive IPO,2015-07-24,5.0,Business Development,"I've been at Zscaler about four months.  Almost everything is better than expected. Great technology, strong marketing, big partner opportunity, huge growth in sales, smart committed employees.  The company feels like salesforce must have been about 10 years ago - you can just feel the security industry about to flip over to the cloud.",The building is horrible - but the good news is we are moving in October.
1215,Zscaler,Ask for proof!,2015-07-23,2.0,,Good central location.  That's about it.,Nothing this company tells you can be trusted.  They have been saying IPO since 2013.  Look up the Bloomberg article with Ceo on that.  Hiring so many sales people but shrinking territories.  Direct sales are not happening.  Marketing is terrible.  PM team is failrly weak.  Total unfocused path.  These guys bought Gartner and Forrester (and flat out lied at times to them).  Stock options are an illusion.  Look up what CEO has done in the past with his older companies.  Best COO Lane Bess left - why is that if they are going IPO soon?!  And ask about the 'board' .  CEO and his family control most of the shares.  Bess left and has a seat.  So no really oversight.  The CMO worked at a company that got shutdown and he got booted from Google.  Otherwise no security experience there.  CFO claim to fame was raising money in her last company.  Hmmm I wonder what she is being tasked to here?  Ops team and custome support are pretty bad.  They fired so many people - they just 'disappear' like they were in old school Russia!  And titular micro management culture .  Oh and unless you are hot and under 30 don't bother working in marketing.  Consider sales instead.
1216,Zscaler,Who said Path to IPO is easy?,2015-07-18,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Good vision, right space - Some great products in stealth mode yet to come.
- Mindset of being frugal - Spend company money like your own $
- Not a pump/dump story - Mantra that company would only blow trumpet after 10 paid satisfied BIG customers

-Decent equity - People who complain do not know the full picture about how equity works
with preferred vs non-preferred stocks. I hope they understand how risk reward ratio works in
startups - This is no longer a typical startup, but one who will file S1 in the next 12-16 months.","-Sometime too frugal when it comes to items like free food, fruits -One can spend some extra money on quality food and better fruits.

1226,Zscaler,Game changing solution,2015-06-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The element everyone talks about in ZScaler is how the solution is a game changer.  Sure, it works which is what you'd expect, but more than that it represents a solution at the perfect time in the market as this is exactly what customers want.

Customers are buying in a big way and the channel / alliances team have recently been hit by a wave of organisations telling us this is exactly what they want.  This means we anticipate huge growth on top of already big, existing growth numbers.

The existing customer base is blue chip which means we extremely strong case studies already to present to customers needing this type of tech.  On top of these, 'real' competitors do not really exist as their cloud-based solutions are nowhere near as evolved at ours.  We anticipate having 'real' competitors in 3 years time but at the moment, we have first mover advantage in a market that has an urgent, pressing need for the only genuine cloud-based solution within our space.

Our CEO is also significant because he has done this already.  His last four startups were in the security space and every one was successful which shows as we are profitable, have almost no external investment and are tremendously successful.

Just wish I'd thought of it first!",We are at an early stage of development.  We are not a start up but have not been established long which means we need more people (sales etc...) to cover the market where there is a significant need for our solution.
1227,Zscaler,Great technology squandered.,2015-06-18,2.0,Sales Development Representative,"The technology is excellent. The platform continues to grow in sophistication, functionality and stability. If an organisation is embracing the cloud, they need to consider Zscaler when choosing a Secure Web Gateway.","Attitude towards employees is awful. The company penny-pinches at every opportunity, pays below market rate and treats all non-technical staff as an unwelcome expense. The lack of spending across the board has stifled the growth of the company. 7 odd years after the company started, the vast majority of prospects have still never heard of Zscaler. Marketing department is the least effective I've ever encountered in a US tech company but that is probably because it hasn't had the funds or the direction to work properly.

Company events and happy hours are a great way to keep that work-life balance.,The location of the office isn't the best.  It's a small company so you can't fly under the radar. Be prepared to work and make a difference.
1247,Zscaler,Great company for sharp and ambitious people.,2014-09-28,5.0,Senior Manager,"While most of the companies are trying to force-fit their old appliance technology for cloud & mobility, Zscaler has developed purpose-built multi-tenant, distributed cloud security. Great place to learn and be a part of a company that is well on its way to dominate security market. Good for sales people who know how to do enterprise level selling.","If you simply want a job, it is not a good fit."
1248,Zscaler,Fabulous - amazing and exciting,2014-09-28,5.0,,"We just had a presentation for the whole company from Morgan Stanley about how Zscaler is going to be one of the biggest software IPOs next year.  It's very exciting.  The company has a huge lead from a technology platform and vision perspective and the competition is very weak.  Sales turnover, which some of the posts here talk about - is a thing of the past now - the head of sales has been with the company for four years, the heads of EMEA and channels have three or more years of tenure - where there was turnover was in North America sales, but that is now fixed - our head of Americas has been with us a year now and he is a total stud.  And we just hired a new head of sales ops away from VM Ware.","This is an Internet security infrastructure company - it might not sound as cool to your friends as the next Snapchat. 
If you are looking for a startup - this is not it - we are about to be 600 people - so this is a fast growing, already profitable mid-sized SaaS company on the way to an IPO."
1249,Zscaler,Career blunder,2014-09-08,1.0,Territory Manager,I was able to learn about how the COMPETITION exceeds industry knowledge and vision.,"Revolving leadership (new VP sales each year), revolving employees (sales and SE's) and executives.  No real security knowledge nor respect towards partners.  

They are trying to increase addressable market with solutions instead of investing in current solutions and internal talent.  

Comp plan is the worst in the industry while leadership takes deals to be paid as reps."

1252,Zscaler,Product Manager,2014-07-14,5.0,Product Manager,"Typical startups have  a focused niche product that they are trying to solve.  Zscaler on the other hand is a platform offering many components in the DMZ (Security, Proxy, DNS, DLP ...)  as a distributed cloud. That means sky is the limit on where the company can go with product offerings. Great to be in PM here.
The customer base already has the biggest gold plated brands around the world.  ALL their Internet access goes through Zscaler. That makes it easy to introduce them to additional capabilities to be bought from Zscaler as well. They simply say sure.. and a subscription is turned on. I came from a large appliance company, where shipping new appliances for each new functionality (or more boxes because new functions slow it down) was a big hinderance to introducing new products and getting sales acceptance.","There's so much to do there's never enough time.

1256,Zscaler,"Late stage pre-IPO company that has managed to still keep the innovation, fun and excitement of a startup",2014-06-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,For a late-stage company with hundreds of employees the company still feels very flat (in a positive way). The entire exec team is very accessible. The CEO and Founder talks to everyone every day and never rejects a meeting. The company is not afraid to invest in smart ideas and people to keep their market lead. Truly game changing technology with a surprising amount of global/large enterprise adoption!,Find ways to keep the passion and devotion while keeping a reasonable work/life balance.

1263,Zscaler,Fun place to work!,2013-07-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Zscaler is booming, but has kept its start-up style. 

The most important thing for me, when choosing a company to work at is work/life balance and culture. Even the biggest salary won't make me move to a company where culture is horrible, and people miserable. Zscaler has met my ""human"" expectations:

- Here is one thing that surprised me when I joined Zscaler: Everyone is in a cube, even upper management. No privileges based on title, no casts. It makes the place more relax and upper management easy to approach.

- I consider myself very lucky to be able to work with very bright people like our CEO or our COO, who have accomplished grand projects throughout their career. I learn a lot from them. If it was in a bigger company, I would just have been a number and the CEO would not have even know who I am.

- By working at Zscaler, you can really make a difference. I know that my hard work is recognized and there won't be anyone who will try to take credit for my job.

- It is a fast paced environment, as you can expect in Start-ups. You can't hide behind your desk, like in bigger groups and get away with not doing your work. It's either you like this kind of challenges or not. I am getting better at what I do and capitalizing for a bright career.

- Very good and smart people work at Zscaler. There is a positive attitude. We have lots of informal fun events like wine tastings and baking contests or outside drinks. Co workers are friendly, there is less politics than in any other company I worked at.

- We can tell of good environment to work by very little details. Here is one: Like in any companies in the Bay Area, our kitchen is full of snacks and sodas, that employees can take for free. I am not a big fan of sodas and prefer sparkling water. I shared this with the person in charge of supplying beverages and the day after we got sparkling water for everyone to enjoy in the company. I know it's anecdotal, but to me, it tells that people care.

- Company has a lot of potential, product is innovative and technology is disruptive. I have no doubt that Zscaler will do very well.","The company start-up mentality. It can be good or it can be bad, based on how you look at it.

- You can work at a big organization and get away by doing minimal work. This is not the case at Zscaler, your work is very visible. It can be seen as a negative point for some people.

- Not everybody can work in start-up mode companies: close to zero politics, and people awarded based on hard work only."
1264,Zscaler,Once in a Lifetime Opportunity,2013-07-02,5.0,,"Zscaler offers ambitious, creative individuals the opportunity to be part of history in driving the company's disruptive direct-to-cloud network to overtake the stale, appliance-based model that dominates today's enterprise security space.  In just 5 years, Zscaler has achieved a $1B+ evaluation, leader status in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Secure Web Gateways, an enviable Fortune 500 customer base and a patent portfolio that will keep it in the innovation driver's seat for years to come.  At Zscaler you are given the resources and the opportunity that any self-starter would kill for.  Work hard, contribute to the culture and enjoy the ride.  This company will IPO in less than 18-24 months and since there is very little dilution, employee stakeholders won't get screwed post IPO like they do at so many other companies.",Senior management has a low threshold for incompetence.  Don't come to work here unless you want to kick ass and be the best at what you do.  Low-achievers and slackers need not apply.

+ mgmt that listens and acts .. can tell certainly for engineering

+ work-life balance is possible- this might not be a case 2-3 yrs ago when company was a budding starup, but now I do see many who are leading good balance, of course there are others in the other camp but lot of times it depends upon once's priorities and passion.
+ capable of change- i have seen company changing during my tenure (of < 3yrs) with more focus given to employee recognition, benefits, proper hr etc.","- a startup in rapid growth phase, many challenges yet to solve, depending upon your perspective this can be an opportunity

*  Very smart & incredibly hardworking people
* Amazing Product & Innovation
* Atmosphere of dedication 
* Very approachable upper management (CEO)
*  Place to be if you are straightforward, self-motivated & love technology
* Your ping-pong skills will improve 

Unlike larger companies where a lot of people end up taking credit for your hard work, Zscaler is very meritocratic. The CEO and Management are very clued-in on who's doing what and it is easy to shine here if you do good work. You will work with a very smart and driven group of people who share a common passion in making cloud security a reality. There is more emphasis on communication (monthly-all hands) and Thursday lunches are catered in to meet with folks.","When you are the first one in the space, the burden falls on you to validate all aspects of the technology and make it work. The team here continues to work through these challenges and you will need a optimistic can-do attitude to succeed here. If you are used to having efficient processes and procedures and a very structured approach to work, you may find yourself at sea. 

However, on the bright side, you can define these procedures. Likewise, do not let things fester and feel free to scream out to your manager as people here are very busy and may not have time for the mollycoddling and regular 1:1 available in larger companies."
