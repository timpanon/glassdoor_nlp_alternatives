3) You can look forward to consistent raises and promotions... a year or two after you make yourself deserving of them
4) The company gives everyone year-round ""recharge days""... taken out of your regular vacation time

The same only reward and promote their favorites, a tough drinking tough playing set of white men with limited time in role, lower ratings and high attrition.

19,AMD,"Company on the rise, and bringing employees with it",2022-01-10,5.0,Senior Test Engineer,"Started as a contractor, good base pay but with no benefits that aren't legally required (unlike past companies where the benefits were similar but with poor base pay as well). With the current hiring model my team uses means anyone they want to keep often becomes permanent within 2 years of contracting.

I'm now permanent, great usual corporate benefits, far higher than average pay for QA (again based on past experience with other companies), and I'm enjoying the work environment.

Despite my job requiring at least some hands-on work with hardware, my team found a way for us to minimize our exposure to each other during the pandemic. We all work for home, except for one person who handles hardware changes. We rotate that responsibility daily. 

Work is flexible, getting time off is a matter of informing rather than requesting, and taking that time is highly encouraged. Very easy to set boundaries between work and home life if you have the desire to do so.

Company is growing fast, hiring and promoting often. Lots of room to make a mark and maybe even create a new role for yourself if you see something they organization is missing that you can provide. Lots of opportunities to provide your input, be heard, and make an impact that you can see and be rewarded for.","Workload can be a lot, and deadlines can be tight, leading to crunch time. These crunch times range from 1 week to a few months (not common, just a rough transition into a new project). The company will ask for long hours and weekends, and it's up to you say no if you aren't comfortable with it or just burned out. I've found they're very respectful of their employee's declining overtime. and they don't really pry for personal reasons.

The rapid growth of the company comes with the downside that we are gaining new business faster than we can build your infrastructure (new-hires, new teams, scaling up etc...). Can kind of feel like you're working in a start-up that just made it big, even though your in a large and established corporation. They are working on resolving this problem though."

The number of hours is one thing, but more importantly, this policy reflects the caring culture of the company about the well being of its employees. 3 to 5 days are simply inadequate to plan and carry the memorial service and funeral; and grief recovery will take much longer time.",Not much to say here; AMD company culture is great.

81,AMD,"Good Money, Toxic Culture",2021-10-13,2.0,Director,"The compensation is very compelling which for many, is sufficient to justify the trade offs in work/life balance, high stress and toxic executives. Benefits, likewise are good. 

There are many good, smart, driven colleagues that do excellent work, deliver results and raise the bar for everyone. The cultural diversity is a also positive at AMD. 

The CEO is whip-smart and is getting proven results which are evident in its surging stock price.","The group in which I worked was led by a highly toxic Senior VP who managed by fear. This individual was a bully pure and simple. They made unreasonable demands, frequently delivered public reprimands, and cared little about their team’s personal lives or work/life balance. That fear-based management style trickled down to the levels below. If something wasn’t going well in the executive ranks, you could be sure that everyone felt the pain to some degree. 

Because these executives often achieve the desired results, I believe a blind eye is turned to the methods by which results were achieved. 

I’ll be honest, there’s a lot to admire about Lisa Su but the fear-based culture starts with her. She commonly operates in this way with other executives. 

These are is THE reasons I left. I wish I didn’t have to but my personal life and mental health were suffering. Many people in the same boat however couldn’t seem to take that step because the next paycheck or bonus is so attractive, and explains why tenure is often quite long."

307,AMD,"Earn Your Stripe, Join a Company Re-Defining Itself",2014-06-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love AMD and I worked in Corporate Marketing. 

Yes, AMD's salaries are extremely competitive. Work/life balance is yours to own as long as you deliver. However, the real selling factor is the people: Colette LaForce is easily the most personable CMO I've had the pleasure of working for in my career. She is open to new ideas, critical feedback and in turn her leadership mostly mirrors these traits. The marketing team at AMD across the board is full of great leaders who are passionate and intelligent.

The organization I worked in is full of  go getters who work hard but, in my opinion, are ultimately under appreciated because of AMD's historical engineering and sales focus.","As the company is mid-turn around, there is some natural confusion and oftentimes bureaucracy. This is a symptom of frequent reorgs and historical cultural traditions. This has unfortunately resulted in sub-optimal, siloed processes and an unwillingness to accept change. 

Enablement is a real issue at AMD as profitability goals have caused opex pressure, resulting in limited resources."
