Most satisfying ,   most difficult and most  rewarding job ever.",2014-08-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"We work with geniuses - in every department,   We create innovative products that thrill our customers and create new product categories -  who else can say that?","ZERO   ZERO   ZERO   work/life balance.   Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better.  But in actuality,  it gets worse every year!  It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it,  they could fix it tomorrow.   They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank.   If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance,  they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that issue dissolve.   Sick of hearing the lies.   Just don't lie about wanting to fix it,  when they clearly DON'T care"
3,Apple,At-Home-Advisor,2015-05-13,5.0,Apple At Home Advisor,"The position is at home. The company is AMAZING. There are limitless advancement opportunities. You work with some very cool people and the leadership cares about your development. You may get coaching but you never get battered or belittled. The pay is decent and the benefits include, 401(k) match, stock purchase options, product discounts and discounts on services across many different areas, education assistance, child care assistance, paid vacation, sick time and other time off options, health club Reimbursment or bike cost set off. You get 1.5 time for OT and it's pretty much unlimited as long as you don't exceed 12 hours in a day or 59 total in a week.",The schedule changes every 90 days and you have to bid for your shifts so you never know what you are going to get. This makes it extremely hard to plan your life to far in advance. You are also pretty much assured to work a Saturday or Sunday.
4,Apple,Changing the world (in a small way),2016-01-22,5.0,Software Engineer IV,"Working at Apple means that the things you work on get into the hands of hundreds of millions of people, literally. It's a lot of pressure to get things right and drives one to do the best work of their lives. 2+ years later I'm still blown away by the talent and creativity of people I work with.","It's a lot of work, teams are usually strapped for resources and under pressure to deliver on strict timelines leading to high stress and long hours at certain times during the year."
5,Apple,A Company as Meticulous as Their Products!,2017-03-10,5.0,Specialist,"Competitive Pay, Great Benefits, Amazing People, Great Work, Awesome Opportunities, Excellent Experiences, Great atmospheres in a beautiful store, no matter where you're working!",None! I had one of the best times ever at this company. Hopefully I stay to go on to corporate!
6,Apple,Great Company,2022-03-27,5.0,Technical Specialist,"Great Benefits, environment that nurtures growth and self development, above average pay, great discounts.","Lots of politics if attempting to promote within the retail environment. Day to day you are encouraged to keep learning growing and make mistakes. But those mistakes will be remembered and more than likely used when evaluating your suitability for promotion. When promotion time comes they not only want someone who can do the job but someone who either has no reputation ,as in new and unknown, or gets along with everyone and is a favorite of all (yes literally all the managers) one wrong move in your time there could be impossible to overcome. This is not just my experience but that of coworkers who received the brush off for promotions.
And by the way if you work part time expect to do “self development” to keep up with trends another 20 hours a week if you want to keep up with everyone else , if you work full time expect to work and extra 15-20 hours on “self development” to keep up and meet expectations. Unless you do this and then some can you expect to even have a chance at a promotion in the retail environment. Your level of conformity will dictate your success."
7,Apple,Assistant manager and store manager made me hate working for apple ever again…,2022-03-21,2.0,Product Specialist,"I had a great work-life balance, you get benefits as a full or part timer, pay is great, they offer snacks/food & you get frequent breaks to take a moment to yourself","The store manager of the Atlanta, GA stores created something called a ‘scorecard’ which made working at Lenox mall Apple VERY difficult. It was a very competitive field, even if it didn’t seem like it. There were a lot of associates giving back handed compliments, cherry picking customer sales, and even doing sexual favors to stay high on the score card. A LOT of associates were unhappy with how things were being done and all they did was stress about this scorecard, even outside of work. Associates felt like they couldn’t give feedback on how they were being treated because at any moment you could be pulled aside and told ‘your not doing too well on the scorecard’ and suddenly higher ups are keeping a more watchful eye on you than they should. When dealing with sale issues, They try to make it seem like they’re on your side when you need help with something and you should of “gone to them sooner”, yet you went to several leads/experts before with issues and yet they still look at you like you don’t know what you’re doing somehow? They barely know their associates when they think they do"
8,Apple,"Seems great from the outside, no work life balance",2022-03-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- 25% discount on 1 of each Apple product once a year
- Discounts on all things Apple, cables, cases, Apple Music, iCloud store
- looks good on resume","- the schedule here is HORRIBLE, the main reason I quit, schedules are never locked down, and they mostly use part time employees to cover the hour long breaks of the full time employees, so in my case they had me come in 5 random days a week, for 5 hour shifts, I argued with them for months to go down to 4 shifts per week just longer hours and they fought me on it every time. 
- You can only advance slightly, I started as a tech specialist and then to tech expert and finally genius, but after that there is really no where else to go. You can try another role like a creative (someone who teaches the classes) or selling or stock.
- Favoritism is terrible here"
9,Apple,Overall good,2022-04-04,5.0,Real Time Operations Analyst,"Ability to work independently, and the company does a great job of taking care of employees. Fun atmosphere and feels more casual than the typical work place.

10,Apple,"Tough to get in, tough to thrive, but toughest to leave",2022-02-16,5.0,Individual Contributor,"- Apple has many of the great amenities, salaries, and benefits that you get from many silicon valley companies.
- Apple is so big that your experience here will greatly vary depending on the team that you are joining. If you stick with it and work hard, things will probably work out for you. You will need to put in the time though. For me this meant working over weekends, early days, and late nights sometimes. 
- Through difficult meetings with senior management, I learned how to think and ask the right questions, which is the most valuable thing I took away from this role.","- Pride among senior managers and staff was not uncommon. Sometimes, not often, decisions were made based off of who was presenting the data, and not based off of what the data was actually saying.
- I've witnessed people forced out of roles because some said ""they didn't get it"". Which really meant some people didn't think they weren't smart enough.
- Remote work is not possible for many roles. 
- With the time I had to invest, it was difficult to work here at times, but I still deeply miss working here like most others that choose leave do."
11,Apple,"Good position for part-time work for full-time students, other than that high-stress & unsustainable environment",2022-03-27,4.0,T2 IOS Advisor,"Work from home, good pay for minimum skills needed to start, employee stock program. For the most part the managers I worked with were really nice people and a pleasure to work with.","High-stress, customers are really rude, management always blames the employees for customer's bad behavior even if its clear that its not the employees fault. Repetitive work flow that becomes mundane very quickly and overall not a job that I would recommend keeping for more than a year tops because of health concerns & because the longer you stay the more difficult I think it will be to switch careers."

Requesting days off is quick and approved 99% of the time.","Wages are nowhere near covering the cost of living.
Higher management does not listen to employees. 
Food insecurity following low wages.
Management sells the vision of our roles being important and impacting people all over the world, yet expects us to live on feeling proud of our work, when it is money, not pride, that pays our bills.
Everyone is soon to be forced back to the office destroying any modicum of having real work/life balance.
CEO and his sycophants pride themselves in breaking barriers yet do not see that their employees are unhappy, that remote work helps in productivity, and would ultimately save the company money."

The innovation and limitless possibilities when it comes to the technology being developed its unmatched.,"The pay is average best and there is this misconception that Apple has great benefits.

- Conflicting information occurs sometimes in technical support documents due to constantly changing OS development
- Issues with time-consuming or non existent resolutions are difficult to sell to frustrated customers"
18,Apple,Honest Review of AppleCare,2022-03-21,1.0,AppleCare Senior Advisor,"-Good benefits - Health Care
-Looks great on the resume","-PAY | AppleCare advisors are underwhelming underpaid. For the same work I have found jobs paying $10k more a year than I make after 7 years. Apple employees should not have to apply for food stamps in order to survive. 

-WORK LIFE BALANCE | It is nearly impossible to have a work life balance when you have a family and it is absolutely impossible to have one if you are a single parent. AppleCare will not move into the 21st century when it comes to flexible schedules.

-WORKLOAD | AppleCare senior advisors have a large workload which would not be a problem if they were compensated accordingly 

-ENVIRONMENT | AppleCare has a toxic an environment when it comes to employee moral and the overall mental wellbeing for employees. They will have yearly surveys that they ensure will change the culture and management never implements what employees suggest and this has been the case for 7 years"
19,Apple,"Very rewarding, limited growth potential at Retail level",2022-03-17,5.0,Apple Genius,"Amazing company that does care about its employees, teaches a lot of personal growth that applies towards a lot of jobs outside of retail.

Great benefits and paid vacation.","Personal experience is widely dependent on managers and how they track performance as I worked in different stores and left some stores solely due to managers. 

They track everything possible of performance from customer reviews, to how many times you talked about a business team to repair rates for certain iPhone models. Repair time, appointment time length etc. Can get very exhausting

Once you reach genius, very limited space for growth inside the company outside of manager at apple store."
20,Apple,Take care of employees… for the most part,2022-03-07,4.0,Technical Expert,"The company has amazing benefits. They look after every employee and their loved ones.
Medical benefits I’m told by every admin in healthcare clinics is like no other they have seen before.
401 K matching.
Employee stock purchasing program is phenomenal.
Higher or about industry standards for pay.
You usually have wonderful breaks. Unpaid lunches but have paid 15 min breaks.","You work retail… 
Expect to work whatever they tell you. 
They take call outs super serious.
You never have any weekend days off.
You have to “request”(as they say it’s just a request) days off 4 weeks in advanced or more.
You have to deal with some very not smart people. We jokingly say, “imagine how not smart the average person is… now realize we work with the least smart end of that spectrum.”
Promotions are given out based on political and social Justice concerns. If you are a white guy that is straight expect to be in role for years before moving up."
21,Apple,"Overall great compared to other retailers, but LOTSof room for improvement",2022-02-17,3.0,Specialist,"The pay is really good compared to other retailers, benefits include health, dental, and vision.

Overall team building is good aside from the weird lingo they use. Most coworkers are great people with cool projects going on outside of work.

Not working on commission can have it's benefits because you don't have to worry about selling more to make more.","When you get hired they're constantly talking about how ""at apple we don't care about your numbers."" In reality, that's all they want to talk to you about when it comes to their ""coaching connections."" The only numbers that matter to them seems to be how much apple care you sell on specifically iphones. So even if your numbers for everything else is really good, your apple care numbers for phones is the only one that really matters.

Customers can be pretty terrible like any other retail environment. A very cringey culture on top of all of it. Just nonstop talks about ""customer journey"" or ""your journey here at apple."" You absolutely will not move up in the chain if you don't speak up during morning meetings about what you could do to improve the ""customer journey."""
22,Apple,Not Recommended,2022-03-22,3.0,Technical Expert,"- Decent discounts
- Good staff
- Good benefits","- Poor management
- Proper raises were only ever considered after losing 2/3 of our team in under a year
- Being a giant corporation, resolutions to issues come at a trickle"
23,Apple,Great until it wasn't,2022-03-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexibility and pay were great for the position, and having freedom to manage time as needed was great",Moving to IT support was awful. Micromanaging (was called in for walking around for 1-2 min every hour because you're expected to be sitting and taking calls your ENTIRE shift) and irate customers gave me anxiety to the point of daily anxiety attacks before my shift. When I reached out for help or to be moved to a chat role I was basically told I was SOL. Moving to IT and being given completely different responsibilities from the job I actually applied for decreased not just my morale but all my coworkers to the point where most of us quit because it was no longer worth it
24,Apple,Benefits are nice. Politics within the building are annoying.,2022-03-21,3.0,Specialist,This was a wonderful company to work for when I was looking for a job fresh out of college. The stock options are amazing and the health insurance is amazing. The pay is above normal for retail.,"Politics within the buildings are annoying. If you aren't faking it until you make it, you will not get far. You need to absorb everything that management says in order to be considered for a promotion. If you don't, they will overlook you every time. For an atmosphere that emphasizes feedback, the same feedback that you dish out will come back to haunt you down the line."

29,Apple,Stablitiy,2022-03-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Best Part of Apple is - Less Politics as people are busy working. They do not have time to play politics. Good Benefits. People are not insecure about getting laid off and due to this productivity is all time high. People are more focused in delivering stuff instead of looking for job outside. I think many companies can learn from this.,Only Con I noticed is - Teams are really small which result is extra-workload for everyone.
30,Apple,Okay Job if you are in school,2022-01-25,3.0,Product Specialist,"- payback tuition 
- flexible with school hours
- employee stock plan 
- employee discounts","- Managers do not help on the floor at all, they would be their for support but rather watch their employees drown than take a transaction 
- leveling up is difficult unless you are up management 24/7, basically have to be friend management in order to level up 
- It's an easy job to get stuck in because the benefits are so great but overall mental health is non existent
- work hours, can be anywhere between 7am - 11pm
- extremely difficult to get into corporate once you been in retail. 
- Career experiences feels like exploitations more than career advancements. Knew someone who did 15 career experiences and made Apple Retail what it is today and is still in retail for sales support instead of corporate. He should at least be somewhere in an entry level at corporate by now."

Everybody is so different but everyone possesses the same quality that they truly want to help. I've never been denied genuine assistance and they have maintained a proactive and safety first approach to COVID which I appreciate every day. 

I'm a part time employee while also being a full time student. They are tremendously supportive with college schedules and as long as your availability meets the needs of the business, the company is more than flexible. Apple knows I will not be with them beyond the next year or two but they continue to push me to accomplish all I can and invite me to be my true, best self every day. It's a terrific experience and if you get the opportunity I recommend giving it a shot.",Limited growth for part time employees.

- depending on group, really great teamwork 
- ability to wear a lot of different hats","- very dependent on management chain 
- many groups are highly political and senior leaders want to build their kingdoms, which can inhibit cross-functional teamwork
- disparity between groups is large-- some teams adhere strictly to policy, some groups don't at all, which can create churn
- compensation used to be very competitive, and now isn't as much anymore

You will have 5-7 managers, maybe will have 1-2 that are tolerable to great. The rest will make you question how they got hired. 
Don't ever let them tell you that you can move from retail to corporate easily. I worked there for a solid 10 years and applied every year to corporate. Unless you are talented in engineering or sucking up, it won't happen. I'm not bitter - that's just the reality. I loved working with my team and for a scattering of managers across 4 stores. The bad managers and nonsense kool-aid cheerleading attitudes eventually made me cry every day before work. So after a decade I left and was much happier. Again, you will work here because it's cool [for a while], your co-workers will be awesome mostly, and the money is good. That's what your expectations should be. Nothing more."

You learn how to be incredibly fast at everything, but that has its drawbacks too.
Some managers are amazing people and aren't micro managers. They treat you like a human being which is hard to find in retail. of course this is highly store dependent.","Some stores/managers are extremely toxic.
Most stores don't have an actually break room or place to get away to in order to reset or eat on lunches and if so those rooms can take over half your break to walk to and from (they do not account for this as farms when your break starts).  2 of the 3 stores I worked at only had the tiny corridor between the door in the back of the store to the tech computer room to use for a break. Sit on a stool that lines the super narrow corridor while your colleagues maneuver around you to work. 
The customers can be nice, but a lot can be downright toxic and vile. 
As a technician you are expected to meet, ask all the questions to try and understand what's going on with the customers device, explain the problem to them, provide options for solutions, carry out those solutions and make sure they are set to use their device again all within 10- 20 min MAX! Heck, software resets (which is a common solution) can take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour depending on the device. You are expected to work at lightning speed without reprieve and it  WILL suck the life out of you no matter how hard you try to do a good job for both you're employer and customer. 
There are a lot of changes, always, but this can be a good thing just depending on how you look at it."

Constantly changing expectations. Lack of support. Lack of attention to remote employee health. Apple hires 3rd party vendors to cover its frontline incoming customer calls. These vendors are not full Apple staff and thus aren't fully trained.

Remote work at home 
Company provided computer
Option to buy stock at a discount","No career opportunities ( Unless one moves to California, Texas or NC)
At home is a customer service based job- but Apple pushes all tech work such as logging, collecting data for engineers (Role is classified and customer service to avoid "" tech"" title)
Recent merge of jobs into one so all take on more work but no increase and pay
Training to learn is crammed within 2-3 days
Extra stress and Apple does not help unless one obtains medical documents to support
Not an open door company for discussing pay equity as a group- wants a "" one on one"" approach to collect information. 

Inclusion and diversity is not equal 
See  apple dot com forward slash diversity  — for statistics 

Board is against Civil Rights audit until recent shareholders vote which changed that. 

Job schedules change every 6 months based on a stack ranking which is often beyond the Advisors control

Loyalty does not matter..
A “who you know” for job advancements.


If you’re in College, Apple will target college kids. BE CAREFUL college students! Lots of promises that will never come true. If you’re offered an At-Home job and you do not live in California, Texas, or NC you will NOT have job options unless you pay to move to the states listed. Pay is terrible and Apple will use the same lines of “Add that to your APR” and the raises are trash. 

They use a 3rd part company to determine pay. If you’re at home, it’s a standard “customer service paid job but then you’re scored on performance and calls all to get a decent schedule. 

Don’t think because it’s Apple it’s all it’s cracked up to be. They entice you with promises and never deliver. 
They send out annual surveys wanting feedback but honestly they don’t care. They use Vendors and only jobs are for the states listed.  Don’t think Apple truly cares. They only speak up to save face and image. 

Pay equity is horrible and leadership is not balanced culturally evenly although they will put cultured faces upfront to “Say” they care. Trust me, it’s not there and anytime someone speaks up, you’re seen as an issue. 

People will often see these reviews and think oh it’s that person. There’s a reason you see so many reviews from former and current employees. Don’t let Apple fool you into thinking differently. Don’t share your ideas as they will belong to Apple and you get No credit. Plus that’s something you sign upon hiring. 

This is something Apple has on annual APRa as “Innovation” and what YOU DID  to contribute to the business. So if you have an idea, don’t share with Apple as you’ll get no credit and no extra pay. 

Look at the common themes of reviews and you’ll see a pattern. Too many people have left because left for these reasons. Apple will make it appear as if the employee was the issue rather than damaging their image."

There’s opportunities to mentor or be mentored by people in the field you want to be in or help others who want to get into your field. They do 401k matching and there’s ways they give back to charities you donate or volunteer with, on top of their own give-back programs they do with nonprofits and community outreach.

Also, if you work hard and succeed they reward it. The better you are at your job, generally speaking the higher your pay and/or end of year goodies.","If you are an average or under performing or new hire or 3rd party hire, the lowest positions may not pay as well as some other lower end roles at other companies, such as a Verizon call center representative or Gravity Payments’ custodian, but they pay better than any regular wage job such as working at a fast food restaurant or a grocery store employee. If you are a full time employee, you can definitely live off your wages even if you have a family. With all the benefits and extras, you will feel happy at your job.

The stigma for people who work in retail is present and strong, despite Apple's efforts to convince us otherwise, and despite our qualifications. 

Many of my former coworkers who was not afraid of making the jump, end up leaving for MUCH better jobs with much better pay, and with employers who value them more than Apple did. But those who were complacent will pay the price (and also make those around them pay as well) for confining themselves to a job that Apple does not intend for anyone to keep long term (unless you are in retirement and just want to work there for the stock benefits)"

Great benefits some upward mobility,Poor management very bureaucratic they would rather see you take a week off and get it covered by a leave of absence than take 2 days off with a simple dr note. This makes no sense and causes lots of issues. Very clicky if u are not one of “them” and you don’t drink the cool air and agree with all their views you become an outcast. If you are overweight or have a disability they don’t treat you well. No one seems to have the answers. You can ask a manager and they will tell you to call HR and HR will tell you to ask your manager. It leaves you stressed out because you can never get an answer. You have to just guess and do your best and hope you do not get fired. This is very stressful. Lastly it is very boring as every role does the same thing all day everyday. They don’t mix things up u come in and do the same thing and deal with the same people everyday. It makes coming to work boring.

The company’s culture is the best, because you are truly valued for you personality, interests, and character. Working at Apple, truly makes you feel valued as a human being, and they’ll care about your wants and needs. This culture has the best mixture of having fun and being professional. I feel respected and work with respectful people.","Rarity of opportunities, takes the lead. 

Working in Retail, unfortunately, and saddens me to say, is completely difficult to connect to corporate roles. Even with a bachelors, it’s extremely difficult, if not impossible, to enter into their job market, unless, perhaps, you’re majoring in engineering. 

My advice is to apply to corporate internships, and trying to land a job that way. The great thing, to not discourage yourself if you’re reading this, is that retail employees can apply to corporate internships. That’s honestly your best bet to try and enter, but keep in mind, like all risk, it won’t be a guarantee. 

All in all, a lack of opportunity outside of sales and repairs is heartbreaking, especially since many people and students have tremendously amount to offer, if only they are given a chance. There’s frankly nothing else for people to grow in, unless you can get into customer service remote jobs.

If you love sales and/or being a technician that solves your device issues, then this is right for you."

If you work hard you can do a rotation, however, the rotations and interview process are extremely competitive. And once you start at the Retail Contact Center, it can be very difficult to move from customer facing roles. 
You need to have excellent interview skills, be willing to discuss the customer experience around the clock, and not complain.

281,Apple,"Coworkers were great, customers were the worst",2021-09-30,4.0,Technical Specialist,"My coworkers were all amazing, kind, and talented individuals. The team was very supportive and it was easy to talk to everyone. The managers really cared about the team and it showed. The pay was nice, we received a lump sum discount ($500, I think every 1-2 years) and a 10-15% discount (also applicable to family and friends).","The customers were the worst part about the job. I was anxious to go to work everyday. Don't get me wrong, sometimes you'd get customers that were great and you'd get along with them well. However, it's the bad ones that stick. A lot of people will bend their phones or void their warranty and take it out on you. My coworkers were surprised that I didn't cry because of a customer during my time at Apple. The worst part about these customers is that they get sent a survey to rate you. If you get bad reviews, management will come to talk to you. 

On Christmas Eve, I once had a customer shove a watch band in my face and not say anything. No questions, no request to buy it, they just expected me to read their mind (I'm supposed to fix the phones too, not sell merchandise). I did it anyway so they wouldn't have to wait awhile. In return, I got a 1/5 star review without any comments.

Another gripe is the amount of work you need to do. You must do a minimum of 20 hours as part time. If you want a day off, you better be requesting that MONTHS in advance. Otherwise, tough luck. Best believe you will be working on all of the holidays. Black Friday is the worst."

417,Apple,Company genuinely cares about you!,2014-09-10,5.0,Family Room Specialist,"- Great benefits 
- great work environment
- great salary (especially for retail)
- lots of peer support
- lots of management support
- lots of learning experiences and resources
- opportunity for advancement
- opportunities for ""career experiences"" in corporate roles, for retail staff (underutilized, apparently. go for it!)
- you become really good friends with your peer group, or maybe even family!
- Amazing sense of belonging and community
- great stepping stone to new career, if that is your choice","- Too much ""drinking the kool aid"". WAY too much. I hope this is an apt metaphor: Imagine you have an 8oz cup in your hand. They pour a 64oz pitcher of Kool-Aid into your 8oz. cup. Then they pour a pitcher of sugar into the same cup. You get diabetes. The amount of company propaganda is absolutely astounding and excessive to point of being absolutely ridiculous, wherein you feel like a caricature of yourself wearing this blue shirt. This is coming from me, a lifelong Apple fan since 1987 (the year I started using computers).
- FAR too much bashing of anything that isn't Apple. Apple has now decided as a company, to compare itself to Samsung and Google, etc etc. It used to decide not to compare itself to anybody. This shows everywhere from development to retail attitudes.
- Willing isolation from and ignorance of the rest of the world of technology. Apple exists in a bubble, and those within the bubble are blissfully unaware that any other technology is relevant and useful. I heard one employee say that Microsoft Office is going the way of the dinosaurs. Nobody called him out on this. What dream world is he living in???? Isn't it better to learn Apple's technology in a way that helps it workably coexist with other technology? This is equally as important as learning the Apple ecosystem, which, yes, in itself is amazing.
- Training is too general, not specific enough to help sharpen one's technical skill set on a consistent basis.
- No ongoing training program to keep your technical skills sharp and up to date. Instead, they offer ""Pathways"", which is meant to improve your social skills. Great! But isn't that why they hired us to begin with? You have to search Apple's technical reporting system for relevant known issues, which is fine but if you don't (and a lot of techs don't)  you usually find out what those are when a customer has a problem and you don't know the answer. One person who happened to look at iDesk might know the answer, but if they're not available, you may end up giving the customer the wrong solution. The signal to noise ratio of important, specific information is a total mess.
- ""I can't believe they re-arranged the lockers. I'm thinking about quitting now."" Everyone joins in agreement. Really, guys? C'mon. Again, as I mentioned in my point about the Apple ""bubble"", the perception of reality can be largely distorted. Management has to work REALLY REALLY hard to bend over backwards for every little thing. So how much energy do they have left over to make sure their techs are up to date, or that sales staff knows their specs and has good ways of explaining tech to non-tech people? Apple is very big on managing expectations for customers (great, actually!) but could do a lot better to manage expectations for employees. Maybe this would improve management's time and ability to fix some more important issues.
- Far too many points of contact for customers. A customer may end up talking to between 4 and 8 different people who may end up telling them lots of conflicting things. Either communication needs to improve in the store or the number of contact points needs to decrease somehow."
