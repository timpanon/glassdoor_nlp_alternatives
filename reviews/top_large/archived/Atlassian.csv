0,Atlassian,Phenomenal Culture,2022-04-04,5.0,Sales Analytics Manager,So far there hasn't been a ton of exec fire drills that you typically see at a lot of tech companies. It's a much more relaxed environment to work in. Fully flexible work situation where I can WFH full time or go into the office as I choose. Comp and benefits are fantastic.,"The distributed workforce can leave out a sense of camaraderie found in the trenches of the office, but it's a small price to pay for the benefit of WFH and not having to commute everyday."
1,Atlassian,Best company ever?,2022-03-30,5.0,Senior Data Scientist,"I love working at Atlassian. I primarily joined for a better Work-Life balance, and it delivers on that--though I will say it might vary based on what team you are on (though generally good). The Atlassian values are embraced by everyone. You'll find support for your new ideas, and you'll be less impeded by office politics. I hope to never leave. 

- Really collaborative culture
- Strong adherence to values
- Great support for innovation
- Solid benefits
- They are still newish to data science, so a lot of opportunities to contribute in a meaningful way to the business
- You don't need a PhD to work on machine learning models here
- Remote work is well-supported
- Large company but still feels startup-y in many ways. You thus get the stability of a company that's not about to go under","- Funding decisions are often driven by initiatives; infrastructure work or long-term projects are often underfunded and understaffed
- Wish they offered a stipend for remote employees to join coworking spaces
- Less data maturity than some tech peers, so tooling or data quality may be work-in-progress
- A lot of ""data science"" work is actually analytics--know what you're applying for
- Still very Australia or Pacific-coast staff heavy, so east coast workers may find it annoying
- Promotions are less quick than I'm used to"
2,Atlassian,It's as good as they say it is!,2022-03-14,5.0,Senior Business Analyst,"Amazing supportive culture that prioritises psychological safety, transparency and constructive feedback. Senior staff are approachable and everyone truly lives by the company values. Company values come up in conversations all the time and truly lead the way with decision making. Pay is excellent and they don't glamorise overworking but encourage balance and rest.","Sometimes the openness of the company means random people will give you feedback which can seem a little scary at first, but there is good intent and all communication is encouraged to be delivered in the most productive way and not as something to tear others down. They truly do prioritise diversity and inclusion but it is definitely a male dominated company in the engineering / development teams which can be a little intimidating when you join as a woman. Everyone is really lovely though and I have not experienced or witnessed any sexist remarks. My manager has not been super hands on with setting career milestones and plans for my future development yet, so I am a little concerned of lack of trajectory in my career but it is still very early days for me so that could change in future."
3,Atlassian,Best place I've ever worked,2022-03-31,5.0,Product Marketing Manager,"- Competitive salary, benefits, bonus, stock
- Thoughtful work/life balance measures like ""Refresh"" days for my whole team so we can take time off without getting lots of messages while we're out. 
- Flexibility - work from anywhere, unlimited PTO, lots of different ways of working across teams and individuals
- Interesting projects and challenges - the company is large but many orgs are exploring exciting new things and have exciting start-up energy
- Regular growth check-ins and opportunities to try new things
- Lots of chances to give back through paid time off for volunteering and company donation matching","- Can be long hours, especially if you're on a global team (meeting times across Australia, Europe, India, USA can lead to 12 hour days at times) 
- Pretty high workload, often with some degree of ambiguity - the company is growing quickly and supports lots of new ideas meaning you're often across multiple projects at once"
4,Atlassian,"Wonderful place to work - but be ready for lots of change, growth, and a bit of chaos!",2022-02-26,5.0,People Team Member,"* Atlassian’s future is incredibly bright and the products keep getting better and better by the day
* Pay, benefits, and the offices (once they open back up) are all excellent
* The people are warm, caring, and the culture is dynamite","* With growth comes change. I’ve seen many cases of teams going back to a “storming” phase as lots of new team members join. I would say this is normal and natural, but not always comfortable.
* Burnout is real, so you need to be the one to keep an eye on yourself, and speak up (and take action) if you are not in a good place."
5,Atlassian,Atlassian is a dream company!,2022-01-27,5.0,Channel Program Manager,"Atlassian takes the cake! The salary, RSUs, and annual bonuses are top $$! The benefits are incredible from paying for health & vision insurance 100% for not only me, but my family of five! In previous jobs, a third of every check went to insurance coverages. We also are granted a week per year to volunteer and our Foundation does so much good in this world. Our founders are dedicated to diversity, growth, and being ahead of the curve. I can't say enough great things about this company and am so happy to have just celebrated my third anniversary!","While I don't truly feel like I have a con to share, I'd say since we are a young company, we figure things out as we go, which in the end is a great way to grow!"

good project
good team
good culture","growing pain
distributed team make it hard to meet up"
7,Atlassian,The Best Professional Experience I've Ever Had,2021-10-01,5.0,Program Manager,"The company is truly progressive, not just in what they said, but in their actions. Employees are encouraged to express their opinions freely, whether they are positive or critical, and regardless of whether they're in direct opposition to leadership. One of the first things I noticed about Atlassian when I was interviewing was how many people have been there for 5+ years; Ive spent the last 5 years in software and I've never seen this anywhere else. In working at Atlassian, I understand why this is - there are a lot of opportunities for growth and incredible benefits. My manager has been really supportive of me doing more of everything I enjoy and less of everything I don't enjoy. I plan on staying with Atlassian for as long as I can (10+ years). I have incredible work/life balance and this is something the company supports wholeheartedly.","Working for a company this large can be pretty confusing, especially if you're coming from a smaller compan. The size of the company is both a blessing and a burden - because of its size, there are a ton of resources; however, with so many employees across so many teams and so many locales, figuring out exactly who to speak to about specific issues can be challenging. Also, the company currently determines salaries based on the going rate for the market each employee is based in. A lot of employees have expressed criticism about this and I'm hopeful that this will change in the near future."
8,Atlassian,Great Company w/ Lots of Opportunity,2022-03-02,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,"As an individual contributor, it feels like my work is always valued and appreciated. Company values each employee, considers your opinion, comp'd very fair, great benefits, and the list goes on. Always room for career growth, and is encouraged by Atlassian.","None really IMO. Company moves incredibly fast at times which can be overwhelming, but a good thing as well. You might be working on one project, then switched to another if the company/team/department moves in another direction. Realistically Atlassian is always looking at the bigger picture."
9,Atlassian,Atlassian is the real deal,2022-03-06,5.0,Product Marketing Manager,"Atlassian genuinely probably one of the best companies in the world, somehow able to balance great employee experiences with a portfolio of products across various verticals. You work with some truly driven, empathetic people and you can tell they really care about the people they hire.","Atlassian is growing incredibly quickly, so you'll experience some growing pains along the way. But overall, this is a fairly minor con that is being handled well."
10,Atlassian,Love working at Atlassian!,2022-03-18,5.0,Senior Data Scientist,"People tend to be kind and smart, the company cares about doing the right thing, and the commitment to remote work is excellent.","With the company being fully remote I haven’t met any of my team members in person, but hopefully we’ll have more offsites soon."
11,Atlassian,Best job I've ever had,2022-01-24,5.0,Product Marketing Manager,"- Interesting projects
- Fast pace but with emphasis on work/life balance (""creative refresh days"" and ""burnout prevention days"" that the whole department gets off in addition to plenty of holidays and unlimited PTO) 
- Lots of freedom to take ownership of initiatives you feel passionate about
- Regular check-ins about professional growth, learning and development
- Really well taken care of - strong pay, lots of acknowledgement from my team about personal milestones (birthdays, weddings, graduations...etc) and lots of opportunities to bond with my team remotely
- Great flexibility with remote vs in-office work. We can basically choose which we prefer and work from anywhere (with some restrictions)","- Growth pathway not entirely clear for PMMs
- Things are moving and growing really quickly, which can feel a bit intense and messy at times. It helps to be comfortable with uncertainty and motivated to create process and structure where it's needed"
12,Atlassian,Good Company,2022-02-03,5.0,FP&A,"* One of the best companies I've ever worked at. 
* Surrounded by incredibly smart, talented, and passionate people. 
* You will work with and learn industry-leading, bleeding edge technology. 
* Competitive benefits. 
* Strong brand to leave with on your resume (provided you can actually take something with you in terms of new skills or experience). 
* This place has culture. I don't know how to put it into words, but it was there. Maybe it's because the company had its roots in uber-nerdy, tech geeks, and they stayed that way (and also took the company to what it is today!)","* Absolute grind, like a steamroller. I saw many a good employee burned out by the long hours. Finance team specifically has long hours, demanding deadlines, and will get no sympathy from anyone. I often looked around and certainly didn't see sales ops or marketing being forced into the same deadlines or workload. Finance really feels like the whipping boy of the company. Seriously, I thought ""burnout"" was a joke that weak people used as an excuse, until it came time to leave this company and I honestly thought I had lost my ability to work -- focus, energy, everything. 
* The Bay Area office really harbors some serious nose-in-the-air liberal culture. The company takes a stand on every single issue, people in the office look down on you for using a trashcan (rather than a recycling bin or compost -- why would you even use something that can't be composted or recycled??). Upside -- it makes for really entertaining discourse when the Poland office is asked to take the same stand, when they may not necessarily harbor the same values. I just want a workplace, not a political rally."
13,Atlassian,Big org  = big opportunities,2022-03-31,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Emphasis on culture, remote-friendly workplace, diverse employee base, opportunities to go above and beyond and really make an impact","Scaling at an incredible rate, so will be interesting to see how the org maintains their unique culture over the coming years"
14,Atlassian,Much better than expected,2021-10-14,5.0,Product Marketing,"Super fast-growing company; feels like a startup with big pockets and the level of investment across different programs keeps growing. 

The product marketing team owns the GTM, and by that I mean truly owns it and drives it. At other companies PMM tends to be just another marketing team but here if you are a product marketer you will have broader scope and responsibilities than in other companies. 

Pay is competitive, good amount of RSUs and very good flexibility to work from anywhere makes this a great place to be.","As with any big company, sometimes there's lots of red tape and different teams involved until decisions can be made. The procurement process (related to new vendor onboarding and contractors) is driven by sloths (if you have seen Zootopia, the DMV scene sums it up).

Because the company is so hot, there's been a good number of middle management leaving to get executive positions at other places, but it also opens up career opportunities for other team members.

Increasingly competitive market makes your work always interesting and in some cases too competitor-focused."

20,Atlassian,Not the best if you are serious about your career,2022-02-22,2.0,Sales Representative,"Lots of perks that you would expect from a large org, work was easy.","Where to start, management in the Boston office is very bad. They do not fire ANYONE. Because of this the management team is a group that was in the right place right time and not true leaders more glorified babysitters. Talking with people that worked in the Texas office this was not the case there just in Boston. Lots of bullying happening on slack due to the bro culture that they just let happen. I would really recommend if you are someone who is serious about sales and wants to make lots of money and enjoy where you work to look elsewhere."

30,Atlassian,Needs improvement,2022-02-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Alot of good benefits and such,"Honestly, if this company could throw 3x as many managers as needed at something and come up with more ridiculous systems based on metrics....I don't think i've seen many companies that try so hard to create systems that just don't work. There's a massive disconnect between teams that create things for other teams. Honestly....if you aren't in support this is probably the best company ever. If you are in support? Well you already know and are already probably looking for another job."

The analysts are great teammates, I worked with many talented ICs in analytics.",Management encourages ICs to compromise data quality standards for speed. Stakeholders do not demonstrate basic competency with interpreting statistics. Too many ICs per manager means low manager support for you. Stakeholders are controlling and want to manage down to the order in which you do your project work. Team culture and cohesion is nonexistent. Org spends too much time spent touching up cosmetic OKR scores.

+A great 5+ year vision, with world-class leaders to ensure we attain that vision.

+A genuine focus on the employee that is unrivaled. I'm being supported in taking care of my whole self; I'm being stretched in ways that are making me a better professional; I'm surrounded by top talent at every level - the company focus on the right additions vs. the right fit has made this the place to be.

+The company - which is truly the people who work here - finds new and meaningful ways to ""refill my cup"" each day. 

Simply - the best!","I'm struggling to think of many - if any - cons. I'm sure they are there, but any that have come up have been easily worked through and turned into positive experiences through teamwork, collaboration, and support."
42,Atlassian,"Great Culture, Amazing Benefits, Humble Leadership",2021-03-07,5.0,Senior Enterprise Advocate,"The benefits are incredible. With a family of four, all healthcare benefits are paid. Atlassian works hard to make sure the employees are taken care of and it shows. They invest in programs to support the mental health of everyone and provide ways to connect with others virtually (through the Pandemic). The leaders are open to feedback and are transparent, answering the tough questions in company-wide meetings, even when it's hard. The culture has been painstakingly cultivated to include all kinds of people. As a parent of a trans child, this in particular has been inspiring to see. There is an emphasis on promotion from within, and there are opportunities to grow your skills to serve the company in new ways.","As an organization that has grown through acquisition, not all systems are integrated, which can make for a difficult experience in learning how to do your day-to-day job. Atlassian is a largely self-organized, self-driven set of software nerds (I count myself among them and don't say that as an insult), as such, it can be difficult to find a human to help you to find answers. It's written down somewhere on a Confluence page, but everything is in Confluence, and if you lack the history and navigational expertise in that platform, it can be very hard to find what you need. Support is always a ticket, but I'm never sure what kind of ticket, what help desk, etc. Be prepared to have lots of systems to learn."
43,Atlassian,I didn't think a company like this existed,2021-11-01,5.0,Product Marketing Manager,"Atlassian is a company that cares. That sounds cheesy I know, but when it's true... it's true. Whether it's time off, contributing to organizations you care about, maternity leave, mental health, etc. Atlassian cares about its employee just as much if not more than the end result. I've worked at start-ups as well as large enterprise organizations, and by far Atlassian is the company that stands out to me as being a ""leader"". If you are looking for opportunities, challenges, great colleagues, and ways to advance your career...look no further than Atlassian.",Truly I have no cons to speak on. Atlassian is a great company and I look forward to growing with them.

46,Atlassian,A genuinely great place to work,2021-09-01,5.0,Technical Sourcer,"This has been my favorite place of work in my career to date. I've had the privilege of working at some genuinely world-class organizations, and Atlassian tops them all. I can't think of another place I'd rather be riding out the absolute sh*tstorm that is the world these days than a company that's so genuinely focused on the health and wellbeing of its employees. From the ground up, it's a culture of genuine care, collaboration, team work and the understanding that YOU are more important than your work.

High focus on the onboarding experience to get employees up to speed quickly. They make an effort to listen to employees feedback and provide solutions to the problems they hear about.","Hard work!

52,Atlassian,Atlassian really lives their values!,2021-08-18,5.0,Technical Account Manager,I can't say enough great things about working at Atlassian. I was a customer using their tools before joining the company. My experience helped me to land my current role on the TEAM. Yes - that's right TEAM! They are a company but more than that they are a group of teammates working on many goals together. If you're not a team player then this is not your future. Only team players need apply.,There's A LOT of content to digest here. Some historical and tons of fresh content coming in at a very fast pace. Sometimes it same seem difficult to keep up with all the new features and information about them. With a lot of tools there comes a lot of learning how to use them or provide guidance to others on using them. You've got to be organized and able to mark content for reference later.
53,Atlassian,Best place I've worked at,2021-08-24,5.0,Senior Enterprise Engineer,"The people, the culture, the focus on ensuring everyone is supported. Without a doubt the company was founded on the idea that having a strong and supportive team is key. The tenacity and focus on always progressing and keeping at the front of technology is there as well. It's just not necessarily the first thing I'd mention as I think its secondarily important to the culture.","The company is growing and through this there are some obvious signs of moving from a smaller sized company to a bigger one.

I get to work on solving strategic problems and I am always pushed out of my comfort zone - which enables me to grow as an employee. The people here are intelligent, motivated, and truly do look out for each other. We have the tools and resources to do our job successfully. In my experience, every employee is heard, validated, and supported by their leadership and their team.

The perks are out of this world. Wellness reimbursements, great insurance options, 401K matching, company swag...the list goes on. I feel very valued and appreciated here at Atlassian and it motivates me to give back to the company in constructive ways.",Change is a constant and we are always iterating. You have to be comfortable with pivots and knowing that projects may change shape halfway through. These Atlassian way of working is very unique and there's a pretty steep learning curve.

Having never onboarded virtually prior, I wasn't quite sure what to expect initially. As I onboarded 100% virtually I experienced noting but fully functioning tools, an extremely welcoming work culture and a highly organized group of helpful teammates.","Due to the team growing rapidly and heavy interview schedules it took a longer period of time for me to interview, however, it was certainly worth the wait."

I've been here 4 years and have worked at a multitude of other companies, but this one takes the cake. From the way they treated us in pre-covid times (food, fitness, excessive off-sites, and other perks) to the way they've handled the transition during covid (extra funding for a WFH budget, mindfulness training, mental health resources for us and dependents, virtual fitness classes, extra covid PTO) - they make me feel like my person comes before my work. My boss is supportive and encouraging, and while new, has made great strides at being a great boss. My work is challenging and I have the resources and ability to make stuff happen, even not being at a senior level.","The pay is significantly lower than I could be getting elsewhere, especially with regards to the tiered system of pay for remote work aka ""Team Anywhere""."

Collaboration, understanding, compromise, teamwork, employee support, encouragement, personal and professional growth... these are all parts of our everyday lives at Atlassian, and I'm proud to be part of this family.

The Founders/CEOs actually listen and engage. You can provide constructive yet critical feedback and they engage, ask questions, lean in, and try to understand.

* You mostly have the tools and resources to do your job properly
* The company transitioned to remote well
* People are generally polite and respectful to work with","It's been almost 3 months since my last review. During that time, Atlassian brought in 2 new content designers. They also hired or promoted 3 new content design leads. All 5 are white. The content design team is now more homogenously white than when I first joined it. Even though Atlassian transitioned to remote and new labor markets opened up, leadership is still cherry picking white people.

Actions speak louder than words. It's ironic that a group of content experts don't comprehend that. You can't call yourselves woke if you deliberately sleep on POC talent. If you don't live and lead according to your values, then you never adopted those values to begin with.

Original:

The makeup of content design leadership is 100% white. The makeup of FTE content design team members is almost 100% white. Marketing content, Playbook content, and DevOps content teams are also almost 100% white.

I've been surrounded by white content experts who understand the risk and consequences of inconsistent and deceptive messaging when it comes to their products. But they lack credibility and empathy with their diversity and inclusion messaging. For a full year, they've aggressively marketed themselves as inclusive while continuing a long pattern where only white people are hired, promoted, and meaningfully included. It's a disturbing and dangerous pattern, and I'm saddened that Glassdoor is the only outlet where it's possible for leaders to pay attention and hold themselves accountable for their gatekeeping."

83,Atlassian,World Class Culture,2021-03-19,5.0,Analyst,"Hands down, the best thing about Atlassian is the the culture.

People at Atlassian live by the Atlassian values and it starts from the Founders setting the tone. It's very evident that the Founders use our values as guiding principles for how they communicate with the rest of the company and how decisions are made. There is a huge amount of trust across the company for individuals to do the same.","We're growing at very fast rate - it will becoming naturally harder for us to maintain culture over time.

Work life balance can be a challenge. It's not really emphasized by managers on every team. I think most individuals have to make their own efforts to create balance, which honestly should fall under a manager's responsibilities NOT on the individual."
84,Atlassian,Great Company to work for.,2021-08-02,5.0,Program Coordinator,"Great leadership, who are in touch with the current situation of the world and keep taking a pulse on how the team is feeling and what they need.",Salaries have not been adjusted since Jan 2020 and it's hard to know if the promotion some are getting is a promotion or just a title change.
85,Atlassian,"One of the best engineering cultures I've worked with, but there's still some corporate BS",2021-06-15,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"I love the engineering culture here. As an very senior IC who moved into management after nearly 2 decades of saying ""I would never want to be a manager,"" it's very hard to seen having done this everywhere else, and I hope to stick around here for a good long while.

We have a great team, great products, and I have a high degree of trust in senior engineering management. Our quality bar is good, and improving, and we have a really high respect for work-life balance and a really high bar for collegiality (""play as a team"" as the company values put it.) We do a lot to empower teams and individuals.","Engineering-wise, this place has done the best job of transitioning from a small company to a big one. Really the only big headache is having to deal with the geographical split, and this is going to be true at any company with our multinational footprint - it's just a little different since the main office is Sydney, not one of the US ones.

I wish I could say that was the biggest issue for the rest of the company, but really every time I have a contact with a non-technical team I am reminded that it's not.

Overall, we do OK at everything. Our HR, G&A, IT, etc folks are all well-meaning individuals trying to live out the company values. The company did really, really well in transitioning to remote for COVID and I know people did a tremendous amount of work to make that happen.

Even so, there seems to be a big gap between the policy-making and the empowerment of people on the front lines of those departments. The policies are not ... bad... but they seem to be built around the sort of ""efficiency"" that is only _necessary_ for a company much larger than ours. They also change too often. 

On their own, none of these are all that bad, but on the net I think these are hurting us in our ability to hire and retain talent, and I've seen a number of very good people leave for dumb, avoidable reasons."

That kind of growth is going to mean some growing pains along the way, and even more so with the pandemic happening in this time period. Despite this, I'd still say that the core things that made me excited to join Atlassian are still very much part of the environment.
- Opportunity to make a big impact right away
- The company still values you as a person first and foremost (has shown this during the pandemic)

103,Atlassian,Unicorn of Companies,2020-07-01,5.0,Enterprise Solution Architect,"Management through the founders are highly invested in their employees. As an example, through the COVID-19 pandemic, they have constantly reached out and forced employees to take time off to help alleviate the stress some are enduring from having to manage working from home and their families.

For those that work in the office, a high functioning and desirable environment is created by providing their employees with breakfast, lunch, snacks, drinks, ice cream, and even an open bar at the end of the day. They are also plenty of mental break opportunities from board games, pool, foosball, video games and more

Atlassian lives, breathes and eats their values. The values aren't just some gimmick that get referenced when people feel it is convenient. These drive all of the work and commitments that are made.

From a compensation and benefits perspective, they really take care of their employees. Their unlimited vacation is truly unlimited. As an employee in my first year, I was able to have time off around the holidays with my family, spend a week with my daughter in Cancun, as well as take other days off to enjoy other time. After leaving a company where I had accrued over 5 weeks/year, I didn't find myself at the bottom just working without anytime to enjoy life. They strongly promote a work/life balance.

It is for these reasons and so many more that contribute to a healthy work environment and happy employees. I work with some of the best people.

+ Every day, I get to work with super smart, ambitious and humble people trying to shape how teams collaborate together. 
+ The company is deeply invested in living it's values and these values are used the basis for decision-making. 
+ The company is long-term focused and isn't afraid to take massive risks that may lead to near-term volatility.
+ Really thoughtful and inspiring executive team, including our co-founders, CFO and product heads.","+ The company still functions, in many ways like a startup. I personally love this about the company but for many folks, used to working in larger, more structured environments, this can be a little off-putting.

- Culture! If you are seeking a place that makes you feel cared about as an individual this is the place. In today’s times I’m grateful to be a part of the TEAM. 
- Benefits! Even without all the office perks like snacks, food etc. You will be given so much more than those “perks” that all tech companies assume makes their benefit package and culture great. There are too many to list but here’s a few; paid health benefits for the whole family, mindfulness and well being benefits, encourage volunteer time, encouraged work/life balance. 
- Growth! While the growth plan won’t be meticulously delivered at your feet you will be given the agency, opportunities to push yourself further without the fear of failing. They encourage everyone to do continuous learning either for your current role or the role you’d like to move to. 
- Change! I love evolving and making changes quickly when something is not working. 

I’d give 5 stars but we all recognize we can always be better and that includes our CEOs.","If you aren’t a “pick yourself up by the bootstraps” type I can see how the pace, transparency, and available content can be overwhelming on where to start and to continue.

Everyone works hard to make this a great place to work, with lots of places to find ""your people"" and for individuals to add to the company culture. Product and marketing teams genuinely seek to be the change you seek while still balancing periodic waves of feedback and navigating several sources of feedback from customer-facing teams.","While Atlassian is truly a wonderful place to work, I've seen people become too comfortable and stop pushing themselves to do ""the best work of their lives"". Experiences with recruiters have been hit or miss internally and externally with seemingly little incentive to progressing employees with internal mobility outside of stats by functional group. Career success and growth seems to be mostly based on the initiative and drive of the individual and their connections rather than something that is front of mind for some managers."

They expect you to work 12 hour days, reward you with way more work rather than advancing your career & only care about the company growing at a speed that is killing the culture. Not friendly to people with disabilities or different work styles & they’ve done nothing to improve the experiences for BIPOC. It’s incredibly hard to climb there even if you’re doing great work.

NO one hardly talks to anyone in the meetings. Just management telling us what more needs to be done. Not a friendly feeling with high stress and our internal surveys show it."

131,Atlassian,Best place I've ever worked,2021-04-14,5.0,Cloud Support Engineer,"~ The people on my team are amazing
~ The culture and community. 
~I believe they care about me and my family. Y'all are the best.
~ The work is fun and technical. 
~ Great work-life balance","I wish the office was open, but I understand why it's not. I did have a great virtual onboarding experience though."
132,Atlassian,The best place ever!,2021-04-15,5.0,Senior Data Scientist,"The best culture I have seen or heard anywhere. Atlassian really lives its values. Tons of energy and optimism all around. Very humble, down to earth people. I have nothing but great experience so far!","Very hierarchical. There are probably 7 levels for people managers! M3 - M10
I wish the structure was more flat."
133,Atlassian,IT sucks,2021-09-30,1.0,Do Not Wish to Disclose,"Share price is good
Work from anywhere is a bonus","No vision
Too many short term illogical plans 
Unfruitful work assigned"
134,Atlassian,The best place to work,2021-01-26,5.0,Data Scientist,"The company culture is the real thing. The values are important, and it's hard to find a person here who doesn't try to work according to those values. In three years, I can count on one hand the number of people I've met who I was not happy about working with. 

Not only are the people nice, they are smart. They will make you better at your job. They will tell you when you are wrong, usually in the most respectful way possible. I would not love my job if I didn't work with people I like and highly respect.

The business is extremely strong. Atlassian sells inexpensive, good products to millions of people on a subscription model. Even if some disaster hit, it would take a long, long time for the business to actually fail. It is one of the best positioned businesses in tech. The founders are rock solid. They seem to be very sharp but still open to others' ideas, as they should be.

People are paid well. I don't believe it's the best pay, but it's certainly competitive. It would always be nice to have a number that no one else could match, but I have yet to find the company that would be as good to work for and pay the same.

People are treated well. The leadership and HR teams bend over backwards to make sure people are happy. It's probably a smart business decision, but not one that you see many companies take. I don't think the perks are over the top, but I'd rather have the people running things truly care about creating a good place to work than have the best catered lunches. The perks are excellent, especially if you think outside of the Silicon Valley bubble.

That's a good note to end on. Atlassian was created to be a good place to work, for Mike and Scott. As they grew, it was centered on being a good place for new people to work. To this day, employee well being is consistently prioritized, and it's a guiding principle in business decisions. That employee focus has paid off for Atlassian, in terms of finding and retaining people you want to work with.","It's a big company. At this scale, there are communication issues and some of the work is not as exciting as it might have been 10 years ago. So far, the company has done a surprising job of sticking to the original values, but it is going to continue to be a herculean task to stay on course with 5,000, then 10,000 people.

The offices are giant open concepts, which look beautiful but they are difficult to work in for a lot of people. Fortunately, everyone has been able to work remotely throughout the pandemic, and many people will never be required to work full time from an office."
135,Atlassian,Overall Pretty Good,2021-01-17,4.0,Senior Software Developer,Pretty open company and cross-team knowledge sharing and collaboration is common. No silos here. A lot of different areas of the company to work on and they're friendly to filling positions with internal candidates. Modern tech stacks and best practices used in many places means you'll stay up to date with what's industry leading. Time allocated for pet projects and innovation. Great benefits and overall culture.,"Open culture to the point of it being a con at times. Be prepared to hear all about people's personal beliefs in the workplace and not just at the proverbial water cooler. Internal developer platform constantly sending out ""breaking changes"" notices. A lot of contractors in some teams (especially a con when they build a service then get switched out by the contracting company). A lot of comfortable middle management."

141,Atlassian,Great company culture but toxic team,2020-12-31,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Atlassian offers great perks and has a great company culture, encourages open company and no bs. Most of the Atlassians with longer tenure are very open and transparent. This is a rare quality comparing other companies I've seen or previously worked for. Atlassian is definitely my top choice. Founders are awesome and truly care about employees' wellbeing. I would want to continue working for Atlassian if the company culture doesn't change.",Some of the new members joining in the recent two years are very un-Atlassian and unethical. There are a lot of dirty plays behind the scene. It's exhausting and worrisome. Not sure if I want to stay in such an environment.
142,Atlassian,"Great culture, not product led",2019-10-22,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"+ This is the only company I know that actually lives its values. That is pretty amazing. That said, this is changing. 
+ Could be an amazing place to grow your career, they are growing rapidly and if you can ride the way, in a short time you can be moving up the proverbial ladder 
+ Australia (if you visit)","- The blogging culture - it is a culture about writing, and 'showing' something has been done. This worked really well when Atlassian was small, and works well for transparency - but it feels like it take a blog to get anything done. If its not blogged about its not real. Keep this in mind, for you to succeed here, you will need to blog and build a brand for yourself internally through it.  
- It is not a product-led company, it is founder led company. This means the major strategy decisions are done from the top. There are exceptions to this rule, i.e. Jira Service Desk came up from a hackathon 
- Atlassian is amazing at marketing process, playbooks, Jira etc, but they do not use it the way it was intended. Do not look at the material and think they have things figure out, if anything its worse on the inside, BUT there is ""appetite ""to improve. There is no standardization across teams, which has its pros /cons."

147,Atlassian,"In the crazy world of tech, this is one of the better companies out there",2020-01-28,5.0,Product Marketing Manager,"My views are based on my experience at different tech startups to SMBs (and now Atlassian) in the Bay Area.

+ Culture here is generally a really positive one. The values are not just lip-service; they are lived.
+ Except for our quarterly earnings calls, I never see presentations about the bottom line. They are all about how can we do better by our customers and stakeholders. It's probably a different story in channel and field ops meetings, but as someone in marketing I find this unusual and refreshing.
+ I genuinely like pretty much everyone I come into contact with here. Great people.
+ Good work life balance. 
+ Kick-ass office with nice amenities, workout room, rooms for parents, reflection room, massage chairs, bar, etc.","- We're not afraid to pivot, which inevitably means whiplash. It's not as extreme as a startup, but it still happens. Lots of org changes.
- I'm told our base pay is not as competitive as other companies in the valley. Between the rest of our benefits and the great work-life balance, it's enough to keep me comfortable and happy.
- I haven't seen any blatant examples of ageism, but I have noticed that everyone on my team and most people on adjacent teams are within 10 years of each other. FWIW."

* Lots of autonomy
* Very flexible schedule

215,Atlassian,Searching for a company like this my entire career,2020-06-30,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"People, the TEAM focus, Remote Support, Learning opportunities and the drive to always improve processes and candidate experience.",Nothing bad to mention! I love this company and my TEAM.
216,Atlassian,Support Team (Customer Success) does not share same values as overall company,2020-09-18,1.0,Senior Manager,"Company culture is good, maintains a collaborative spirit. Very engaging staff that is always happy to help others. CEOs seem to genuinely care about their teams, even forced the entire company to be work from home during Covid before it became the standard and declared that the choice would be the employee's in the future.
Good benefits, 401(k) matching, decent salaries, good medical coverage","All of the cons here are related to the Support (Customer Success) teams
Support team does not have the same culture as the rest of the company
Support Senior Leadership has a “do what I say, not what makes sense” attitude
Does not do collaboration well, despite making the software that supports remote collaboration
Support leadership fails to keep up with rest of the company from a behavior and teamwork standpoint (As an example, support teams were required to be in the office over the holiday break, being the only people still in the office when everyone else was remote during that time (pre-Covid))
Places roadblocks to promotion quoting “policy”, internal promotion system is slow
Highly qualified persons are passed over for a role and end up training external hires over them despite being “prepped” for the same role
Company has grown beyond the scale of the software they make leading to issues and workarounds that slow down productivity
Support team training consists of the same materials available to customers, it's mostly reading a bunch of articles. Very little actual investment in up-skilling their technical teams
The other reviews that call out the Jira team experience are accurate but not limited to that team
Interview process is extremely slow and not transparent, this is uniwe to support in my experience as other teams move much more rapidly and are able to make decisions at a reasonable pace and move forward, while support lags behind consistently"

218,Atlassian,Atlassian is unlike any company I've ever worked for,2019-10-31,5.0,Senior Product Marketing Manager,"This company is growing so quickly, and there is a ton to do!  There are so many challenges for you to solve, some of the biggest challenges you can solve in a career.  And that makes it exciting.  But what's even better is that Atlassian really gives its employees the room to solve those tough challenges.

More than any company I've ever been at, Atlassian tries really hard to take all of the pressures that might prevent you  from being effective.  From the benefits, to the food, to the healthcare, the pay, etc.  It's an amazing experience.

The employees are some of the smartest people I've ever worked with, and it's an absolute pleasure to come to work every single day.

Of course, this could be a ""new job honeymoon"" - but every one I talk to, who's been here for many years, feels the exact same way still.  


Everyone is working really hard - and don't get me wrong, it's not like we're all putting in 10 hour days, every day, or anything.  But it's when we are working, we're working hard, intelligently, fast, effective, and efficient.

And the best part of the business? our company values (look them up) - we live and breathe them every day.","Growing pains.  

Another pro of Atlassian is we're always trying to disrupt ourselves, before our competitors do.  But, that can sometimes cause maybe some confusion, or disconnect, or have a lack of clarity - but, that's okay.  Because if we didn't do it to ourselves, our competitors would. 


I want to address one ""con"" I've seen in other reviews - and that's the pay.  I think the pay is ""fair"" or ""average"" for the bay area.  But what you have to really look at is the total compensation (normally I wouldn't say this, but this time I do).  The free food, the free healthcare, the stocks, the health stipend, the commuter benefits, etc..."

I can work from home when I want to or go into the NYC office which is awesome to have the choice when the commute is 3 hours round trip. The NYC office always has great food and drinks available and a lot of fun events to attend including in office yoga classes, supper clubs that explore NYC, and team building events when other offices visit. Everyone who I've worked with personally has been incredibly smart and helpful, I'm consistently impressed with my colleagues. There's a lot of great resources for learning and growing as a developer including a very fair size budget to travel and go to conferences with. Not only do I get to enjoy my day to day life at work but I get to enjoy more out of life with the pay and benefits they offer including compensation for my yoga classes and bike and incredible health benefits (the best I've had in my life and I have a chronic back issue so this is a big one for me!) I agree with the company's values and have been more than encouraged to give back through donating time and money through the company to some charities doing great things.

243,Atlassian,This company actually lives by the values they promote,2015-02-24,5.0,Senior Support Engineer,"If you go to the company web site you will no doubt see the ""Our Values"" section.  In most companies this is just more BS internal marketing but not at Atlassian!  I started working here in Dec 2014 and while it has only been 3 months I can say that the values they advertise are absolutely the values that they follow in the day to day operations of the company.

In my 25 year career in IT I have never worked for or with a better group of people.  I love coming to work!  I love taking cases and helping our customers!

Benefits:  Insurance Paid. The last time I worked for a company that paid for my health insurance completely was in 1989 - 1994!!  Vision and Dental, Paid!!!

Perks:  To many to mention but catered lunches, parties, working with great people, learning and growth opportunities, subsidized parking or train, and a lot more!

Need more convincing, how about profitable company for 12 years!  How about explosive growth (Austin office went from 6 or 7 transplants in spring 2014 to over 130 employees in Feb 2015!!!","None.  I love coming to work, I love the people I get to work with, I love the customers (how many support engineers can say that?)  I do make a little less than I made before but I actually take home more because of the fully paid insurance."

- I'm trusted to do my job; I have enormous flexibility over where/when/how I work. 
- The company and its values really mean something to the vast majority of employees - as a whole, people believe in Atlassian, our values, and the products we make. Sounds cheesy, but shoot... it's nice to care. 
- Very, very little email. 
- Great benefits package, competitive salary, lots of office perks.","- It's occasionally overwhelming to have a constant stream of opinions from everyone, including people who lack full context and are speaking up anyway.
- It's easy to work too much/too hard, because there's just an enormous amount of work that needs to be done and things move at a fast pace. You have to set boundaries (and you can).  
- The sheer volume of information/communication shared in the company in a day is mind-boggling. If you try to keep up with it, you'll drown. You have to find the right volume and channels and make peace with ignoring the rest."

Large kitchens and tons of perks.,"Because the company thrives on data, it even uses it to micromanage. New managers have little to no understanding of the products their team supports making review time more of a tutorial for the manager.

252,Atlassian,Fantastic place for a Salesperson,2019-09-03,5.0,Sales,Atlassian is an open company focused on doing what is best for the customer. Great products & support to service our customers well.,"The no-negotiation on pricing & terms is often hard to work with, and the contracts are very pro-customer which helps."
253,Atlassian,Hipchat SRE Review,2017-03-26,5.0,Senior Site Reliability Engineer,"It's a small, close-knit team with a mix of projects we handle independently and collaboratively across a large space.

Our team lead knows that his role is to make the team reliable and available.  That empowers the engineers to do the same for the services with which we are working.  Those services make Hipchat function.

You will never cease to find a new technology challenge to learn.  There is half a floor of software engineers you're working with day to day.  Everyone of them are working to deliver new features or services, and you're working with them from an SRE perspective.  That means you have to learn  as fast as they do...all of them.

If you are unhappy with something, speak up.  Management will listen.  It may be a slow process to effect change, but you can effect change if you are persistent enough.","This is not a job for the faint of heart.  This is a job for someone who loves learning constantly, who has the self confidence to work as an independent operator or as part of the team in a group effort.

SRE within Atlassian is only a couple years old.  In a way this is a con since there's a long road ahead to get to where we want to be.  But if you read this and felt inspired...well...I have to ask why you haven't applied yet.

There is tons of technical debt to be paid down."

Thought leadership, when shared, is generally good quality and a source of pride.","Cosign many of the points made by the January 2 reviewer: Atlassian is great at bringing in motivated, quality talent and letting those folks languish. There is limited opportunity for upward mobility, and where it is present, your options are to work for a brand-new manager promoted out of seniority (hit or miss), or a transplant from a traditional enterprise software company whose cultural-fit section of the interview must have gotten cut short (sure miss). 

The HR team (I refuse to call them Talent, since they clearly do not see employees as such) is among the least reliable/responsive I've ever seen. To call them tone-deaf would be an understatement. Valid complaints around gender discrimination and hostile work environment are brushed off; the constant refrain of ""look at the perks we offer"" to questions around pay scale was once funny and is now just insulting. What perks?"
261,Atlassian,Worst job of my life.,2014-11-12,2.0,Customer Advocate,"The company itself has some strong points, hence the 2 stars and not a 1 star rating. They have the kind of fun atmosphere you would expect from SF tech companies, beer in the kitchen and ping pong competitions at lunch, free lunches and paid volunteer opportunities.","But on the flip side, they lack a level of professionalism that one might hope for at any job. I don't mean the stuffy suit and tie feeling of large corporations or financial institutions, rather a sense of leadership and respect that helps careers to grow and smart talented people to stick around. I left because the particular team I was on had fired their manager and spent months in meetings that devolved into screaming and swearing on a regular basis to try and tackle the issue of how to handle the workload. There was no consensus on the correct approach and no strong leaders to step in and implement any judgement or experiential foresight. But in the time since I have left, I've known many others to also take the leap to new and exciting opportunities and each time, I have heard them talk of the bitterness of their departure in the same ways in which I felt when I left. Atlassian is just not the top company it portrays itself to be.  Two thumbs down."
262,Atlassian,World-class Experience!,2017-08-29,5.0,Marketing,"At Atlassian I sometimes hear my co-workers say that they are ""doing some of the best work of their lives."" I truly believe this, and have experienced it myself. The company has a remarkably distinct and powerfully positive culture, and the leadership teams truly lives the values. Here's what I enjoy the most:

- Values driven culture, no BS, and inspiring mission
- High trust environment where I feel empowered 
- Frequent, high-quality communication (weekly company meetings)
- Incredible growth with kick-ass products
- Great lunches, snacks, and events","Global footprint  (US, Australia, Europe) makes working across timezones a bit tricky at times."
263,Atlassian,A potentially great company going through growing pains,2014-11-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Atlassian, like a lot of the other SF bay area startups, has a lot of great perks – fun atmosphere, great office, stocked drinks, and food. They also have a lot of dedicated and smart people working there that makes coming into work fun. Besides the ubiquity of JIRA, I first heard about the company from a TED Talk several years ago (Dan Pink on Motivation – look it up, it's good) and wanted to work there ever since.","In a way, I felt like I was the victim of a bait and switch, and it seems like this is because it's a big company acting like a small startup. I interviewed for one role, and was offered something else, which I had accepted thinking that it would be just as good and similar. What I had found was a team going through transition – people leaving and management being replaced, and a project starting to come apart at the seams. To be honest, I should have asked more about the role before accepting it.

Atlassian is going through growing pains, just as much as any other successful company in the SF bay area. You can gather this by also looking at the Cons of other reviews (even positive ones) – lack of career development, seemingly disorganized management., etc."
264,Atlassian,"Great company: opportunity, people, talent and culture",2018-09-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'm a mid-career engineering manager with experience at a couple of startups and several of the big tech companies (Google, Adobe, Microsoft). Atlassian has talent as good as the best of those companies (e.g. Google) and has done a better job of keeping a collaborative culture.  The scale (currently ~3500) is large enough that there are a range of interesting projects and there is plenty of opportunity for career growth, but the company hasn't yet started to feel like a big company.  Very little beaucracy, and no BS.  On that last point, it's really been a great experience working for an Australian company -- there's an honesty and freshness that permeates the company culture that I haven't seen in any of the silicon valley companies.","For more senior folks, timezones may be a challenge -- there are several engineering teams that are split between Sydney and the Bay area."

* Some great people at the worker level","This review is mostly about the Bitbucket section of Atlassian.

* Like in most big companies,  there are are good and bad divisions.  One of the bad ones is Bitbucket.  Stay far away!

 * The culture has become toxic.  There are a lot of unhappy staff.  Morale is very low.  In the past it was a lot better, but now the division no longer cares about preserving the culture that made the company great, or following the ""Atlassian values"".

* This division has a lot of issues with management.  They couldn't hire any engineering team managers for a long time.  A lot of the ones they ended up with are terrible.  There's been nearly a 100% turn over in product management.  And two senior division managers recently left.

* Pay is below market rates.  In the past, the work culture and people were meant to make up for that.

* Microsoft recently bought Github, the major competitor to Bitbucket.  Bitbucket is already a distant second in market share.  Bitbucket won't be able to compete against Microsoft's money and resources.

* San Francisco offices are in a sketchy area - multiple staff members have been robbed, assaulted, or harassed going to/from work or at lunch."
268,Atlassian,"Great culture, but that's not everything sometimes...",2015-09-09,4.0,Project Manager,Great culture! Great benefits! Great people! No Politics! Great Founders! Great location & office! Flexible schedules!,"Not enough praise. Too many critics. Too much open talk about women in tech and sexuality in the workplace than is needed, creates an uncomfortable place to talk about your opinion. Culture is not everything. Nobody is really on the same page. So many different things, and some alike, happening at the time and teams and even people within the same team are not aligned. Too much information on CAC and not clean to be able to sort and know what is accurate and/or what is important. The global aspect is hard to adjust when your team is throughout 4-5 different offices on complete opposite time zones. There is a lack of communication, which is hard to believe when everything is on CAC, but it's not easy to digest. People tend to use EAC as the method communication and forgot how valuable face to face meeting are and how effective they are. Along the lines of communication, setting expectations is the lack of and often times can you bite you in the but, but that might just be my team because I actually don't think that aligns with our company values."
269,Atlassian,Amazing work/life balance. Great work,2019-07-02,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Amazing leadership - my direct supervisor is here to help me succeed
Fantastic perks - food, vacation, benefits, emergency childcare coverage
Work/Life balance - time off when I need it for whatever reason, without guilt
Great work - I love what I do and that I'm supported to go out on a whim and try new things without risk",Work can be slow - because it's an open company there can sometimes be too many people that need/want to be included in a project and it takes longer than needed
