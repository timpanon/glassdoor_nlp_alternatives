0,Autodesk,Putting their people first always ! Amazing culture and team spirit,2021-10-11,5.0,Ops Manager,Additional company holidays last year and this year. Great support during pandemic. Putting the team first and ensuring empathy and support for Covid related stress. Culture is fantastic... best company I have worked for.,Work from home country could be longer
1,Autodesk,Overall Good Internship Experience,2022-03-30,5.0,Student,Good people especially the team members,Sometimes directions might not be very clear for interns
2,Autodesk,Autodesk has a lot of potential but fails to live up to the hype,2022-03-28,2.0,People Manager,"- Work/life balance
- Great people on the ground who care about their work and the people around them 
- Management can be good depending on your organization
- We were well supported during the pandemic","- Constant re-organization of departments with little insights or transparency into how it impacts the teams getting moved around 
- Leadership above the people managers do not care about employees in any meaningful way 
- There is a lot of lip service from the C staff around valuing teams and people that does not translate into day-to-day life at Autodesk 
- People managers are not able to effectively reward team members who work hard
- Promotions are slow to come, if at all
- Lack of clear direction on how to grow and improve or move to a new team
- Leadership is always turning over and with each new leader comes a change of direction which leaves employees feeling unsure of what we're actually doing
- The company uses a lot of legacy software or overly customized software that can make simple tasks challenging to complete 
- Each purchase of a new company leads to splintered off business practices that don't integrate well with already existing systems and processes"
3,Autodesk,Just another old corporate company at the end of the day,2022-03-18,3.0,Anonymous,"Autodesk is an ethical, humble, and good place. The current CEO is smart, transparent, and human. Work life balance is strong. This is a great place to get your start, take a break between faster-paced jobs, or retire.","It is almost impossible to get promoted. There are no initiatives for employee retention, and there is a huge pay gap between incoming and existing workers. Autodesk isn’t a top tech company, so it doesn’t attract top talent. This also means it tolerates mediocrity; it’s very hard to get fired here. Team culture and leadership is dependent on department."
4,Autodesk,Love this company,2022-01-27,4.0,Customer Success Advisor,"Work-life balance, competitive and fair pay, great stock program, fairly good vacation policy (3 weeks + week of rest + 6 week sabbatical at 4 years ie: only complaint is it's not 4 weeks + week of rest).","This is the only reason they have four stars from me. They carry a very liberal mindset and indoctrination when it comes to Covid. If you're like that, this would be a pro. But for a company that touts inclusivity, they are not inclusive of those who have chosen a natural route of handling Covid as apposed to the vaccine. They disparage such employees even to the point of threatening employment (although thankfully for me it has only remained as a threat). Such work environment has made it less enjoyable to work here when one thing is touted and a very different thing is practiced, and it is disappointing.

Another Con would be their career advancement opportunity really looks at predominately Autodesk experience. So if you get into the wrong department, it becomes a very tedious journey of climbing the proverbial ladder to get anywhere, even if with past experience you are more qualified than half the people of a job ""two rungs up."""
5,Autodesk,Consistently poor management,2022-03-28,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"It's an easy job, with minimal pressure. Most coworkers are genuinely kind, smart, and enjoyable to work with. My direct managers have all been good.","The upper management in M&E has made repeated mistakes during my employment. Layoffs of extraordinary engineers, managers, PMs while keeping the less talented folks like me around; acquisitions of companies that do nothing to further our goals... all of this while telling transparent lies to justify the mistakes or failing to communicate them altogether. I've found out that people I worked with regularly were laid off by having emails / slack messages bounce."
6,Autodesk,Good Large Company,2022-03-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a bigger company, but they do seem to care about employees. Andrew (CEO) is great.","Salary comp is a bit of a challenge. They try to make it up with RSUs, but the stock is down (like most other places)."
7,Autodesk,"Innovative, Growing and Positive, but also Siloed and Slogging through internal transition",2022-03-25,4.0,"Sr. Manager, Operations","Autodesk produces products you can be proud of and is committed to making an impact for customers and on the world around us.  Autodesk works hard to be ethical and takes extra steps to 'walk the talk'.  Autodesk makes the tools that people use to design and make.... well, everything.  Internally, that's a source of genuine pride.  

From an employee perspective, Autodesk tries very hard to treat people with respect, adhere to its published values and - when push comes to shove, STICK to those values... unlike some other Bay Area companies that might be more willing to compromise their stated values (e.g.: 'don't be evil' ..... ).  

Autodesk is in the midst of a huge transition:  from perpetual license to subscription, from desktop to cloud, from narrow function applications to end-to-end integration, from a loose collection of complementary point products to platform company.  It's interesting, but also exhausting, don't even think of interviewing here if you honestly regard your work-ethic as anything but ""HIGH"" and ""Driven"".  It can be very rewarding, the over-all strategy makes sense and progress toward those mid-term and long-term goals is undeniable.  Autodesk does not just talk.... we DO.

All-in, if you are smart, talented, hard-working and really give a damn about what your work contributes to, Autodesk may be fore you.","Autodesk is 40 years old and going through a mid-life transformation.  Every infrastructure system is in transformation; products are at various stages of their transition to Cloud enablement, and the drive to be a platform company is ( finally ) real this time.  Entry-level positions do a lot of transaction volume and there's some question about whether compensation is competitive.  Mid-level positions work relentlessly - that's driven both by the internal pace of change as well as business growth - be prepared.  There are politics at play in Director-level and above; and it's an internal joke that 'nothing is guaranteed but death, taxes and Autodesk re-organizations'.  the Alphabet soup of Org acronyms coupled with the reorganization of the quarter makes it tough to know who does what.  As Autodesk has grown it has become more corporate, and it's easy to play ""Buzzword Bingo"" with the Org announcements and scope changes.  Product divisions don't understand the infrastructure that runs the company, and are the worst communicators I've ever seen in terms of sharing their product plans with the upstream and downstream groups who will bear the workload of their decisions.  The customer experience is complex, and end customers frequently become frustrated but the experience of simply accessing and managing their software investments.  The company has a habit of doing 3X yearly employee surveys but does not always honestly assess what employees are telling them, and it feels like Autodesk will put more effort into 'spinning' the survey results than addressing the raised issues.  H.R. support is weak after a recently departed H.R. V.P. gutted the department and tried to turn it into a ticket-driven, self service support function and I doubt those folks have time to breathe.  Still, every company has challenges and Autodesk's heart is in the right place.  We're on a journey to be better, and that's made tougher by the span and rate of change, as well as the rapid growth of recent years - but things are trending up."

14,Autodesk,Good benefits and work if you are in the right team and you are under 40,2022-03-10,3.0,Principal Software Engineer,"Good benefits including unlimited vacations, equitable distribution of RSUs, ESPP, $1000 towards wellness benefits, healthy employer contribution towards healthcare. Great inclusive work culture. Great diversity initiatives. Remote work friendly.","Autodesk operates as a large corporation with many underlying orgs and projects that fight for relevance. They constantly change priorities which tends to mean a lot of instability for developers/staff. Losing relevance equates to layoffs. Gaining relevance equates to promotions and higher priority. At the start of each calendar year, upper management assigns a priority number to each project. If the project you are on slides down the priority list, you will eventually get laid off and your position get transferred to a higher priority project regardless of your inherent talent. 

Autodesk is not good at retaining and moving talent within their org. Sometimes you'll see layoffs and hirings at the same time for the same type of positions! They prefer to hire externally. This is also a way they get rid of more expensive, senior staff in favor of younger talent graduating from college. The word they use is 'redundant' to get rid of people around January about every 2 years. They are not great at forecasting resource needs to prevent the redundancy in the first place.

Autodesk tends to also have a high turnover. Most of their employees are new as of the last few years. They have trouble retaining talent.

All this said, it's still a stimulating place to work if you don't stick to one position more than 3-4 years. Jump to different projects internally (you'll have to re-interview) to avoid getting stuck in a project that loses priority. All projects, outside of the big ones, will eventually lose priority. 

The employees that have been around decades did so by anticipating which projects are on the rise and downfall and strategically jumping ship to the next shining ball while also building an internal network to help them.

The pay is good but not on the level of FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Netlfix, Google, Amazon,etc..)."
15,Autodesk,A company that cares about it's employees.,2022-02-14,5.0,User Experience Designer,"Autodesk has been very fair in the months of Covid regarding flexibility for all employees.

The business changes moving towards a SAAS model are partly to blame, but it can be very frustrating to learn all the nuance at Autodesk. From a sales job point of view, I would call it very detail oriented for this reason.

The majority of employees are friendly and willing to help.","When I began working at Autodesk I was told that your happiness greatly depends on your manager. While my time at Autodesk was great to begin with, my team became increasingly toxic during the pandemic with a new director that asked for too much from the team, and increasing hostility, bullying, and manipulation from my manager. The team was expected to work long hours including early mornings and late nights, there was no recognition or career growth opportunities, and the pandemic further intensified discontinuity among the team.

The upper leadership do care about its people which was demonstrated even more during the pandemic. Autodesk did everything it can, plus more, to accommodate and help its employees during the pandemic.","It has grown so fast that some divisions may have become to arrogant. It seems more difficult to enter into different roles internally compared with someone coming outside. Hiring managers in most cases, already have people in mind to fill open roles that the interview process may just be a waste of time. 

My advice is to expand and build your network. If you are shy or hope that opportunities will just be handed to you out of pure hard work, you will certainly be left out. I have seen people with little or no experience move to new roles because they have a good network of people who are willing to give them a shot. It is a fact!

It talks a lot about Diversity and Inclusion - it is great at a higher level but once it trickles down to different teams, it becomes a hypocrisy."

The culture code of being able to speak up (be brave) hasn't penetrated well into GPS.
The most challenging part is compensation. Bonuses are great, raises, not so much. So the longer you work there, the farther you fall behind. And almost every year there is some sort of reorg and oddly it occurs right before your performance review. I've had twice as many managers than the number of years at Autodesk.

Autodesk has a monopoly in their industry so they spend money on lots of random things that make the environment and company feel plush. 

Good place to do individual work but you do not want to be in management, or try to learn it there.","The politics are sharky----upper managers and the exec team are more focused on looking good than delivering value. The marketing-background CEO got his job by selling Wall Street a cloud and construction industry story that pumped up the stock price. The culture of looking good vs. doing good permeates.
 
Autodesk does not innovate, it grows entirely through acquisition. Acquired teams leave quickly or are shown the door. Comically, the CEO of Autodesk's biggest acquisition ever left in a year and on her LinkedIn claims she was the ""VP of Nothing""."

Leadership is there to help you meet the challenge. Very bright, inclusive, and people focused executive team.",Goals and expectations are high / stretch for the majority of sales reps. Multiple segmented sales & support teams as well as active resellers create extra work and complexities in many transactions. A lot of time spent dealing with aftermath of regular organizational changes & acquisitions and learning as they adopt new operational methodologies.

- HR is truly not on anyone's side. There were countless mistakes that hurt me and my team. I received my stock grant late, we were unable to hire a former intern despite having an open req for it, and we were unable to keep good performers because they wouldn't increase the budget for merit raises. 
- There is a sense that no one cares to get anything done. Leadership is just resting and vesting."

A very broad mix of products, ongoing acquisitions, a global presence and both direct and indirect sales makes Autodesk a very dynamic and interesting place to work.","People stay a long time and leadership relies heavily on that fact, so there isn't as much career growth as you might find elsewhere and salaries probably lag behind as well."

109,Autodesk,Where the talented few carry deadweight,2021-04-08,2.0,User Experience Engineer,The company has very nice offices and is financially stable.,"Autodesk is filled with deadweight at all levels of the company, and they survive off the innovation of a talented few. Ridiculous amounts of time and resources is wasted on internal politics that only serve to keep people feeling like they're accomplishing something. The company has a good mission, but most of the employees are running on a figurative hamster wheel going nowhere.

If you're a talented individual who has the desire and patience to play the corporate political game, you will thrive at Autodesk, because the company's deadweight will want to ride on your coattails. If you have little ability or talent, you can easily fake your way through an interview. There's no need to prove yourself afterwards, because they'll just hire more fakers to fill in the gaps. It's only a hop and skip away from the infinite monkey theorem.

This is baked into the company culture, and it seems to be working for them. I personally hate it, and will never return."
110,Autodesk,More Stars,2021-10-27,5.0,Customer Success Manager,They treat employees incredibly well. Listen and encourage feedback.,I don’t have any top of mind
111,Autodesk,Worst place I have ever worked,2021-07-14,1.0,Account Manager,"If you like politics and bro culture, this is the place for you.","I worked in this hell because they bought our startup and had to wait for them to vest. 

No career path in the ACS division, we all know the sales team will get diluted and channel parters will take the jobs. That’s what Autodesk does best. Buy startups and spit out the people working in them in small increments so they never make the news. 

The culture is bad, as they like to talk about diversity but don’t higher them cause apparently management doesn’t know how to interview them. Fact ! Comment I got when asked. 

I finally quit, and the HR proved me right that this company doesn’t care. Kati, worst HR . Who kept on getting defensive when I was trying to explain my side and why I quit. Sexism and no ownership of the management. If they are not hitting their target, they will though you under the bus.

If you are reading this and on the fence of quitting, do it now. It’s scary but it’s not worth your mental health."

There are decisions made that seem to directly go against what people want. 

Flexible policy put in place for the long term is barely flexible at all. If you are looking for a flexible place to work that allows more work-from-home than in office, Technical Support is not the right fit at Autodesk."

Within the past year there have been many changes as they restructure the org, and they have clearly demonstrated that they could not care less about their support staff. 

The rest of the company gets to work remotely if they choose to, but support specifically has a three day in-office requirement? We are clearly viewed as second class citizens, and no feedback is ever taken into account. Upper management claims they are listening and open to feedback, but all they do is nod and smile and nothing is done.

They are regimenting our daily schedules down to the minute with no flexibility and work/life balance is in the toilet. It is also making it impossible to help our customers the way they need and expect help."

I've worked with teammates who pushed me to become better at my job and others who criticized me behind closed doors. I've witnessed the organization as a whole take the right steps to address diversity issues and witnessed leadership dismiss sexual harassment charges. I've collaborated with extended teams who make the effort to understand my role and KPIs and people who bark orders and get snarky if you can't deliver on their unrealistic expectations. 

Know your values, what you can and cannot tolerate, and ask difficult questions in the interview process to make sure you're aligned.

They did a lot of awesome things to ensure that employees were connecting to the culture and living the mission and values. Throughout the pandemic, they've been very focused on employee well-being and it made me feel really valued as a whole human and not just a worker bee. 

Having a company mission that was rooted in making the world better gave me something to really be proud of. To be able to truly make an impact on the world and its future is something that's hard to find at other companies.","It's a big company with a lot of red tape. There are so many people that need eyes on everything that it really delays the process of deploying anything. 

One thing that I think about constantly with regards to my time at Autodesk is how much I feel like the system is not set up for people of color to succeed. The D&I team has put in tremendous effort towards inclusivity and belonging within the company and it does not go unnoticed. However, that's just one piece to feeling seen and heard within the company. The leaders who make decisions on promotions and merit increases are oftentimes not people of color and with them comes biases. Bias training is great and highly necessary, but if the people who have a seat at the table to make merit and promotion decisions don't put that training into action, who's going to hold them accountable? A lot of these decisions are made without a person of color having a seat at that table and it's very obvious when you look across the organization and don't see any diversity at the top. Instead, you see diversity at the individual contributor level. It makes me question whether or not people of color can see their career grow at Autodesk."

Standards are incredibly low here. Besides Autodesk, I've never been at a company where a project lead can ignore all correspondence for months and still be employed.","This primarily pertains to the Brand Content & Socially Media (BCSM), formerly known as Content Marketing & Social Media (CMSM) team. If you are interviewing with this team, run. ""Leadership"" (Leadership is in quotes because he is a leader only in title as the head of this team, he is not an actual leader by any means - I wouldn't trust him to lead a wildfire through California). Please join this team if any of the below apply to you:
- If you want to work for a team led by someone who has no idea what he's doing and what he wants for the team. This team is led by someone who literally takes two years to change the team name from Content Marketing and Social Media to Brand Content and Social Media then back to Content Marketing and Social Media then again back to Brand Content and Social Media...first of all is a complete waste of time and resources but image trying to work on projects as he dilly dallies and changes his mind whenever he pleases.
-If you want to work for a ""leader"" who says he cares about diversity and inclusion but has 4 people of color on a team of 25+ (to achieve this in the Bay Area is near impossible given the makeup of the city and the technology industry), has hired and promoted zero people of color over 2.5 years, has never attended a employee resource group meeting, and says to ""just be happy"" when a person of color voices concern about inclusivity for minorities on the team. 
-If you want to work for a ""leader"" who says he cares about team morale and his individual team members but cancels one on ones at the last minute 5 times before actually meeting and wishes his employee happy birthday on a card meant to congratulate said employee for the birth of a child. When the company survey shows that employee satisfaction on his team is way below average quarter over quarter for multiple years, instead of figuring out a way to address and fix the issue himself, he outsources to lower level employees on his team to create, lead, and implement solutions that, surprise surprise, never result in anything. The theme here is all talk, no walk.
-If you want to work for a ""leader"" who asks his employees to cancel a paid corporate subscription to a project management system and create a new account with a fake gmail to save money from his budget when he works for a company that sells software subscriptions

This portion applies to Autodesk as a whole:
-Besides Andrew's sponsorship of the Autodesk Black Network, it's clear that most of leadership does not care about diversity and inclusion. There are supposedly initiatives in place to increase diversity and inclusion but nothing has really come of it. The company presented that they increased hiring of women and minorities by X% but when asked more detailed questions about how many of those women were women of color and how many of those positions were leadership positions, the team in charge responded that they can't provide that data."

Mentorship is scattered and it's easy to get lost in the shuffle, your career gets stunted.

Not as flashy as other tech companies (you still have to do your own dry cleaning lol). 

Lack of transparency whenever layoffs are about to happen (about every 12-15 months over 5 years I was there, and eventually my role was affected).

There is a great focus on equality at all levels of the org. Andrew, the CEO, is well-spoken, honest, and has shown that he does care about everyone working at Autodesk.

Benefits are nice (in the USA, at least).

The company mission is clear and potentially world-changing. The shift from license keys to named user was executed wonderfully; it's still amping up in terms of profits. The next move into the Make aspects of the world from the existing Design ones is simple to understand at a high level, and Autodesk has provided ample evidence that it is the right move to make.

Our customers build amazing things with our products. Fusion 360 is like magic (and I don't even work on it). Seeing the jaw-dropping stuff that we make possible is hugely rewarding.","Crazy politics. No pressure to deliver.

People hold nearly all senior positions with 10-20 years of tenure. Historical baggage undercuts trust between groups, even when only 2-3 people were present for it. I've had the statement ""well, three CEOs ago..."" said to me an embarrassing number of times by people wanting to block an idea or tell me why it won't work.

Everyone wants to build something cool with no regard to its usefulness or need. This again undercuts trust. There are numerous internal products and services that are well-engineered and don't do anything you want them to. Since adoption is understandably low for these things groups, resort to executive-level dictates that XYZ must be used, further detaching them to build something people want as it now required anyways.

The company is 5-10 years behind the curve in terms of the Cloud. It's pretty normal to see a 10 page White Paper published internally explaining or pushing for technology or pattern that has been industry standard for years already. Workloads were lift-and-shifted to AWS, and some account reps likely got to buy personal islands with how much we spent doing it.

Autodesk's growth strategy is via acquisitions (this is not bad in and of itself). Somehow they don't have a playbook on how to integrate them still (there have been over 70 as of this writing). This leads orgs to be fragmented as the tech stacks, platforms, tools, and processes of those individual companies continue to exist for years after the buy. The plethora of systems means confusion, poor standardization, and lots of poorly maintained solutions for teams.

I had a coach (provided by Autodesk) tell me that many of his Autodesk clients hold out until there is a reorg if they are unhappy. Groups are reorganized frequently enough that it usually only takes a few months. There are a ton of people coasting here. Putting in minimal effort, knowing there is no pressure to deliver. Coming from a startup, it's like progress hitting a wall.

The Security and Compliance groups have created poor cultures throughout the company. The reasons are too long to list here. TL;DR they are policing units that take no efforts in improving security products to their specific needs. Everything is a generic check box that often conflicts or has a considerable gray area when viewed through a specific product lens. They have no authority for punishment and chose not to build tooling that features teams want or need. In the end, they are mean and nagging to get teams to do as they want."

296,Autodesk,Good company but I hit a bad team,2019-11-11,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Location, benefits, workspace, equipment, work-life balance","- Project scope, language and framework was changed right after I started

- Old and crufty codebase with poor documentation, inconsistent code style rules (mix of semicolons and non-semicolons in a js project), inconsistent file structure

- Manager once told me to get back to work after I spent 8 minutes in Slack chat discussing the pros and cons of a few terms related to testing; got told that I should be coding but had been told that I needed to be more collaborative 5 minutes earlier in the conversation. Typical ""read my mind"" sort of criticism from that manager. 

- Manager seemed surprised that I posted a Confluence doc about the vertical whitespace rules that I and 2 team members agreed on. The project was many years old and no one had written down style rules. Manager said ""I thought all languages wanted zero whitespace"". I had no response to this, I was just flabbergasted. This is one of the most WTF statements I've ever heard from a manager. I told a colleague about it (someone with close to 20 years experience) and his response was one word: ""Run"".  For an example of vertical whitespace in a modern js project: see packages/react/src/React.js in the React github repo (not allowed to link it here) 

- Team member told me ""your question was innapropriate"" after I told them that the condescending response I got to a question was innapropriate. When someone tells you you are being inappropriate you don't say ""no, u"", that's rude. This team has issues."

318,Autodesk,They take care of their employees,2020-05-29,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Autodesk is a great company to work for. From the established, industry leading products to the cool offices to the smart, down to earth exec team--it's been a great experience so far. It's a huge company, but I never feel like a cog. Employees are given leeway to tackle big problems, and are rewarded for thinking outside the box. The company values and culture are more than kool-aid given to you during onboarding. ADSK consistently hires a smart, friendly, diverse group of employees who take pride in their work.

But what really pushed me to write this review is Autodesk's COVID-19 response. I've been so impressed by the level of support given to employees at this time. Bi-weekly webcasts with the CEO with a live Q+A, frequent and clear comms from leadership, WFH through the end of 2020, a WFH stipend, reasonable expectations around work-life balance, and no layoffs. Autodesk even took this time to EXPAND their employee stock grants to those who didn't yet have options. They are proving that they truly put employees first, and have the right leadership in place. It's nice to feel like your company is on your side.","Things can move a bit slowly and feel disjointed. If you aren't proactive, you can miss out on new processes and best practices that aren't always clearly communicated, and there's a steep learning curve when it comes to internal processes and language. 

While I've had positive experiences with my managers, some colleagues complain about a lack of mentorship or guidance from theirs. 

While Autodesk does value and pay individual contributors well, it seems difficult to move past a certain level of management unless you've been at the company for decades."

Current CEO seems good, no layoffs since he took over, which used to be every year.","Autodesk is a good company I have heard, but the things required of consulting project managers are often absurd, non-sensical, and mired in bureaucracy and politics, which is strange for such a small subset of the larger organization. It seems that here, project managers are the lowest of the low and get no respect. Priorities of all other groups seem to trump priorities of PMs. Director level management has historically been not-to-be trusted, and the level of Machiavellian maneuvering is mindboggling. There are a lot of cliques, and favoritism of unsavory types exists. Layoffs and bullies are not uncommon. Opportunities for advancement are quite limited."

Great company mission and empathetic leadership team, very proud to say I work for Autodesk.","Salary pay is way below market rate for SF, and it is very difficult to move up in the company. Many of the managers, directors, and VPs have been there for years and will continue to stay, so it is extremely difficult to grow. Another con is the constant reorgs. I have had 6 managers in the past three years - which may be another reason why it is so difficult to grow."

Employees fear for their jobs with so many reorgs.  Decisions made based on keeping their jobs rather than what is best for the company.  In the company's quest to look progressive - younger employees are often valued over older individuals with strong company knowledge and skillsets. The pendulum can often swing dramatically regarding company focus to the detriment of the most valuable products.  Some of the best talent has left the company in recent years due to new management.

People with terrible management skills manage people. You can’t complain to HR because they won’t do anything. I was constantly analyzed why I said this or that, and from day 1 I was told what areas I had to improve on. From day 1! It was very unwelcoming.  Your confidence is killed from the very beginning.

Honestly the work was too easy and I was used to working in startup and consulting environments and it was crazy that people were fighting over their projects so they had something to show for.  Middle manager has no clue how to do anything and once asked me to put slide deck on the value of my tasks (that she assigned me) so she can present to her manager. Credit stealing is rampant. It was a shame because I loved the product.

They claim to want to see you succeed, but when you tell them you need help or guidance from their vast set of experiences, they give you nothing.  Often times, you work in an information vacuum, and when you fail you get hammered.  If you succeed they treat you like a C student, especially if you're not in the ""in crowd.""

The pace is picking up, with the new CEO, but it is still a lifestyle company that allows flexibility for families or other life priorities.  While it is a company where you can build a long-term career (and many people have, there's a lot of loyalty), there is also a serious issue with lack of diversity at the leadership levels.  So, if you're a woman, or minority, you can expect to face many of the same hurdles in furthering your career as you would at other tech companies!  There is, however, a lot of change happening in HR and a push for more inclusive hiring practices and management techniques with the promise of shifting this over time.  The benefits are excellent.","Few women or minorities in leadership.  Big enough to be beaurocratic, but small enough to find good opportunities to shine and make a difference.

A core of true believers still remains, people who care about customers, products and each other.","The true believers are being swallowed up by a crowd of opportunists who are focused only on seeking political favor from senior leadership. Many of these opportunists barely know who their customers are and what they want.

A few years ago, Autodesk decided that it couldn't grow and compete by acquiring technology (it long ago gave up trying to innovate organically). Its new strategy, which has been increasingly visible over the past four years, has been to extract more money from customers who can't switch away easily from its products and to reduce costs by systematically cutting ""experienced"" employees, regardless of performance, and replacing them with interns and new hires. Of course, every company needs to turn over its skill base to stay relevant, but at Autodesk there is a pattern where low performing, highly paid but politically savvy employees are retained while higher performers are let go. What's worse, some of the new hires aren't always top performers (to be fair, some are excellent, but why settle for just some).

The environment has become increasingly political, and a company that has always struggled to listen to customers has become practically deaf to them at this point.

Oh, and the sabbatical seems like a cool idea, but when you compare it against a standard vacation policy it's not such a great deal."

Six week paid sabbatical every four years worked.
Unlimited sick time. 
The CEO and leadership truly care about diversity and inclusion, which is such a breath of fresh air when you look at companies like Google, Nike, and Uber that are struggling with diversity and harassment issues.
Very engaged employee resource groups. 
Employee stock rewards are very nice if you're at a high enough level to earn them.","The company is very siloed and it's hard to get things done with other teams don't want to work with you or have no incentive to help you.
HR has never had a very supportive model.
No mandatory and ongoing leadership training. Many people in senior leadership positions get the job because of time on the job, not because they have fantastic people leadership skills.

There's an internal policy that current employees cannot apply for jobs at a higher grade-level than their current grade-this is a real policy confirmed verbally by HR. 
Mediocrity and ineptitude run rampant and are rewarded and direct communication and innovative thinking are penalized. 
People stay here so long (many 10-25 years), which contributes to complacency and fear of change.  
Promotions come to people based on time-served and age rather than meritocracy. 
No directors under the age of 40 and lack of diversity (of any kind) in leadership positions. 
Lack of diversity contributes to homogeneous group-think, fear of innovation and avoidance of new technology.
Managers are more concerned with pleasing their managers than developing their staff and doing what's best for the company.

508,Autodesk,Losing Its Engineering Roots,2017-10-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Good snacks. Free food twice a week if you stand in line for 20 minutes. Located above a BART station.,"Highly political. Too many useless meetings. In my organization, our non-technical program management group has taken over. They are hell bent on implementing Agile SCRUM as the solution to all of our problems, real and perceived. It is a sign of a lack of trust in the engineering team to get something done. To make matters worse, it isn't fixing much of anything but we pretend like it is working because politics. I worry some of our agile champions will migrate to other parts of the company after proclaiming success, like a cancer slowly spreading until we have 40 hours of meetings every week.

Morale is down and many solid engineers openly daydream about leaving. The former co-CEO was considered an engineering guy and left - or was forced out - when he lost the CEO race. Current CEO is a nice guy but he was promoted from Chief Marketing Officer, further proving who calls the real shots at Autodesk. Hint: it's not the engineers anymore.

I can only give my perspective. The internal Autodesk Pulse surveys show a workforce of mostly happy people. It's hard to reconcile the positive survey results with the general atmosphere of my group."

The pay is good, the people you work with are fascinating, and  the perks are many. Work/life balance depends on your manager, but overall, there seems to be an effort to help people balance their work for their own situation. Every four years, you are eligible for a six-week sabbatical. Besides that, you get Christmas Eve through New Years Day off so you can focus on spending times with your loved ones. Working during vacations, sabbaticals, and the week of rest is generally frowned upon. Work from home is allowed. 

One of the coolest things about working with Autodesk is that you are empowering the people who will change the world. That's really cool when you think about it.","Autodesk is huge, so it may take some time to find the information (or person)  you are looking for. If you are self-motivated, you'll find what you are looking for. There are politics, sure, but if you have more than two people, you'll have politics. 

Some people check out once they walk in the office, which can be disheartening to see. This has a lot to do with their managers, and again, is part of human nature. That doesn't have to be your story."

Oh, and that folks can bring their dogs in to work...but most folks are much too busy to do so any more.","Salaries are so-so, not great, especially considering the long hours that are really needed to get our jobs done. Nice bennies package, though. Stock has basically been horizontal for several years, so, unless something changes drastically in the market, there's not much opportunity for earnings beyond salary and bonus (although the ESPP is decent).
Division reorganizations every year or so are an incredible waste of time and energy...seems like a low cost-benefit ratio, and a lot of wasted time.  Very Dilbert.
Reviews are now rather rigid here: 20% of people get an ""A"", 70% get a ""C"", and 10% get an ""F""...even if your whole group is stellar, or even if they are awful, 20% of them will get a great bonus and pay increase, and 10% will get neither. Guess the thing to do is make sure you join an under-performing group, then you'll have an easy time getting an ""A"". Seems like this could be handled with a little more finesse.
Most folks I know are just biding their time, waiting to escape from what was once a great company to work for.  We really miss Carol Bartz!"
519,Autodesk,Constant Flux & Stress,2019-04-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"GREAT product and open work environment.   There are no offices (other than meeting spaces), you could literally be sitting next to someone on the executive team on one side and an intern on the other.  The setup allows for open conversation between groups.   Autodesk provides lunch once a week and has beer on tap in the Boston office.  The BUILD Space is truly an amazing facility that full-time employees have access to.","Autodesk is in constant flux with layoffs and reorgs...  Every December and February everyone in the company stresses out about getting laid off.  If you are looking for long-term stability, Autodesk may not be the right fit.  There is no long-term planning or strategy (even 1 year out).  Everything seems to be ad-hoc and very disjointed.  Tons of silos that everyone talks about, but nobody acts upon.  The executive team has secret meetings and do not involve key stakeholders.  LOTS of meetings (even meetings to discuss next meetings topics - yes that's right).  Not a very good life/work balance due to the constant flux, last-minute projects, and deadlines.  Managers pick favorites and are by no means transparent -- despite what they tell you.  If you are looking at upward growth and mobility, your manager can break your career with Autodesk.  Management expects complete honesty and transparency from their team, but do not exemplify it themselves.  Oversharing could cost you your job -- especially if you upset someone."
