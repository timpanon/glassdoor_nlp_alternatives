0,Bain & Company,Great firm,2021-10-31,5.0,Associate Consultant,"Solid culture, really cooperative, a lot of feedback both down and up, Leadership cares for employees",All normal consulting cons around hours
1,Bain & Company,Looove working here!,2022-03-30,5.0,Manager Assistant,"They really do care about their employees and even though my role is completely remote, they make sure to make me feel included. What I love about working here is they allow you to explore within Bain..they want you to succeed within the company.",I do not have any cons so far
2,Bain & Company,Welcome to Bain,2015-10-05,5.0,Manager,"Welcome to Bain.  I'm going to give you a problem that neither the CEO nor his entire management team could solve.  And I'm probably going to give you lots of different opinions and imperfect data sources.  And then I'll ask you to focus in on where the most value is and convince all those people with different opinions that you're right.  But don't worry, I'm also going to give you a Bain team.  Those associates and consultants are going to be tenacious in coming up with creative approaches.  Those managers and partners are going to knock down barriers for you, connect you where you need to be connected, guide, support, direct and re-direct you.  The office support staff is going to fix your computer after you spilled coffee on it for the third time, find you the unfindable data source, and smile and hand you a baked good after you ask for help re-doing dozens of slides.  You are empowered and accountable but you are not alone.  And the best part is you can't fail.  Because after all, what all those people are reinforcing is that a Bainie never lets another Bainie fail.","Here's how you know you've made it at Bain.  The reward for doing a good job is getting a bigger, tougher problem next time.  Meaning, you are always solving the easiest problem you will ever solve again.  This takes a lot of resilience and active managing of self-expectations to remember that you are not actually getting worse, the problems are just getting harder.  So my advice is to remember that.  And then take a second to realize that it would be a lot less fun if the reverse were true.  And isn't that precisely why you wanted this job in the first place anyway? It sure was for me."
3,Bain & Company,Only good things to say,2022-03-24,5.0,Senior Knowledge Specialist,"Everyone from the leadership to the assistants is not only smart and driven, but also kind and personable. People care genuinely about each other, the environment and the society. There is freedom to express yourself and an expectation that you will develop yourself to maximize your potential.",The cold brew can be slightly addictive.
4,Bain & Company,Best place to start a career,2022-01-20,5.0,Senior Associate Consultant,"You'll learn more here than just about anywhere else. The people are tremendous, and Bain has a rock solid culture of fun and respect that I haven't seen at other consulting firms. Your start class will give you friends for life, your managers will become your greatest cheerleaders, and if you choose to leave, the world will be your oyster.","Look, it's tough work. The hours are long, sometimes the job is uninteresting, sometimes clients are a nightmare, sometimes partners are a nightmare, and sometimes your team is a nightmare. That's life. There are other places that will pay you more, work you less, or be more interesting, but if you're looking for a well-rounded job that optimizes for all of the above factors, Bain is probably your best bet."

You learn different skillsets, meet smart people, work in different industries and make decent money. The benefits are great. The prestige is also great. But the lifestyle is not for everyone.","The leadership loves saying how much they care about people, the welfare and mental health of employees, etc... and naive people like me usually believe that... until they actually need help/assistance with something regarding their personal lives. HR will tell you that they can't do anything because of ""company rules"". Partners will tell you the same. Colleagues will feel bad for you but cannot really do anything. In the end, you're just a number and there are thousands of other people dying to work for the company, so your particular issue is not worth their time. You work late nights, weekends, sacrifice your personal life for the job... but when you need something, you're on your own."

- People are amazing - super friendly and social but also the right kind of nerdy for an introvert like me
- On balance, the average project is probably a little more sustainable and a little more interesting (skew shorter and more strategy focused) than the average project at direct competitors","- Has slightly lagged BCG/McK in total comp in recent years

Even working remotely, there are a number of events and engagements that foster joy. My manager and team are exceptionally bright and I can learn from them - something that I value tremendously. People here presume trust and best intentions, so working with colleagues is amicable. I'm also impressed at the efforts the company is making to increase the diversity of the company and foster a greater sense of belonging across demographics.

135,Bain & Company,Great firm,2021-11-16,5.0,Vice President,Good place to start career and strong culture,Long hours and demanding deadlines
136,Bain & Company,"Bro Culture, Micromanaging, and Poor Pandemic Response",2021-11-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits are pretty good.,"I feel like this place did a 180 on me. My experience has not matched what was pitched in the interview.  I don't think anyone here is trying to be toxic but they certainly exhibit these behaviors in my experience.  Since starting here I have personally experienced gaslighting, micromanaging (wanting to read your emails for example), being interrupted, having my expertise questioned, etc. I do not feel heard and I do not feel like I have the autonomy needed to do my job. Unfortunately, this is a common experience for those in my demographic.

There are other cultural things that make me uncomfortable as well. There is so much pressure to participate in extracurricular Bain activities e.g. Bain band, pub crawls, etc. that I don't feel like I have a choice in saying no. If that's you're passion, by all means, jump in and have fun; but that's just not for me. The idea of singing songs about my workplace (as they do in Bain Band) is 100% offputting to me. We work here, this is not a capitalist worship house. It's also not super-inclusive to encourage constant after-hours activities (which are often at a bar). Imagine what that would feel like if you had a family, cared for a parent, or didn't drink for one reason or another. I'm not saying I'm against all work events or drinking at these things, I just think they could be more mindful of how this can make others feel. I personally feel obligated to attend lest I want to limit my professional goals. 

They also do these really bizarre reply alls -- to the entire office-- that are at best a waste of people's time and at worse inappropriate. I'm sure I must sound like a killjoy at this point but dang...I just think that folks should be able to opt into how social they want to be with people. I don't need to know about everyone's business to do my job. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of awesome people here and I think it's great to make friends at work. I just think it should be more organic. I don't want to have to comb through 100 emails har-haring at something that I'm not even involved with just to get to my actual work emails.

They've also had a really bizarre approach to the pandemic in recent months. Lately, there has been a huge push to get folks back to the office. Sure there are precautions they have in place, like twice-weekly testing, but it's still an odd choice to pack folks into the open floor plan (most people maskless to boot) just for the sake of it. What's really odd is how jovial they seem to be about it. They'll email out pictures of crowded lunchrooms, meetings, etc as evidence of how great it is that folks are back and then offhandedly mention the breakthrough cases that happened. I get that there is a value in being in the same space every now and again but to what end? We can't simply will the pandemic to end and folks are working perfectly well from home. It just comes off as that old-school management thing where they want to watch over your shoulder all the time.


There are also a lot of issues with the values and historical decks/content that would 100% not fly today(but are still being used for some reason). For example, they want you to have an ""insurgent mindset"" which is just really gross sounding. A lot of what they do feel like 1984 doublespeak to me. For example, a few women on a recent panel talked about how great Bain was to them when they became mothers. They both mentioned stepping into lower roles so they could be with their kids more. Now on the one hand this could be a great thing...if Bain is helping people with kids find the right work-life balance then that's cool. Unfortunately, I didn't get that vibe. I might be reading into it too much but their stories made it sound like leadership roles at Bain require so much work after hours that it'd be very difficult for parents (especially mothers ) to maintain them. I'm not saying this is the case, this is simply my impression of what was shared. 

Overall I just think this place is designed for people with very different backgrounds than my own."

* Breadth of experience - In 2 years, I have been exposed to cases in more than 6 industries - a great place to learn about a variety of industries and functions
* Benefits - Bain really tries to provide the best suite of benefits to its employees and their families (healthcare, parental leave, etc.)","* Work-life balance - even with the shift to WFH, 65+ hour weeks are not uncommon. There is a lot of variability in that weekly schedule as well"

It's generally very invested in it's employees and the benefits are very thoughtful. 

There are a lot of places to plug in, but you really have to be motivated and self-starting in order to go anywhere here. In the assistant position, potential growth is extremely limited and there is not currently a path for assistants to be promoted within the company.","There is zero wage transparency and many antiquated compensation practices that negatively impact BIPOC and women for hourly employees. 

If you're expecting salary growth, this is not the company for you. There is one promotion available to assistants with a significant raise and after that you're done. This promotion is based more on the needs of the company than the qualifications of the employees, so you could be waiting for less than a year for a promotion, or you could be there for 4 years. 

Raises are typically awarded at about the rate of inflation and are non-negotiable. If you are comfortable with your salary offer, you'll be fine.

Manager Assistants support six people and are not allowed overtime. It's a response to the pandemic that they are currently planning on making permanent. Do not factor in overtime to your compensation because they expect you to keep your hours under 40 a week (and it's not a 40-hour a week job, closer to 45-50 if you're working at a sustainable pace)."

Company is very transparent about the state of the business.

Fast career trajectory.","Work life balance is challenging broadly in the management consulting field, however Bain does a relatively good job relative to its peers, with a ""GAL"" (get-a-life) / ""virtual baby"" culture where you get ~1 early night per week, typically. Work hours can range from ~55-80 hours per week depending on the client, office, and manager. 

Staffing is a bit of a challenge in that you don't necessarily know where you'll be on the next case - either in terms of work life balance, or physical location - and you only get some say in the matter."

-Best culture and combination of high performance people that actually treat each other well
-I feel prepared to go do so many different things, and at the same time I've continually opted into the role and the path here","The two things the firm is working to address are consistent with what I would observe:
-Sustainability - this is a hard job. A really hard job. The culture is super high performing and the problems we solve are not easy. This means that it's hard to turn your brain off of the work even if you leave for home at a reasonable hour. The upside is that relative to other consulting firms, the home office staffing model does very materially make this more of a sustainable place to build a long-term career in consulting.

465,Bain & Company,People come first. Period.,2020-08-17,5.0,Senior Manager,"- Incredible team of people. Lots of companies say they put their people first, but Bain actually does it. Let's acknowledge upfront that that makes a lot of business sense in a world where people are the product, but Bain truly delivers. Some examples: I had a team who fought for me, who pushed against the odds and the statistics, to get me the opportunities that were exciting to me. I had someone who worked for me who dropped everything when her peer's father caught COVID - this led to some crazy hours and stressful days, but this individual believed in our operating principle ""A Bainie Never Lets Another Bainie Fail"" - something that has permeated everyday of my career here. My path hasn't been standard but I have felt deeply supported and seen as an individual at each step of the way. 
- We do great work for our clients. Cliche, I know. But as I work with my clients, it's clear that Bain is different. We focus on delivering value that the client can actually realize - it's not about the academically perfect answer or something complex that will require 5 more years of consulting. It's about making the client successful. 
- Can't get thru 2020 without mentioning COVID. Bain went work from home before SF city ordinances (which were some of the earliest in the country) and has put employee safety first at every step. This includes people moving across the country to be with family or needing flexible work schedules to manage child care or other WFH needs.
- We aren't the most diverse company and have struggled to recruit and retain people of color and LGBTQ individuals. And I've seen Bain step up this year to fix this. Including massive financial commitments, changes to our operating principles, Diversity committee to report to MD to evaluate and track stats, an Americas-wide Juneteenth training on systemic racism and what it means at Bain. We are nowhere near the end of the road here, but as a gay woman, I believe in what the leadership is saying and setting out as a goal and direction for the company.","- it can be a bit of ""you put in X years, you get Y reward"" but I do think that's shifting over time
- If you aren't starting as an AC (right out of college) ... it can be alienating - the ACs who work here get such incredible opportunities and boosts that those joining out of biz school never had... I've heard many people discount how hard it is to get into schools like HBS and GSB because ""it's just expected."" As someone who fought for that degree, it can come off as cavalier, discounting, and perhaps ""holier than thou"" (oh you had to work for this thing that was just a duh for me? poor you...). Have to develop a tough skin and know that your path was worthy and real and important to survive that egotistical stuff."

They tout ""one-team"" oriented environment and being ""at cause"", but that's only when it's convenient for them.  When push comes to shove (when you attempt to be ""at cause""), and they have to ""deal with you,"" they will make you feel like YOU are the problem.  This is also because they lack the skill-set to effectively mediate a situation.  Do not try to voice a concern, this will only make YOU look ""difficult.""  

Basically, they are about themselves, not you.  If you have a problem, they will turn it against you and then have HR gang up on you to make you feel like even less of a person.  I've seen this happen with almost every person I've ever worked with in Graphics for the last 10 years, and it's getting worse by the year.  If you don't mind being a grunt without a voice, this is the place for you.  I didn't often seen happy faces walking down those newly designed halls.. most people seem miserable and unfriendly.

Culture is definitely more open/fun than at competitors. Everyone from partners to support staff is happy to joke around which makes the long hours more bearable.

I learned a lot about analytics, project management, and prioritization while there.

Great connections fellow consultants and clients.

Leadership knows the firm needs to improve in terms of sustainability and diversity. They've got a lot of work to do but I also believe they genuinely care.","Work-life balance is going to be pretty bad most of the time (~60+ hours/week) and really awful every few cases (~80+ hours/week). 

Workforce is not diverse, although this is largely a ""pipeline problem."" Management seems to be working in earnest to address this."
721,Bain & Company,Bain NY,2020-03-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Exciting work, intelligent colleagues, fantastic professional development","Difficult hours (to be expected in consulting), but above all management needs to reemphasize zero-tolerance policy towards hate speech and bias, and act accordingly.

They love our work, and they also love working with us. That makes a client services job incredibly rewarding as you often find yourself developing strong friendships, as well as advisory relationships, with senior clients. Our rate of enduring clients who actively call Bain for their toughest problems speaks for itself. 

Strong supportive culture - It's in the DNA of Bainies to support one another, coach, and mentor. I feel like I have an amazing set of mentors supporting my career, all the way from Senior Directors to my peers to our ACs. 

No better place to start your career - I am in awe at the opportunities Bain creates for our ACs and Cs to develop the general manager mindset. We constantly push our teams to deliver the best work we can, and as part of this we stretch our people to learn new skills and build towards their personal career goals. It is awesome to watch Bainies succeed, both at Bain and outside of Bain.","Client services is inherently demanding and at times unpredictable. However, Bain really does support you in finding a balance that works for you.

766,Bain & Company,Unparalleled culture and opportunity - lives up to the hype,2014-09-26,5.0,Consultant (Second Year),"-The breadth and quality of the cases you can cover are hard to come by in all but a few other consulting firms
-The office based staffing model makes Bain more sustainable than other firms; I interned with another consulting firm where I traveled 4 days a week and was only in my home office on Fridays. I found it unsustainable and felt I didn't know the people in my own office. At Bain, when you don't have client meetings, you can be in your local office. This means you have a more reasonable travel schedule and you really get to know your colleagues. 
-Compensation and benefits are great - can't complain, comparable to similar employers
-Bain is serious about your development. It's viewed as an apprencticeship and your team really invests in your professional development, regular check-ins to talk about what you're doing well and how you can do better.
-If you work here, within a matter of months you will start getting multiple solicitations to go work for another company at a level that would be hard to crack into a few years out of business school; I've been recruited almost more heavily here at Bain than when I was in business school.","-The nature of client service is that you'll have an unpredictable schedule. I've averaged 60 hours a week but it's felt managable so far. If you rotate into the Private Equity Group you won't travel at all but you'll expect to work longer hours due to the nature of the work.
-Yeah, the only down side is the work life balance - this is not and will never be a 9-to-5 job, but you probably know that already."
