If you aren't far left then it's just known to keep your mouth shut , or deal with coworkers that think lesser of you. There are also weird cliques on some teams. It's growing increasingly corporate, but that's expected of a company with such explosive growth."

Clear favoritism for certain projects and teams... valuable, mainstay products feel under-appreciated
Management has this vision for connecting all these disparate parts of the company, but doesn't put enough resources into making that technically feasible"
12,Block,Avoid PIE and ML Platforms,2022-04-02,1.0,Machine Learning Engineer,"Some nice people trying to move the needle. Good company overall goal.

If you don't know anything about ML and want to be an ML engineer, they will hire just about anybody and give them a Sr ML Engineer title. Got a physics degree, you are a shoe in. Economics degree and one year at a ""AI startup"", you'll be leading ML projects and a Lead Software engineer.","Toxic middle management. No real experience in ML, but leading projects just because they've been at Square a long time (probably because no one else will hire them). Management is political, will promise new features or lie just to put up roadblocks against other more qualified teams that can deliver.

The tech stack is an all inhouse nightmare, let's built it all ourselves mess. It's a bunch of engineers whose first answer to every question is , ""let's build something new"" or maybe if you are lucky they are like, ""let's buy something new and then package a bunch of our own tech around it and call it a new project"". Many of the projects are on the 4/5th iteration of just the same old tired nonsense so somebody new can be a DRI.

Instead of, you know, just using open source tools and ML frameworks that ALREADY do what is needed. But there's no promotion or bonuses in making the right decisions in PIE.

Maybe other parts of the company are better, but the PIE (ML Platform group) is career suicide."

- You get to empower small businesses everyday
- Great benefits","- Widespread cheating in the sales org
- AEs do the role of a sales rep, tech support specialist, CSM, and integration specialist. There are support teams for these tasks, but they were scaled disproportionately slowly compared to the sales team. 
- AEs aren't vertically specialized, so their attention is not only scattered between tasks, but also between products"
23,Block,Unrealistic Expectations,2022-03-09,1.0,Account Executive,"Benefits, stock plan, great colleagues","There are some serious unrealistic expectations in the sales organization. The number of talented AEs leaving Square is very discouraging. Many sales leaders are very inexperienced and fail to listen to AE concerns. Compensation could be decent, but the vast majority of reps are not even close to hitting quota so they are not benefitting from what they could be making. The compensation is pretty much your base salary plus a few hundred bucks every quarter. The product is great but unfortunately the sales organization needs to really reevaluate how they will encourage reps to stay."

33,Block,On a Downward Spiral,2022-02-03,2.0,Team Lead,"Very smart people from all different industries. Mostly everyone is willing to help or point you in the right direction.

Senior leadership is generally very understanding of mental health, taking time off, and offering resources to help support you. However, YMMV depending on your manager.

The ability to wear multiple hats and learn quickly in different areas, even if it is beyond your expertise.","Lower compensation than other tech companies. Lower base, no cash bonuses, stock that used to be high-growth, but has been on a downward spiral since the second half of 2021.

Obsession with BTC/crypto/blockchain. They are putting all their eggs in this basket and every decision is meant to push the company further in this direction. People might be thinking they are joining a global fintech leader, and instead are going to a company who's stock price follows the same volatility as bitcoin.

Burnout is real. When certain leaders of organizations don't care whether you stay or quit, how you are doing, whether you live or die, it sounds like lip service from the top pretending to care about mental health. You will be forced to put slack on your personal phone, and they will contact you during weekends, holidays, pto, etc. for fake fires 365 days a year.

Speaking of these ""leaders,"" some of them pretend to care but they clearly don't. Jack and core will talk about and offer support during Black Lives Matter protests, or Stop Asian Hate, or the Capitol Riots, but there are other sociopaths at the company who really don't care. Cash App was plastered all over the ring during Logan Paul vs. Floyd Mayweather. When people brought up domestic violence against women, they made it clear that is their customer base they are targeting and they really don't care what you think. Thanks for showing your true colors!"

- FLEXIBILITY and Work/Life Balance - (they were one of the first companies to allow employees to choose to WFH full-time back when the pandemic first hit - This alone speaks volumes). I was looking for a fully remote role and I got it!!!! 
- HIGHLY competitive compensation
- Personal and Professional Development is wonderful and exactly what I was looking for

42,Block,Good Company,2022-01-25,4.0,Account Executive,"Good benefits, stock options, fun product",Pay and commission are low
43,Block,"Culture of Nepotism, Alcoholics, and Cliques",2022-02-09,1.0,Software Engineer,I met some great coworkers here.,"Compared to their peers, Block pays below average. Their refreshers are roughly around 5-15% instead of the standard 25% of your initial offer. I know people who got $6k/yr grant as a refresher vs the expected $20k+/yr grant as a refresher (for their respective level).

Block's culture is rampant with alcoholism and cliques. When we were still in the office, they had a weekly meeting on the rooftop where all the ""old guard"" (actually what they called themselves) would grab a beer and drink. They were all white males and not very inclusive of others. Managers were also especially bad about this - they would regularly skip meetings with people to go out to the Market for a beer run and drink with one another during company hours. 

Register and Cash are fighting with one another internally - Cash keeps cannibalizing the rest of Block by literally poaching other Block employees (sometimes to the point of starting the poaching right after someone joins Block).

The company also has a history of rewarding Nepotism. People who have tenure or have special connections continue to be rewarded despite not delivering results. Managers are able to make up metrics and lie about their directs. They also don't undergo training and several managers contribute to an abusive culture. HR isn't there to help you - they will only cover for the manager."

Benefits

vacation time","the metrics are hard to meet, even for a seasoned rep, it's not easy to do everything they need you to do with the small amount of time they give you in between calls. at the end of the day it's a call center, you have to deal with customers. they have no culture, only one lead for about 40 reps means you rarely talk to your lead, it takes a super long time for leadership to get back to you when you need help."

48,Block,"Nice people, good products, but confused leadership",2022-01-05,4.0,Software Engineer,"People are always very nice, friendly, and helpful. As an engineer, I have a great work-life-balance.

When it comes to delivering on new features, Square's tooling is a bit esoteric but usually gets the job done with minimal waiting (and when it doesn't, the nice/friendly/helpful people I just mentioned will unblock you really fast).","C-Suite leadership makes bizarre decisions (e.g. renaming to Block) that somehow promises to make *them* a lot of money, but doesn't contribute towards better products for users (e.g. Jack's obsession with crypto).

There's a mixture of new and pleasant technology, and old legacy stuff that has to continue to be supported. This would not be so bad, except there is a surprising amount of resistance if you decide not to build *new* things with the old legacy technology.

""Software architecture"" isn't a priority for Block's microservices - so while everything works and individual services have unit tests, creating usable APIs for cross-team boundaries is usually an afterthought that makes it a pain to ever make new connections."

I come from the hospitality industry. If anyone had warned me that I’d be taking non-stop calls for 7+ hours with hardly any downtime between calls, I wouldn’t have taken this job. They’ve since updated the job description to say “expect to spend 90% of your day taking calls.” I wish it had said that when I applied. Expect to have mostly angry (rightfully so) callers with very little manager support. I have empathy for days, but wow this gets exhausting. If you’re not taking calls then you’re out of “adherence.” So say good bye to having a minute to breathe after an irate customer screams in your ear before the next calls comes in. I had a month of training which honestly wasn’t enough before they had me taking live calls. Finding a straight answer is basically impossible. One person says one thing, the other says another thing. It’s very hard to help callers when I can’t even track down the most accurate information. You have to go one place for an answer, then to another, then to another. All while having to put someone on hold just to track it down. Every thing I do is tracked and monitored. I have to publicly say when I’m going to the restroom so that I don’t get a message asking where I’ve gone. You’re scheduled an hour lunch (usually cut to half hour) and two 15 minute breaks. You’ll probably get a call that will make you miss your breaks and you don’t get to take them. If a call goes into your lunch, your supposed to take your lunch as soon as you can. But again, then you’re out of adherence. They preach time management skills, but it’s so hard when the calls never stop. Don’t get too comfy with your lead/manager, because there’s a good chance that you’ll be reassigned several times. This makes it very hard to establish a relationship with my lead because it’s constantly changing. Yes, your calls are monitored and recorded for quality assurance. Expect to have to listen to those calls with your lead for “personal growth.” There was a few days where work force management started publicly outing people for being out of adherence. Imagine hundreds of people being put on blast for the whole company to see. It was disheartening and embarrassing to witness. Now people update everytime they have to change a diaper, puke, or any other human thing. Expect to have bigots and racist callers, but you have to help them as long as they aren’t verbally attacking you as a person. Right after training I had over 400 emails in my work inbox. It’s expected that you go through these emails for pertinent information. It’s impossible to do this with zero downtime. Expect to be in a constantly changing environment, rules/regulations change every day and nothing is stable. You will be learning something new everyday. That sounds reasonable until it’s too much to keep up with. I’ve never been burnt out from a job this quickly. I had such high expectations and I keep trying to convince myself that things are going to get better. But they haven’t and it’s doubtful that they will. Please whoever responds to this, don’t tell me to talk with my lead. I doubt they care and there’s a good chance I’ll have a new lead anyway."

-Benefits 
-ESPP / Stock
-Strong product and brand recognition 
-Great mission","-Sales org has drastically changed over time and is in a tough spot right now. Doubling in size and overall lack of efficiency in terms of onboarding AEs successfully. 
-A large population of Senior AEs have been in the org a year+and haven’t touched quota once. There has been a lack of direction and overall efficiency for awhile in onboarding as well as making this role more manageable in terms of work/life balance.
-Several sales managers are focused on inputs/talk time/daily activities and micromanaging those aspects, but as of now seem to have little control in shaping reps success based on rising quota expectations.
-This is an outbound SMB sales team compared to most B2B sales orgs, even if you are a mid to upmarket AE. You will be handholding a lot of merchants to the finish line and playing a heavy tech support role as well. 
-Pay is average to below average for the work you put in to hit your number, a lot of people are here for the brand name and stock. 

At the end of the day, it’s a lot of hard work like anything worth doing, but the inefficiencies and time it will take to remedy and improve the cons may frustrate/surprise a lot of people coming in externally."

A lot of your experience there can depend on luck regarding who you get as your manager. Sadly there are a number of external hire management that don’t know the role and can’t help teach you, so you rely on overstressed teammates and mentors. The metrics are way too high and you’re expected to know a lot for the role in a short amount of time. Upper management seems lovely and savvy but are tone deaf to the struggles (or just don’t care) and continue to make the role harder. Training is very limited. Quantity, not quality, is what is important. It’s certainly more of a corporate environment than I ever expected. Oh, and you’re often too scared to take your “unlimited” time off."

259,Block,Great culture; great mission; interesting work,2020-08-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Can't speak for other offices, but pay in Atlanta is top-of-market.

Flexible culture. Work from home is going to be allowed permanently, even after the whole COVID situation is over. Flexible PTO. Extensive parental leave.

Good balance in engineering culture between shipping features and paying down tech debt. I think this is an overlooked variable at many companies. At Square my experience is that careful consideration is paid to the decision between moving quickly to deliver vs taking time to go back and clean up old messes.

Upward mobility. If you come in as a junior engineer, you don't have to look for another job after 2 years to find more responsibilities and commensurate compensation increase. Evaluation for promotion is built-in to the system, and pay increases for promo are considerable, not just token raises.

Worthwhile mission. Square is a company that actually takes its mission of ""economic empowerment"" seriously. It's not just a payments company or a POS company. It's a company that works hard to deliver the products that small businesses need.

Interesting work. Whatever you're interested in, Square is probably doing it. Nitty-gritty payments code, ML, cryptocurrency, front-end design and engineering, etc.

Room for growth as a company. There's still lots of uncaptured opportunity out there for Square, and the business is actively seeking it out.","Promotion process is kind of drawn-out and opaque. You work with your manager to put together a promo packet, but then don't hear anything back for at least several weeks.

Company culture is fairly homogenous politically. Some people are outspoken about their political beliefs, but it would probably be somewhat uncomfortable for someone who isn't at least moderately liberal to voice their beliefs.

Not many cons. I plan to be at Square for the long-haul."

For the most part, the benefits are Great! High pay at every position but you will pay a price for this. Cash App advertises unlimited paid time off which was changed to a ""flexible"" Paid Time Off policy requiring manager approval. This often results in no Paid Time Off.","I can't speak for Square Inc as a whole, though its Cash App business is hamstrung by exploitive practices, incompetent managers, and inconsistent policies. For example, you may be asked to do a task without training, then when you ask questions, they act as if they had trained you. This is frustrating and makes for a terrible experience. Upper management throws money at HR issues rather than working to understand the challenges to make meaningful change. 

Often senior management resorts to firing multiple staff who violate policies without adequate training. To make matters worse policies change weekly with little to no notice. Turn over is very high and their solution is mass hiring to replace those they cut. Management pats themselves on the back for hiring diversity. The truth is there is no one of color in upper management positions. To make matters worse they don't check references or perform due diligence in their hiring. All that's required is a minimum required background check."

Other things to point out:

- Few people work late, though you are implicitly expected to be in early
- Food is good","Bad managers seem to be a relatively common complaint among IC employees I talked to. I reported to a micromanager, and didn't get the impression I could do much about it without burning bridges.


Jack (CEO) seems to be phoning-in anything not related to BTC. Several of the VPs are very risk averse and there is no real vision for the future other than a very vague ""grow"" directive. The company is complacent about its market position and I don't expect it to keep growing.


Other things to point out:

- Complacent business strategy leads to boring work
- The SF office is very loud due to poor acoustics and tight desk layouts
- WFH is generally discouraged
- Stock appreciation is considered during comp review, refreshers/raises are poor in general and there will almost certainly be a big 4-year cliff now that the stock is stagnant

You often hear rhetoric at other companies like ""we're /disrupting/  and changing the world"", but at Square, you'll find that people are more humble about the mission of economic empowerment and people have full lives outside of Square.
- Product ownership is huge here. I feel like I get to weigh in on decisions for product, and innovate on our products with new ideas.
- Engineering excellence. I worked at startups before this, where engineering was haphazard and unfocused. Here you learn how to build incredibly performant, secure products that integrate with a global payments stack
- Career ladder is well defined for software engineers. Clear paths for I.C.s vs management roles and my EM's have all been very receptive to my career goals.
- Perks are amazing. Free lunch and breakfast everyday (I wish we still had free dinner) and lots of other freebies that are icing on the cake when picking a job.

They are not very helpful and while may make it seem like they're on your side, there is almost 0 communication from them. The one person I was able to talk to was a 3rd party consultant and wasn't able to give me any information that was relevant to my situation.

- Great paternity / maternity leave program. 4 paid months off! 

- Super transparent company culture. Every other Friday we have a company wide meeting (with different fine wine and appetizer pairings), where different groups discuss what they’re working on, where Jack Dorsey himself engages with his Squares, and listens to us voice our grievances, whether professional or personal opinions, (and he does so with great compassion and concern for all). 

- Awesome CEO that genuinely cares about every single person that works for him. He’s created a very welcoming and inclusive culture.

-Great company events aimed at creating a great, connected culture within the company ! Outrageous company picnic called square games with open bar and hilarious inflatable games and activities and not to mention all the good food! Great events for our merchants.. awesome holiday party.. and even just the random celebrations. Like Squares birthday.. and others.

- Pay is  WAYYYYYY above market. Especially if you consider the fact that my stocks rocketed 250% in the past 7 months .

-The smartest and most personable colleagues. I seriously have made some of my best friends through this company. No beaurocracy. Everyone is humble and kind and respectful and happy. 

-Flexibility in work schedule as long as you’re getting stuff done. I am able to work around commute hours and even WFH 1 or 2 days a week.. although I really miss being in the office the days I’m not it .. 

-Lots of opportunity to make a name for yourself within this company, and given all we’re working on internally in terms of our own ecosystem of offerings, you are going to be sitting on a pretty penny in 5 years if you work hard here. 

- CEO is a saint. God bless him for all he does and continues to do for his employees and for the rest of the world. He believes very strongly in being humble and letting the results speak for themselves. It may be why we don’t spend so much money on trying to be ranked the best place to work. 

- Management is amazing. Very supportive of personal and professional development.","I feel like this true of any company I’ve worked at that spoils their employees, but some people begin to feel entitled and whine about the most nonsensical stuff.  Like some of these reviews for example. None of you are oppressed. None of you work at a place that you can’t stand. You’d be somewhere else otherwise. And if you think it’s any better anywhere else, by all means, it’s at will employment.. but I will let our boomerang rate (people that leave and then come back) speak for itself.. and as someone who has worked at other these so called “best places to work”, trust me.

There's very little opportunity to advance into a career outside of the support environment. typically, support is a stepping stone towards other career paths, but there's little to no room for mobility aside from being a support manager or resolution specialist (tackling escalated cases).
- Difficult to support other products of Square when they don't have a customer facing team/direct transfer for incoming calls. I.e. Employee Management, Capital, Cash. Supporters are expected to have knowledge of multiple product areas so it does get difficult when there's new features/bugs in the platform/product requests/etc. since there's no clear escalation path in place
- The nature of support is 24/7. You are meant to serve the customers and with that in mind, expect to work holidays. When other employees get a week in between Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, you're more than likely working. Though you get to work from home, it's unfortunate having to be locked up in a room taking calls while the rest of your family enjoys the holiday.

 80% of the managers are completely incompetent. 
Many project managers have never managed anything and give engineers nothing useful to work with.
 With nearly all operation staff on contract half of your time on call is spent dealing with information they put into the system wrong.
The only people who stay long enough to have any understanding of how stuff works are on work visas or 22-year-olds read on the interned with Sqare. No one else lasts more than a year. This makes things like tax season absolute chaos as no one has seen it before and there is no documentation.
  Salary  stock and 401(k) matching are far below market.

-Shared resources and tools have no ownership, so once whoever created the tool or resource leaves it gets no attention and eventually falls apart.
-Upper management is very tone-deaf and completely very disconnected from work that customer facing teams are doing.
-Management very bad at taking feedback- your feedback for leads is often turned around into a criticism of yourself. Frequent response you will here in response to feedback given to management is ""maybe this isn't the place for you"".
-Decisions are made by people who are not involved in work being done without consulting people who ARE doing the work."
501,Block,Cares about employees,2017-02-17,5.0,Recruiter,"- 'People first' is a view that stems from upper management all the way down the chain. Square places a large emphasis on generous benefits, leave policies and even the daily perks you see around the office.

505,Block,Great company to grow at!,2017-01-18,5.0,Business Operations Manager,"Square is an amazing place to learn and grow. The speed of change sparks affords new opportunities on a very regular basis. Even as the company has grown and gone public, the culture is still very horizontal and executives and higher level managers are still very approachable and open to new ideas. Perks are great - flexible vacation policy, good food in the office, plenty of snacks, coffee bar, and a beautiful office. 

The CEO has strong morale convictions and this clearly guides his leadership. It's very refreshing to have someone this authentic heading the company who speaks their actual opinion about social issues. Even when I don't agree with him, it's nice to know it's actually his opinion (opposed to something his legal team drafted up).","A lot of these issues have been fixed, but due to the rapid growth there are still some systems issues and managers that are in over their heads. Most of these Managers have been replaced (or moved to a more appropriate level), but some remain in higher level positions who lack the necessary experience in critical areas which is still causing some pain. The HR team is understaffed so they are not in a position to offer much support, but this is currently being addressed. 

The CEO's political beliefs create a somewhat insular environment, though I'm sure most tech companies are like this. It would be a challenging place for someone with conservative political views to work at."

Required engineers to be on-call, at least on my team, but did not properly compensate. I have never worked anywhere that required engineers to be on-call unless it was shortly after a launch maybe they would be expected to fix their code if it failed catastrophically but not like this.

Has only 1/2 a CEO.

In an extremely low margin competitive business with no solid plan for turning a profit.  it’s the worst kept secret of both Square and Twitter, everyone seems to know it except him and the respective boards. Jack needs to try with one or he will fail with both in my opinion."

I saw managers refuse to give direct reports feedback.  My career development stagnated at Square because my manager was ill-equipped to provide any sort of guidance in this area.

- Inability to prioritize.  Focus would be given to shiny projects over projects that would actually add value to the company.  Some managers thought it was appropriate to have 10 P0 priority projects running for a single employee at one time.  

- The most political work environment I've been a part of.  If you don't cheerlead for yourself here, like other employees are doing for the most mundane of projects they complete, you won't get noticed.  Combine that with the fact that you would likely not have a manager who is skilled enough to be an advocate for you and it creates an environment that is frustrating for employees who aren't politically savvy.

I'm one of a handful of engineers that left Google together over four years ago to create a new office in ATL for Square. We've strived hard to maintain the same close-knit environment we started with, even as we've delivered many major contributions, grown 5x, and added several more teams.

- Our compensation is competitive. 
- We have many smart engineers, ranging from PhDs in CS to pedigrees at Amazon and Google.
- We have a friendly, collaborative atmosphere.
- Square continues to retain its startup feel, and it's much easier to have an outsized impact compared to larger companies like Google.

Don't be fooled by my four star ratings. I almost never rate anything perfect.","Square continues to grow, which is awesome, but it means there are growing pains. For example, some time ago, the company revamped its engineering ladder to be more consistent and prescriptive about career paths.

You get to help small businesses and craft people and such earn a living or make extra bucks on their hobby.  Very satisfying.","St Louis has become the center for Support but is increasingly becoming excluded from the rest of the company.  Very little room for advancement and recent available promotions were not posted anywhere (we found out spots were open when being told who the new leads are).  

Recent shake up of the schedule, and plans to do so every six months, means this is no longer a stable work environment.  If you don't mind having your schedule changed without regard of extracurricular needs (such as family, volunteer work, etc) this won't be a factor for you. An increasing number of staff are now looking for a new job.

Also there really isn't a lot of transparency in regards to upward mobility. Tons of possibilities are discussed but the odds of moving up are pretty slim, especially in a supporting role. The work for a supporter as to be expected is highly repetitive and can wear you down pretty quickly.

527,Block,Seemed good as long as you're not in Support,2016-11-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Square is very perk-oriented. The company has a great energy about it, with leaders always sporting positive attitudes. It is a very casual environment where employees can relax (until they begin work).","The positive attitude didn't have much (if any) substance behind it, and that especially goes for Support. The brunt of the company's changes were placed on the Support team, with very little information or assistance in even the biggest company changes. It is very much a chained-to-your-desk environment, where even a longer trip to the restroom is heavily questioned. Unlimited PTO becomes less of a perk and more of an onus when leaders speak critically toward employees wanting a vacation.

Things move very quickly there, and not always in a good way. The Support team is expected to balance dozens of products with hundreds of features and is pulled in conflicting directions: keep someone on the phone while you investigate a messy issue, but don't let your call run long; we don't have a script, but we do have a very strict template of what you should be saying. Support employees have very little control over their situations, their days, and their growth within the company.

Arguably the worst part was that it was not like this at the beginning of my time at the company, but the leadership placed an emphasis only on quantifiable data rather than on our customers — a bad sign for a company claiming to be all about its users.

This is a company I had expected to stay with for a number of years, but I left as soon as I saw the direction it was heading."

+ One of the few opportunities to build something that is impactful for everyday people trying to make an honest living. People are connected to the mission of helping the small business down the street.
+ A truly full stack company. You can learn SO much on the engineering side.","- Design culture is awful. ICs are great but their management structure is incredibly top-down and not iterative. They hamstring product teams and slow everything down.

Work/life balance is good.","Office politics are extremely pervasive in Square. I've known coworkers fired over personal disagreements. If you don't drink the kool-aid, you're gone.

Management refuses to admit mistakes. The communications team seems to focus on placating employees, not telling an inspiring narrative to the rest of the world.

Generally, projects move at a glacial pace unless management happens to fancy your project this quarter. The next quarter your headcount could be gone. I saw projects take two years that should have taken 3-6 months.

Compensation is unimpressive. I think there's more of an effort recently to improve it, but for many employees like myself it's too little too late.

For as many great engineers as there are, there are equally as many really poor engineers. Square grew far too quickly, and its talent suffered as a result. In general, engineering makes little investment in the future. Technical debt is extremely high with no plan on how to pay it down."

639,Block,Would Not Recommend,2016-04-13,1.0,Risk Analyst,"- The Perks and Benefits etc: free food, gym, beautiful workplace
- Friendly staff","- Google Square and you'll see it is rated 2 stars, and for the same complaints that it's merchants have is the a problem that is not getting resolved through the eyes of an employee the turnover rate is huge because they hire on contingent workers with low pay and do not offer upward mobility unless you are white/gay. This company hugely discriminates! Yes you will see a couple specs of minorities around the building but they either work as a janitor or a contingent worker never anything more. So as far as career opportunities there are none. 

- Square has treated me and my colleagues as if we are invisible. I have no idea who my supervisor is and that is sad. 

- For the past several months my team has been getting paid to sit here. It may seem like a fun job to sit and do nothing but not when it messes with the overall productivity of the company."
640,Block,A Chaotic Mess,2016-03-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Gorgeous office and great benefits including fully paid health, dental, and vision
- Breakfast, lunch, and dinner five days a week
- Incredibly generous vacation policy if you're on your lead's good side
- Most of the company genuinely believes in the mission to enable small and mid-sized businesses to succeed and grow
- Numerous showcases for Square merchants and high-profile speakers who regularly stop by to share their stories
- The security and kitchen staff are incredibly down to earth which is refreshing in this industry","- Absurdly unnecessary “perks” that bloat operating expenses. $40 designer plates, a made to order smoothie bar AND separate coffee bar, full Wise Sons deli, and robots you can remotely drive around the office with your face plastered up on a screen in google hangouts weirding everyone out. They also recently brought in a full mariachi band to parade around the office as well as a cotton candy station and magician. All completely necessary when you’re on track to lose north of $80 million in one quarter (this is public information).

- The amount of tech entitlement in San Francisco that you’ve heard about is alive and well here. There was a ridiculous debate concerning the cafeteria's pre-planned closures two days out of the month. Some argued that it was completely unacceptable because 30 minutes spent to go out and get lunch was 30 minutes lost with family or productivity. Ever heard of packing a lunch the night before? How about ordering from the food delivery service your company just acquired for 90 million dollars? 

- The company is extremely divided and headed in a million different directions but doesn’t seem to care that it's affecting its bottom line and employee morale. Payments? Register? Capital? Cash? Caviar? Invoices? Appointments? Payroll? Employee Management? Marketing? Remember Wallet and Order? Ask any of your friends or family what Square does and they’ll say, ""Um that credit card dongle thing right?"" Yet everyone has convinced themselves that we’re known for “more than just our reader."" The epitome of biting off more than you can chew.

- Massive attrition. Don’t be surprised to see scores of paperwork and candidates spilling out of the interview rooms. It’s almost a guarantee that the position you’ve applied for was recently vacated and needs to be filled immediately, resulting in a rushed interview process that devalues candidates. But of course they won’t tell you that. If you do interview in person, you can judge the sense of panic for yourself.

- Combine all of this with extremely poor compensation relative to industry standards, atrocious middle management, limited growth opportunities, and a “culture” that seems more like a freshman high school mixer, you can clearly see why they’re struggling to mitigate the massive amount of turnover in all departments.

And while you’re at it, google “Square IPO ratchet” and see who’s really benefiting from the ill-timed IPO.

Square says its mission is to empower its sellers, yet it has mightily failed to empower its own employees."

-Merchants generally love us and our goal to empower them is actually quite fulfilling
-Some very smart and talented people
-Big comfy office with lots of space
-The core products are still very strong and growing very fast
-Works hard on diversity and other ethical challenges","-People are added to the middle pretty consistently.  That is, it's becoming more and more likely to see your role effectively demoted because they decide to add a level of management between you and your boss, or boss's boss, etc.
-Decisions are now mostly by committee.  In Square's earlier history, decisions were generally made quickly by informed leaders.  Today, processes are much, much slower and the company is becoming less nimble.  
-Burned by the IPO.  Many employees at Square, especially members of our Finance Team, took substantial pay cuts to work for Square -- sometimes in excess of 50% -- under the promise that there would be a big IPO someday and we'd make up that loss in stock.  However, with the substantial cut in Square's valuation, many employees have stock option grants that are entirely in the red.  To make up for these losses, the company issued one time RSU grants to older employees who might have been burned.  My RSU grant was the equivalent of a 7.5% salary bonus, which takes a year to vest and will be taxed as income.   
-The transparency that Square used to treasure is disappearing.  It used to be that there was no product or financial plan that wasn't shared among employees.  Today, a combination of unplanned leaks to the press and the demands of being a public company have ended a lot of that transparency.  
-Out of touch leadership.  Jack is a very inspiring leader and has an excellent understanding of design and usability.   However, his conviction of being a visionary contradicts current market forces. 
-Lack of career mobility.  Square is very proud of its ""go/grow"" and ""go/careers"" programs which purportedly  allow employees to find new roles at the company if they feel they're not developing in their career.  However, very few employees are promoted at Square, particularly on the Finance and Business teams.  
-Apparently Square is perfect?  It's very rare for Square to admit something didn't go well or it made a mistake.  The policy seems to be to just let the problem disappear and hope nobody asks about it.  Products are often launched and then shifted permanently to the back burner.  Metrics post-launch are rarely checked and very few financial resources are oriented towards product launches.
-Dead weight remains.  People who are under-performing or are becoming caustic to the organization are very, very rarely fired and only occasionally mitigated.  On the few occasions someone is fired or mitigated, of the person who replaces them is just as bad, they let that person stay in role indefinitely rather than embarrass themselves twice and have to hire for the role a third time."
