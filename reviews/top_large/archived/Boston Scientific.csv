131,Boston Scientific,Solid company to work for,2021-12-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"good benefits, interesting field to work in, bright people","regulations in medical field can make job very challenging, not very diverse."
132,Boston Scientific,Just okay,2021-12-08,3.0,Sales Associate,Great products and company brand. Training is thorough,Management is not good and the culture is toxic
133,Boston Scientific,Boston Scientific Review,2021-12-09,3.0,Medical Assembler,There can be great coworkers that you get along well with and for me as time went by the amount of coworkers hard to get along with become less and less. If you have a great attitude then the only thing you need to worry about to not be hard for others to get along with you is to have a high output. That's where the cons come in.,"1. Always need to hit goals. My department and shift in particular is short staffed so we need to constantly do overtime whether it's staying extra hours and/or working the weekend to hit our monthly goals. We are continually pushed to have higher outputs even though we are completely above our staffing goal. If it's any worse than this you can expect to work holidays as well. For high-output-experienced-workers this hits us hard because we have to constantly do everything. You'd be hard pressed to know that attendance is king when it comes to getting your raise and having experience and high output does you no good. It's even worse that it doesn't get you a promotion either. Makes you think why you're going so fast for besides the fact that you may not want to do overtime.

2. Management is bad. We are constantly told to do more than 1 job simultaneously and in a fast paced environment it becomes extremely tiring . It's 1 person doing a 2-3 person job getting paid 1 person. Great for the employer but horrible for the employee. Management also gets so stressed they lay the anger and frustration on you. I know because they tell us sometimes but that never justifies. It's almost everyday. They also know that you cannot do anything and no one will care if you did. There has been multiple reportings of people to Supervisors, Managers, and Human Resources but they do not do anything about the person being reported. Especially so when that person is a Supervisor or higher (including a Production Coordinator which is 1 step below a Supervisor).

3. Opportunities for advancement. They hire more people from the outside than they hire/promote people from inside the company. This makes it very hard for anyone as a Production Builder or similar to advance their career. You will not be given a chance to learn something new because they want someone who already knows a bit to do the job even if you are a passionate, hard worker and fast learner.

4. Salary. For Production Builders the salary is capped at $25/hr as a Production Builder III. Which requires at least 7 years of experience etc. Keep in mind that we do a 2-3 person job so getting $25/hr wouldn't cut it anyways. The base pay for a contractor is $17.50/hr, doing a 2 person job, would be $35/hr but you're getting nowhere near that. No great bonuses either, sometimes you may get anywhere between a $5-$50 gift card. It's definitely not occasional, just whenever management ""feels"" we're doing too much but they also have to approve of it with their superiors too which decreases the chances of getting it depending if your higher ups want to or not. It's nice to be rewarded, but you won't get much here."

The company sometimes promotes based on optics of momentum versus people who actually deliver measurable results.
Recommend avoiding Urology & Pelvic Health due to very poor leadership at the top. 15 Directors left the organization in a 12-month time span due to a division leader who is spectacular on camera and in front of an audience, as well as at managing up, but whose actions behind closed doors are extremely poor and not inclusive or open to diversity of thought."

Clear career paths 
Numerous opportunities to join employee resource groups

Large issue of favoritism, ie the department supervisor picks friend's for positions they aren't suited for better than someone else. Those same friends are able to get away with slacking off and doing just about whatever but if your not in their little group then it's not advisable to try it yourself at any point.

This has been shown by how they have handled the COVID lockdown, being in a strong enough financial position so that they have not laid anyone off, and using that financial position to actually not lay anyone off!
It makes good business sense to do what they have, given our financial position, but not every company in the same situation would have handled it in a way that treated employees so well, and in a way that puts us in a position to pick up steam as the lockdown is slowly lifted and business restarts.","The division I work in is in Southern California, so high taxes, commute issues.

Together they create a culture which is friendly, inclusive, and focused on making a difference the lives of patients.","Over the last three years, the organization has seemingly lost its way around the importance of people development.   Particularly in the area of HR, they have seemingly tolerated very weak and inappropriate leadership; they have dismantled one of the best global talent management functions in the country and abandoned their approach to engagement, internal development, best in class capabilities, and work/life balance.     Employees, and especially high potentials, are extremely frustrated with the lack of leadership, sponsorship,  and career development and are ready to leave the organization.   Most are finding their roles more tactical than strategic and are seeing such an increase in demands that they cannot maintain a reasonable balance of work/life.  Most are seeing an org structure which is so lean that they cannot begin to meet the real needs of their clients."

If you are at a company that is acquired and don't want to move to Minnesota (extremes of -40°F and 110°F humid), start looking for work.  They come in friendly, learn about your products, then transfer the profitable ones to Minnesota or offshore, kill any that don't have high enough ROI, and lay everyone off with various amounts of warning.

- Too much firefighting and too little focus on overall systematic fixes/improvements.

- Morale is low in the Bay Area. Ever since 2/3 of the business was moved to Costa Rica, morale here has been low. Add onto the fact that competitive tech companies here have plenty of perks, it's easy to see why morale isn't there.

It is a good place to start and have a mid-range career in IT. Pretty good benefits (vacation starts at 15 days), and in IT after a while most people have a standing work from home day on Friday. Work-life balance is OK depending on what team you are on.","To get on good projects and promoted at an ideal rate, must be in favor with IT leadership. There is too much emphasis on internal networking, sometimes gets in the way of actual work.

The idea of moving towards doing more Agile methodology is poorly planned. Only one big project is doing Agile right now; the worst part - they have a Manager I put in charge of leading the change. This needs to be championed higher from the top, and not just by throwing out buzz words in IT Town Halls.

The company has to cut down on SG&A costs a lot - IT is one of the top areas this spending has to be reduced."

Amidst an otherwise banner year for BSC financials, an IT layoff of US-based employees happened and we were told outright it was because not enough (expensive) US employees left through retirement or otherwise. That was disgusting, but it happened amidst the obvious failure of Indian outsourcing in BSC and against strong industry trends away from it (google it). Non-IT employees rightly associate IT with incompetent and unhelpful Indian employees and heavy users regularly go around the help desk to competent US employees. Ironically, the most ""successful"" recent initiatives were adding IT bars (like Apple's Genius bars) at major US sites so employees could get competent help, and stop giving such gawd-awful satisfaction rankings to IT's Indian help desk. A not-so-advertised related ""success"" was the introduction of a special US-based help desk for sales staff, so this vocal, high-profile group didn't have to ever deal with Indians.

TMs with this company make triple what CSs make with very little difference between the job descriptions. TMs order the CSs around but are not technically considered their managers. Very strange relationship between the two positions. The only way to make more money as a CS is to sell.... Again strange considering that the TM is the one that most benefits from the CS selling.  ... One must be crazy to want to work this hard just to watch their ""teammate"" reap the rewards.

If you are interested in this position:
Know ahead of time that you will be working extremely hard and make very little money. Even when you have a free moment from cases & sales calls to try and catch up on admin work, you will get pulled to neighboring territories to cover their cases (again, not making you a $). Don't be surprised if you end up working 12-16 hour days. You will be on-call every single weekend and you will be required to answer your phone to patients and accounts even if you are on vacation. As the CS member of the team, you will be the team member required to cover the holiday cases. You WILL be overworked & underpaid and the work-life balance is horrific."

During that time, the company has undergone significant changes - becoming leaner and more focused on it's core product offerings. As a result, the company's stock has appreciated significantly as new products have been launched successfully. This has greatly benefited the employees who participate in the stock purchase plan - where stock can be purchased at a discount twice each year. In addition, the company has funded an attractive yearly bonus, based on profitability. 

I have found the company to be very employee-friendly and a fun place to work. There are many perks that are offered during the year to build morale and loyalty.

Leadership was often changing in the beginning of my employment, but now we have talented, capable leaders who are stable in their positions. 

I feel that Boston Scientific has found it's footing and is moving forward with direction and purpose, providing excellent products for patients with serious health conditions and a promising future for its creative and dedicated employees.","There have been regular reductions in the workforce over the time I've been employed, but now those seem to have abated.

Middle-management fiddles while Rome burns, and upper-management accepts the sterilized data they're given. No room for excellent, experienced workers who understand the company and the industry, and they are systematically and periodically let go in waves of layoffs every year. Experienced workers are traded up for inexperienced workers at all professional levels/areas without the experience and history to call out their superiors' incompetence, and decision-making is based on cronyism. Business-as-usual is the mantra, and as is typical of large businesses since 2008 they are more interested in squeezing more hours and effort out of current employees to expand profits and bonuses than improving systems/processes or hiring additional workers for expansion."
