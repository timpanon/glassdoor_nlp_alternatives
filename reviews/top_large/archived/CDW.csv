0,CDW,What Really Matters,2022-03-15,5.0,Sales Manager,"There are many reasons why I have been at CDW for the past 17 years. Many of them are reasons that you could find at other place but the one that makes this place different is the PEOPLE. Everyone says it but it's different here. Our team has grown exponentially but our culture continues to be a ""big family"" focused on solving customer problems. We care for each other in order to ensure we bring our best selves to work for our customers. We literally are the living example of Ubuntu - I am because we are!",Compensation has room for improvement
1,CDW,Best Employer,2022-03-29,5.0,Account Manager,"Supportive management, great sales incentives, opportunity to grow in your career",low base pay during the first few years
2,CDW,Great Place to Work,2022-04-04,4.0,Senior Manager,"Overall the company has a great culture, is focused on improving its ESG and DE&I strategy, and has a creative approach and feels like a Start Up. The people are really outstanding and it really feels like you're working with a great team who has your back. I've been happy working here and would recommend the company to others",The compensation and overall company benefits seem light compared to other leading tech companies
3,CDW,Okay for what it is,2022-02-21,3.0,Account Manager,"- good starter job
- easy to get hired at other OEM companies if you start here
- fun spiffs
- work from home
- more laid-back culture than other similar jobs
- potential to make lots of money","- disgustingly low base salary 30k when you start and then goes to 25k when you get ""promoted""
- typical metrics-driven sales job, managers only care about how many outbound calls you can make
- limited internal opportunities, CDW stresses that they love to promote from within, which they do, but it's difficult to get into management positions still
- lots of bureaucracy, very difficult to accomplish anything, which results in angry customers
- unrealistic sales numbers to hit
- depending on what sales team you get put on, your chances of making any sort of a living wage are non-existent. I work on a government team, which hasn't been bad, but I would recommend steering clear of small biz and non-profit"
4,CDW,A company that really cares,2022-03-16,5.0,Creative Designer,CDW understands that listening is just the beginning and that action comes next to really make a difference. I see CDW making changes constantly to create a better and more inclusive workplace. It's important to vocalize what is needed and it's nice to work in an atmosphere where you feel heard.,"The benefits are good but basic, I hope they can become more competitive in the near future."
5,CDW,Great Company,2022-03-28,4.0,Purchasing Supervisor,"Work life balance, flexibility, valued input, great coworkers, good managers","old systems, pay is not competitive to industry, overall rewards/bonuses/gifts are given all to sales."
6,CDW,Forefront of tech industry,2022-03-29,5.0,SLED Account Manager,Great place to get insight for all major tech players,Base pay is very low
7,CDW,"If it’s good, it’s great. If it’s bad, get out.",2022-03-23,2.0,Account Representative,"CDW as a corporation is great employer. Selling there, you do ethical work you can be proud of (which isn’t always true for sales careers), and corporate treats their employees well. Although, that is all succumbent on the people you work with also being great.

Best outcome: you have a good boss and a good book of business. It’s a fun job that still has its challenges to keep things interesting. You develop relationships with your customers and over time can start making hand over fist while often simultaneously doing less work - both in levels of hours and frustration.","CDW has a very high turnover rate with new sales reps, but also a very large number of employees who spend their entire working career with the company. This is because it is a very sink or swim environment. And unfortunately, sinking at cdw often is not at the fault of the one sinking.

Worst outcome: you have a bad boss and a bad book of business. It’s a tiresome and incredibly frustrating job. You put in loads of work and see next to no reward. If your customers have no money, you can’t sell what they can’t spend. If you have a bad boss on top of that, they will not care to give you better accounts and you’re stuck in a rut where you have to work twice as hard just to stay afloat. It does not help when the leadership system is heavily based on publicizing sales numbers, putting you to shame day after day. On your first day, you might hear what is said fairly frequently at cdw “it’s either the easiest 6 figure job in the world, or the hardest 30k job in the world”. That statement is incredibly accurate."
8,CDW,Good company,2022-03-01,4.0,Principal Solution Architect,The company pays well and has good benefits overall.,"If I had to come up with some shortcomings I would say that they could improve their vacation policy, which starts at 2 weeks for everybody. Expect to be busy, since they tend to staff on the lean side, but not so busy that you're working after hours too often. Also the turnover in mid-level leadership is frequent so priorities often change, but I suppose that isn't so different from other big companies."
9,CDW,Opportunity,2022-03-23,5.0,Account Manager,Lots of opportunity to grow within the company,"Hard work, long hours, it’s sales"

12,CDW,Great company,2022-03-21,5.0,Sales Representative,Great place to work and start sales career in technology.,Inside sales model is not for everyone
13,CDW,Great place to work,2022-03-15,5.0,Sales Manager,"Work with great people, team environment, career advancement opportunities",Not enough time in the day to get to everything
14,CDW,Meh,2022-03-16,2.0,Full Time Employee,Great benefits and great opportunity for networking!,"The ServiceNow department is horrible. Awful culture, tons nepotism, not allowed to bring your ideas to the table. The turn over rate is so high and more people are struggling to stay on. CDW needs to check the ServiceNow department entirely. They have trouble integrating within CDW and there’s lots of push back on standard policies and SLAs. Makes it very hard to work collaboratively and makes the environment less healthy."
15,CDW,Great place to work,2022-03-15,5.0,Manager,"Coworker focused and competitive, high-growth environment.",Salary and compensation not great unless you're a senior leader.
16,CDW,Amazing organization with great direction and opportunities to grow,2021-11-03,5.0,Sales,"Terrific culture filled with leaders who care from top to bottom.
So many areas / departments that are growing and expanding. If you start in sales and have ~3 years of success, doors are wide open for you to move to management, other departments, other roles, etc.
Stock price continues to rise, lots of acquisitions are made to provide more services to offer our customers, and we have great communication.
Investing in new tools for us internally such as Salesforce, Kronologic, Zoominfo, etc.
Opportunity to make great money, might take a little time but the payoff is there.
Many Coworkers around me have been here 10+ years, a bunch now 20+ years... all while welcoming in outside talent and newly graduated talent. Truly a great mix.
Very focused on DEI.
Strong culture filled with many hard worked who get things done.","Nothing unique to CDW is a ""con"". In sales it takes hard work and dedication... but then you can be very well compensated over time.
No more ""rules"" or ""politics"" than any other large company... I would argue that type of stuff is fairly small at CDW vs. other Fortune 500 companies. We still refer to all our Coworkers form our CEO on down by their first name."
17,CDW,CDW,2022-03-15,5.0,Analyst,Great company and leadership. Very welcoming culture.,No con's to share at this time.
18,CDW,A lot of work,2022-03-16,4.0,Contract Analyst,Nice company to work for,Busy all the time. Poor work and life and work balance
19,CDW,Sweet place to work,2022-03-09,5.0,Business Development Manager,"Great Culture, leadership and company market insight","While there is work/life balance, the nature of the job tends to take over a lot of your life while not directly working."

22,CDW,Great start to consulting,2022-02-09,4.0,Consulting Engineer,"The ACE Program is a great way to get started with consulting, and get a solid foundation of technical knowledge. Challenging work, but great support.","You will not be compensated based on your performance. They will, like most companies, pay you as little as they believe they can get away with. You will need a competing job offer on the table before they will play ball with salary."
23,CDW,Consulting Engineer,2022-01-05,5.0,Network Engineer,"- Amazing Culture
- Lots of Support
- Strong Base Pay Increases
- Strong Quarter Bonuses","Not a con for me, but maybe for some... See below,

This position requires one to be extremely organized all of the time. You're not responsible for selling projects, however, you are responsible for accepting work as it comes in and managing your utilization hours. Your position basically combines a consultant, an engineering role, and a Project Manager role all into one job. This may be a big transition for those leaving an operations role, however, it's nice leaving the after-hours rotation behind. The expectation is for you to manage multiple projects at one time so if you can take great notes, you're already ahead of the game."
24,CDW,4 out of the 25 or so in my hiring class are still here.,2022-03-23,1.0,Small Business Sales Representative,"Team, my team was awesome really nice people that were always very helpful.","Several
- Pay 
- Commission Structure 
- Amount of work you are expected to do for pay
- If you are going to work here watch out, they never withheld federal taxes and I ended up having to pay an extremely high tax return for 2021"
25,CDW,Was better before COVID,2022-02-25,4.0,Account Manager,"Ton of resources, solid training, good work/life balance",The job is great… if you’re in any sector besides Small Business. Small Biz receives much worse commission compared to other sectors. The pay is significantly lower than the other account manager roles available elsewhere
26,CDW,Good upside for people determined to hit the phones,2022-02-23,4.0,Account Representative,"Work life balance
Social and friendly coworkers
Freedom to do the job the way that works for you","Likely to start with a small book and make little money
A lot of phone calls"
27,CDW,great company,2022-03-07,5.0,Security Officer,"positive motivation, lots of upward or lateral mobility opportunities, lots of swag.",none that I can think of
28,CDW,It’s okay,2022-03-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Flexible work environment and nice people,It’s basically a call center.
29,CDW,Short staffed,2022-03-09,3.0,Financial Analyst,"Good benefits, involved in community.","Perpetually under staffed which means people are alway training and coworkers are in and out of positions. This means working lots of extra hours.

Goal setting is obnoxious for those whose jobs are in a support role."
30,CDW,"Better than most Pro services firms, but quickly slipping away",2022-02-22,3.0,Senior Consulting Engineer,"Enforcing work/life boundaries is not frowned upon
Good base pay / regular pay increases
Employee retention is high; Experienced engineers in every silo as a result
High autonomy in my role","-Poor bonus structure for engineers which was changed prior to COVID, has resulted in large swaths of billable resources not able to hit bonus which was usually a given, resulting in ~25% loss of wages for most engineers; Management has indicated this will not change short-term and so competitive compensation at CDW has slipped dramatically 

Poor stock options - After being here 10+ years I have only ever received stock grants that are less than a single paycheck and vest after 3 years; Yet company has money to make billion-dollar acquisitions on the regular. 

Disconnect between upper management and teams - Upper management has a lot of good ideas, but these ideas and changes are made with no real world input from engineering, or players at the team/individual contributor level, resulting in poor execution of good-on-paper-only ideas

Horrible lower management: Managers routinely act in ways that make most question how they got the role. One manager in particular went AWOL for over a year and came back with zero knowledge on how to perform their role/was not replaced by management. Resulting team went from one of the highest grossing teams year over year in the company to one of the worst, with little to no care expressed by upper management.

-High retention also leads to a significant amount of ageism between younger coworkers and older employees who have been around for 15+ years. Many of the experienced engineers are on autopilot/not open to change and the apathy is real. Young engineers are routinely shut down when making positive suggestions ""because this is the way we have always done it"".

-Sales driven company: Sales can do no wrong, and often sell things that don't exist or make huge omissions in project scoping. Engineering is expected to deal with it and clean up the mess, causing engineers to perform pre-sales work not in their job description on a regular basis. Any attempt to mend the process or attempt at bringing attention to glaring omissions is frowned upon.

-Low mobility opportunities: Changing teams is often pre-determined / given to favorites without opening positions to the general population of engineers."

Flexible with PTO requests
Lots of different positions within the company","New VP for Configurations is in the process of restructuring a lot of different departments. Job stability and expectations are largely unclear as a result. 
No formal training program. Everything I learned was through trial and error or through other colleagues in my position. 
Lack of growth opportunities unless you network. 
Salary is not competitive for position.
You are considered expendable until you are hired on. Most everybody starts as a contractor."

34,CDW,Lazy employees,2022-03-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay a lot of money to employees that do very little work,"Lazy employees, Training is horrible! They are not a hunter gather sales team they elephant hunt in accounts they have already sold. Anytime a new product or service is rolled out they basically throw it against the wall to see if it sticks! They are not very welcoming of outsiders since most of them have milked the system for years and years and somehow managed to keep their jobs."

They were always encouraging and treated me like a peer rather than someone below them. Additionally, you design your schedule. The job is extremely flexible","Although flexible, the internship lacked guidance. It was my job to decide who to speak with on campus; it was my sole responsibility to find customers for CDW to work with. At times I felt as if I was pushing the company to much on to contacts."
46,CDW,BDM,2022-02-02,4.0,Sales BDM,Great people and a wonderful community. There are business resource groups available for everyone so you can feel welcome.

55,CDW,"Steady, Strong Performer worth considering",2021-12-19,4.0,Experienced Senior Project Specialist,"CDW has strong roots and the CEO Chris Leahy will only bring more fuel to the fire that drives motivation and an abundance of innovations that will propel the company past its already amazing ability to thrive. The core daily workers adapted well throughout Covid, and the company has outperformed in keeping employees informed of security and health issues that have been stressing . They have a loyal workforce who love what they do, and have career learning tools should you wish to pursue added skills to your career growth. There are the normal benefits for healthcare, wellness, and retirement options to choose from however they set the bar high for themselves and have a substantial variety of A+ social network groups and career development applications. This beloved company is a pleasure to work with and maintains that high tech innovation while having a firm grip on their family hometown feel core.","Compensation includes any benefits they match to calculate ""competitive"" salary, whereas Glassdoor does not, base is simply only your salary being calculated, so keep that in mind when considering working here. There are not many cons to this company because they really do care about their customers and employees however they tend to have a herd mentality for company titles that can make it a challenge still with vertical movement and opportunity. There has been a noticeable diminishing of incentives for business side to outperform past goal. They do collect your ideas, they do listen, but some those may be implemented without you and to the benefit to who is going to champion the idea. Even though you may be performing at a higher skill level, you are advised to seek elsewhere within CDW or elsewhere period, if there is not a vertical position open to accommodate your skill level. Hence salaries are not as competitive since they have the ability to tamper down salaries by lack of open positions and/or titles availability."

They have a good program and talk to us all of the time and give us suggestions to use at work and with our families. I speak to friends that work at other company's distribution centers and factories and they don't have the same help and assistance. I have lost two friends to COVID that worked at other locations that caught it at their work. If you are scared to work at your companies and want a safe place to work, come to CDW. The safety director was out here a couple of days ago to speak to us and we were appreciating him doing that. He showed he gave a damn about us. CWS ladies here are also good and easy to talk to. Some of the contractors that are here are not great so we need to do a better job picking who works here.",We changed our safety procedures a little in the fall and got rid of masks and spacing but luckily we quickly returned to using them. We heard our operations managers wanted to make it easier for them and asked for those changes but that safety security and some exec people made them put everything back. I was glad we moved back to masks because we want to stay safe and many of us thought it was stupid to change it. We used to have safety belts that could tell when we were too close and we don't have those gizmos any more and I wish we did. Those made us very comfortable and now we are working too close. I have my vaccine but some of my friends and family are getting sick even though they had the vaccine so we should stay away from each other to make sure it doesnt happen here. Lets make it all like it was before please. I am not the only person that believes this but we don't want to tell anyone and speak against our operations supervisors and managers. I have a friend that works in the configs place and they agree with us and said they need it more because they are very close.

Whether it's standing up for employee rights, recognizing employee contributions, or providing financial rewards, I see that CDW truly cares.

CDW Strives to do and be better - CDW is constantly innovating, acquiring companies to broaden and improve their offerings, being introspective about new capabilities, and encouraging employees to achieve goals that further the company's mission.","Hard-working culture - Work/life balance can suffer at the expense of serving its customers

Education
Growth
Leadership
Culture
Benefits",None. My advice is to deeply research a day in the life of a consulting engineer and see if the position is for you before applying.
105,CDW,CDW,2021-12-16,4.0,Account Manager,CDW is a great company to work for. They take care of you.,They do not pay you much. you must earn every cent.

The team culture was great and every person I met with was helpful and enjoyed talking about the culture. Very early on I met with members of various teams and got a clear understanding of my role, and what my daily job duties would include.","I am a few months in, and haven't found anything worth noting.

109,CDW,A Great Company to Dedicate Your Career to!,2021-10-11,5.0,Solution Specialist,"The company truly values its employees and works hard to show it in a broad range of ways-including through bonuses and compensation. An overwhelming majority of employees have long tenures-because of career continuity and job satisfaction coupled with solid health, 401k, and many other employee perks and benefits. Many employees who left to work directly for partner tech companies at triple their CDW salary came back after a short while-realizing they missed the culture and stability even at a lower salary. CDW calls these employees ""boomerangs"" and there are a great many who tested the waters elsewhere and returned. Employees are very respectful of each other and genuinely always happy to help answer the many questions a new employee will undoubtedly have. Career growth is great at CDW as you don't get trapped in a role because you are awesome at it-you can continue to grow and move internally every 1 to 2 years easily if you want to. Even though salaries are lower than most tech companies-the culture and stability mostly make up for that-CDW tries to keep people employed even when eliminating roles by finding another spot for you internally. A very low % of people have been laid off for a company with over 10K employees. Now there are many more opportunities to work 100% remotely--a direct result of the pandemic.","No company is perfect, and there is always room for improvement. CDW is a large company and though it encourages evolution and process improvement and executives solicit feedback on what works and what doesn't-change doesn't come quickly. Some structural issues create disincentives to do certain types of work because of how bonuses are awarded which makes some roles more challenging than others. Compensation is lower than most tech companies and could use improvement."

They lie, contradict each other, show no appreciation, and give really low raises.  Very high turnover and there is currently a mass exodus of long term employees who are tired of not getting promoted, not being appreciated and being given unmanageable workloads.  Management seems like a bunch of robots, trained to use the same sound bites.  They constantly tell us how every situation can be turned into a positive; they promise change but do not deliver.  It’s a highly dysfunctional environment.  The Sales team is rude, demanding, impatient and treats sales support very poorly.  I am pretty sure CDW pays people to write “good” reviews because I don’t know anyone who is happy working there.  Cheap company, silos their employees, poor internal communication and management will lie to your face.

CDW supports me in my career goals and encourages me with a wealth of resources for advancing my technical and professional skills to keep me relevant in the ever changing, fast-paced IT industry.","I've worked from home for the majority of my career at CDW. While I do travel to customer sites around the US from time to time, that travel has become a lot less frequent to almost non-existent. While I prefer to work from home, there is somewhat of a disconnect from your traditional management structure - this is ok if you can self-govern but for individuals who require more direction, this might hinder you from being successful. You have to be self-motivated in this type of work environment (although not all jobs at CDW are work-from-home) which has not been a problem for me, but might not be a good fit for everyone."
198,CDW,Best company ever,2021-01-14,5.0,Senior Project Manager,"I have been at CDW for ten years and love the culture. a Healthy Work/Life balance is stressed. I have the ability to pick my projects; they are not just assigned. If I am having an issue with a project, my manager and others are there to assist and if I request it. If things are really bad and I believe the project will fail because I cannot fix it, they will take it off my plate and give to someone else. And you are not judged poorly for doing it. In fact, you are praised for knowing your shortcomings and doing what is right for the project/customer.

Management is fair and listens to the employees. We take a survey each year, it is tabulated and then management comes out with an answer to the major issues and what will be done. They share that with the coworkers.","Because of the fast-paced environment, it is hard to take a vacation. Taking a vacation means that someone else has to take your project over for a period of time and we all work very hard; taking on another project, even for a week, is difficult."

228,CDW,Pivoting for Success amidst a Global Pandemic,2020-10-18,5.0,Corporate Human Resources Manager,"* Handling of the COVID-19 Crisis: CDW enabled the great majority of us to work from home back in March. Investing in the technology and tools to make us effective from our home offices. Leadership has extended WFH through at least 1/1/21 for our health and safety. The company has gone to great extents to keep the distribution center coworkers and contractors safe during this trying time while they continue to deliver for our customers.

*Keeping our Customers at the Center: All coworkers can articulate how what they do everyday helps our customers. It's a shared mission to help our customers with all of their technology needs - and those coworkers who live the mission are rewarded well. 

*Innovation and Growth - Top leadership has invested heavily (bringing in key talent and funding projects) to position CDW for what the future will bring. I have a high degree of confidence that we are prepared for whatever tech trends are next.",*Not seeing coworkers: My favorite part of the job was being in the office with my teammates. Working from home is convenient but I miss the interaction and fun of being together in the office. Can't wait until this pandemic is behind us and it is safe to return!
229,CDW,Review,2021-09-06,5.0,Software Engineer,Nice I place to work,Boring at times but a good new cfo
230,CDW,Very Challenging but Can be Lucrative,2020-09-22,4.0,Account Representative,"For a large company, it's a pretty good one to work for. Management is usually competent and professional. The executives are transparent with the company's direction, goals, and pains. Benefits are average but healthcare costs are more than average. The company believes in advancing your career and finding new internal opportunities. They also believe in charitable causes and even have a charitable match program.","Work-from-home programs have been frowned upon by many departments/positions, but hopefully that changes post-COVID. I know healthcare costs are always rising, but my CDW healthcare cost is always more than my wife's has been at her employers. Account representative/account manager roles at CDW are very difficult. Base salary is extremely low and even goes down after your second year. The biggest issue though is there's barely any time for proactive selling, which is what we should be doing. Internal processes are extremely time-consuming and wrought with problems. It's basically 80% of your time is more like project management. It's a very transactional sales role. The first two years in the role are extremely difficult and hard to make a decent wage."
231,CDW,Culture and Values are degrading after Tom Richards,2021-11-18,1.0,Finance,It use to be a great company,"- No growth opportunities
- Lack of vision by leadership
- Political work environment"
232,CDW,Great Company,2021-08-27,4.0,Senior Project Manager,For the most part a great company to work for,there are some bad apples. Management heavy as well.
233,CDW,Finally found a company I want to stay with for the rest of my career,2021-05-13,5.0,Manager,"*Very pro co-worker (employee) atmosphere. Most co-workers are very collaborative and want to help you. Since this company is based in the midwest- you generally work with wholesome nice ""salt of the earth ""people. Outside of sales, they aren't cut throat and try to take care of their people.
*COVID Response- the company had all of the employees that could work remotely work remotely, we have a configuration center that was an essential operation, if there were any issues, they had the whole center professionally sanitized to keep the config center workers safe. Our health and safety has always been #1. Unlike other companies, CDW hasn't rushed us back into the office- they have being taking surveys, seeing what people are comfortable with and are cautiously going forward. I'm glad they aren't pushing people to get back into the office ASAP- they been very understanding and been very respectful of employees privacy and wishes. 
* Fertility Benefits just got upgraded BIG time- CDW in 2021 has partnered with Progyny for fertility benefits. You can get 3-4 cycles of IVF, Egg Transfer, along genetic testing covered. This is offered to all employees including LBTQ+ couples and single people who want to start a family on their own. Also they will pay for 3-4 rounds of Elective Egg Freezing which is outstanding if you are an unpartnered female. Having friends who are in deep debt because of lack of IVF coverage with their work, this is huge if you are looking at starting a family.
* A company will never be your family and I dislike when companies compare themselves to that. That being said, CDW is the company that has gotten me closest to that ""feeling"". Everyone here is really nice and I feel very supported here. Other companies I feel like I could get fired at any moment and not know why or because I wasn't part of the ""in crowd"". Outside of sales (they are performance based), if there is an issue, they will have you work with your manager to level set expectations and try to met those goals. There's no surprises when it comes to my performance and I feel much more secure here than any other job I have had.
*Annual Increase- If you have a good rating, CDW usually does a merit increase each year. This is amazing because at least your salary increases each year 
 which helps a lot with inflation. Not many companies do this at all and every year you have to ""fight"" for more money. I'm so glad I don't have to do this anymore and can get a merit increase for being great at my job. When my rent goes higher I don't freak out as my merit increase will cover it and I can maintain my lifestyle.","* Too many, tools process and admin work- 60-70% my job is dealing with discrepancies, pushing orders through, making exceptions etc. CDW makes it work but processes are very complex and it takes years to learn all the nuances of everything. I'm still not sure how everything exactly works and I can thankfully lean on others to help me if I don't know something.
* CDW needs to work in it's diversity. They done an awesome job of promoting white women into their senior leadership and C-suite roles. They need to start promoting people of color and women of color into management and senior leadership positions- that *aren't* D&I/HR roles. I will say as a person of color- this is the most supportive and comfortable working environment I've been. I have no plans on leaving, I know CDW and Chris Leahy are actively working on changing this and I look forward to seeing what they do to change this.
*401k/ESPP- could be much better, not competitive with what other tech companies offer."

Allow self 12 months with goal to move on and specialize.",CDW is a revenue generating machine. Period. Most new hires figure out compensation is substandard and long term benefits and lack of pension and lack of stock awards don't exist. Executive management has no issue dipping their toe into the Sales pool and taking money from Account Managers. SPIF's which were big part of an Account Managers compensation have been eliminated. Account Managers generally last 16-20 months and realize the futility of a long term sales career before leaving. Team Sales Managers also have a high burn out rate and realize there isn't a work life balance.

292,CDW,Maybe Wait a Year or Two to Apply,2021-05-17,2.0,Program Sales,"Work from home flexibility was good even before the pandemic; strong and sincere focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion permeates the org; leadership culture and the CDW way give the impression that you're working for a company that really values ethical behavior (at least in theory, if not always perfectly in practice). The work for the negotiations team is always interesting, and for the most part the people are great.","In a little over two years, the team I was part of turned over twice, and 2021 has seen a mass exodus of people in program sales at large, but most especially on the Negotiations team. Job has an extremely steep learning curve, but there's virtually no one left to train you (other than management, there's no one left with more than a year working on public contracts). Broken down vetting processes and a lack of SLAs ensures conflict between negotiators - who are dealing with unsustainable workloads - and the internal stakeholders who rely on that work being done timely. Department as a whole operates reactively, which leaves the team constantly scrambling. Enablement initiatives and process improvement efforts either get abandoned because no one has time or actively make things worse (like the new CMS: no one asked for it, it's barely functional, there was barely any training or communication about when it would go live, it requires substantially more data entry and triples the time it takes to perform simple tasks, and it's only actually useful for about half of everything that comes across your desk). 

While it seems like management is finally making strides towards fixing the substantially below market pay, it might be too little too late (imagine if some of that had gone towards retaining folks with some level of institutional knowledge). For the sake of the people still there, I hope they manage to turn things around. Maybe the benefit of losing all your institutional knowledge is losing all your institutional bad juju. It's still not a position I'd recommend to anyone anytime soon."

Account representatives make a low base of 35k and Okies they are promoted to account managers their base drops to 25k and at account managers and account executives make a low 20k base. Not to mention goals are constantly set so high it’s almost impossible to achieve. The only people making real money are the highest level, CIO’s, CEO. Team managers have no real power to make change and upper level management is constantly hitting account managers with fees to pay for new resources. They’re constantly increasing work load and decreasing pay. The health plans are extremely expensive and not very good. You only get accumulated two weeks time off which is awful and 5 days sick time which also has to be accumulated. I’m not sure how they got best place to work this past year because everyone on the sales team hates working here and wants to quit. Save yourself the stress and work somewhere else."

Great internal mentoring structure that is unique to CDW from my personal perspective.

Network Security team is national, and most work has been mostly done remote. 

Company is constantly pursuing new security technologies, and is keen on ensuring the engineers get the proper training to be fully capable consultants for that technology.

Given the nature of consulting services (especially in the security sector), you are constantly being exposed to new technologies. When combined with plenty of projects, it makes for unique job security/opportunity in the form of constantly learning about new technologies that businesses are using/wanting to use.

If you have a passion for technology, starting out as an associate in a given track (NetSec, InfoSec, Enterprise, UC, Wireless) is an incredible opportunity without requiring a ton of previous job experience. The benefits of the program become more clear as you advance, and the connections to make internally and externally are very, very valuable.","Nature of the work itself often requires working late nights around weekends, depending on the technology/product you're deploying.

Base pay is decent, but salary reviews (for associates) relies on passing your second board exam. This requirement combined with massive Cisco certification changes forces the underlying internal curriculum to change. This places associates, especially those who started in 2019-2020, stuck between a rock and a hard place, as you must rapidly study and pass certifications, perform client work and prepare for a board exam that may or may not be changing.

If you fail your board exams, you're essentially delaying your potential for a raise, getting out of the associate program, and progressing your career with CDW."

338,CDW,Good Place to Learn the IT Industry and Grow Your Skills that Can Also Limit Career Opportunities,2021-04-01,3.0,Senior Brand Manager,"If you have not worked in the IT Industry before CDW is a great training ground, and the PPM department is a great place to get cross-functional experience across multiple departments in the company inclusive of sales, procurement, finance, and marketing. This experience is invaluable in understanding the interconnectivity of the departments, and how they can be leveraged to differentiate your brand or product.

Overall employees vested in your success and the success of the company. A lot of people really love CDW and that feeling can be contagious. There are a lot of company outings and activities (pre-COVID) with many genuine friendships developed over time.

There are many education and training opportunities. Partnerships with colleges such as CLC and DePaul enabled several employees to earn advanced degrees. Lean Six Sigma trainings occur regularly. Linkedin Learning encouragement. Most anyone is willing to help you pick up a new skill so if you don't have a ton of experience you can get it pretty quickly.

When the company says family first they do mean it. I never had an issue leaving for a doctor appointment, injured dog, or working from home last minute because kids were sick. Much of the PPM team has kids so there is a mutual understanding and respect for this. If you have young kids this is a really good department to be in.

You will work with some of the top technology brands in the world. By understanding how those organizations work and interact with different channels you get a better understanding of the industry in aggregate and not just where CDW plays.

Recent leadership changes in the department bode well for the future. They are hiring strategic leaders with the necessary experience to make meaningful change to better leverage resources.","Pay is significantly below other types of positions in the IT industry (At least 25% less). It is repeatedly highlighted in company surveys and the line is they understand, but believe their total benefits outweigh the salary. The challenge with this line is my wife's insurance was less at 3 separate companies. Maternity/Paternity Leave is far less generous (2 weeks for dads up from just 3 days 2 years ago for example compared to several months). You do not get days off like MLK Day, day after Thanksgiving, etc... that other companies have off and/or schools are closed meaning you have to dip into PTO to accommodate these days. 

Job titles in partner and product management make it hard to leave. Brand Managers and Senior Brand Managers should be called ""Partner Managers"" because the responsibility is working with the assigned partner to grow the business. Brand Managers in other industries are responsible for the P&L for their assigned lines inclusive of manufacturing, supply chain, promotions, etc... P&L ownership does not occur until you reach Category Manager. Your job title responsibilities will not line up with other companies with similar titles decreasing your mobility to other companies and industries in the long term.

Another challenge is you can be blocked from moving to companies in the same industry. Moving to a manufacturer is possible, but approval is often required and more often than not is denied. While PPM leadership will say they have no problem with you leaving to a manufacturer (several have worked there themselves) when push comes to shove they make sure external opportunities are limited.

If you are looking for a career that is marketing focused, PPM is not the best department to be in. A large portion of the department are former sales people who transitioned over making it feel more like a sales organization than partner and product marketing. Marketing is a separate department and PPM roles are responsible for getting partners to invest more heavily in marketing. Marketing is pre-packaged and often leans more towards velocity products like laptops/monitors instead of solutions based products that have longer sales cycles. Regardless of how effective the marketing is you are responsible for selling it to partners.

As CDW has grown the flexibility of PPM roles to influence their business has decreased. 2 years ago you had ability to invest funds however you wanted to grow the business within reason. Today all activities are heavily regulated and scrutinized making marketing and events very cookie-cutter.

Your success in PPM greatly depends on your manager and department. The onboarding process for sales is highly structured, but PPM is hodge podge. With a good manager this can be overcome, otherwise you can easily get lost in the shuffle at the start."

After working in the Managed Services department for a decade, I can tell you that this place is run horribly. 

We were often expected to work 50+ hours with no compensation. 

The worst people somehow get promoted to management, and even openly brag about how many times they've been reported to HR. One manager (who is married and has kids) would ""joke"" about how he'd do favors for female employees if they dated him. 

There is a strong inner circle that gets promoted more often, and refusal to participate completely eliminates your chances at advancing. 

One employee made racist remarks at another, and when it was reported, the victim was punished and the harasser was promoted to a manager. Another time an employee made a racist joke, and when I reported them, I was told to ""stop picking on him."" 

I was paid well under market value for my position, and when I asked if I could be compensated fairly (new hires made twice as much), I was told by my boss to ""get used to eating peanut butter sandwiches"" to save money.

The health benefits are expensive and cover almost nothing. One year I had to pay the maximum out of pocket ($15,000) because none of it was covered even though the provider was in network. They do an employee survey every year, and one of the consistently most reported problems is benefits, but they do nothing to change them. 

I was once kept in limbo of being promised a promotion, but they would constantly tell me ""it's not in the budget,"" then spend stupid money on new chairs, or bigger TVs in my office.

We would often joke that CDW shouldn't have customers because of their complete inability to deliver on anything. The NOC in Managed Services gets an absurd amount of tickets, and instead of focusing on ticket reduction (most of them are meaningless noise), they keep adding on. They also introduce new services that do nothing, but cost money for some reason. They don't sufficiently staff any team, so everyone is spread so thin that you're constantly overworked, and you're treated like garbage if you have a problem with it.

They constantly tout their diversity and inclusion, but women and minorities are treated like crap here, to the extent that it can be an aggressive environment. They once received a report of rampant sexual harassment by managers, and instead of punishing them, they held a series of meetings to listen to the problems women had, and then did nothing with them. But that's CDW, appear to care, but never do anything to prove it. 

I could go on and on about this, but I will summarize everything by saying ""never work here."" I say that as someone who was promoted many times, and was overall treated better than most people."

Being able to show up every single day and interact with my team and other Account Managers has truly taught me how to be better in my role. My manager is extremely supportive and challenges me daily.,"The longer you are here and start to work on larger projects, most of your job is taken up by waiting for partners and other resources to do theirs."
353,CDW,Not Everything It's Promised to Be,2020-12-08,3.0,Corporate Account Representative,The company culture is good. Managers are all friendly and know how to push you to do your best. If you don't mind being on the phone and sales is your thing then this might be for you.,"Work life balance is nearly impossible to manage. Job expectations for the first few months are a bunch of calls each day, then managing the sales process for low-spend customers. If a recruiter tells you you'll make 50K+ in a year ask them to show salary and commission that you will be set up on then do your own math. In my eyes, you're just a glorified Best Buy employee for the first 6 months."

363,CDW,Peace of mind,2020-11-20,5.0,Contractor,"I was assigned to work at 4 other companies in Lake County and one in Cook this year before coming to CDW. I left the other places  because there safety  for corannavirus  was terrible. I was afraid to bring coronnavirus  to my husband and his mom at home.  i asked my manager to send me to CDW because the employees at my company  told me about the reputation that CDW had for having great coronnavirus safety. They finally had an opening and sent me to CDW. It was amazing! The thermals cameras, the strict security guards that checked the floors all of the time  to make sure everyone was behaving,  and safety employee  stopping by to see if I needed anything  and tell me how to stay safe, and the way they take people out and hold them out 14 days if they are even a little  sick just in case is very good.  We all felt SUPER  comfortable working there because the security guards and manager  didn't mess around  when it came to our safety. And they really care. They even have a HUGE poster in the CDC that tells us we are special and that  they do it all for us. And we can tell they mean it because they would take time to make that and then act on it. I was pregnant and didn't tell anyone until I had to resign to have my daughter  but I want to go back when my new daughter is old enough. I felt safer there than I did when I wasn't at work. We also got free food and employees and contractors were made to feel the same and respected. Oh and fun work.",The only bad thing is having to leave and hoping I can get assigned back there. My husband works at a different company and when I tell him about our safety people and prosses he gets mad because his company is close to us and doesnt have anything like we do to stay safe. He had two friends that died from Coronnavirus that worked at his company. His mom's job is like his too and they keep closing and opening like my husbands because too many people getting sick  in the warehouse and spreading coronnavirus to each other.  So the con is that my husband doesnt work at CDW too because he would be safe if he did and I wouldnt worry. . The other bad thing is that many of the ops supervisors don't do anything but sit down and are too friendly with some of us ladies. Unprofessional. Place is cleaned all of the time but  they have some clutter all over the place.

The things I sell today and vastly different than what I was selling 5 years ago, which is why I am able to grow my income year over year.","There is a severe lack of accountability in every department that supports the sales organization.  For example, ""customer service"" doesn't actually service any customers.  If a customer asks the most basic question of them, they forward the customer to their sales reps.   Sales reps more and more are increasingly asked to perform tasks that should absolutely be owned by purchasing, credit, and customer service departments.

There is a lot of talent and knowledge in the managed services and field services departments, so it's a great place for learning from your peers. The work environment is fairly relaxed, and even when sh!t hits the fan everyone still keeps their cool. Most of management would rather discuss issues than bark orders at their subordinates.","As time goes on, the company makes you feel more and more like a number and less like a person. Upper management and HR care more about if you are on-time than how much work you get done or how much value you add to the company. They push on supervisors to come down hard on employees for being 5 minutes late, but could care less if you work an additional 1 or 2 hours on top of your 12 hour shift."

You can only build your book so much based on government contracts among other limitations. The common saying is “just give it two years, drink the Kool-Aid and you’ll be happy”. Obviously instantaneous gratification is not realistic in most jobs that are worth it, but seeing is believing and some people just don’t see the same results even if they do all of the same things.

The bonus payments are way below any company I have been to.  The salary ranges are below market.  They are trying to hire college grads to lower costs of resources.

630,CDW,Low Pay High Bureaucracy,2020-05-15,2.0,Accounts Manager,"CDW offers an academy program that gives fairly in depth training on a wide breadth of product offerings. The academy gives you a decent baseline understanding of business technology.

Good place to start your career if you don't have a college degree as it will allow you to begin to build a professional network where you can find a legit technology sales job.","Of hundreds of technology companies offering sales positions in the greater Phoenix area this is the lowest I've seen in terms of pay (25,000$ base and a tiny commission on everything you sell). Don't be fooled by ""uncapped"" commission. The SMB teams might have 1 rep out of 20 with a six figure salary. Comparitively an entry level sales development role at a software company will range from 40-80,000$ and an actual opportunity for a short path to six figures.

If you can get past starting at $25,000 a year thinking you'll grind harder than all of your peers you better make sure that you fall within the bureaucratic plans of the husband and wife that lead the chandler office. No matter how hard you work there will be no opportunity for advancement if you do not fall within those 2 directors social rank. At other companies there are various factions that can aid your advancement not just 1 couple. When you leave the company it will almost certainly not be on good terms in managements view.

It used to be sort of fun until management grossly misbehaved at happy hours and forced a 2 drink maximum and if you're seen having a drink at lunch you will be fired.

Overall - If you're college educated without obvious professional red flags you have far greater opportunities than working for 25,000$ in the suburbs for dying monolithic company."

668,CDW,Great  Company,2020-01-08,5.0,Services Engagement Supervisor,"Culture, flexibility, people, benefits, career growth",They on average will only give you a 10% increase for a promotion so many people end up leaving the company and come back to make what they’re worth.

674,CDW,Your on an Island at an inside lead company,2019-09-18,2.0,Field Sales,"The work-life balance is amazing, goals are obtainable, management is relaxed based on your region. You can literally sell anything. Internal processes are amazing, especially the configuration services in the warehouse. CDW can integrate with all your customer's platforms. Great benefits programs","Your local resources are likely not good compared to smaller VARs in your region. The inside team calls most of the shots and can dictate what accounts you have access to. Partners don't view you as actually strategic or of much value beyond easy to transact with. Internal business systems (changepoint, SPS, etc) are horrendous."

tons of free food and collateral
job was not very stressful and fairly easy to pick up
Great entry level opportunities to IT/sales/data
Sales support managers are generally good people/managers","-non-sales coworkers are second-class citizens
-for temp-to-hires your employment does not officially start until you are hired directly. So if you are employed in a 3/6/12 month temp position regardless of how long you've been at the job, day 1 of your official CDW hire date you start with 0 vacation or sick hours. PTO is accrued at a rate of 6.66 vacay hrs a month, sick at 3.33 hrs a month so by keeping you temp-to-hire for 6 months you lose 1 full week of vacation vs. direct hire - a.k.a. try not to get hired as a contractor if you can help it.
-pay is embarrassingly low,
-benefits are poor - starts at 2 weeks vacation, doesn't increase until 4 years in
-paternity leave starts at 1 day after 1 year of employment and caps at 3 days total
-for a IT company with teams spread across multiple locations and the connectivity to support it the fact that remote work is frowned upon at best and completely denied at worst is absurd
- change is incredibly slow"

-Leadership wants the best for coworkers
-Hard working coworkers, dedicated to their work and collaborative environment
-Great Partner relationships
-Coworkers have the tools and resources (including budget) needed to get the job done and stand out.
-Big company, small company feel
-Good direction and strategy - Kelway acquisition was a good thing and well executed/transitioned","-Lots of coworkers have been with CDW for more over a decade...many in the same roles.  While this is a testament to a company people want to stay with, and one that takes care of its coworkers,it is also a challenge because some people tend to get complacent and stay in roles too long. 
-Marketing reorg has been challenging and doesn't seem well thought out which could result in losing key coworkers that the company needs to get to the next level.
-it's unclear in many roles where the next step career wise is or what promotion criteria is.  When people stay in positions so long it blocks others from moving up especially in areas like Marketing where there are less positions available overall.
-While the collaborative spirit of the org is great, in pockets it has created an environment of entitlement among some coworkers who don't understand that in business not everyone is included on every decision, nor should they be."
700,CDW,"Best company I’ve worked for, Hands Down.",2017-01-23,5.0,Enterprise Architect,"Having consulted for over 100+ companies, you get to see a lot of culture and company dynamics. CDW is hands down the best organization that I’ve worked for. Between the associate programs, and opportunities to grow personally and professionally, they care about their work force.  It shows too. CDW ranks in the top 10% during the annual surveys for employee satisfaction. The talent that CDW has on their workforce is superlative, and you always have someone to go to with questions – at any level of your professional career. While CDW is a large organization, the individual branches provide a smaller organization feel. Freedom of schedule and trust as a consultant is one of my favorite things at CDW. You truly can work autonomously, as a trusted professional should be able to do. If you want to work for a company, STRONGLY consider CDW. You won’t regret it.","CDW does see a bit of turnover in the HMS side of the house. While this is common with data centers, it may be indicative of needed change. Also, customers of CDW do require you to sacrifice some of your weekends, and nights. If this is a problem for your work/life balance, CDW may not be the best fit. Management promotes work life balance, but its ultimately up to you to enforce it."

Tons of resources.  I have friends at other technology companies and they dont have 5% of what we are able to offer customers.  
Self powered.  My managers have never micro managed me to death, allow and encourage me to take time off, visit customers, ect.
location, have to throw this in, its right across from Union Station.  I dont even come from the burbs but for those that do its awesome.  
Coworkers, work with a lot of great people that are great at what they do","Some of this will sound contradictory, so bare with me...
Coworkers, since CDW is such a large company I think we get desperate to hire at times.  That being said I have seen some morons
Starting off in Sales, it can suck.  Base pay isnt much and you need to grow your account base 
Work from home still isnt readily available for everyone, in sales you need to be at a top % of your group to get this perk.  I feel like we are a bit behind the curve here. IMO proven people that know what they are doing should get to work from home once in a while"
