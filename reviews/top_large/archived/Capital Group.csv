If you want to live in California or near another office location, this is a fabulous place to work.","Despite being very flexible with the amount employees are required to actually be in office, Capital will not allow permanent remote work or allow employees to live beyond commuting distance from what is considered their home office. This seems like a frustrating line in the sand to draw for a company that has gone almost totally remote in the Global Investment Control department.

You log in 8:30 am and take phone calls until lunch which is 30 minutes due to OT requirements and then end day at 6:30pm or 7p.m. In training you will get an hour lunch so enjoy it!
*If you don't care about connecting with others and just want a job that is transactional then this is a great job for you.
*IF you don't work the OT it does effect your review which effects your bonuses.
*You do get generous time off but it's hard to use it based on the area your in is dependent on the number of hours available. 
I.E. From Thanksgiving to Tax Time pretty much non existent.
*Training is done online and virtual. But was there over a year and never got to finish the training due to inbalance in company resources (time/associates/workload)
*Overall it once was a great company to work for but has gone down hill and is like a open wound gushing blood with no stop in sight.
*Transparency is lacking as well
*There is not a direct path for how to get from point A to point B in regards to career paths.

If you stick around long enough you might get lucky and get laid off.,"I don’t even know where to begin.  Call center area is like slave labor.  You are watched every minute of every day, including how often and how long you use the restroom. You’re chained to your desk.  My boss used to watch her clock and watch to see if everyone arrived on time in the mornings, after breaks, and after lunch.  If you were 1 minute late you were written up.   Don’t expect to be treated like adults with intelligence here, it is ONLY about numbers and metrics. They don’t treat you like humans. You’re discouraged from approaching or speaking to other managers or other departments without having your manager escort you and listen intently to your discussion there.  When I worked there every tv in every lunch or break room was tuned to Fox News always. We were not allowed to change the channel, in fact remotes and tv buttons were made purposely inaccessible to prevent this. My boss harassed me and made rude jokes about time off I took for medical reasons, as if to imply that my time off wasn’t warranted.  She also told other managers right in front of me that taking time off like I did for medical reasons shows a lack of work ethic (like hers). They’ll tout their MRP and time off, benefits blah blah blah, but in reality you’ll end up using your MRP funds up once you finally burn out and quit, to help keep you afloat until you find your next job.  I know of at least 6 former CG employees (including myself), that did exactly this with their MRP money. Also it doesn’t matter how much vacation time you get if they won’t actually let you take it when you want to.  Also they’ll lay you off eventually because their mutual funds are old school dinosaurs that no one wants, and they can’t plan for long term staffing needs to save their life.  

Run, run fast, and run long…..away from applying to this ridiculously old fashioned, micromanaging, and toxic company!!!!"

It can get pretty competitive up there and you will see group of people of the same consulting company meeting about the project you’re working on but you won’t be able to attend or know what they’re planning 

I used to have a lot of contractors in my team from Accenture and they were very competitive and did not welcome us in the group and it was very difficult to get anything done because they controlled most of the operation and the business process…

It can get very competitive a little bit toxic and it was not a very warm place to work I honestly hate it up there, and never felt like we were welcomed.. imagine having to play politics and having to pull and take over or push and pull on daily basis.. it was a draining me quick"

Company culture is very inclusive and understanding.,"The required overtime is absolutely ridiculous. Depending on your position you may be required to work an additional 2 - 8+ hours per week. When I initially started we were told we would have an opportunity for overtime here and there. Now it's required every week. This job is basically taking calls back to back, non-stop, for 8.5 to 10 hours a day. Recently they have made changes that include the amount of additional time worked in your review process. So, if you don't work the required overtime, then your performance review will be affected negatively. Also there are many times when required overtime is added late in the day...very short notice."

- good onboarding program 
- decent pay increase based on performance
- great retirement program","- You will never be more than an admin, ever. Promotions and growth are nearly impossible. They make it clear what you’re hired for and that you’re intended to stay in your lane and in that role indefinitely. 
- Say they want change & evolution but cut anyone who voices ideas at the knees. 
- You’re a second class citizen to others, especially managers. If your manager is an irrational micromanaging hothead , that’s clearly a “you” problem - even if they’ve had a revolving door of admins due to said manager. You need to accept it (ie. Grin & bear it) for they will not try to remedy the toxic manager’s behaviors and actually gaslight you along the way. 
- They will not take an admin’s side nor will they help you in hostile work environments with fellow colleagues. 
*Sadly this is not just a local issue but a global one. I knew of reports of office bullying that transpired in other locations, and their “resolution” was blaming or pushing out the victim vs. dealing with the bullies themselves. Seems to be CG’s global policy that squeaky wheels don’t get oil, they get called liars and/or get sacked.

123,Capital Group,Going downhill fast,2021-07-10,2.0,Customer Service Representative,Pros? There use to be but not anymore.,They do not care about their employees. Required overtime hours are constant and ending. There’s been overtime so much that they’ve made it part of your yearly review. You don’t work it then you get ding’d on your compensation. Now they are onto their next associate crushing mission which is to MAKE some associates work in the office. Not because they are essential but because it’s considered a perk to wfh. They like to throw the word PERK around a little too loosely. The stress of having to be perfect in the office was prevalent prior to the pandemic but not using it as a form of punishment is taking it too far. Now there are talks of making associates that wfh work later hours because of course they have more flexibility. Work/life balance is a joke. More work = less life

Your success, raises, work/life balance, etc. depends on almost entirely on your direct manager and some of them are really abysmal at the job of managing people. There's very limited oversight from Senior Managers, they're more worried about impressing the higher-ups than taking care of their departments.

Top-down refusal to consider real flexible options for WFH/hybrid is causing the company to lose a lot of valuable people and nobody seems to care much. It's definitely impacting culture/morale and we're losing a lot of great talent to companies who are willing to be more flexible.

Communication is an absolute clusterf&@%. Major changes are communicated through the informal grapevine long before management makes a poorly worded statement with opaque decision making processes informing us of the change. 

People are frequently pushed out implicitly through re-orgs or explicitly through layoffs, there's no sense of stability or certainty. People are moved around into roles they're not qualified for and there's no training for the new expectations, just fumble your way through and don't get too attached because you'll probably be pushed into a different role within a year or two."

And the future still looks very bright!

After 30 years, I can honestly say it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

Lots of running projects in their IT org to get your hands on.

People share their time and knowledge so willingly. Really - the people here are incredibly kind.

Back in the office, people would basically leave their desk at 5. Work-life balance is real here.","Slow to move in the IT and product organizations, but this is in-line with expectations for an older financial services firm.

Product team seems to run development teams with no clear leadership to push back on this within IT.

Lots of talk within new product teams claiming they are a startup within the company. You are not a startup, nor can you be one when your ""product"" is heavily coupled with outdated processes and systems."

They say everyone has a voice, but it only applies to them.  Many people managers just want ""yes men"" and those who suck up get promoted.  It's a popularity contest.  I worked for CG for over 30 years and it has gotten worse over time.  Most managers put themselves before their teams."

The work is interesting and they value collaboration and there is plenty of support from peers. Benefits are great including paid time off. They encourage moving about in the company and there is good mentoring.,"Company headquarters is in Los Angeles and biggest office is in Irvine, California which are two highly unaffordable areas as far as rents/buying are concerned. Living outside of these hubs means a nightmarish commute. A work from home option or greater remote flexibility would help many of us looking to move further away (even to another state) to be able to afford rent/owning and achieving professional goals while supporting our families and spending more time with our children (as opposed to hitting the road at 5 am and back at 7 pm)."

Winning ""best places for DE&I"" because they know they are NOT a diverse organization. It clearly shows due to all the workstreams they are trying to accomplish, now all the people in HR are at 130% capacity. So it is really a pro? You decide.","If you are good at being fake, HR is the place to be. It's the only way to have internal mobility. It's mind-boggling to me that the people in HR who have their favorites think those people genuinely like them. The moment they turn around those very same people have so many negative things to say. If you like drama, being in a popularity show, and are good at faking it, this is the place to be. It's like being in a reality show. 

From what others have shared, depending on who you are supporting, get ready to be micromanaged. Sr.managers & SVP's walk around like they should be worshipped. Also, In meetings they say ""we welcome your opinion"" but the moment you share it or let alone challenge them, be prepared to be looked down upon. This is the main reason I left.


Pay! You can do as much or have even more responsibilities as another associate but the difference in your title will pay you less. For example, a coworker who is in an associate role gets paid about 10k less than someone who does the same role as her but since the other associate is an Admin II, the pay structure is different. Although, she does so much more and has to support 3+ people. 

Run..if you care about your career, please invest your time elsewhere. They will run you to the ground."

The benefits are straight up ridiculous. For retirement benefits they contribute 15% to your retirement plan. You read that right 15%! That's not a match program, its not only for people that make over a certain amount, they just plop it in there 1x/yr. 

The health insurance is amazing. Every time either myself or my family have had to go to the Dr. / Hospital the people who process our insurance always make a comment about how great our health insurance is.

I deliberately waited until after a year to post a review as I wanted time away to reflect on my experience and also compare the role and environment to my current employer/position.  The opportunity to grow here is dependent on how much effort you put in.  I had a ”tough as nails” leader who expected the best and was completely invested in our growth and development; she pushed me out of my comfort zone and I became a better HR professional because of it.  My small team was a supportive group of caring, smart, and highly capable HR professionals.  The HR organization was comprised of some of the smartest and kindest people I had the pleasure of working with.  Work is done with the culture and employee experience in mind.  Communications and planning of future initiatives were well-vetted and executed.  Having been at another prime employer before Capital where culture and employee engagement were at the top of the list in terms of importance, I didn’t really appreciate it until I left.  I now realize that Capital is really a special place.  Nothing will be handed to you here.  If you have the opportunity to work here and want to be successful for the long-term, be humble, proactive, forward-thinking and solutions-oriented.  If you try to coast by, you will not get the most that this company and department has to offer.  It may not be for everybody, but then again, not every company and organization is meant to fit every person.  Lastly, the Total Rewards package is pretty great.","With any organization, there’s  always room for improvement.  Opportunity areas that I see here are the following:  1) Time it takes to make decisions can be lengthy and at times, an exhaustive process.

Friendly environment, management is willing to listen to concerns. Read more below on cons to this.","1. Almost 3 years ago I was hired by  Capital Group, my biggest concern making a change in my career was my ability to develop & grow. During the interview process I was told about how there are multiple ""paths"" and the company dedicates time to associates to develop. Really they mean giving you 30 minutes a month to complete some training or complete a review of someone/recent training experience. Those so called paths they mentioned are nonexistent. I've sat in the same position for 3 years, never had the chance to be trained into a specific department because there is an ongoing staffing issue within departments. The lack of opportunities does not attract people to stay here long term. 

2. Management tries to be too positive. I've expressed my concerns to multiple managers and not one has seemed to take it seriously. Over a year ago, management asked for feedback, it turned ugly real quick & ever since it's been hush hush. Continuous issues are overlooked and not addressed. Management also makes decisions based off what they think, not what those doing the job with the experience think. i.e shift bid, removing earlier shifts and adding later shifts. Considering more than half the associates are parents, management should be considering people with families or additional responsibilities outside of work. 

3. Overtime is never ending. Associates receive last minute emails begging for people to work additional time when their shifts end in the next hour or two. Management likes to preach work/life balance but for the last 2 years, overtime has been required. When I was hired I was informed of ""blackout dates"" for 2 weeks every January and 3 weeks in April due to tax season. At this time, there is constant overtime & taking your time off is ""not contributing to improving the current environment."""

365,Capital Group,Flex Work + Flex Dress FTW!,2019-10-04,4.0,Anonymous,"Work/Life Balance:
Capital Group is a DREAM employer for working parents. Depending on your business unit (starting this year), we have an option to work from home 2 days a week, flexible working hours, early release summer Fridays, and potential to work part time, according to business needs. Obviously certain groups like the call center are exempt from most of this benefit due to the nature of their work and the security protocol that's associated. We've had ""clock watchers"" in the past, who fixated on associates arrival/exit times, and even gossiped about it...but now it's a moot point in many areas of the business because as professionals, we are treated as adults who can be trusted to get our work done. This is a beautiful thing!!

With the exception of ONE Manager I had years ago (now retired-thank GOD), every leader I've ever worked with is exceptional, or strives to be,  and cares about me as a human being. This is the type of company that cares about you inside and outside of work. My director knows my daughter's name and pops by my office to touch base periodically. My manager consistently demonstrates openness to creative, flexible, and cutting edge ideas. He always pushes his team to challenge the status quo. He always has my back, and I can say that without a doubt. Sure, there are bad seeds that I hear about here and there, but isn't that the case with literally every company on the planet?

Investment in Diversity and Inclusion:
D+I is part of daily conversations. Capital Group has made significant strides in fostering an environment where people are no longer afraid to be themselves. We can all have personalities...and SHOW THEM! This wasn't the case when I started. My feedback used to be that I needed to be ""more composed,"" which felt like a way to ""shush"" my opinions. Not the case in 2019.

Plenty of senior leaders are vocal allies for underrepresented populations. We are now able to use our own professional judgement in deciding what to wear to work (we no longer have a dress code!) - Yes, that's right, tattoos and piercings are exposed in all of their glory.

We are leveraging our ERGs in every way we can to ensure diverse voices are heard. Our leaders want to continuously evolve and improve as an organization. Anyone at our company would agree that we aren't exactly where we want to be, but it genuinely feels like EVERYONE is committed to making changes.

Benefits:
Our retirement. Hands down. I've been with CG long enough that my retirement account is something to brag about. It's cool being with a company that basically forces you to save for your future, as a part of the comp package. Through my 20's when I was living paycheck to paycheck, I didn't have an extra dollar to save, and I didn't see the value in saving. I wanted a bigger BASE because that's all any of my friends ever talked about. Now that I'm a wife, mother, homeowner, etc. I look at my balance and I am floored. So incredibly grateful for that.","Glassdoor as a review site is a really negative place, so I don't want to completely fixate on areas of improvement for Capital Group, but want to call-out 3 cons.

1. We have a ""perfectionist"" culture. Some of our leadership seems to be so focused on the noise of the ""problems"" we have, that they lose sight of ALL OF THE GOOD that is happening around them. I wish human nature was different, but recognizing the positive and not giving too much energy to the negative, is an art. I wish there was more focus and effort given to highlighting wins. Can we get better about managing bad behavior swiftly so it doesn't take away from the good work our associates are doing?

2. As someone who has been with Capital Group for over a decade, I have seen a lot of people come and go. One thing that remains the same is that our organization REALLY values new/fresh ideas, people, perspectives. This is great. Of course. BUT. From my perspective, some of our leaders demonstrate that they value the new shiny people from big name companies with fancy education credentials, over the steady, loyal associates who have stood the test of time. I think we need to get better about valuing high performing, long term associates...ESPECIALLY in 2019 where good employees can jump from company to company in a heartbeat. Let's genuinely value loyalty. Our more tenured associates who are high performers, should be getting paid the same, if not more, than the really exciting new hires. My belief, is this is not the case. I would love to see that change, or at least see that addressed. PS: From my perspective, there isn't a gender inequality when it comes to compensation. 

3. My last con is one that is NOT unique to Capital Group, and it is something that is inevitable in any business. There are some really questionable promotions at times. There are people within our company who are ""over exposed,"" meaning...they are recognized repeatedly and climb the ladder because they are super talented in managing UP and being visible. These are people who play the game really well. There probably isn't a solution for this, but I consistently find myself comparing my skill sets/performance/scope/accomplishments to my peers and to people in more senior positions, and can't quite make sense of why certain people hold certain titles and comp. Again, promotions can't be a consensus, and we can't collect 360 feedback from everyone, but this is the reality."

371,Capital Group,"Come, self-combust and retire",2019-10-20,1.0,Vice President,Please refer to the cons for a free-flowing perspective.,"I have resisted writing this review for a while now. But a recent spate of events made me think, why not offer some insight to folks who are considering a position in this company. 

Beyond the usual cribbing and complaining (that I am entitled to), I want to offer you something useful. 'You' could be an outsider wanting a peek in or an insider looking to validate that voice in your head. I promise not to disappoint.

For the inquisitive mind and the recently committed ... 
If Dormancy is your quest, look no further. If you are a star, come here to self combust.

The Company
CG as it is referred to, is the oldest Investment Management company in the world. It takes pride in its deep market research, active investment philosophy and large share of Portfolio Managers who invest their own money in the funds they manage. 

Well respected in the industry, silent but strong player and has a religious following among Financial Professionals, mostly the established and experienced ones.

The company does not have a CEO structure, but is run by a Management Committee. Rumor has it that the entry pass to the committee is an Ivy League pedigree. With $1.9T in AUM, they are doing something right. 

The twist is in their way of working. Extremely conservative approach to work, taking on too much and ending up fighting for resources, unwilling to take smaller risks are all reasons why this company is 10 years behind its competition from the east coast.

The Culture
In paper, the value system is stellar. One could argue that it could be used as a template for other companies.

It is based on mutual self-respect, emphasis on aligning with all parties on decisions, thorough research and long term focus. That is how the investment process works here and delivers long-term results.

Every doctrine that stops at a certain level of generality opens itself for interpretation, often misinterpretation just like the Constitution. This company succumbs to such a fate as well. 
 
 -  Meeting culture
Have you come across a place where they talk more about the work than actually doing it? Welcome! Collaboration is interpreted as consensus and the approach to consensus is meetings. If only performance was assessed by meetings and the loudest voices in the meeting .... 

This company operates on a noxious meeting culture, associates spend 60-80% of their time in meetings. There are prep-meetings, planned meetings and follow up meetings. Yet, that coveted decision that was supposed to be made will always be a moving target. 

Would you like to know why? Because they can't articulate what decision they were trying to make or the upshot of the meeting. 

- Decision making
No-one feels empowered to make decisions or lack the courage required to do so because they are nursing burns from past experiences. Spunk and drive are met with screeching brakes at every turn until you slow down to the pace of the 405 during peak hours. 

There is no use stepping on the gas. Remember, you are on an aircraft carrier that's moving on a California highway. You HAVE to wait.

- Demeanor
'Everybody is so nice' - you will hear this quite often and it is so true, whether you are a contractor or an employee. Until you are caught unawares during a routine 1:1 with your supervisor or you see your performance review. 

Co-workers rarely sort out their differences directly with you because the culture forbids 'confrontation'. The result? lack of courage that seeks to complain to one's manager or toss one's cookies all over your performance feedback.

These people are determined. They are patient, they will wait until your performance review and then get the job done.

- Work-life balance
 The verdict is mixed here, but for the most part, there is no other FinServ company out there that can match CG's work-life balance. It exists.

- Title and compensation
The pay structure is excellent. Generous basic pay compared to other FinServ companies + 2 bonuses + a generous retirement plan.

The grip tightens as you age in the system because job titles are not on par with the market and you will find it difficult to venture out and get paid better. It is a 6-year golden cuff to vest retirement benefits, to say the least.

- Diversity
I will fight the criticism that this company is not diverse. There is an active focus on Diversity now. In the past year or so I have seen more people of color working, but I am no expert. 

It is a sensitive topic and I sure am not a fan of forcing diversity in hiring decisions where the focus should be on hiring the best match for the job.

The People
                    Decent bunch. Many of them are very talented, respectful and committed. In times of urgency or crisis, they will willingly rally around the cause, forget their differences and jump right in to help.

And then some have spent 20, 30, even 40 years at this company. Exceptions aside, many of them thrive on nostalgia alone, without getting any work done. Big fat egos, passive-aggressive behavior and know-how on gaming the system is their forte.

Mind you, they don't want you to come in with fresh ideas and challenge their ways. Anybody from the outside is a threat to their backward ideas and speed (lack) of execution. Well, can you blame them when a 20-year veteran has sat in a manager role for 15 of them?

The Leadership
                           At the very top, there are really capable and well-connected people. As you start descending the pyramid, there are so many 'oh dear's. Sensitive like a teenager, egotistic, temperamental, passive-aggressive and much more. 

Promoting favoritism, constantly talking over others and filling their calendar with meetings so that they can show they are 'busy' is what they do. There is no mind-space to do any work. 

Ask them what they work on in a typical day. It will be 8 hours of meetings or the work their teams are on. These so-called leaders have no deliverable that they lead.

Most of them do not understand the concept of having a strategy before jumping into execution. All they know is 'project' / 'initiative'. Oh, nowadays it is Agile!

This layer between the Management Committee and the foot soldiers is made of a bunch of SVPs and Senior Managers. They are like the perma-frost under Russia. Toxic emissions escape when they thaw and are capable of destroying the company from within.


Your Job
Well my friend, if you are coming from a fast-paced and bleeding-edge culture, expect to be very very very frustrated. There is no exaggeration when I say that. 

Outdated processes, aging workforce, crippled decision making and a false sense of superiority will drive you nuts. All this when you have the latest technologies purchased and under-used. Essentially, you will be driving a Ferrari on the busy roads of SoCal, doing grocery shopping.

Fearless leaders to watch out for ...

0s and 1s
I have not come across a FinServ company where a cost-center wields so my influence on business operations. They have restricted options for the business to make good use of the dollar. 

There will be a fixed annual IT budget and they are very reluctant to use a global sourcing model. Even if a business unit has money to accomplish something, they have to get into the prioritization game to steal from one area to pay another.

Oh and the characters you will come across will be amazing. 2 in particular ... There is the sordid patrial who talks big game to arm candies he brings along to events. And the colonial he now has to call a peer. The most abrasive, unclassy know-it-all who has multiple HR complaints against him.

Mouthpieces
Sordid bunch. They have a spunky new leader who is standing up on the gas pedal and growing frustrated with the outcome. Unfortunately, he has so many blind spots that I can see him heading for the exit soon.
They fight so much among themselves and the leader has had 1 hit and 1 'where did the ball go' miss among the 2 hires he made.
The threshold for making the leadership team here is strong ties to sales, many years of warming the seat and inability to successfully deliver anything.

Display
The leader and the leadership team is so lost. For a company that talks about collaboration and alignment, everything is top-down here. The leader is just lost.

Word is, there was a crowd-sourcing effort to define the north star for this group in a swanky hotel, where the gathering was left dumbfounded when they realized the caliber of their new fearless leader.

So, you decide the outcome you want. Growth or dormancy, choice is yours and good luck."

- Very few ""leaders"" among the bunch of IT Senior Managers, Directors, and SVPs; seems like more like a bunch of project managers looking through budgets and allocating internal and contract resources rather than people who are inspiring and motivating their teams to deliver value quickly

- Where's the vision? Everyone seems to be able to point to a project plan or roadmap but hardly anyone can explain in a compelling way why what we're doing is important, exciting, and benefits our shareholders
- The company will let low-performers stick around for a very long time before letting them go; this reduces the productivity of everyone around who has to work with the person

389,Capital Group,The cake is a lie... Slow and Toxic Culture,2019-09-08,1.0,Senior Manager,Excellent compensation and benefits. A few good people that want to do really good work.,"Slow moving and tedious meeting-driven environment. Constant negativity. Associates talk of wanting to be a tech company and move more quickly, but they just don’t know how to get out of their own way. This place needs a serious shake up with leadership if they hope to be relevant in the coming years. Culture is not what it seems. It has become a toxic place filled with a subversive negativity. HR talks of core values, but fails to uphold them. If you bring an issue to the attention of HR they will try to avoid taking action. People seemed fake. Instead of helping people grow they’ll look for ways to bring you down and prevent any kind of change you bring to the organization. They typically, over hire for roles and limit your span of control into a tiny box. It’s sad that people end up staying for the pay and continue to dread each day of life in the office. 

Too many meetings and council approvals combined with micromanaging senior leaders slow progress to a crawl. No wonder, change is pretty much non-existent. Decisions take months or even years and opportunity is lost. They don’t realize how much money and time is being wasted which is your investment money being wasted by the way. In this case, talk is not cheap. Talk of the importance of culture is constant, but they don’t know how to nurture it. In most cases, leaders only care about themselves and not the people they lead. Additionally, there is no evidence that active management is actually better than passive and yet they continue to take your money and waste it in their extremely non-productive work environment. So much talk and so little action. Risk avoidance is built into the corporate culture so no one is willing to take a risk on even small changes. Everything, and I mean everything, needs to be reviewed by a committee before a decision is made. The good folks get frustrated and leave and the bad ones stay and act busy just building powerpoint presentations for the next committee meeting. 

I had high hopes for Capital Group. On paper it looks so good, but the reality did not align with the promise. The longer I stayed the more I became frustrated and depressed. Do not join this organization if you have a strong moral compass, value your time, want to grow professionally or want to make a difference at the place you work."

Most of the Sr. Consultants and Consultants will never feel safe to speak up about what really goes on here (Irvine and LA) and that's sad, because then we resort to these anonymous Glassdoor reviews which will be reviewed by a person or two that is actually part of this toxic group of senior managers.  They will discuss how they just received another review of someone who is just trying to complain and that it's ultimately irrelevant.  It has happened before and again, HRLT will do nothing about reprimanding some of these senior managers and directors for their bad behavior and poor leadership skills.

Awesome Co-workers
Great Retirement Benefits
Beautiful Compass
Wonderful Reputation in Financial Services Industry

When I started working at AFS - It was an amazing company - large corporation, but with a family feel and take care of your people attitude. While it is a large department, AFS is largely a flat organization, so the possibilities to move upward within  the department are limited - Associate, Manager, and Sr Manager. So the possibility of career development is largely only available to moving out of AFS.

That being said, the work can be challenging dealing with frustrated clients and investment advisers. The pay is quite respectable for a phone and processing center. AFS does require overtime when they are busy or understaffed. They attempt to offset this with ""voluntary"" overtime, but at times, they do require all associates to put in some required overtime. While required over time is not liked by any associate, the overtime pay helps numb that pain. The more overtime you do, the larger the contribution to your retirement plan and your bonuses. This is not always realized, but it's nice to see it when it comes in and really builds up over time. 

There is a significant amount of training involved. For some the material is easy, but for others, the concepts, services, and products are really over their heads. They do a fair job of helping associates understand the concepts with additional support for a limited time (maybe 6 months or so) but after that it'll become an issue if you can't grasp the concepts or processes.

The Irvine compass is beautiful and has great cafeteria for you to purchase lunch if you want. If you commute by train, you'll develop some close friendships and bonds commuting back and forth and getting to know people outside the office. Irvine has a shuttle that picks people up at the Irvine train station and drops you off right in front of the Capital Group offices, so it's super convenient. There isn't much of interoffice socializing . A lot of people commute a long way and most days people just want to go home. Happy hours and outside social events within the department are pretty much non-existent.

The department tries to keep motivation and moral up with some on campus social events, potlucks, and providing some meals and snacks for special occasions or as reward for doing the overtime. Not everyone appreciates these things, but it could be nothing - so take those complaints in stride. It's certainly something that they don't have to do. 

Overall, this is a great place to start your career in financial services. The training is good and the reputation about the company will serve you well if you stay in the financial services industry. It will also be some of the greatest associates you get to work with. Lot's of great associates that you can build good working relationships with and if you're lucky, some good life long friends.","Within the department, the attitude has shifted from family and promoting within, to more micromanaged, cut throat, and promote from outside.  More and more, the business as a whole seems to hire from outside to fill positions in various other departments as opposed to giving associates the opportunities to prove themselves.

It can not be over emphasized that you should heed all the warnings about ""speaking your mind"", ""tell us what you're thinking"", ""share your observations"", ""we have an open door policy"", ""we are very receptive to feedback"" and any other variation of those thoughts, ideas, and concepts, because in the end, those are just key words for ""open up to us so we can make a judgement about where you're going to go in the company and whether or not we like you"". Once you show your hand, your reputation is cemented and no amount of time or change in your behavior will change their opinions in this department. Managers seldom move, Sr Manager never move - so whatever they think of you, is what they think of you. Don't be fooled by the fake compliments, ""Kudos"", rewards, free lunches, or utilization as a ""resource"". If you aren't being given opportunities within a few years, they've already made up their minds about who you are and where you're going within the company.  Like many reviews have said, AFS doesn't really care about your thoughts or opinions. Whatever you do, don't complain. Maybe you can provide ""suggestions"", but watch your tone. Consider your delivery method (face to face, privately, in an office, on the floor, or via e-mail) and how it could be perceived by others. Don't be fooled by the rhetoric of accepting feedback or by whatever response Capital Group will provide in response to this opinion. AFS is interested in one thing and one thing only - support whatever idea upper management comes up with, no matter how silly, dumbfounded, and unrealistic it is. If you work there long enough, you will see a change from one process to another and then back again. Mostly a repetition of previous ideas and processes, wrapped in some new meaningless, see through wrapper. So when you see it - smile and exuberantly praise what a great new and fantastic idea is it. Don't be surprised when the process is changed, revised, or reversed weeks, months, or years later.

Within AFS, the department is not interested in leaders. They want followers. It's bred into the culture from Senior Management down. Leaders are too disruptive to the status quo within the department. Original ideas - truly and genuinely original ideas about managing associates or the department - are not really well accepted and if they are - expect them to be stuck within the cogs of reviews, analysis, and clarification. The wheels of change move slowly. Ironically, it doesn't seem that the same amount of analysis or clarification is utilized for some of the initiatives that management push forward to the associates.

Managers over associates can seem duplicitous. While seeming to care, they are also sometimes the first ones to deliver a negative perception about the associate. Sr managers rarely take the side of the associate, mostly because of limited interaction. So be aware that if you want a new perception from your Sr Manager, start having those one on one meetings with  your manage and include the Sr Manager in those meetins. Also, think about setting up maybe quarterly check-ins with the Sr Manager to help develop your interaction and career. Again, be careful. This approach while seemingly almost necessary is a double edged sword. Also remember to have your ""work face"" on - be prepared with clear ideas that you want to convey, don't get too personal, emotional, or passionate about anything. There are some managers that really do care and support their associates. But there are seemingly more that are only interested in pushing their career objectives and answer to their boss, that it makes the good ones difficult to identify. 

 The greatest incentive they offer and keeps you tethered to the job, is the retirement plan. 15% of your gross income. That being said, I would encourage you to leave on your own terms and don't sit around wasting your time for 6 years for the retirement plan to be vested before leaving. While it is a great benefit, it's also one of the major incentives to stay, but remember, it's not your money, so anything you walk away with is free money. Other companies may offer matching or better overall compensation packages if you know what you are looking for."

However, if you consistently rely on interns to help get your work done, you should probably consider hire more full-time staff and provide more lateral moves for associates.

-Great health insurance
-Great bonuses for exempt and exempt-equivalent associates
-Generous vacation policy","-It’s really challenging to move up in this organization.  Lured by the prospect of a fabulous retirement plan and decent work-life balance, CG routinely hires ambitious people who are often overqualified for the roles they’re in, which is actually a recipe for disaster when you consider how little room there is for upward mobility.  Since most of us are working in what are essentially dead-end jobs and smart enough to realize it, management stresses that we should try to grow horizontally rather than vertically by moving across groups or doing a temporary rotation with another team.   However,  even the lateral moves feel almost impossible to get.  A colleague of mine got a rotation and found out  that about seven or eight other people had applied for it.  It wasn’t a particularly attractive role, but there was a lot of internal competition for it.  Also, even if you do apply for a permanent role as an internal applicant, you’ll be subjected to the same ridiculously lengthy interviews as an external applicant.  It makes no sense — shouldn’t your years of great reviews actually count for something?  I applied for an internal role and did not get the impression that they had reached out to my manager to discuss what kind of employee I was or that they had looked at my reviews.  Shouldn’t there be some sort of benefit to having a proven track record as an employee?  
-Management can be ridiculously condescending about the lack of opportunities for associates.  A top lady in HR closed out a big conference one time by saying something along the lines of,  “If your career is in the shadows, that’s because that’s where you have allowed it to be.”  It was probably the most tone deaf thing I’ve ever heard.  I couldn’t even believe it came out of the mouth of someone in HR.  It’s completely fair to put responsibility on associates for speaking up and raising their hand when they would like to be considered for opportunities. But as described above, if you have roughly  8-10 internal applicants for every halfway decent rotation, some people are bound to be disappointed despite making their best efforts to get their careers out of “the shadows.”   Be a little more considerate of the frustration that some of us are feeling.  
-Managers will critique the most inane details of your job performance.  They sift through emails that associates send (even internal emails) and question the most minute things.  I’ve had emails go through three levels of review before being sent out.  It is ridiculous. 
-Hope to God you never get put on a huge project that moves at a snail’s pace.   I’ve attended meetings where it took almost an hour for people to learn that the key decision makers weren’t even invited to the meeting.
-The work in my group isn’t very  challenging.  This might just be my specific group, but I don’t feel like I’ve learned as much as I have in previous outside roles."

1. The company culture is amazing, people are super humble and willing to spend time sharing their knowledge. Ideas from the most junior to senior people are respected, team members work together to arrive at the best outcomes. There is mutual respect among all employees.

2. At capital there are abundant ways to learn, there are 'Learning communities'. I was completely new to financial industry so joined a 'Learning group' where we discussed financial concepts and learnt together for a certificate program.

3. The company culture encourages you to move across groups if you find that a specific position/group is not the right fit for you.

90% of the front-line people (the ones in ""the trenches"") are the best you'll ever work with.

Investment group is amazing. Much less ego than in most investment companies. Investment results are shockingly good with lower-than-average fees.","Once upon a time, there was a world-class buy-side investment house. They were the greatest company you never heard of. Billions (now trillions) in managed assets, their reputation in the industry for their quiet culture, long-term views, no org charts, and never having had a layoff in their (then) 70-year history.

(((record scratch)))

NOPE... Not any more. This ain't your father's Capgroup. While the investment side is still well-run by the guiding principles of its founder, pretty much everywhere else is a catastrophe. Simultaneously penny-pinching by hiring countless contractors, while dumping millions upon millions into useless re-orgs initiated by an ever-increasing top-heavy management structure.

The horror stories from the call centers have been going on for years. I never saw them myself, but a parade of internal transfers from there with identical reports of overbearing managers and hyper-strict rules on time spent on calls/away from your desk can't be coincidence.

There are definitely good managers, but lord HELP you if you get in with a bad one. (See other Glassdoor reviews) They basically have god-rights over their little fiefdoms. And NO ONE wants to hear you complain. I cannot emphasize that enough. 

My advice to anyone new (anyone who's going to actually, you know, WORK): You'll meet awesome co-workers. But keep your head down, do your work. JUMP departments at the first hint of anything bad going on in your department. Stay six years to get fully vested in the retirement plan, then BAIL."

-Maybe 40% of the managers are great, and if you get put on their teams you will not only have a more pleasant experience, but you'll probably find it easier to grow and move forward as well","-'Stepford Wives'/Gaslighting culture -- a lot of glaring issues and controversial topics are swept under the rug, and constructive criticism is rarely taken well. It's also worth noting that many of these glowing Glassdoor reviews were posted by HR to boost the company's rating
-Employee engagement declining rapidly  -- turnover has been very high in the last few years. the most recent company survey indicated that less than half the associates are happy or willing to stay long-term. Also, because of the job security referenced in the 'Pros', ineffective employees are rarely fired... meaning that associates who are lower in the ranks often end up picking up the slack and never get fairly compensated/promoted for it
-Lack of diversity -- most people who work here are from privileged areas of Southern California and were essentially bred for asset management. If you don't share that background or did not attend an ivy-league school, it can be tough to grow here. Politicking seems to be the only way to get ahead
-Mixed messaging -- they hire the best and brightest, asking for innovation and disruption so they can get with the times, but freak out when you actually suggest changes. If you actually give genuine feedback when they ask for it, there's a good chance you'll be blacklisted as a pessimist or 'not a team player'
-Stale management -- it seems like many managers were placed in those roles because the CG leaders didn't know how else to reward them. A lot of them lack management/people skills and destroy team morale; contributing to the engagement issue mentioned earlier
-Lack of development opportunities -- their educational reimbursement program does not cover much, and spending time on Lynda or reading industry publications is generally a faux-pas since there's always so much work to be done
-Over-dependence on contractors and consultants -- the back-office operations are so labor-intensive that it's almost impossible to take on new business without hiring more people... but rather than developing full-timers or involving them in solution-planning, management chooses to hire temporary help instead. This leads to frequent half-finished projects led by consultants, a revolving door of contractors who need extensive training, and ultimately huge wastes of Capital's money"

The marketing organization is the epitome of chaos, starting from the very top. The CMO and his direct subordinates (who are comprised of brown-nosers, sycophants and yes-men) work to sow this culture of ""innovation,"" ""disruption,"" and ""excellence,"" but actually just want people to nod, deal with constantly changing direction (head on a swivel is even too nice to describe how the head of marketing makes his decisions), and take degrading feedback with a smile. 

There is talk of Capital culture but it's really all a facade to get people in the door. The fact that we've had a number of strategic layoffs, lots of talented-long-time employees leaving, reshuffles, reorgs, ""early retirements"" and a dismal employee engagement score should mean something to the higher-ups, but they somehow miss the forest for the trees and aren't seeing that the culture they so highly regard is being terribly managed and deteriorated from within by them hiring people who absolutely do not embody anything close to their own ""standards."" How can I be sure? Ask anyone who's been in meetings with the CMO or some of the directors in the marketing org as I guarantee that they could NOT say that they've never seen people being disrespected, sexually harassed, or morally degraded. As for the actual work being done, it's hard to say when the decisions are mostly being made by agencies paid to do most of the work who, curiously, are not there because of their quality of work (they're awful) but because they're friends with someone who made the decision to give them a contract. 

The last marketing organization employee engagement survey came back with dismal employee engagement scores and upper management's response to that was to have the employees all work on ""making it better"" versus actually trying to make things better for us. We already told you what and how we felt about how the organization was being run, yet instead of finding solutions, you get to say you're working on it by actually having employees run their own ""survey category improvement"" groups. Basically that's like saying hey, you told us you're unhappy and exactly why you're unhappy? Okay, well, you change because it's definitely not us. And don't bother talking to HR, as they've had the most unprofessional practices I've ever seen. Have a problem with another coworker/manager? Don't think you're going to be dealt with in a respectful, safe, and comforting manner. It just might be you instead. Again, it's the mentality of ""it's not me, it's you."""

459,Capital Group,Hypocrisy Better Not Bother You,2018-12-04,1.0,Financial Processor,"The work is very easy, low stress environment. You sit back and you process transactions.  The training program is fairly extensive as well, they make sure you know how to handle every situation by providing job aids that are readily accessible and easy to understand/follow in addition to other senior employees helping you out. The pay isn't terrible, but not very competitive.","Get ready to be micromanaged at every turn. There is a massive double standard in their enforcement of rules and regulations.  Lower level employees are told that cell phone use is prohibited due to security concerns, as they walk around on a cell phone.  The same goes for dress code policies.  Business-casual is the expected standard and is consistently enforced by individuals who themselves don't comply.  Being told you cannot wear a hooded sweatshirt by someone wearing a hooded  sweatshirt actually happened. There is also ""mandatory"" overtime.  What's worse, is that this overtime is sprung on you with less than 48 hours notice.  It is very much frowned upon if you cannot participate in this overtime.  It's actually quite hysterical to listen to the ""work/life balance"" values during training and then have someone give you negative feedback for not working overtime. And if you were thinking of getting promoted, good luck.  Capital Group hiring is few and far between since they outsource many positions and departments to staffing agencies all in an effort to minimize the number of individuals they are required to provide benefits to."

471,Capital Group,Leadership Development Programs,2018-10-22,4.0,Human Resources,"Capital Group has invested in me.  The tools they make available to all associates to embrace their development from a leadership and skill perspective is outstanding.  Recently I finished a multi-week Harvard Business School leadership course with approximately 40 other senior managers from across the country.  We met weekly via video with heavy coursework that was parsed out through smaller working groups.  The capstone brought the diverse group together to put a fine point on the topics of strategic agility, hiring and developing top talent and personal leadership branding.  Reinforcing the firm’s commitment to the essential skills that are needed to be a leader at the firm plus iterating our core values was needed for my role and future.",Development is state of mind and looking for ways to keep up with the changing skills needed is important.  coursework is something about vertical mobility that associates look for in a career; being rewarded with title and responsibility (not to mention $$$) increases is still very important.  Capital can improve in this area.  Hiring senior associates for every role leads to bottlenecking and stagnate verticality at times.
472,Capital Group,This is a great or terrible company depending on position and department,2018-07-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"• While actual salary is slightly below industry standards, if you perform well, the bonuses and retirement plan more than make up for it. Under these circumstances I don't think there's better compensation outside of one of the big tech companies.

• Some of the most smart, friendly, and talented co-workers, who come from all walks of life and experiences.

• While diversity still needs lots of work (most of senior-level management are white men), there is still good general representation of women and minorities, and a fair number in higher level positions. You'll also find people of all ages.

• Company places great emphasis on giving back to the community, which is reflected in the many volunteer opportunities, and 2:1 corporate matching of donations.

• Pretty flexible in terms of working hours if you need to do things like go to a doc's appt. during the weekday. Some lucky people get to work remotely once a week. Overall, most people work 40 hours/week. Some unlucky people work a ton more.

• Nicely designed offices in some locations, mainly the LA HQ. It is an open office plan but at least you still get your own desk and space, unlike the startup style of sitting side by side (like some of the agile spaces in Irvine).","• The single most important thing that will make or break you is the manager you directly report to and your superiors. If they are incompetent or don't have your back, you will either be doing their job and not being recognized for it, or be thrown under the bus. Also, because your bonuses are highly dependent on their feedback, you are under their mercy if they don't like you.

• Way too many meetings; can take up about 75% of your time. If you're a manager or more senior level, expect that to be 90%.

• The company has a directive to cut costs, so they are overly reliant on contractors right now, as they are cheaper and easier to terminate. However the weird thing is even if the contractor is great, it is often difficult to extend contracts past a certain time period, and even more difficult to hire them full-time. Also, can take forever to hear back from applying for a job, interview, and be accepted. This affects both the person applying and the team waiting to get help. And when people leave or are let go, there's somewhat of a hiring freeze in some departments so many positions are not back filled and the remaining team is left to do more with less.

• Company is going through their latest restructuring/transformation, which happens like every 2-3 years, which becomes super disruptive. It seems like we go full circle every few cycles. And these changes are done without much input from the people it most affects.

• No clear process for most things.

• Don't expect to move up, only laterally or into the hell of middle management, which there seems to be many levels of. People stay here forever (which can be a pro for some).

• There is supposed to be a culture built around core values, with one that centered on respect for everyone. This is being eroded by some new senior level people who are creating a toxic environment by debasing others, or constantly changing direction without much reason. People are so afraid to speak honestly to them, preferring to just say yes to everything, or remaining silent.

• Highly bureaucratic, way too much consensus building (though they will tell you it's about supporting everyone's unique perspective).

• If you're a creative, it can be really boring, tedious work most of the time. The style guide is pretty restrictive, most things are templated, and you'll find yourself doing  lots of production work. Also way too much time and emphasis spent on creating long, boring powerpoint presentations that are internal only.

• Company is so legally conservative and risk adverse that it prevents the company from doing certain things differently. Also because of this, it takes forever to let go of under performers because of the fear of a law suit.

• Technology is outdated, everything is locked down, or it takes forever to adopt new things/software/technologies/processes.

• Some parts of the company say they are doing agile, but it's more agile in name and rituals only.

• Like my title says, work can go one way or the other depending on your position or department. Marketing and IT are experiencing the greatest amount of turbulence right now."

Many of the senior level managers have been with the company for a long time which makes their management style insular, old-fashioned and inward thinking. Endless levels of review of product, numerous re-do’s and constant re-doing of work are the norm.

People who work here mostly act like zombies. Low walled cubicles make employees feel like they’re in an aquarium and there is very idle chat or social discourse. Everybody has to constantly be looking at their computer and working if they’re not in a meeting. Company culture rewards introverts and people with personality get crushed here very quickly. 

There are two kinds of employees here. Those who have drank the cool-aid and have lasted here for years and other kind that can’t wait to get the hell out of the company.

Over the past few years they've replaced top management positions with people from outside, with quite a few being from Goldman.  They are slowly moving to a culture that is like any other mutual fund company and are losing sight of what made working at Capital great.   The 'service center' is being rebranded into a 'call center' where the focus is no longer on quality customer service but on meeting and beating the metrics. Associates in the service center are provided 1 hour monthly for 'development' whereas previously it was at the discretion of the manager.   Outside of the service center there is an increased reliance on contractors rather than CG associates, which limits the mobility within the company.    There is now an official severance policy since layoffs are increasingly common, however there is a lack of visibility and communication when these happen which just causes rumors and mistrust."

Capital has a clever way of making you think you are valued by giving you a multitude of “opportunities” only to send you right back to where you came from with the same pay. You are really just a cheaper resource that they can and will utilize where there is “business need”. This rarely leads to any type of advancement in position or pay. The raise structure will allow an associate to outperform the majority of associates, but only receive 1-2% more than an average associate because of the cookie cutter structure. There is no incentive to work harder for an entire year to make 1% more than an associate who just shows up to work everyday. 

Also, don’t expect a straight answer from management or anyone above. “More to come” is as precise as it gets."

Great place if you want a steady, repetitive job, with a great environment and little responsibility.","Very misleading job descriptions. Career advancement is a very slow process, it is very easy to feel stuck - especially if you are ambitious and looking for responsibility and/or career advancement. Certainly not the place for fast track career advancement. Training in the GSO department is horrible. Months and months went by before I had enough tasks to fill up even half a days with of work - but I still had to clock 8hrs. So I spent a lot of time with nothing to do."
535,Capital Group,Sinking Ship,2018-03-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Master Retirement Plan = 15% of your compensation annually
-2 bonuses per year
-Interviews are easy, all situational type questions","-Master Retirement Plan = Can only invest in American Funds
-A sinking ship. No longer producing products the public wants. The new strategy is having VPs come up with the new direction = their current solution: Just copy the same under performing, expensive active funds in new vehicle forms: SMAs, LUX, SAs. If no one wants your flavored soda, why keep offering it in different bottles? The evidence is in the pudding. BlackRock and Vanguard have had AUM triple in last ten years, while Capital Group has remained relatively flat from $1.2T to $1.6T, much of it due to the overall rise in equities during this bull market
-Products are too large, as they add more and more investment managers and keep slicing the pie into slivers. How can having 30+ managers (several are never disclosed btw) beat the market? 
-They will often show you results on how they beat the market from the 1930's or 1970's. Unfortunately info was not readily available back then to the public, therefore, as they visited companies it became easier to beat the market since they were the holders of the data.Today info is more widely accessible and cheaper. Info is disclosed in an instant and we all have the data now, its not proprietary to Capital. My case in point, as the emerging of the info age: Compare their funds or institutional products  to the S&P 500 and the results are atrocious (1992-2018 Growth Fund of America-A 367.22% vs 559.27% in SPY) 
-Lovelaces own 51% of the company. The rest gets divided among the employees in high positions. Many of these employees in high positions have stayed for years because the dividend payouts are lucrative, many times earning much more than their annual salary. The problem though is old ideas and no innovative products or ideas
-Millennials are asking for cheaper products, with more relevance to their lifestyles such as ETFs and value products with easier access to open accts. Unfortunately, you have to go through a broker or jump through hoops and pay higher fees or commissions to get their funds and no ETFs or value funds offered (exception WMIF). They are working on an active ETF fund but have had problems getting approvals from the SEC, kind of late in the game though and a losing proposition since they will attempt to just replicate one of their under performing mutual funds or institutional products
-If you're in operations, good luck. Your job will be automated soon
-If you're innovative and full of ideas, go somewhere else. They look to hire from the best colleges and bright people, however, their talent is put to waste since they do not want innovative ideas. Promotions are based on who is the best operationally and an order taker, not progressive and innovative"

Blatant abuse of the H1B visa program.  Clearly looking to reduce headcount through attrition and layoffs in order to replace experienced associates with offshore contractors and/or H1B visa recipients.  Approaching 70-80% of IT workforce, at least.

Despite loss of key associates workload and deadlines continually becoming more aggressive.  

Upper management talks about valuing associates, providing growth opportunities, 50/50 ratio of associates/contractors... They talk the talk but clearly don't walk the walk.  

Vast majority of middle to upper management positions in the past 10 years have been filled by outsiders.  Many of them come from Accenture.  This has completely transformed the culture of IT and not in a good way.  They may have reduced costs but at the expense of the company culture and skilled American workers.

This is no longer the case, which creates unpredictability, resulting in disengagement and apathy.  For example, 2017 was a record year for the business and leadership still laid off lots of people in IT without a good explanation.

The global finance group consists of entity level (not fund level) accounting, financial reporting, tax and treasury professionals responsible for the overall legal entity books and various group reporting and analysis. Other departments have better overall morale and working conditions but not the Global Finance Group. Accounting is the best sub group within this larger department and I would recommend that area.","This department used to be made up of thoughtful leaders. However, a shift in some high level positions and poorly designed restructuring has helped to drive a culture of fear and CYA tactics at the mid-Manager and analyst levels, especially in Management Reporting Planning and Analysis. Employees can be treated quite poorly by managers and senior managers, who exhibit zero emotional intelligence. Mistakes are absolutely not allowed and many reporting managers will blame others when decisions they have approved are later viewed as mistakes by senior managers.  Goals and expectations are a constantly moving target and not communicated until managers are in CYA mode.  Long unrealistic hours are expected due to poor staffing and constant turnover.  They will say they no longer want employees putting in such long hours, but they refuse to adequately staff in some areas, and continue to pile unrealistic amounts of work on individuals.  Micro management is encouraged and there is constant unrealistic pressure to perform the job of multiple people with constant interruptions. 

Stay away from the management reporting planning and analysis team, there is a reason there are always openings on that team. Former employees have been fleeing due to the extremely toxic environment. I’ve been watching good people flee that team (or the equivalent pre-corporate structure changes) for close to a decade.  Their issues are a direct result of long-term senior manager leadership."

- The campus in Irvine is beautiful, and it is clear that a lot of effort is spent on creating a enjoyable physical environment for work.","- As alluded to earlier, Shareholder Services is undergoing a lot of change. Due to DOL ruling, service is focusing on becoming more efficient. The way it is being communicated to front-line associates is creating a very stressful environment. Managers are coaching strictly to numbers, watching each employee down to the second to make sure they are adhering to their schedules. This is taking a severe toll on employee engagement and work outlook.

You don't really have to work.  No one ever gets fired.  There was one firing a couple years ago and the culture freaked out.  The culture does not focus on improving performance.  They will just hire 10 more people and hope that one helps out.","Zero advancement no matter how hard you work until you have been there 15+ years.  It's all about length of time.  There is zero merit focus in the culture. 

Sometimes you feel bad that you don't meet internal needs.  The whole culture is about excuses why you cannot do something.  If you can make lots of excuses about why something is complicated or risky, then you are promotion material (after 15 years of service).  

Frankly we are over charging clients in a world where they can get our services for 1/100th the price.  Not sure how long this high cost business model will last but more of a 10 year problem than a one year issue."

Ask anyone around and the morale is quite low nowadays. This new ruling from the department of labor has almost eliminated entire departments. Don’t be fooled, associates are resigning left and right due to severe cuts in cost. It all makes sense since the profitability just isn’t there anymore, but layoffs are here. This company used to be an exciting place to work but it’s gone downhill in the last year and they’re expecting that downward trend to continue.","Everything- including the new call center metrics that expect intelligent associates to act as simple minded robots by keeping in mind how many seconds each call takes. Even the managers are scrambling for their jobs at this point. Avoid joining shareholder services at all costs unless you’re looking for a 2 year filler job, that seems to be the average length of tenure before people get sick of it and leave."

This is not made clear during the hiring or training process, and it seems like they are not upfront because most people probably would like to steer clear of call center environments. Felt like the job was not meaningful and had little impact due to changing industry standards.

There is not much room for upwards mobility or changing to other business areas after being hired on. The company offers ""internship"" rotations, so that employees feel like they are doing more (and usually are) however there is typically not a pay increase."

I was used to working at a company that had a clear career path. I was told before coming here that the progress is more linear but I had no idea I would have to move heaven and earth to even be considered for promotions. 

More recently, CG has been extremely focused on cost cutting. Although they say people are their only resource and expense, I see that as a way for them to say ""why would we promote you and pay you more to do the same work."" 

Also in terms of salary, CG has an amazing bonus structure and one of the only companies I know that still provide pension. That being said, the base salary is pretty low and increases each year are about 1-3%."

It's all about having a big team think of reasons why something cannot be done.  If you hired 200 good people to replace the 7.5K rules based people who are all into coming up with reasons why things cannot be done, you could lower feees for clients and have better systems, but everything is about how many people you manage, how you protect your team, and silo based thinking.

- Coffee stations and the kitchen was impressively stocked
- Respectful management","- You get 3.5 weeks off but work an extra 2.5 hours overtime every week which adds up to 3.5 weeks overtime per year. That is not mentioned in the interview process
- The overtime is then factored into your base pay to make it look like you make more
- Base pay is average, they lure you in with the benefits but they aren't that great. I don't know if most people haven't worked for fortune 500 companies but the benefits are similar to so many other decent companies around and some companies especially Scandinavian based companies have amazing benefits
- A lot of people are burned out from doing the same tedious job for 8-10 years
- No room for upward mobility
- Stratified and completely elitist as all hell 
- Some indoctrination that is completely unnecessary, for example, meeting weekly with your boss to discuss the most tedious things ever. As well as discussing the culture of capital as if it's a religion and elevating senior executives of the company to an almost rock star admiration - totally weird

Learning opportunities are also offered - mostly online - so you can learn new skills.  Bottom line: if you have the drive and take the initiative, you can do very well for yourself and your family working for CG. There is no shortage of available work!  My managers have been some of the best  I've had in my career; they are genuinely interested in improving your skill set.  I enjoy my regular meetings with my manager to get his feedback on my projects and advice on how to proceed.","There are tons of meetings and progress on initiatives seems to take forever at times; big projects can change direction in a moment's notice because they weren't engineered with enough technical input; expensive technical purchases appear to be driven by emotions at times and not by sound purchasing strategies.  You can expect to get a new buzzword introduced every 6 months or so to describe your workload, a team effort or a current project.

- Doing things differently is encouraged until you try to do something differently
- There is great hesitation to do something that could be wrong or do something when there's not consensus that it's the right decision
- Stifling for anyone who has an entrepreneurial, get-it-done mindset as the consensus-mentality cripples the efficiency to the decision-making process
- There is a vast underrepresentation of Millennials who are Associates and not contractors.  My assumption is because they leave frustrated with the pace of work.
- Management is laden with burdensome tasks that detract them from inspiring their people to be great.  Well, I should say mgmt distracts themselves with burdensome tasks rather than truly knowing and investing in their people.
- If you're looking for a place to be inspired, feel heard and reach that wonderful place where your and the company's purpose align, then this would not be a good place.  If you're looking for a paycheck where you work with pleasant, kind people, this is the perfect place for you."

The firm is obsessed with hiring newly graduated MBAs from Harvard.  It's obsession with the Harvard MBA can be considered a borderline behavioral disorder.  It'll hire a few from Wharton or Stanford.  Other than Harvard, Wharton, Stanford, it might hire someone from Insead or Columbia, once in a long time.

803,Capital Group,Contracting here is a scam,2016-05-17,1.0,,"The work-life balance is the only benefit to working here. Employee's work an 8 hour day, no more. Contractors will occasionally pull OT just to get the hours, but it isn't necessary to do your job. The only reason to accept a position here is if you have kids and are looking for a flexible paycheck - but you may have to give up your integrity to stick it out for long-term.","I really wanted to like this job, I was recruited by a 3rd party firm and told that it was a temp to potential hire contract position that would last up to 18 months with 3-6 month contract extension periods. I was also told that contractors were almost always hired on FT.  I was quoted an hourly rate and given the annual equivalent rate (which seems astronomical compared to what I had been making) and was told I was able to get benefits (health, dental, etc) through the 3rd party firm. 

What I found was that after my initial contract period, my contract extensions became shorter and shorter with no explanation as to why (even after I had inquired as to the truncation of my contracts). Towards the end, I was living from 45 day contract to 45 day contract.  I found that only a small percentage of contractors ever made the transition to FT and if one did, it was only because they went through an excruciating interview process to prove that they were qualified for a job they had already been doing for the previous 18 months. I found that the hourly rate I was quoted was up to $25 dollars an hour less than contractors doing the same work as I was. When I inquired about the discrepancy in wages I was told that Capital would not renegotiate. The benefits I was offered would have cost me over $400 a month for minimum coverage. The job I thought would get me in a better financial position ended up putting me in a cycle of barely being able to pay my monthly bills. 

But this doesn't even cover the toxic, unregulated and unprofessional environment that I worked in. 

Contractors are treated as the lowest of the low by FT employees even though they are some of the most qualified and largest amount of work force in the company. FT employees do not communicate pertinent information that will be presented in closed door meetings that you will not be invited to (because you are ""contigent"" and not deemed necessary) and they will make errors consistently, but somehow those errors will become you, the contractor's, fault. There is limited training, no consistency and the process is constantly changing. You will always be wrong.

You will also not be invited to any company sponsored event, no matter the size. Be it a birthday cake in the office next door or a ""team"" happy hour in your bosses office. You will always be left out and not considered a member of the team. You are and always will be an outsider that is not good enough to be part of the ""club"".

You will have to get used to being expendable, because there is always another person eager for the ""good paycheck"" and ""flexible work environment""."

805,Capital Group,Trying to take the good with the bad...,2016-04-10,3.0,Shareholder Account Representative,"Decent vacation/sick time accrual, paid training, large referral bonus, access to management, company is pretty willing to accommodate personal needs (although aime hoops to jump through), voluntary overtime usually available to make extra cash. Unprecedented retirement plan (company adds 15% of your total compensation each year to your retirement plan, on top of a match for your contributions), ""usually"" 2 bonuses per year. Almost always a manager around to help if you need approval or help with a situation. Many avenues for support from fellow associates and inter-office information center. Very honest environment. People will find cash or jewelry on the ground or in the bathroom ...and return it to security nearly every time, which is rare in society these days.  I recall not too long ago, someone sent out a mass email saying they found a diamond money-clip with $1400 in it, in the hallway.  They could've pocketed that and nobody would've known. But that attitude causes a ""karmic"" attitude where most seem to follow suit in case you are the victim one day!","Although there are usually many opportunities for movement in the company to help prevent ""burn out"", but nearly all are lateral movements, with no pay increase, but added responsibilities (many times even adding the new position/responsibility to what you're already doing, so in essence, you're doing two jobs now with no pay incentive). Nearly every position in the company is a ""phone job"" and it often just feels like a call center. Extreme micro management, with most of your calls being reviewed and graded, constant monitoring and analyzation of literally everything you do, including bathroom breaks, talk time, hold time, wrap up time, etc, which is then held to expectations and comparisons to others, who may be working a completely different work stream, meaning it's apples to oranges, but they don't seem to recognize or care that it causes inaccurate analysis of your performance (and I'm not disgruntled as I have higher than average scores consistently...however it is a flawed system). They are constantly hiring new people to relieve overworked employees like myself...yet no relief seems to come of it, plus they aren't paying a profit sharing bonus this year because of all the new hires (so it's like you are having something taken away, after putting in countless mandatory OT hours and working extremely hard to meet company standards/expectations on an increased work-load). Management plays favorites. Very political and ridiculously PC company mindset. One thing I've noticed in my time there is that so many of your peers seem to have a childish, ""tattle-tale"" mentality...always looking for someone to ""snitch"" on or throw others under the bus, for trivial things that make so sense as to why an adult would even bat an eye, let alone run and tell your manager about it.  So many areas for improvement or making things more fair/efficient, while saying they want everyone's input, but then great ideas are brushed under the rug unless management came up with idea themselves."

Master retirement plan is like a golden hand cuff. Almost rare in this industry for the employer to look after you keeping your twilight days in view.
Co Workers are very respectful to each other and it is the core value of Capital Group. Very very special attribute of CG.
CG has  a great history and reputation.","The company is still partially stuck in its past successes and tends to look back at what worked though in this industry future results are routinely stated to be not an indicator of future success.

Part of the above problem is that the average tenure at CG is around the 10-12 year mark. Even though employee retention is good, it is imperative to move on with the need of the times in terms of skill set of your work force. CG's technology toolkit ( which employees use) is dated to say the least.

They need to reinvent their model of investment in my view and I might be wrong. Given how the market is moving more towards ETF, index based strategies, it is going to be tough justifying some of CG's long term results views in the future, unless there is a structural shift in market dynamics

CG's perception of quantitative rigor is markedly different from the rest of the world which can be good or bad depending on where you come from. Personally I enjoyed the process more than some one else might (this is for people considering quantitative roles at CG)"

There are break rooms everywhere.  with ice machines, coffee, fridges and microwaves.","The environment was harsh because of the sensitive culture that is encouraged.  There is no criticism, joking or asking hard to answer questions.  The team I was on had allot of insecurity about the technology being used, insecurity in general about the project.  They did not like a new comer having new ideas or suggestions.  They do not like you asking for clarification because you are new and need further insight so you can ramp up to speed.  They will misinterpret everything you say and look for ways that could be interpreted as talking down to people.  They take things out of context and report you for a single sentence you said that was part of a larger conversation, because they believe it to be insulting.  In short you have to be careful with everything you do and say.  They have meetings to prepare for meetings.  They have too many meetings, which gives a developer about 2 hours to develop if they are lucky.  Projects will move along at a snails pace with no since of urgency.  If you try to help move it along you are not being a team player.  If you do not agree with everyone else's opinion you are not being a team player.  If you express opinions, do prototyping, ask questions to the product owner of clarification you are seen as trying to make yourself more important than anyone else on the team and will be reminded that you are not anymore important than anyone else and the project is the most important thing.  They say they buy into whole team ownership of the code but then will be told that if you need to modify someone else's code that you need to talk to the author first and get permission.  If you point out issues in the code that could result in issues later they will think you are being critical.  If you point out issues where other's are not conforming to coding standards, they will think you are being critical.  They will think your trying to prove yourself when all your doing is trying to do your job when you do not care about impressing anyone, all you want to do is work and to feel like you contributed.  

Onboarding was a nightmare.  I was promised that I would be given briefings on the architecture. I was promised that I would get to shadow others to learn the business, code and project.  I was given a brief demo and explanation of the project that was being rewritten, and that was it.  I spent the rest of my time reading going to meetings to prepare for other meetings.  No one had time to help me because of meetings that left them to complete their assigned tasks.  Other people's time is limited because of meetings, so being able to shadow and get a full understanding of your project may not happen."

There are impenetrable layers of authority and bureaucracy. Nothing gets done. Ever. It's frustrating. Everyone is a project manager, so projects never get completed. You spend half your life in pointless meetings so people can hear themselves talk.

The fact is, as automation takes over and the business is more efficient there will be a need for less people. The people sitting behind the glass offices are entrenched. They are in career preservation mode. The lack of action speaks more than words.

If you like a stable job with no growth but perpetually good healthcare benefits, this is the firm for you.","It is very old school, and management/culture has not been effectual in improving career development of employees at all. There is a stigma associated with entering the firm at a junior level, and how you progress tends to be determined by which program you came in, not by aptitude. Internal candidates that have been earmarked for promotion tend to wait around for years while the firm goes out on a limb for outsiders. They have enacted some superficial steps for improvement, but an ingrained culture that is against promoting from within is hard to change. This is relevant only to the investment group.

Most of the people they hire are friendly and it's not too hard to develop some good friendships here.","Coming in I thought this would be a place where I could develop a long term career. The people were friendly, there seemed to be a large support system, and the campus was beautiful. During the tours they gave us, staff would always point out the best things (great cafe food, big open campus, free coffee, open door policy for managers, etc). After some time though the facade starts to fade away and you start seeing what is really going on. I have gotten a sense from some of the older workers that the company used to be better but the financial crash of 2008 really changed things. Mandatory overtime can run up to 2 hours a day which can really drain you throughout the course of a week. Time off during the year end holidays is very hard to get. Upward mobility is very slow, very few openings for managerial positions. More lateral than upward movement. Management tries to make things seem nicer than they are, my favorite being calling overtime ""additional time."" Company is very very slow to adapt to change both with external and internal policies. Training can feel long and overdrawn. I really wish I could recommend this company because at first it sounds amazing. At the end of the day though, I am not happy and I can very much tell there are several other associates who are not happy."

That should tell you something.

If you move up the ladder from within pay may be 25- 30 percent less than those that are hired from outside the company.  You will see a lot of people able to squeak by and get promoted while not doing much.  Micro management.  If you are hard working you will always have a target on your back.  You will see that people at the top hire their buddies to insulate themselves.  Good ole boy system is alive and well.  Can be very difficult to get ahead and be treated with respect if you are a female.  Bonuses are not necessarily based on merit.  They talk about their ""open door policy,"" but don't do that.  Be very careful about what you voice and how.  Creativity is not fostered nor encouraged.  Environment fosters apathy.  Many people with ill intentions get promoted."
