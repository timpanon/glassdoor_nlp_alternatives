0,Capital One,Great Company,2022-04-04,5.0,Associate Treasury Management Consultant,Great company culture and trying to be a more progressive bank,Strategy often shifts and too many vendor partnerships vs. building products in-house
1,Capital One,"Decent pay, questionable culture, poor management",2022-03-11,2.0,Principal Associate Software Engineer,"- Pay isn't too shabby, but I'm a rather cheap hire anywhere","- Incompetent managers with backgrounds not related to what they're entrusted with managing 
- Talent attrition rate right now is horrendously high, lateral movement is extremely common as well which is also a bad sign
- Social interactions with teammates don't exist if you're a new hire (things are very insular in this org) until you feel too isolated at work and engaged outside of work that your teammates just are an afterthought, the pandemic seems to have created a weird social side effect here
- I made a few minor mistakes and my manager started just filing conduct memo after conduct memo until I shut down, HR did essentially nothing and everyone quit/moved teams
- They post shill reviews here (I work in the same org as the current 5 star reviews)
- The only BIPOC person on the team made a lateral move as soon as I started and I don't think that's a good indicator of an inclusive culture
- I'm worked like a dog right now and my manager doesn't even show up to standup"
2,Capital One,"Customer focus, constant change",2021-10-15,5.0,"Senior Manager, Product Manager","True customer focus through all levels of management. Everyone is collaborating with the customers' best interests at heart. As a product manager I got to partner with designers, business analysts, data engineers, and of course my tech teams of 4-7 software engineers. 
Auto loans is organized into ""experiences,"" each focused on a different phase of the customer's journey, and product managers get a high level of autonomy to develop new features and improve processes. 
My projects were engaging. People across job families were engaged in their work, smart, collaborative, and really nice.
Also we're a good mix of a tech company and a bank: product and technology are at the focus of the company, but you still get banking holidays and log out at 5pm every day.
I was in auto loans in the Plano campus.","There is a high level of change: I had 5 managers in the last 12 months. That's higher than average, but everyone seems to change managers at least once a year if not twice; either because the manager gets moved to a different team or because you do. 
My projects tended to get changed frequently as well: partway through a project, leadership would change the objective and ask us to focus on a different goal, abruptly stopping a 6- or 12-month project halfway through without us delivering anything. That happened enough to my projects and other product managers' to become a pattern. 
This all combines to a frustrating level of change when you have really interesting projects and would love to get them out to customers. My advice would be to start coding an MVP as quickly as possible so you can at least deliver something before priorities shift."
3,Capital One,COAF does attempt to go above and beyond for its employees.,2022-03-30,5.0,Total Loss Agent,"The work from home life is important. You aren't in danger going to at work location by someone else, who has low awareness to social distance. Diversity and inclusion are important. They preach this but words alone aren't enough. They have given great effort, but words are cheap. To really be inclusive, it must be visual. I have not seen higher ranking employees diversify.",COAF sold me on the ability to migrate into any industry CO is in. I found it quite difficult to break into roles I was eyeing for years. Promoting up on a pace that you see for your own career I view as a con. As well as diversity as a con. This company isn't as diverse as it claims. That hasn't changed much over my tenure either.
4,Capital One,"Nice place to work, BUT Stack ranking ouch",2022-03-28,4.0,Senior Manager Software Engineering,"It's a nice place with tons of perks, and I loved them.

WLB, is said a lot, but if you take advantage of it your rating will drop and stack ranking will bite you.","You have to stack rank your staff. So as a manager, you need to always hire someone that will be cut. So unlike other places, if you do a good job as a manager all of your staff should be average or above, or issues dealt with ASAP.

At C1, you need those people to stick around till December, every year, that way you have someone at below average. And if you don't, then you are tagged as below average for having an above average team."
5,Capital One,Pretty good place if you know how to play politics,2022-02-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The salary is a little lower if not middle of the pack for the industry; CEO and senior executives seem to really understand remote work is a big draw for many of us staying here; when you get a good manager/boss who cares, it makes you want to stay.","At the senior executive level, it seems they genuinely care about people retention and what the industry is doing. At the lower levels, People managers can be dismissive of BIPOC issues and while they will listen to you complain about being bullied, they will also use corporate speak to say it’s your own fault. This happened to me twice, with one of the times making it into my performance review as something I should improve. I was so mad about this, but luckily changing teams is not too hard to do! The flexibility in changing teams and moving to a nicer team are why I stayed. I will say also that it’s almost impossible to give reviews about your own people manager anonymously so my old people manager is sadly still there."
6,Capital One,Head in Sand,2022-04-02,3.0,Attorney,The overall culture is positive,"There are too many roadblocks to advancement and little transparency. If you are good at your job and keep your business happy, you could probably stay there forever but never advance beyond Director. At some point they just made it next to impossible (unless you are one of the anointed) to progress beyond that level. They have also started hiring attys at ridiculously low levels so even getting to the ""catch all"" Director stage is much more challenging."
7,Capital One,"Relaxing, low stress place to work",2022-03-24,5.0,Senior Business Analyst,Fantastic work life balance. Consistent 30 hour work weeks. Great name on resume for credit—lots of fintechs will try to poach,"Not the most fast paced of working environments. Work has no urgency. Pay was median for 2018-2020, but is now severely under market for 2022."
8,Capital One,Good work life balance,2022-04-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Good work life balance for most of the time,Compensation can be better for certain job roles
9,Capital One,Great company,2022-04-03,5.0,S S E(Senior Software Engineer),"Great company, really cares about its customers and employees. Nice work life balance as well.","Can be political, performance management process is heavily reliant on who your manager is."
10,Capital One,Great Company to work for,2022-04-04,5.0,Senior Internal Auditor,Great team and culture to work for.,No complaints. Can't think of any cons.
11,Capital One,Good Company,2022-04-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Fair company to work for,Have to work Sunday or Saturday within work schedule.
12,Capital One,Exodus of tech talent doesn't faze management,2022-03-31,3.0,Software Engineer,"- company can still get things done when upper management deems it necessary and throws people together to make it happen. When the pandemic started, there were lots of such initiatives to make it easier for customers and employees.
- good work/life balance
- great 401k match and benefits
- great place to learn about AWS tech
- company really values customer feedback and tries to do right by them","- RSUs are only for master software engineers and above. CEO likes to include C1 in the ranks of netflix, amazon and other companies that have crossed the digital canyon. But compensation structure is nowhere near them.

- extremely tough to get promoted unless you are willing to spend 50% of your time in networking with other teams and know all the right people. The bar for promotion keeps raising every cycle even though the managers promise that you are next in line.

- recruiters constantly try to down-level qualified candidates and convince them that they should be promoted within six months, which sadly never happens. 

- the CTO launched the TDP program to get new college grads into C1 and give them the best training among employee groups. TDPs get the plum assignments and get promoted faster than people who came through regular channels. But TDPs use the time to brush up on leetCode skills and move on to bigger tech companies. As a way to stop such churn, CTO seems to have asked managers to promote them even faster :eyeroll:

- new people managers leave within 6-10 months since they get sick of the games that they have to play to get their employees promoted. Old-timers can play the cross-calibration games that are used to stack-rank employees better than newbies.

- even though lots of companies have abandoned stack-ranking, C1 seems intent on making it work. Out of 74 possible candidates for a job category in the last cycle, only 4 got promoted, supposedly due to stack ranking. This leads to a lot of good engineers leaving for better pay. If you are interviewing for a position, ask the recruiter for the list of people promoted in the last cycle. The shortness of the list should help you decide if you want to play the game. 

- every team has 30-40% contractors and their talent level has dropped considerably during the pandemic. Full-time engineers spend a lot of time coaching these contractors in addition to their regular work. Managers seem to be not willing to remediate the situation, since its tough to get any contractors in the first place."
13,Capital One,Great Place to Work,2022-03-28,5.0,Senior Associate,Great place to work with great benefits.,"Upward mobility can be tough if you have high turnover among your manager role, since that person has to essentially convince everybody else that you deserve to be promoted, and if they're not totally familiar with your work, it can be difficult."
14,Capital One,Work life balance,2022-04-03,5.0,Senior Relationship Manager,Plenty of PTO with flexibility depending on deot,Disparity in pay for internal associates
15,Capital One,Good,2022-03-31,5.0,Ambassador,Great benefits and retirement plans.,Retail has a very small space for career goals.
16,Capital One,Best company I’ve worked for yet,2022-04-02,4.0,Associate Relations Specialist,"Fantastic health benefits, co-workers are typically  friendly and hardworking. Get the sense that the company generally cares about their employees.","Performance review process sucks. It’s not enough to be good at your job, you need to be better than your peers to be ranked well. You also have to play office politics."
17,Capital One,Amazing place to work!,2022-03-29,5.0,Branch Ambassador,"Great and helpful team. 
Most times, it doesn’t feel like work especially when you’re dealing with great, pleasant customers.","Having to deal with not so great customer. 
People with zero manner or common decency."

19,Capital One,"Potential for development is there, most Cafe leaders are too inexperienced in leadership though",2022-02-05,3.0,Cafe Ambassador,"- Plenty of opportunities for development and internal mobility
- Big focus on Diversity and Inclusion
- Open door policy even with upper management
- Generally, you get to decide what you want to work on (aside from the basic job duties) 
- Volunteering opportunities (on halt because of Covid-19)
- Relatively generous PTO program
- Decent benefits","- A lot of Cafe Leadership is inexperienced, not many are true leaders - most are just playing boss
- There are minimal to no actions taken by HR and leadership against reports of hostile co-workers/work environment
- No Covid-19 sick leave - you have to use your own PTO if you need to quarantine, even if the exposure happened at work
- Depending on the leader you get, well-being and work-life-balance will be an afterthought, even though the company overall constantly speaks on the importance of work-life-balance and encourages doing what you need for your own well being."
20,Capital One,Great WLB,2022-03-30,5.0,Software Engineer,Great WLB; coworkers are friendly; managers exhibit concerns for employees’ happiness,Pace can be slow; consistent technical challenges can be hard to find
21,Capital One,Great Company!,2022-03-31,5.0,Human Resources Associate,"Great culture, good pay, awesome benefits, and a lot of smart/kind people",Performance management is really frustrating
22,Capital One,best work life balance,2022-03-28,5.0,Agile Delivery Lead,Capital one has the best work life balance I've ever experienced from any company I've ever worked for. No exaggeration.,total comp is lower than big tech industry standard.
23,Capital One,pretty good,2022-04-01,5.0,Accounting,Very respectful to their employees,Pay rate is very low
24,Capital One,Current Position,2022-03-30,5.0,Call Center Representative,"Great hours, pay, and training",I do not have any cons at the moment. It is a great place to work.
25,Capital One,Great company to start off with,2022-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Provide great support to fresh grads,Can get a bit corporate
26,Capital One,Experienced Hires Beware,2022-01-17,2.0,Business Director,"- Large corporate option in the DC area with strong brand 
- Typically good work-life balance relative to pay
- Great benefits package for healthcare, parental benefits, etc. 
- Attractive Tysons campus, especially with new additions of Wegmans, Capital One Hall, etc.
- Generally nice and hardworking colleagues","- For the Business Analysis job family, it's extremely difficult for experienced hires at any level to be successful and especially to get promoted. That's based on hundreds of associate observations in talent conversations across multiple years and lines of business. Powerful transferrable skills and extremely hardwork are no substitute for leaders actually seeing an individual do the work since they were 22 years old. (Analyst Development Program is the preferred entry point.) 
- Re-organizations multiple times per year, which can be demoralizing and frustrating for everyone involved. 
- Organizational politics especially at the Director plus levels. I spent a significant amount of time trying to understand what leaders wanted and working to influence them (and still wasn't successful)."
27,Capital One,I want to work for capital One again just not in small business banking,2022-03-23,5.0,Senior Advocacy Coordinator,Overall capital One is a great company to work for.,Small business banking the management is unprofessional and in order to grow and develop you have to be related to manager or their Bestfriend.
28,Capital One,"Incompetent, egocentric middle management in Enterprise Digital group",2022-01-12,2.0,Senior Product Manager,"+ Nice campus and office environment (prior to offices closed due to COVID)
+ Relatively good pay
+ CEO with good vision and willingness to invest in technical innovation
+ Senior leadership in Enterprise Digital group are very thoughtful and caring (but overshadowed by the incompetent middle management sycophants)","- Performance and promotions are based on who likes you -- not whether you delivered significant business value
- Managers promoted to their own level of *incompetence*
- Everyone out for themselves
- Managers take credit for what their team delivers
- You only get a good review if someone else gets a bad one (bell curve)
- Managers are limited to how many top performance or promotions they can put forward; so, others get left behind (even if they're doing a good job)
- Incompetent managers are never fired -- only their victims that work for them
- Improper conduct (harassment) by management only results in a slap on the wrist
- Managers don't care if you succeed or fail; employee failure is never seen as a potential reflection on poor management / leadership"
29,Capital One,Good Benfits & WLB,2022-03-30,5.0,Senior Data Scientist,WLB is very good and the management is fair,Can't think of any rn

- Good Pay for what you actually do (in general)
- Good data ecosystem and analytical tools
- Senior Management is good and can trust the ship is steered towards healthy financials
- Can jump around teams internally very easily","- Data Analysts get treated like dog crap relative to Business Analysts, Tech, and DS.
- A lot of compliance groups to bottleneck work and de-motivate you (the pro of this is you can use it to prolong the work)
- Diversity groups monitor your slack messages for you to ""consider your word choices"" (a pro if you find SJWs funny)"
32,Capital One,Ok experience,2022-04-02,4.0,Senior Vice President Product Management,"Interesting and challenging work, competitive compensation and benefits, great investment in employee development.","The employee review (aka “calibration”) process is inaccurate, biased, and politically motivated, where individuals outside of your org with little intercession with you, weigh in on your ratings, resulting in high turnover of employees."
33,Capital One,Management,2022-03-26,3.0,Customer Service Representative,Overall campus is great. The company had great restaurants with plenty of selections. Most all of the employees are very friendly.,My complaint was with one supervisor. I was trying to get into recruiting. She was trying to make me stay in customer service. She began harassing me and calling me down and writing me up every day and eventually letting me go. The department was short-staffed.

37,Capital One,Worst service job I ever had,2021-12-11,2.0,Branch Ambassador,"- you can easily pick up hours depending on which market you're in
- when your manager is good, they're really good
- the pay throughout the pandemic was excellent. Industry leading
- benefits were fantastic, industry leading","- banks have the RUDEST customers, easily. Worse than food service. It is insane the ways people will talk to you. Be warned.
- things change way too often and for no reason.
- absolutely NO GROWTH when i worked here. You are a branch ambassador. Thats it. Theres branch ambassador and then theres market manager. I was there over 2 years and heard of one true promotion - everything else were lateral changes (sorry, branch ambassador to call center is not a promotion)
- the work they had us do during development (for reviews and such) were childish.
- you are not seen as capable adults. You will be micromanaged
- branches closing left and right, adds to angry customers and will leave you not feeling secure about your job
- they are cheap and slow with giving security guards, even when the entire branch feels its needed. They are cheap.
- not a knock on capital one, its banking, but you are on camera, you are being watched. I worked in NY so no audio but if you are in other states where audio without consent is legal, becareful about what you say..
- the ""culture"" is to brown nose..."

Aspiring Product Managers be warned,2022-03-10,1.0,Senior Associate Product Manager,"The recruiting + interview experience was positive, up until I received my actual offer letter.","Once I was extended an offer, I then chose to professionally send a written negotiation letter on the basis of compensation and PTO. The compensation was well below my current salary, and the PTO was ABYSMAL (10 days- like seriously?). In response to my negotiation (which I wrote super respectfully), the recruiter calls me to let me know that the hiring manager doesn't think I'm a good fit anymore, and wants to withdraw the offer."

Benefits, specifically 401k match and ESPP are fantastic
Not stingy with personal tech
Good pay for finance, but not competitive with Tech","Just an absolute crapshoot with leadership. Often leaders are so insulated from the inner-workings of their organization that they fail to see underlying issues, let alone course-correct. Promotions are not truly based on competency or subject matter expertise, but political capital. If it wasn't for the overall low stress environment at the company, this would be a larger point of frustration for me."
51,Capital One,Why work at Capital One,2022-04-03,4.0,Software Engineer,"There are a lot of interesting projects that use a lot of different software such as cloud, AI, etc.",Can be a big company so your work may not be as visible.

There are favorites, so you better focus on managing up; failure to live up to mission and values in terms of DEI, mental health, and overall associate wellness (lip service only); few Black and brown associates in executive roles throughout company; meeting heavy, so actual work often takes place outside regular work hours; diversity is not truly prioritized by those able to implement change--true work takes place many levels below and is not well supported; the straight white males who make up the company's upper ranks, including corporate communications, are allowed to be on their own ""journey"" with diversity and inclusion, but this journey has no end in sight and they're traveling on a first class ticket; lack of diversity of thought and work styles (templated approach to both); white women are provided many opportunities, which is great, but they are allowed to manage with little apparent oversight while the same is not true of other groups; suggestions for change fall on deaf ears; executives are idealized and rarely questioned, access to them is limited, and they are often surrounded by sycophants; team is kept extremely young and older workers are culled regularly. Overall, associates can have a completely different experience based on their age, race, sexual orientation, personality type."
54,Capital One,GREAT OPPORTUNITY,2022-01-05,4.0,VISUAL ARTIST,"Lots of pros to list here: 
Culture of people that I was surrounded by was always positive and uplifting
C1 takes the time to empower you to make decisions and present ideas","Yearly reviews, based on performance, is lacking. It really leaves a lot to be desired. 

As someone who was rated Strong/Very Strong, year over year, it became frustrating that I was not seeing promotions. Especially after I learned that the only reason I was being held back, was because HR didn't see the value in the team and it would raise too many questions if there were to be a promotion. This was after being told that I had been ready for the next step/promotion for a long time. There's too much to write to truly explain to this story, but that is main idea behind it all. It's unfortunate, but sometimes, we recognize bad decisions and move forward with life.

Oh, and last thing, I wish that you had more of a voice when presenting these issues, but the reality is- the company is so large that it is hard to get your voice heard on an issue like this particular one. It's unfortunate, really, but overall a fantastic place to work. 

Chances are, most people will not experience this same type of event. This was strictly within the organization that I worked within, and they are not actively hiring Visual Artists any longer."

However, growing in the company can take years and if you are not networking that can be a problem as well. I feel as if you have to know the right people in order to grow since the company is so large.

And then after a good day, you can get right on the highway to zip on home.","Open plan seating during conference calls with both coasts means not being able to really hear the call if people get loud, which they do.

129,Capital One,Toxic performance culture,2022-02-25,2.0,Senior Director,"Work life balance is extremely good at Capital One. Families are the norm and are very well supported with decent leave policies and flexible work arrangements. They are in no rush to return to the office, and leaders as well as associates extol the benefits of working from home. Compensation is quite high for certain job families (ie. software engineering), but uneven for other groups.","Meeting culture can be paralyzing due to personnel bloat at the bank. Leadership and steering meetings often involve 30+ people, which makes it difficult to generate decision or have meaningful conversation. 

Performance culture forcing PIP quotas breeds a climate where bootlickers are rewarded and independent thinkers are punished. In the end, calibration boils down to a popularity contest where people who are well liked by leadership get promoted and those who challenge leadership are voted into weak performance and managed out.

You will find that there are two classes of employees at Capital One, lifelong veterans who have been with the bank for 20 or more years, have never worked anywhere else and are -deeply- invested in the way things are, and folks who've been around for 2 or 3 years deciding if it's worthwhile to stick it out. The former class are entrenched and know how to use the performance management system to reward each other and cement power. The second class are prey and fodder for the veterans."

Once Capital One got rid of individual rolls and made everyone Branch Ambassadors, that's when things started to go down. They got rid of people who actually cared, they ask and grade us on things during audits that are not necessary anymore, and they do not care about you. Management thinks they have to know everything going on in your personal life, and will still try to make you come in when you call out or even on bereavement. They expect you to break your back over this job when they don't pay you to do that. I got sick and tired of working for them.

They are trying to make things more equitable for women and minorities but have a way to go.
I do like the CEO and CIO. They make good decisions and drive the business/technology to the leading edge.","The performance management process is brutal for managers trying their best to take care of their people and represent them in a ""cross-calibration"" process. For employees, there's a forced distribution with very high numbers on the bottom end. Those being forced into the bottom rating will not receive a raise and a nominal bonus. For this reason, I would not recommend working for the company. It's not a great way to treat employees who work hard and are loyal.

While I do appreciate the CEO and CIO, I do question their judgment in continuing the performance management process they just won't let go of. It's a completely demoralizing process. For this reason, I have marked the Culture & Values at 3 stars."
156,Capital One,Good benefits. Environment can be toxic.,2022-03-08,1.0,Software Engineer,Good benefit package. Good WLB.,"It is a bank - meaning that c1 does NOT have a good tech culture that they are bragging about.  If you decide to join, you might want to be mindful of selecting a good group. Talk to your future coworkers before you join. It will help. 

For me, it had been the worst experience in my career so far. I happened to experience organizational changes few months later after I joined. I can write a book to rant about my experience with C1 but I would like my review to be served as an informational guide for people who are considering to accept an offer:

1)  The work is easy. The majority of the time I spent here is at meetings listening other people to argue about some nonsense and work that the manager tries to put the team through in order to make us look busy. 

2) There are some chance that you can fall under a horrible manager.  It depends on how “lucky” you are because reorg happens often. Btw, the definition of an “incompetent leader” to me: full of ego, hollow in knowledge, insecure, micromanaging, bossy, couldn’t care less about emoloyee’s wellbeing. It was my first time encountering toxic people in my life, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 

3) Stack ranking at a bank? As many of the other reviews have mentioned, your performance is evaluated against people at the same level as you. If you get a manager who is willing to advocate for you, then you are the lucky one. Although it is not guaranteed that you will get a “above strong” rating, your life will still be easier.  If you happen to get a bad manager who only cares about the time you put into nonsense work because they don’t know much about tech, you will be as miserable as me :). Choose wisely."

- Stock Purchase Program. Stock is bought at the end of the month and can be sold once they hit your account.
- Work life balance can be great depending on team","- If you are experienced hire you will be paid less than an entry level college hire
- Company will make you lazy. Coding is secondary here. AWS and buggy enterprise tools is all you will deal with.
- Performance Management Process is absolutely horrendous. Stack ranking makes performance management a popularity contest. You need to know how to play office politics.
- No COL raises. Only merit raises. They will only give non merit based raises to TDPs (entry level college hires)
- Work life balance can be horrible depending on team.

172,Capital One,Great People Company,2021-12-28,5.0,Software Engineer,Competitive Salary. Cares about their workers and the people they serve. Great start for those fresh out of college or making a career change (after doing junior dev work). Cares about what you learn and how you advance as an individual because they want the best individuals.,They pride themselves on being disruptive as a company which means they often try new things and lead themselves into new places which is great as and allows to expand your learning. But at times you go down dead ends and during transitions you can feel a bit rudderless. But it’s a necessary part of business in my opinion

I met co workers who became family,Toxic Corporate Bullying and gaslighting. Department Managers and Sr. Managers (PAs) play favoritism and expect unethical behavior from their Unit Managers to keep Associate Engagement Surveys above 80%
212,Capital One,A great place to start,2021-11-08,4.0,Business Manager,"- Great culture and great people

- The campus in Northern Virginia is shaping up to be an incredible one after all the construction, but traffic is going to be a massive headache

- Most of the perks you could possibly want, including paid leave for both parents (much less for fathers than for mothers), 401K match, and wellness reimbursements","- Work delivery is slow, with some projects taking a year or dragging on for months before getting killed, so your rating / promotion can get political, with how you're perceived being more important than what you actually deliver

- Company has a mission of doing right by its customers that it preaches regularly, but it's hard to see how Capital One has differentiated itself from major competitors in that regard

- You're largely on your own in terms of development and career progression and your mileage varies significantly by your direct manager. There are a lot of great people leaders at Capital One, but there's a constant shuffle, and you need to manage this process proactively

- The company is not supportive of remote work. You can, but this is your last step on the corporate ladder."

216,Capital One,Good place for some,2021-12-10,3.0,Principal Software Engineer,Work life balance is reasonable most of the time. Some teams get to solve interesting problems. Possible to grow if you stay with the company for a while.,"Bloated middle management leads to a lack of technical direction. They are not close enough to the ground truth to focus on solving the real problems. For a company that wants to be ""all in"" on AWS, the cloud controls are ridiculously opaque and Kafka-esque. Many times people just won't know how to be productive with AWS because the best practices aren't clearly communicated. 
Performance management is an absolute mess, retaliatory behavior goes unpunished, so talent leaks like a sieve."
217,Capital One,Lack of Leadership,2022-01-20,2.0,Branch Ambassador,"Benefits are great (tutition reinbursement, healthcare benefits, ect)","Being in a customer facing role you definitely become a therapist for a lot of customers, many in which take their frustrations out on you which can be mentally draining.

228,Capital One,Lots of Opportunity for Professional Growth,2021-11-12,4.0,Software Engineer%2C Senior Associate,"Capital One marshals vast resources to make professional development available to their associates in the form of conferences, technical learning resources (aCloud Guru, Udemy, etc), and opportunities to build and try new things. They emphasize addressing unconscious bias in decision making and open leader / subordinate relationships in a culture of advancement. They target paying higher than the regional median for tech talent, and are aware of the current tight labor market and have made appropriate adjustments for that. 401k matching is competitive. They're health insurance plan is self-funded, which works well for the associates because they have a pretty large risk pool that skews healthier and younger, which keeps premiums pretty low for very competitive coverage.","Large tech stack with a fair amount of duplication means it takes too long to build and deliver new systems. Internal documentation is often difficult to find, and is sometimes out of date. Reliance on internal interfaces to gatekeep cloud deployment means that learning and using ""X"" cloud service at Capital One is not the same as learning and using ""X"" cloud service generally or elsewhere. ""Meeting Culture"""
229,Capital One,Great work-life balance.,2022-01-31,5.0,Senior Associate,I am amazed at the amount of design talent that exists at Capital One.

-Decent hours if you’re not a people leader
-Good 401k match with some immediate vesting, cheap health insurance and some FSA matching $
-Coworkers are competent
-Friends/family think you have a prestigious employer (unless they are in true Silicon Valley-level tech or are far-left and think credit cards prey on the poor and uneducated)
-Gift card points handed out like candy
-Monthly “no meetings” days
-Founder/CEO explains his strategy in detail every year
-Pays well for Plano, Chicago, and Richmond
-Good on-site amenities before COVID
-Meetings have 5-10 minute breaks in between
-You get a couple extra national holidays since it is a bank. People are dismissed after lunch on Fridays heading into 3-day weekends","-Every employee is stack-ranked, with ~5-10% of people getting punished with half bonuses, half raises, and being put on a PIP (fast track to being let go) each year. HR glides over all this when you join, but the fear of this by itself changes a lot of behaviors and internal politics. For example, everyone is obsessed with working on projects that look good when reported to higher-ups, sometimes at the cost of doing what they think really should be done. Perception is everything at Capital One, even if it is not the only place like this in the job market
-Only two weeks’ vacation when you join (and it gets prorated)
-No stock grants in most cases unless you’re a director+, very unusual for a self-proclaimed tech company
-The salaries look high at each title, but there’s down-leveling and title deflation, so set your expectations conservatively. At an IC level, you are told you could get promoted at any time to encourage you to work harder for free (they will not remind you there’s a cap on promotions each cycle until you don’t get the promotion)
-No more Excel, everyone uses Google Sheets now
-Personal email is blocked on work computers, and you’ll be doing two-factor authentication at least half a dozen times a day
-Contractors and fresh college grads constantly joining and leaving teams, requiring a lot of training, explaining, and finding replacements. These less efficient newbies are often paid close to what much more experienced/FT hires make
-A culture of forced optimism (even printed on shirts and mugs) where instead of saying there’s a problem or a weakness, everyone says you have an “opportunity” 😀
-Pay is not competitive in NY or SF
-Constant mandatory training courses (the acronym is CBT, and the joke writes itself if you look it up) and reminders from your VP that your department looks bad if anyone is late completing the courses
-Extremely hierarchical culture — be prepared to be discouraged from initiating a 1:1 meeting with anyone more than a bit higher than you in title/scope 
-You cannot work remotely from anywhere outside the US even during COVID (most places will only ban a few countries) 
-Before COVID working from home was heavily discouraged though office crowding was an issue"

I've never worked for a company where I've received a raise EVERY year I worked for them. Unheard of. The amount of vacation I receive is insane.,The only thing I can think of is due to the company being so large the hr system/job postings should be easier to navigate. Feels like sometimes when I search for opportunities I'm not sure if I'm seeing all the opportunities I could qualify for. They are improving that since we're almost fully virtual (at least on the credit card side) to reflect position locations as virtual and not necessarily tied to one or two locations in the US.

289,Capital One,Good Pay But Experience Won't Be Fulfilling,2022-01-18,2.0,Product Manager,"Good salary
The company does well and if you do your work right, there is job security
You can have a good work/life balance if you navigate and find the right team
Pleasant people at the associate and manager level
If you are in one of the hubs like Clarendon/Richmond there are a lot of onsite perks. Lots of meals and food.","Being a minority here will be a challenging experience. The company has a performance management system that really favors how friendly you are with your manager. Usually this benefits buddy-buddy relationships. I've seen managers and higher-ups favor their online gaming friends, intentionally punish/target a team with a minoritized racial identity. You can read the comments in other posts, there are a lot of jabs at non-white members within the company, people complaining about the company focusing on hiring or promoting women. The senior leadership is pretty racially and gender homogenous and if trickle down was ever a real, its how this company works.

As a PM, your experience will be a lot of meetings and managing up. Which may not be unique to the role at any place. In my experience, I found that due to the need to impress people with decks or ""influence"" over working product or code, people invite everyone senior to meetings to voice their opinion. It's a very hierarchical company, so before any decision gets made you will be talking to every co product owner and their boss and bosses boss and boss on boss to make any type of decision. This all means you likely won't get much done.

There's a lot of politics at Capital One. A Lot. So be prepared to undertake in all these games. It's a bit toxic really and probably the worst part of the job.

I don't think you will gain much technical product experience. Capital One is a very product risk averse company. There really isn't a culture of testing and learning you may get at other software companies. You will hopefully get a very specific idea/product the company wants to build. Pray that the company fully invests in it, and if you are lucky within two or three years it may come to life. Within that time you will likely get reorg-ed and your project may go dead. You won't easily get access to the data of products or even company market research/strategy.

Another tension at Capital One is balancing your personal sanity with the desire to perform the Capital One Way. To maintain sanity, you will want to avoid as many meetings, interactions with senior leadership that don't go anywhere, and find a core team that you are highly efficient with. Unfortunately, the stacked ranking system benefits you interacting with lots of managers, showboating that you are influential across multiple organizations or teams, and networking. This will likely stretch you thin and just be present to too many ineffective meetings and obnoxious politics or power dynamics within the company. You will start to think about these relationships and dynamics all the time. Your life will blend into Capital One. At some point, you will probably need a therapist to remind you that all these stressors are only at the office. However, you will fill a strong need/desire to be in with the ""in-crowds"" at Capital One. 

My advice is if you take a junior/principal role here, find a product in later life cycle/in market one that's critical to the company, learn the basics of managing a product in market, working with an engineering team and design group then peace out. There's not much here for building/launching/improving. It's NOT a technology company despite whatever HR /company site tells you."

That said, the compensation and bonuses with ""Strong"" or significant and if you can handle getting that, even some years when you felt you deserved more, then you will probably be the one to stay and enjoy the significant pros of working here."

394,Capital One,Call Center Job that is a Dead End in Auto,2021-07-07,3.0,Relationship Manager,"Time off is great, benefits and retirement package are good too. Cap One is very supportive in diversity","There aren't many places to go other than being a Relationship Manager or an Area Sales Manager. THAT'S IT which makes the competition hard to move into management bc people won't want to leave management if that is a goal of yours. If you are not interested in management then you are stuck in your sales role so you can't move around and learn other interesting skills or job functions. It's a dead-end job sadly and Cap One Auto has made no improvements in trying to create new jobs other than just sales or management. So BE WARNED, if you are lucky to be chosen as a Relationship Manager or Area Sales Manager get comfortable. It definitely can cause burnout doing the same thing day in and day out with no prospects of learning new skills for new roles within the auto division. Do not be deceived, Relationship Manager is a call center role-if you are not a call center type this job isn't for you,if you plan to come in and move around don't come into Capital One Auto Finance--find another way into Capital One. I cannot stress enough that this is a DEAD END JOB and in NO way a Career."

397,Capital One,Flexibility is key,2021-12-24,5.0,Principal Engineer,"I had a fantastic experience at Capital One. Great pay, benefits, team, manager and career growth.",Some of my friends were not as lucky as I and were under some bad managers. I recommend that if you find yourself in that situation try to switch to another team immediately.
398,Capital One,Great Place to Work,2022-01-02,4.0,Business Manager,"1. Awesome culture:
Peoples are genuinely very smart, friendly, and outgoing. Management respects work-life balance and is very respectful of employee's personal lives. Although some people chose to work past five, there is definitely no pressure to do so (unless there is a pressing deadline).

2. Investment in people:
I've also found that managers at Capital One are incentivized to highlight the achievements of their team members instead of promoting themselves. Even at the most junior levels, analysts will almost always present their own work unless it is to someone at or close to the C-Suite level. Managers also invest a fair amount in developing their employees, and it is typical to have regular 'development meetings' with your manager and your manager's manager to ensure that you are learning and that you are staffed on projects that are meeting your goals.

3. Internal Mobility (Vertically and Horizontally):
At the lower levels (Analyst - Sr. Manager), people can typically expect to get promoted every 1-2 years (in larger parts of the business). There is also a culture of people switching teams, and it is not uncommon for people to take new roles in completely new parts of the company with very little friction.

4. Great Internal Resources (see cons as well)
Capital One has a great set of internal tools and resources to help people manage the day to day functions of their jobs (managing data, doing analysis etc). This is especially in the larger parts of the company. As a result, people here spend very little time doing 'grunt work' and are instead dedicated to very substantive projects. As a new employee, I was quickly able to build a robust profile of work, and genuinely feel that I have developed a strong cross-functional skillset (data analysis, presenting, project management etc).","1. Lack of input in the rotation process (for campus hires)
Many business analysts joining out of college will be put in C1s rotational program (the ADP program), where you are assigned one role for your first year and then join a new team for your second role. The first rotation essentially random, while analysts get a larger degree of input into their second role (although the final decision is made by the program). Many people like this because it lets them work in diverse parts of the company, but inevitably a number of people will be placed into roles they are very unhappy with.

2. Frequent Organizational Shifts
As Sr. Executives come and go, they will restructure their subordinate teams. As a result, entire teams, and also individual analysts, are often move into new chains of command and may have to pick up an entirely new body of work. This happens quite often and with very little notice (maybe once per year).

3. Differing experiences across lines of business
In my experience, the largest parts of the company (Mainstreet and Upmarket) tend to have higher levels of technical support and better promotion rates than other parts of the company. The higher level of technical support often means that these LOBs have staff dedicated to making your job easier by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring data is easily available, and by building tools to simplify your work. In smaller LOBs, analysts will often have to do this work on their own, limiting the amount of time you can spend on important projects."

-Processes are continually changing and you are expected to work with your head on a swivel
-Work/life balance is heavily flawed 

You are expected to be in a minimum of 5 stores/day. without exception. Territory makeup is smaller, so that's great for those needed a change from heavy travel jobs, but this really makes no difference since you'll be in the field 5 days a week, 8 hours a day.

Minimal raises if you department isn’t meeting shareholders expectations. Too much pressure on employees to problem solve for upper management.

Company implemented ""Invest in Yourself Days"" where we were allowed to essentially do whatever in order to focus on ourselves. Some people literally used the day to meditate or have a good work out. Others used it to learn something new that they wouldn't usually get to use in their typical day-to-day.
Definitely a place where you can come and retire. Competitive pay and job security as long as you do your job of course.
Extremely smart people work here and you can learn a lot from the people around you.","Like any corporate company, the politics game is heavy here. 
If you want a promotion you have to practice ""influence"" instead of just showing strong competency and results.
The loudest and most vocal person is generally the one driving the discussion which I think leads to other team members from not wanting to participate or even caring to."

506,Capital One,"Incremental change, not all good",2021-12-10,3.0,Senior Risk Coordinator,"Working for Capital One was something I aspired to, and it took several years to finally get hired. This was not an unusual story, especially because it is one of the largest and most well-known employers in the area. I worked at a now-defunct call center outside of Richmond, and there was a clear ""have and have-nots"" delineation between those who worked at West Creek and those who worked at my location. The site was often looked down on, or completely unknown, to the people at West Creek making five times our salary, but we were collecting the money that allowed them to have fancy perks like bicycles to ride between buildings and a butterfly garden. I can't speak to the experience at the Glen Allen locations, but it seemed that folks could much more easily move from working there to West Creek than from our site. I don't know if the site going permanently remote has impacted the career opportunities for those employees, but when I worked there you still had to be within a 100 mile radius of the site you worked from, meaning you couldn't apply for remote roles in other states. 

The people I worked with were amazing and getting to know them was the best part of my job. Management supported career growth for their team members, and we were given lots of opportunities for professional development (pre-pandemic.) Having access to support groups for many different types of identities was a unifying experience that made the widely dispersed company feel a bit more familiar. I was able to gain experience in many different areas that boosted my personal and professional growth. However, I do believe that privilege plays a big part in that, as many of the other folks I worked with were passed up for opportunities time and time again. 

Benefits were good, with affordable healthcare options, 401k (regardless of if you contribute), parental leave, short- and long-term disability, EAP, tuition reimbursement, and occasional perks like gift cards and swag. The managers of the front line workers really care about their employees and do the best they can with the resources they have. We often had potlucks, parties, and events on site, which made work very fun and enjoyable. I didn't know everyone I worked with, but they all felt like friends. Unfortunately, this experience didn't translate to work from home, although many other sites had been remote long before and therefore had the infrastructure in place to support employees in that way virtually. 

Finally, learning about credit and financial well-being was one of the most valuable things I gained from my experience. I have been able to help my family and friends build their credit and feel more secure in their finances from what I learned during my time at the company. There are lots of resources available to learn and even help your community. Volunteer time is allotted each quarter, and the company matches your volunteered hours with donations. Most of the employees truly care about others, which makes for a very welcoming, friendly environment.","Once the pandemic hit, my role began to shift drastically. We went from an ""empathy-based"" approach to ""results-based."" It completely ruined morale, and that was before the layoffs and department closures began. People were desperately trying to leave the department and company due to the massive shift in business objectives. It became very difficult to get promoted, which was one of the biggest perks before 2020. The future went from looking bright to very, very bleak. At times, half of my department was on leave for mental health (which is understandable during a pandemic), but this trend began well before then. With everyone struggling to make it through the day and burning PTO to take care of themselves, more and more pressure was put on those who were still working. Metrics became stricter, performance reviews were graded more harshly, and everyone at the bottom of the food chain felt the pressure bearing down from the top. Needless to say, it became a pressure cooker, and most folks couldn't take it. 

Unfortunately, a lot of my coworkers (including myself) were going through very tough times during the pandemic, and our jobs involved talking to customers who were going through the same things. It was like living in a never-ending hellscape of sad stories. There was no relief, and we were often told to just ""focus on the positive."" Pretty hard to do when you are literally cold-calling people who are in the hospital with covid, fighting for their life, and telling them they need to make their minimum payment on their credit card or they will be charged more fees. We had some hardship programs to offer customers at first, but there was a cap, which enraged many people who would then take it out on the phone agents. I don't know what the department is like now, but I hope things have changed for the better. 

Culturally, the company has lots of grand ideals about how it is changing banking for good. However, during the pandemic, I saw a complete loss of humanity in this regard. The biggest indicator of this was the cafe employees who were pretty much hung out to dry. Pay equity is something that is not discussed on any level, and when some employees tried to ask for an objective review of their team's pay and raises, the company essentially told them they should be grateful for what they are making. Complete lack of transparency from upper management and age-old tactics to keep workers submissive and hopeless bred massive distrust and disdain for a company that workers previously evangelized. 

Many employees were often put into stretch roles or internships, which builds great experience, but is essentially the company saving money on labor by having someone do the role without receiving the pay. There should be a bonus or differential for employees that temporarily are working more senior roles. Getting one of these internships or stretch roles was often the only way to move up, and you usually had to be hand-selected rather than apply. If you weren't a golden child or friends with management, good luck trying to get a new role. I was considered both at one time and still couldn't get hired in any other department once the hiring freeze was lifted. 

This can be a great starter job or a long-lasting career. It is all circumstantial, and each department and line of business is very different. Do your research, ask lots of questions during the interview process, and make sure that you are confident of what the expectations are for your role and if it will change over time. Take advantage of all the resources the company has to offer and learn as much as you can. 

My experiences are all subjective, and many of my former coworkers are still very happy and love their job. I would take any review you read on this site with several grains of salt because there is no guarantee that your experience would be any better or worse. If you are considering applying here, I highly recommend finding someone who can give you the inside scoop, and hopefully a referral."

Associates who identify actual risk to the organization are routinely penalized if doing so runs contrary to senior leadership's overarching agenda. The leader of the AML organization often boasted about having ""never filed a single SAR (suspicious activity report), the fundamental work of the front line associate within his organization. Leadership fears competency and rewards compliance. Stay away from this company if you are highly-confident and comfortable challenging the status quo.

Decent pay
Work-life balance overall for the company is very good compared to other companies (notice how I said for the company, not for this particular position in terms of the everyday workload. The one positive is there is no on-call for this position, and once you complete your 8 hours you can forget about work for the rest of the day)","Since the pandemic stated in 2020, call queues have been a complete disaster. Most days it takes hours for users to get a hold of an IT Service Desk agent. I'm talking 100-200+ calls in the queue, with no end in sight for the agents who handle this for 8 hours every day. Between each call, there are only 45 seconds before another call comes in, which quickly leads to mental exhaustion after talking for 8 hours straight. This has been an issue for pretty much 2 years now!....2 years! To have it happen for a couple of months, fine, but any longer than that and you really can see where this item is on upper managements priority list/recognition of the dire reality of the situation. I understand it's a tough issue that's multi-facted, but 2 years is completely unacceptable in terms of the mental effects it has had on current employees.

Pay increases every 6 month period are usually a miniscule 1.5-3%, which as everyone knows, does not keep up with inflation (especially the 6% inflation in 2021). You can most likely get paid more by working for a fully-remote friendly company based in another high COL state, especially for a role such as this one that should already be fully-remote since it's completely over the phone. 

Morale is at an all-time low with most team members I speak with, people are just burned out and dread going to work in the morning, which is quite sad. Life is too short to be feeling this way, and to see it at a company like Capital One is very disappointing.

My biggest gripe is by far the lack of growth opportunities here in this particular position. Now, I want to preface this by saying yes some users have moved out of this position into other departments. For the overwhelming majority of agents however, this has not been the case. The users who did move into other positions usually had a lucky break with knowing the right person at the right time, or having experience that was gained outside of Capital One and thus could make them a stronger candidate. For those whos first IT experience was here however, even with earning certifications, it's very hard to move out of this department into other IT positions within the company. Part of the reason for this is that Capital One has a job hierarchy that restricts users from applying for other job positions unless you are currently at a certain job level. For instance, if you are Sr. Coordinator (which is what this role starts at), you cannot be considered for a role that's 2 levels above your current level due to HR policy. The company recently made it so you could apply for 1 job level above your current level, which is an improvement in terms of upward mobility for people. However, the kicker is most tech roles within the company start at Senior Associate or above, which compared to the Sr. Coordinator level, is 3 levels above that. The levels break down like this:

Sr. Coodinator
Prin. Coordinator
Associate
Senior Associate

So with this hierarchical system in place, you are destined to be in the IT Service Desk position for a long time, which I believe is by design to keep people in the position. Promotions can take anywhere from 1-3 years, and there's no guarantee when it's going to happen for you as it takes longer with each promotion. Upon getting a promotion, you do not learn any additional skills that you didn't already know at your previous level for the most part. The job responsibilities stay the same, and thus so do your skills and employability for other positions within and outside the company. 

Generally, industry-wide it's often recommended to stay in Helpdesk/Service Desk no longer than a year or two so you can specialize in other areas (unless you really enjoy it). The other areas are things like System Administration, Cloud/Networking, Security, Data, etc. The problem is, you do not gain the necessary skills within this position to move into those particular areas within the company, and are left to get certifications or outside education to fill this gap. This isn't an issue unique to Capital One, but the problem is a lot of internal company positions will want at least a year or two of experience with the technologies themselves in an actual job position. Not having this experience, but having certifications and outside education will look good, and may even provide an opportunity for a lucky break as I mentioned some people above had, but overall when applying for other positions you will get denied for not having the direct job experience a lot of times. Outside the company, your predicament is just as bad as even if you do have certs/education, the position itself does not give you access to skills that can get you more than another help-desk job unless you get lucky with a company willing to view your certs/homelab as experience. You don't get your hands on managing users/groups in Active Directory, group policy configuration, Windows Server, automation/scripting, AWS/Azure, or SQL. When you look outside the company, you'll see and realize how a lot of even other Help Desk positions within large companies require these skills."

The benefits are great, and they've really put associates over profits during the pandemic. They've also been more cognizant about work-life balance.

Almost everyone who works here is smart, ambitious, and friendly. Development is also encouraged through trainings, lateral moves, and taking on additional work.","Like others have said, the performance management system can be frustrating and promotions difficult to come by. Depending on your manager, those you're ranked against, and open roles, you may have to wait a while for a promotion, even if you are ready.

The internal politics at the senior level is beyond ridiculous. It feels like you're back in high school and you have to watch out for the ""mean girls"".

The salary also needs to be commensurate with the operational workload required. I left in early 2017 so hopefully that aspect has improved.

Multiple managers have been fired for very bad things from Sexual Harassment to fraud and money laundering. Company expects perfection from employees but employees aren't given the right tools. The HR department is a confused mess. It may take them multiple years to fully train you but they will still hold you accountable or they will put very little effort into training you but will expect perfection. Higher ups constantly changing rules without worrying about the impact on employees. They will hold you to accomplish ridiculous goals without incentives. Very little opportunity to move up.

Work-life balance is great, but this can vary by what team you're on and management.","Stack rankings. Even if you're a hard worker, if you have stellar coworkers/teammates, good luck. You'll get rated poorly and get blindsided because you weren't given any feedback throughout the year, hence no real opportunities to improve. If you're rated below strong, aka ""performing as expected,"" you will not get a salary bump, even if the people who've been at the company for 3 months get the bump by default because they're ""too new to rate.""

The bar on hard skills is really low for engineers for comparable positions, so it makes this a great place to learn. Ton of volunteering positions for giving back to the community.","From the shared tech side of house- If you want a tech heavy, forward leaning programming job this ain't it chief. This is an ""argue with the tech lead about why unit tests are important"" type of job. If you try to improve the quality of programming, the populist hordes will scorn you. Adding tests and implementing design patterns takes too long, silly! You Build It You Own It culture translates internally to software developers that ship things without giving it any testing other than a quick, manual happy path. I never saw a solution get off the ground here. I consistently saw products being created that didn't meet the needs of our users, but did meet the political needs of certain managers. Inevitably, one crew of management would be fired or reorganized and another team would shepherd the product to its next phase. Be prepared to come in one day and have all your work cancelled or reorged away from you."

Capital one has management that stresses flexibility and fulfillment in your role  and works with you to find the right fit. You have a lot of opportunity to grow and develop with the company. Capital One has a high focus on customer satisfaction and most employees are also customers.,The culture can be foreign for an outsider to navigate at first. Capital One adjusts quickly to outside (and internal) factors and reorgs can be common.

The company emphasizes collaboration, allowing everyone to speak their minds, and assuming positive intent in your coworkers so that you all feel like you’re working together towards common goals. Additionally, the Business Analyst and Business Manager roles are very quant-focused in a way that allowed me to grow in the rigor of my data analyses. Finally, managers are encouraged to regularly ask how you want to grow, so there are frequent opportunities to shift your job functions to better fit your goals and desires.","I didn’t experience many downsides at Capital One. The reason I left was because I wanted to shift into a different industry from finance, but I would have stayed if I wanted to remain in that industry."

2. Management is extremely biased and feedbacks are extremely vague and useless for career growth 
3. Full of passive aggressive, arrogant and condescending people who are full of themselves with their own ideas and opinions- those people always do ‘great’ and get promoted 
4. Full of associates who are with Senior or above titles that are confused or not knowing what they are doing 
5. Not much new development work for engineers - more maintenance

806,Capital One,Great Company for employees. Not good for customers,2021-01-02,4.0,Senior Risk Coordinator,They treat their employees well. Team outings and innings. Team leaders have budgets every quarter for things they can spend on us. They have big events and invite all the employees and have dj’s and great food etc. they know how to make you feel appreciated,The job itself is MENTALLY EXHAUSTING. Having to try to collect money from people struggling especially during a pandemic is heartbreaking. I get tired of telling people that we can’t do much for them. Capital one made very minimal effort to assist in this pandemic even though I’m sure they benefitted from corporate bailouts. The only help they provided was not charging late fees IF a person calls every month to tell them they’ve been affected by COVID. If they don’t mention COVID they get no help. And if they forget to call one month we’ll charge them late fees and can’t waive them. Also we keep charging interest every month so someone who owes 300 dollars ends up deferring because of the pandemic and losing their jobs and by the time they get a new job they owe 500 dollars. And I’ve seen it on large scales too where people go THOUSANDS of dollars over their credit limit from interest alone. And they will NOT give any offers to lower ANYONES interest rate. No matter what. So it’s very hard to work for a company that treats its employees great and their customers terribly. If you have a conscience you wouldn’t be able to take this job for long

It is like a cross between the TV show Survivor and Real Housewives. The amount of passive aggressive behind your back activities is stunning. Someone is going to end up in the bad review bucket so people do what they have to in order to stay safe.

And they are very big into diversity and inclusion, it is woven into everything as if race and gender identity are the only things that matter. If you fall into one of the correct victim groups you are safe, if not then keep your head down because as I said someone has to be labeled as underperforming."

Meaning, if you're a business analyst you inherently get to a higher level and pay grade than some other jobs. Really was demoralizing when I discovered that, as it felt like it put a pallor of being undervalued on the role I was hired into. 
-The annual and mid year review process was always changing and each manager had significant leeway in how they approached the process. I'm certain they were always trying to improve the model, but it made it feel like a bit of a moving target."

If you're willing to network, there are lots of chances to move around and work on interesting projects.","Internal politics are really strange at times with folks staking out technical positions that seem purist and are likely driven by career optimizing rather than solving problems for customers. A lot of productivity theatre as well, teams doing redundant work. I'm sure this happens in most large companies but it seemed more frequent at C1. Product management was either brilliant or terrible, not really consistent from team to team. Its been a few years so this may have improved. Bonus and incentives structure seemed to cause a lot of churn and fueled some of the above behavior. All that being said, one of the best companies I've worked for."

Hell, you might even enjoy your job if you're lucky.","If you're not lucky, you'll be working on something boring or in a tech stack that's a pain to work with. Even worse, you might get stuck with team members who make you question your own sanity. It's such a huge company that nearly the entire spectrum of experiences is possible here.

Internal politics are a big thing here. Advancement is not a question of what you do; it's who you know. You could be the hardest working developer on the team, but if you haven't been doing side of desk work or giving demos or presentations (those are *huge*), you're out of luck.

Finally, being that it's a Big Financial Company, there's a lot of regulation and bureaucracy and overhead. The amount of hoops you need to jump through just to get a static webpage available internally is mind boggling. If you're someone who sees impediments like that as a nuisance rather than a challenge, you're likely to get annoyed.

Ultimately, the pay and WLB have been great, but I've not done anything genuinely fulfilling here. On top of that, I've had to deal with some real jerks (ones who are classist and lack any self awareness, at that).

867,Capital One,Great WLB but Mixed Growth,2021-03-25,3.0,Software Engineer (TDP),"- c1 is fully in the cloud (aws) so you MAY get to work with the latest technologies
- there are pockets that push for the highest standards for engineering
- stress free, low hour work on most teams","- regulation stifles innovation and this is strongly felt at even more tech driven banks like c1
- typical pains of large company
- change management team/cyber security team have too much authority, obviously a lot of great folks there but quite a few incompetent ones as well sadly; this leads to a lot of extra redundant and tedious work to avoid escalations with management (getting exceptions often requires VP approval and many managers are afraid of doing this, probably due to authority of these regulatory teams at c1)"

Culture tries to be employee-centered and practice good ethics. Compensation is good but not great.","San Francisco location is really noisy: high ceilings and wide open spaces make it an echo chamber. There are small rooms along the edge where employees may sequester themselves, but  those rooms are always full. Decentralized management and week Scrum Masters means results in lots of bullying in the scrum. The company decided all software developers are engineers, so QA engineers are expected to become full-stack developers. But there is no plan or support that allows the transition, other then spending 20 hours/week outside of work to attend community college or take courses through Lynda.com . Traditional developers are balking at doing real QA, so quality suffers. Women are encouraged to participate in numerous conferences and conventions for women in tech, while the men stay at the office an work. As a result, the guys gain more experience and deliver more output in the same period. In the bigger picture, more new hires that are men are moving on to higher paying jobs. the company emphasis on diversity is at the expense of productivity. High achievers are not rewarded in the first few years out of college. ""Diverse"" groups with little background in software development recieve a small amount of training and made into Scrum Masters, and many look like deer in the headlights."

This leads to a mid-senior level group of individuals that lack external industry experience and are often mediocre talents that are somewhat stuck at Capital One because nobody else will compensate them for their unexciting skillset.

My favorite way to explain this is when I tried to find someone to invite to a work function when my partner couldn't make it with me. As I was listing people off in my head, every single one of them was a co-worker that would already be there. I did end up bringing a co-worker that might otherwise not have come, but still...it was another co-worker. 

After over 10 years, 3 departments, and countless positions, I'm still friends with many of my former co-workers. I enjoyed going to work to see my friends and work with them.

I had one boss that fought tooth and nail to get me a worthy raise due to my hard work and the fact that I was grossly underpaid for what I did and my ""title"" within the company (and I really don't care about titles).

Depending on your location - great snacks and paid or subsidized gym membership. They really do care about employee health.","Stack-ranking for promotions and raises. The higher everyone is ranked, the worse off everyone is because ""Very Strong"" becomes the new norm and lowers everyone to ""Strong."" 
Gaining licenses and certs rarely counts for anything other than prestige and additional responsibility and opportunity, but definitely not guaranteed promotions or raises.
Long-term employment means no salary adjustment. The only way to get paid what you are worth is to leave and come back (and yes, I know people who did this and made a lot more money, mainly on the tech side of things)."

You can make the most of your time here and keep a flexible schedule,"None. Benefits, salary, culture are all great. Work can get stagnate at times but management is always willing to listen to concerns"
985,Capital One,It’s not for everyone,2021-10-20,4.0,Branch Ambassador,"Environment, easy job, customer experience","Growth, mentorship, no overtime, if you go over time there is no extra pay bc the manager will ask to lower the hours to meet 40"
986,Capital One,"Incredible culture, amazing place to work, aspirational vision",2021-06-13,5.0,Vice President of Innovation,Capital One was a phenomenal place to work; the leadership team is hands down one of the very best at Strategy so the company is not afraid of prioritizing hard problems that matter. The only old line company to fully transition into the cloud the company is customer centered and obsessed with heading in the right direction.,"A complex regulatory environment does add some friction to the day to day processes; however a culture that assumes positive intent, is forward thinking, and consensus driven help teams to make progress."
987,Capital One,Tech pivot stumbles; your experience really depends on which Division you are in,2021-08-13,3.0,Software Engineering Manager,"- Salary and benefits are great (for engineers). Full-time Engineers were given a huge pay bump this year to compete with other large tech companies (time will tell if this was only due to inflation). 401k match is the best I have seen anywhere (up to 6%). Health plan is just OK.
- Company appears to be doing pretty well. However, there is a dark side to this that I will get to.
- Lots of free and easily accessible learning resources. They will pay for all sorts of things, from certification exams to degree programs. There are also tons of opportunities to present about various topics to large swaths of the organization.
- Internal mobility is highly encouraged. Employees routinely jump from team to team and division to division. Internal job board allows you to easily find and apply for roles around the company.
- Engineers are given a lot of say within the company. As much as I will complain about the tech org later, CapOne does seem to be genuinely trying to encourage a strong engineering culture and giving them the power they need to succeed.
- Heavy focus on their TDP program, which aims to attract graduates straight out of college and give them lots of training inside of the company. Sounds like the TDP experience can vary widely depending on what kind of teams you get placed on.","- CapOne wants be a tech company soooo bad, but it doesn't seem to understand what that means or how to do that. They hired a bazillion software engineers, designers, project, and product people, but have no idea what to do with them. Lots of engineers spend all day just updating libraries and re-hydrating VM images. Internal product teams get more love and resources than the public-facing products that actually make the company money. But hey, this message seems to be making investors excited.
- Some divisions have strong products, talent, and culture (*cough* Card). Some divisions are really floundering from both a talent and business perspective. This creates a self-reinforcing loop where good people constantly flee to the already-capable teams and everyone else gets left with the lesser performers. Credit cards are still hands-down their cash cow, so everything else plays second fiddle.
- Lots of power jockeying between teams and senior leaders. Typically this comes in the form of creating processes that make a team a gate-keeper for the rest of the company, such as requiring everyone to get their approval for something as simple as adding a column to a database. More and more decision-making authority is being given to HQ teams like Cyber and Change Management, while the engineering teams on the front lines building the actual products have little to no say in how they are allowed to develop things. Little trust is extended to engineers throughout the company; instead, HQ teams try to micro-manage product teams and force them into supposed best practices despite not knowing anything about their products or code bases. This is made all the worse by people with little to no engineering background repeatedly being put in senior engineering leadership roles. These internal tools and processes that lock everything down are more often than not half-baked and have all sorts of functional issues. There is a lot of bureaucracy even compared to other financial services companies that I have worked at.
- Their well-known cyber security incident in 2019 was CapOne's 9/11 moment. At first there was a real drive to fix systemic issues that led to the incident, but as time goes on this initiative has driven the tech organization to the brink of madness and self-destruction. Crazy amounts of engineers are being used to do lots of BS work in the name of ""cyber security"" and ""compliance"" at the expense of improving their products, but very little of it actually helps their security posture. This is driving away tons of talented tech folks who don't want to spend their entire days working on nonsense like filling out paperwork rather than building products.
- Their Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging program is borderline toxic. Race and gender is brought up constantly and seems to be the only thing that matters to most people. If you fall into one of the in-vogue demographics (and don't work at a branch), you will be given several speaking and leadership opportunities. If you aren't, prepare to be berated either implicitly or explicitly on a daily basis. Some company policies and mandatory trainings are created and run exclusively by the EmpowHER and Black Leadership Council groups. Whenever I wanted to hire someone of certain ethnicities on my team, HR always demanded a written explanation due to ""diversity concerns"", but never did the same for other ethnicities. The sad part is Asians (east and central) get crapped on the most despite making up half of the company's software engineers; lots of H1Bs that are bullied into long hours and low pay increases under threat of losing their visas. The company should do its best to respect people regardless of things they can't control like sex, but this DIB program isn't the way to deal with that topic.

Some things I saw related to their DIB efforts: a woman muting all of the men at the start of a conference call because they ""already got to speak enough,"" to lots of cheering. A Division President highlighting the ""white"" data point on an employee demographics chart during an all-hands meeting and saying ""This is the problem right here with our diversity efforts..."" despite the numbers showing that Caucasians were under-represented relative to national demographics. A recruiter got drunk at a company event and spilled that a lot of them dig through candidates' public profiles to see if they might be Republican supporters and reject anyone that they suspect of this. A very active member of the DIB program on my team repeatedly complaining in private about ""all of the Indians"" that worked at CapOne."

1003,Capital One,"If you're a Marketer, make sure to do your research and talk to former employees to get full picture",2021-08-19,2.0,Marketing Manager,"The company really does care for its employees and offers great benefits and comps. We used to joke people stay longer just because of that even though the work might not be great. Great campuses and amenities, you have all the resources and equipment at your disposal. 

The recruiting process was by far one of the best and seamless processes I've ever been through, I was thoroughly impressed. 

Surrounded by a lot of very intelligent people with high IQ (but maybe not so much EQ). Incredibly competitive environment because everyone is super smart.","Their marketing department is not like traditional marketing - it's more Operations and Performance. If you are coming from the outside and are considering a Marketing role within Capital One, I HIGHLY recommend you search for former Capital One Marketing employees and get their perspectives, whether positive or negative. Word of mouth feedback from former employees is usually the most valuable. I'm sure you've heard reputational things already about Capital One (not saying good or bad), but the way Capital One operates/markets and their way of work is VERY unique and specific to them, and not typical of other marketing environments so make sure you talk to former employees before making a decision. 

 Not everyone fits into their culture; if you don't fit in it's identified pretty quickly (both from cultural and work standpoint). Like I said, they have a unique way of doing work that is specific to them and you're expected to do it. I was disappointed with the fact that they hire a lot of outside talent but I felt they didn't take advantage of the value they're bringing (I'm not saying this about myself, more my general observations which are unique to me). 

You're either in or you're out. Once you're out, you're really out. I had a benefits issue after leaving and have literally been ignored and ghosted entirely by their HR department despite multiple follow-up attempts and reaching out to other contacts in the org, which is unprofessional. I have the paper chain to prove it. Literally no responses or acknowledgements whatsoever. I would expect more from a company the size of Capital One. I would say a lot more in this review but don't want them coming after me!"

Developers are hired with no actual vetting of their skills, to the point you wonder if they have ever written software before. The appearance of results is more important than actual results, so a lot of people move up through the ranks simply knowing how to sound like they know what they are doing regardless of actual ability. Many managers and team leads are poor at mentoring or coaching their hires, giving them unrealistic tasks with no guidance and expecting other teams to provide support and problem solving. Senior company leadership is completely out of touch of what actually goes on, only hearing about issues after they have been filtered through multiple levels of management."

Good environment for competitive folks.","I was hired on as a manager on a team who already had a manager. This when I found out that I was manager in title only. This was fine, but when your 10 to 20 years younger than most your team it can be tricky. Let's just say I didn't get the warmest welcome and had to mostly fend for myself."
1093,Capital One,Thick skin required,2021-03-22,1.0,Collections Specialist,Better benefits than almost any other call center,New employees are constantly being training because most of them get fired shortly after starting. You need to fully understand which policies can get you fired and make sure you follow them. If you ask a manager about policy there is a good chance they won't know it either and if you follow what they say and its wrong you will be fired. Since managers are free to lie about what they say (since its not recorded) you should figure out a way to record it (hard to do on Zoom calls). The worst mistake you can make is to take as gospel what a manager tells you. In early 2020 they fired every temp in the last 3 groups of new hires because they made too many mistakes. So rather than find out what they needed and properly train them they just fired that many people at once rather than hold the trainer accountable.

They are empathetic in their leadership style. Work/life balance is good. Benefits like 401K and vacation time are fantastic. 

They are trying hard to move forward and be a top contender in the FinTech industry. It’s a slow process, but compared to other banks they are pretty innovative and have made big steps since I’ve been there.","They sell that it’s like a start-up environment - it is not. It is a bank, audited by the OFFCP, with a lot of red tape surrounding anything we do. They have to be 1000% risk averse, so it feels like you have to go through 10 pipelines of approval to get anything done. 

The performance management system is horrible. Metrics for hiring numbers or anything actually related to your job description are not considered when giving out promotions. Instead, it is a popularity contest or about who received the attractive projects that gets recognized from leadership. At times, this is unfair as not all recruiters get shoulder tapped for projects. 

Some direct managers (not all) are very disconnected from the perspective of “in the weeds” recruiting, as many managers are not promoted from within but hired externally. This is frustrating for lower level associates having to teach managers how to do their jobs."

1215,Capital One,"Pretty on the surface, still just another call center underneath",2021-07-12,2.0,Net Promoter,"You have a lot of say in choosing your shift / hours. Making changes after you start is difficult to impossible, but if you go into it with a preferred shift in mind(mornings / nights, 10 hour days 4 days a week, 7 hour days to avoid a mandatory lunch, etc) there's a good chance they'll be willing to work with you.
The benefits package is great, but it kind of has to be to makeup for being a call center.
Very inclusive team. Everybody is treated as an equal within the department regardless of race, sexual orientation, or other background characteristics. If you're a social person, you'll probably make a lot of friends working here. 
The pay may seem competitive for the area, and in some ways it is, but for the work/effort required there's many places you could be working for significantly more money.","Underneath the pretty paint and great benefits package, Capital One is much like any other call center. 
There's very little room for advancement. Most moves within the company would be lateral, requiring 9 months of investment and zero pay increase. The one promotion up from entry level is to the escalations line. What a customer would call a ""manager"" but really you're just doing the same job you were already doing, and now also taking escalated calls. This comes with a nice pay raise, but the work becomes more toxic and you'll need a very thick skin to get by. 
Beyond the first promotion to level Two, level Three has a very low turnover rate and you may be waiting YEARS taking escalations calls before you're even considered for the next level. If you want to reach a position in the company that will afford you a comfortable living, expect to put in upwards of a decade of your life waiting for it. 
Missing work / calling in sick is a big deal, one that WILL get you fired if you do it enough. 
Every month you will have a certain number of calls pulled by several different people, some you've met, many you never have and never will. These people will critique your calls and give you a score that may or may not depend on their mood at the time.
You will also be held to very strict, often impossible to meet KPI 'goals'. These goals will be purposefully set at unrealistic levels so that when you inevitably fail to meet them, they can use it as a reason to withhold bonuses, offer a less attractive raise, or put you on the chopping block depending on your personal relationship with your manager.
Every month you WILL be told that you're spending too much time talking to your customers, and you will be asked to reduce your AHT (Average handle time) or you risk termination, even though AHT is largely out of your control. You may get lucky and all of your calls are simple 2 minute balance transfers, or you may get unlucky and have a complicated array of technical issues you're chasing on end. 
Either way, LUCK is more important here than talent or effort."

The work life balance is non existent to say the least. I was promised I would be a software engineer and get to do what I love, but instead I'm just a janitor to work through these terrible internal processes and tools that are poorly defined and don't work 90% of the time. Literally everything I'm told to do is high priority fire drills that need to be resolved yesterday. This has been a complete waste of my life and is nothing but a red mark on my resume.

- Good amenities: pharmacy, gym, cafeterias, doctors, etc.","- Big company politics
- Development plans for employees are optional and most managers don't have the time to use them yourself. You need to keep track of your own development. Managers will usually help achieve your goals if you tell them what you want.
- Rating is on a curve and how you will be rated is determined at the end of the year, so you can manipulate the system. The trick is to talk first when they ask for an ""exceptional"" employee. Once you are established, you usually aren't questioned again. You can also get people a higher rating than they deserve by talking about your average/strong employee when they ask for exceptional. Just be the first person or two to talk and even if they bump you down a notch to meet the bell curve, you're still ahead. Likewise, if you don't talk about someone, they will likely be rated in the lower tiers, so try to talk first. You rarely need to talk about middle-of-the-road employees."

Branches closing all over the US for re-evaluation of staffing and branch consolidation. Capital one is in it to WIN it for the company. They make it seem like they care, but its to cover their butt. I've been through 5 branch closures and when I started working for Capital One 10 years ago they had 9 Full service Capital One Branches within 10 miles radius. Now, since 2019, one full service and one Select service, now its 2021 one full service within 40 miles radius. Capital one is all about making money for Capital One they force customers to bank digital and enforce employees to bribe and make customers to bank how capital one wants them to bank. Its not all about that special connection with the customer any longer. Capital One wants banking made easier for Cap One. So they will have less ovee head and use the excuse we don't have customers coming in because they are digital this is BS! So they use the excuse to let higher paid dedicated 10-55 year employees go and then hire new hires starting them out at $15 hr. You are promised tomorrow at capital one and you are constantly being watched,threatened to be fired,written up for any and everything because of new policy/ procedure guidelines changing back and forth. Even they can't keep up with the policy changing because it literally changes daily. Good luck if you consider working here. Please take my advise! Beware of what you are getting yourself into.

Beyond Principal Associate, not a single thing they sell you in the interview is true about growth or support, there is no upward momentum - immediately a glass ceiling unless you are a home grown HR rotational not a professional recruiter with actual ideas.

This is likely the single most political company of truly unqualified managers I have ever worked for. I have been here just over 3 years and have had 7 different bosses because of inconsistent reorgs - you are a placeholder they toss around and throw reqs at.

Avoid this company for corporate recrutiment. You are expendable, you will feel put down and alone in your career here, management won't support you unless you fit the mold of popularity they see fit, and promotion (unless out of tech recruiting) is a pipe dream.

Also so much fake positiviti (like the grouping) it's awful."

If you are one of the lucky few who get into a great team where they actually do development work, great! But there is a higher chance that you will get placed into a team that does ""development"" work and by that I mean do nothing that is remotely close to development. There is a reason why a lot of TDPs don't make it through their 2 years in the program. Management won't listen if you complain. They might make you rotate off the team early but no guarantee so you can waste your first year doing no development work. 

Also, like mentioned above, people love to coast at this place. Something that should take couple days can take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. There is no sense of urgency when it comes to completing stories. Or if the devs are working hard, they are impeded by the many hoops they have to get through to get their story completed."

I went to the gym every day, took advantage of personal training and free career coaching, would often frequent the #freefood slack channel rooms to score free lunches, etc. It was a great experience aside from the standard petty office politics.","The culture has gone down the drain post-COVID, especially with regards to work life balance, based on what my partner (still at Capital One) says. I asked my partner to take one day off of work to come with me to close on a house and he refused because taking a non-Friday off would be a red flag in his group. I then asked if he could take the Friday off to help move and he said that might also be a red flag. He also made it clear that based on the way his team functions, he's not planning to take more than 1 week of paternity leave next year because he doesn't want his team to use that against him in perf.

1571,Capital One,Okay Company with terrible performance management,2021-04-03,2.0,Master Software Engineer,"1) Gives back to the community through volunteer/ coders program
2) Compensation is above average, and raises are fair. My salary more than doubled after working here 6 years.
3) Work life balance is pretty good, aside from late night releases
4) Has better values than most other banks. Yeah C1 gets fined from time to time for violating regulations, but it's no Wells Fargo
5) Much farther ahead technology wise than similar financial companies
6) Strong push for diversity
7) Pretty good benefits
8) Invest in yourself days","1) Uses stacked ranking for performance management. 

 How will you be evaluated as a developer you ask? This will determine not only your bonus, but also when you will likely be promoted next and salary increases, so it's pretty important. 

At Capital One, this is process is known as calibration sessions. All the managers under a senior director get in a room and they are given a certain percentage of who can be rated as exceptional, very strong, strong, and needs improvement. . 

There is little regard for the reality of how the employees are actually performing objectively. Astonishingly, the managers work backwards from the same distribution no matter where you are in the company (no I'm not joking) and try to fit all the employees into that, leading to some cases of exceptional employees being under rated, or struggling employees being rated as strong. 

 Your rating will be determined by other managers who you have little opportunity to interact with on a daily basis, and will heavily depend on how much political clout your manager has. Astoundingly, there is little to no consideration put on the opinion of your teammates who would know the most about your contributions.

What this results in is a sort of hunger games culture where you can only do better by having those who work closely with you to do poorly. As you can imagine pitting teams and employees against each other in this manner is a huge drain on productivity.

2) Work is not interesting and doesn't build your developer skill set

The data breach has created a very shortsighted culture. There is a cyber initiative that in theory would be important work to safeguard customer data, but as an initiative it's not very well managed. Don't get me wrong, securing platforms and customer data is and always should be the number one priority. But the kinds of things they have developers doing aren't making the platforms any more secure, and are largely dictated by non-technical types. There's teams of developers (a significant portion of devs) that are spending months doing nothing but continually upgrading versions of libraries of internal systems and filling out endless google sheets. 

This work is the height of tedium and you can expect your developer skills to slowly degrade if you find yourselves in one of these nightmare positions. 

3) Lots of late night releases

More so than other places that I've worked, you likely expect to be up on late night releases 2 to 3 nights per week. This is a drain on your work life balance and one of parts of the job that are actually not conducive to work life balance, otherwise the work load is pretty fair.

4) High turnover (and loads of technical debt)

This may vary with team, but almost every platform I've encountered is understaffed and filled with technical debt. It's a vicious cycle where developers are leaving because the platforms are unmaintainable, which leads to new developers going through the same burnout and leaving. You can't under-staff a platform and continually put off refactoring and listening to developers without paying a price.

5) The hiring process leaves a lot to be desired. 

Applicants for software developer positions are given questions out of a pool that interviewers are mandated to pick form and are frankly... awful. They're solving a small coding challenge that has no resemblance to the kind of work that we do on a day to day basis. It's no surprise that with this hiring process we get a fair amount of developers that can't contribute to the team in any meaningful way and are rarely fired, but merely moved from team to team forever.

6) Company politics are rampant

I've personally seen managers straight up lie to another to get ahead. On one occasion one manager said he would give a developer to the other if they could transition a platform, and then went back on his word and pretended he never said this. I was shocked. Some of these managers directors are so without moral compass and scheming they make Machiavelli's characters look like Fred Rogers."

1629,Capital One,Hit or Miss,2021-03-18,3.0,Recruiting,"- Generous 401K match.
- Extensive paid parental leave option.
- Myriad additional benefits depending on your situation.
- If you're looking for a place to 'park' fora few years, this isn't a terrible option. Depending on your role and department, work/life balance is recognized and this can very much be a strictly 9-5 position for those seeking that.","- I'll preface by saying - given Capital One's size as an organization - employee experience will inevitably be both team and manager-specific.
- If you're based outside of Virginia (McLean, Richmond) or Texas (Plano), you'll end up feeling like an outsider. This may be changing due to the increasingly virtual nature of employment, but pre-pandemic this was certainly the case.
- The performance review cycle - while not uncommon among enterprise organizations of Capital One's size - rewards those who know and schmooze the right people and have a well-positioned manager. The unfortunate reality is that individual performance metrics are not weighed heavily; it's more or less a popularity contest.
- While internal mobility is encouraged and stands as a reality, the organization leads with selling that option to prospective employees. This begs the question: why are employees constantly shuffling throughout the organization and what are they running from?
- Largely a culture of blame. With an organization this size, it's easy to pass off errors to someone else, hide your tracks and refuse to accept responsibility.
- If you don't start working at Capital One straight out of college in one of their rotation programs, you'll never truly be treated as a superstar employee; it's very much a 'home-grown' environment for leadership.
- Along the same lines as the above point, much of the leadership within the organization has spent the majority (if not the entirety) of their career at Capital One. This lends to blindspots, a lack of diversity in experience and a refusal to adapt to outside points of view.
- Generally speaking, Capital One (purposely) does not pay as competitively as organizations in the same space. If you're going to sell your soul to a bank, you may as well get paid for it."

ALOT of AWS experience gained","-Having a noisy open workspace, working less hours and having stickers on laptops doesn't make you a tech company. The job was advertised as a software engineer but ended up doing boring DevOps work, and when I needed to code I had to deal with undocumented spaghetti code(I was surprised to see this quality of code in a company like CapOne). There is no enforcement from tech leads to write clean code or provide documentation. I was surprised because the coding challenge in the interview process was written very professionally and included end to end testing.

-You'll need to go through many procedures in order to make any change in production code.

-You'll spend most of your time on endless time meetings.

-The tasks you need to work on are not clear and you will waste your life looking for answers on what needs to be done.

-Co-workers are not helpful and lazy - will take time to respond to you so you stop asking questions and won't respond at all after 3:30pm (because this is when some people stop working here).

-Tech lead is incompetent and careless. If asked, wouldn't even know how to run the app which is the core functionality that the team manages.

1807,Capital One,Not Really a Tech Company,2020-11-30,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Aside from the product owners, the engineering group were very professional, easy to work with, and had some definite talent.","The management structure is very dated. Essentially all engineering teams are run by a Product Owner. The product owners sit in meetings and groom backlogs; they're not capable of contributing to meaningfully to technical discussions. Some have a technical background, but within a few months they're completely out of date on any given stack, and are functionally unable to manage an engineering team. At that point there's a real problem- software decision-making is entirely driven by a non-technical staff. This of course is a perverse incentive- instead of an engineer driving technical decisions, designing software and innovating, the engineers have to effectively beg product owners for tasking, (""please let me solve this issue the right way""). Any incentive an engineer had to excel in their trade will quickly be exhausted by this poor organizational structure."

Bonus ranges are fixed and cap out at roughly 20% of base salary (could be lower if your starting salary is on the higher side). They say they do that in exchange for paying more up front in base salary but I’ve found that to be untrue when comparing across companies.

1970,Capital One,A Red Queen workplace- work as hard as you can to stay where you are,2021-02-14,2.0,Senior Business Analyst,"- Remote work (at least until Sept.2021)
- Decent requisition system for office supplies (can easily get monitors, chairs, etc.)
- Decent pay for entry-level/mid-tier jobs.
- A lot of training if you're straight out of college with a bunch of peers
- Tuition reimbursement for college courses up to 5250 a year, along with access to coursera and pluralsight.","- Be prepared to have to suck up to your manager. The way the evaluations work, you are compared against all your peers, and the only person speaking on your behalf is your direct manager. So if they have a bad opinion of you, you will languish.

- Get ready for vague job responsibilities and milestones. I was specifically told that senior business analysts are required to do what is necessary to finish a project, and that you will be subjectively judged based on how well you did whatever was necessary. This ties in with the previous point, in that you never really know how well you are doing until year end.

- Prepare for a lot of ""80/20"" corner cutting. Timelines are very aggressive (one could say unrealistic), and management does not like delays. Therefore, shoddy analysis has to be done, and covered up with pretty Powerpoints. Discrepancies are not looked into closely unless they don't ""fit the story"". 

- Expect people to be selfish. Because this is a ""results focused"" company, anything that does not contribute directly to your results will be ignored. That means that there is no incentive for others to help you unless it benefits them or they have a kind heart (and thankfully, there were a lot of kind hearted people). Collaboration is rare unless it is mandated from above.

- There is no training if you are not straight out of college. ""Professional"" hires are given a 3 day orientation, then thrown right in. You will definitely notice this, as you realize that hires straight out of college seem to know how to talk the talk, and have better connections.

- You don't get to choose the team you are hired to, you are assigned randomly to teams that need people."

2451,Capital One,"Like working at a (technology) startup that has good funding, great benefits, and decent work-life balance",2015-02-16,4.0,IT Manager,"This is an update of a review I previously posted

Benefits are great. 401K up to 7.5% company contribution, short/long term disability paid by company, discounted company stock purchase option, vacation days (able to buy more during open enrollment), unlimited sick days, 3 family care days, free financial planning consultations via Fidelity, free use of athletic trainer in company fitness centers twice a week (there is a fee to use the fitness centers, but no additional charge to use the trainers). I find the medical insurance (bronze/silver/gold options through Aetna) to be expensive compared to the HMO I can get through my spouse's employer, but I don't think the Aetna costs at Capital One are out of line with what I have observed at other companies; I'm not a fan of the high deductible though. Capital One does try to brunt the pain of the high deductible by offering free health clinics on site at major locations (no copay - family members can also visit) and no copay to visit CVS minute clinics. Very progressive company - just announced expansion of maternity leave to 12 weeks PAID, 2 weeks paid paternity leave, 6 weeks paid adoption leave/surrogate leave (if your child born via surrogate), $10K contribution toward adoption expenses, fabulous medical benefits for families with autistic children. Company will contribute up to $1000 toward your flexible spending accounts (medical/dependent care). 

My manager (and senior leadership team in general) have been absolutely fabulous - when my dad died, I was told ""take the time you need"" - very humane.

I had severe culture shock after joining Capital One for a very long time... I have encountered very few ""slackers"" and am continually impressed at how responsive most associates are to any requests/questions I may have - it's highly unusual for it to take more than 4 hours to get a response. Capital One takes pains to hire very intelligent, data-driven associates. I am very satisfied with my work/life balance, but that balance can be a bit unpredictable at times (mainly because I am in an operational role - stuff happens... and you have to deal with it right then).

Capital One has taken great pains to recruit/retain associates hired as interns/new college grads - this program is very well-designed/run. They would be well-advised to pay a reasonably equivalent level of attention to experienced hires (obviously, more seasoned hires don't need as quite as much hand holding).  While there is clearly room for improvement in this area, I've observed some progress on this front over the past few months - a *lot* of energy spent on trying to improve the onboarding process for experienced hires within my line of business so that they have everything  they need to do their jobs once they finish the 1.5 day long HR onboarding process (which incidentally is *very* well done).  Similarly, I've observed some efforts aimed at reducing the red tape that makes it difficult to do your job efficiently and reduce the ""environmental"" learning curve associated with being a new hire. While you might be a subject matter expert in your area, you can't be effective without also understanding the company environment.

I am thoroughly impressed by the company's commitment to doing the right thing by their customers. While I won't go into any detail here, suffice it to say Capital One gives up a LOT of $ by not following the same practices used by many of the other large financial companies. The latitude given to call center associates to satisfy a customer's needs is unprecedented.  

Capital One University is a fabulous resource for associates ... many different types of training courses (online, instructor lead) are available - many at no cost to the associate's department. Subjects covered are typically either line of business centric or role centric (e.g. project management college, software engineering college, information security college, etc.). 

The corporate culture is heavily oriented toward recognizing associate contributions. The size of your pay raise and bonus are heavily predicated by your performance review rating  (which is in turn based upon your contributions); the higher your performance review rating, the larger your pay raise/bonus.  Bonuses can comprise a very significant portion of associate compensation - the higher your paygrade, the more significant the bonus is.  

Any associate can recognize another associate or team of associates for their contributions. The recognization can range from a simple thank you note to points that can be redeemed by the associate for gift cards from a wide variety of vendors to cash awards. 

Promotions are a *HUGE* deal at Capital One.. they are generally recognized twice a year. All promotions are publicly announced (typically first within the individual line of business, then company wide). If you are on the receiving end of a promotion, you can count on being flooded with congratulatory IMs, emails, and phone calls from fellow associates once the announcement is public. It can be a bit overwhelming if you aren't expecting it.  Promotion recipients are also invited to a luncheon with their managers and members of the senior leadership team.  I personally have felt very empowered to ""grow my flame"" here.

Mobility within the organization is excellent - there are many, many  roles available within information technology. If you get tired of your current role, there's an excellent chance there will be an opening in a different area of IT that you can apply for.","The ""startup"" culture at Capital One can be a double edge sword - if something isn't working, just wait six months (or less) and it will change. 

If you are a person with a ""glass half empty"" attitude or someone who greatly values organizational structures/processes etc. remaining static over a long period of time, this is NOT the company for you. 

There have been big changes in the senior leadership team (most external hires) in my line of business during the time I have been at Capital One, a significant number (1100+) of associates hired (many as part of the drive to insource key functions). While I think the CEO and very senior management have good plans for the company (e.g., identifying key objectives each year, and making solid plans to reach them), objective identification/planning within my own line of business has historically been shaky at best, largely due to understaffing/lack of resources and multiple reorgs. I have noticed some positive movement in this area  over the past 2-3 months - I do like what I'm seeing/hearing - but will reserve judgement for another few months.  If this changes significantly for the better, I'll up my rating from 4 to 5 stars.

Predictably, mentoring of associates is not what it should be in my line of business given the staffing challenges.The company does pair up a ""buddy"" with new hires who request it. While I had a buddy, I didn't find it useful because the buddy was not in the same location or same role as me, and so was not able to answer many of the questions that I had.IT has been switching over to agile-based methods (not just for software development), while also shifting to a federated model in which IT resources are assigned to a particular line of business rather than a centralized pool of IT resources. While there are some distinct advantages to that approach (e.g., IT resources are intimately familiar with the applications of their line of business and the associated network infrastructure; fewer issues with prioritizing needs across different lines of business), it makes it difficult for the remaining ""central"" IT organization to keep track of everything that is going on. Time will tell how this gamble pays off.

Associates in general don't like the performance management system, but overall I think it provides a decent measure of fairness. Everyone that I've known that has received a promotion truly deserved it.. 360 feedback is strongly emphasized as part of the performance management process. Forced ""cross-calibration"" sessions amongst managers of all associates at the same level are performed biannually as part of the performance management process to ensure everyone uses the same standards to rate associates. This can be a little awkward if you are at the same level as your manager (yes it happens). Your manager's ability/willingness to advocate for you during these sessions is key. If the managers participating in these cross calibration sessions don't think highly of you, you're sunk...You need to be *very* aware of that in your daily interactions with other associates. One of the main criticisms of the performance management system is that it emphasizes individual performace more than team performance. Some steps have been taken to shift that, but too soon to judge the effectiveness of that change."

Benefits are excellent.
Campuses are nice and well maintained.","'Up-or-out' performance management process equates relative ranking to absolute ratings, e.g. if you are at the bottom of the curve relative to your peers, you go on a performance plan, even if you are doing on okay job.  And the 'bottom' is forced - the company demands a certain % be rated below-expectations.  Once on a plan, it is nearly impossible to get off, since you must 'climb over' someone(s) ahead of you on the curve.  Moreover, as a manager it's difficult to put someone on a plan who hasn't been there already, since they weren't properly warned of the possibility, making climbing out of a low rating even more difficult.   So people scramble to switch jobs before the performance period.   So many things can wrong with this approach, it leads to alot of wasted talent and hurts morale.  Most companies have recognized this issue and allowed managers more flexibility in how they rate their people; relative ranking (forced ranking) will always be there, but it need not automatically lead to forced meets/does not meet ratings."

Lots of focus on supporting local small businesses through resources and contracting them for catering and event services. You are also given a lot of freedom to connect with local non-profits by volunteering your time at work and offering financial literacy services. In addition to all of that it is still a customer facing role, so you get to meet a lot of people who live around the cafe and really hear what people need from the cafe. Capital One has the best benefits I've ever received from company from PTO to insurance.","Not a lot of opportunities to move around the cafe organization unless you are willing to relocate. Merit increases are lower than any other position I've held at Capital One and there is no pay transparency. Leaders are great people, but are short sighted and don't take great care in anticipating how changes impact the front line and customers before they are implemented.

2. Lack of clear direction from leadership
3. People with technical skills are not rewarded, people with social skills skyrocket in their career
4. Lack of good technical intents, be prepared to sit idle most of the time until leadership tries to get intent (am a java dev, but last year i did manual testing for most part and 0 API or microservice work)
5. Layoffs here and there, and no clear career path direction (all API teams were converted to mobile teams in chicago downtown, by teaching android and IOS development - you have 6 years of technical experience in one area, so what??  start from 0 now)

- HR is basically completely centralized. Unless you're in Richmond, expect to be ignored. 
- Career growth/development is 100% on you, the employee. They even say this in town halls, etc. To get company sponsorship for certifications or conferences, you have to be on somebody's favorites list
- Unless you are on one of the tech teams, expect to come in at the bottom of the priority list

You get work from home days regularly in back office jobs. They also promote community service and giving back which I like a lot.,"Work/life balance is hard to achieve with long hours and work phones. You feel like you’re always attached to the job. The company in general doesn’t live by their own values (do the right thing). Lots of gaps and areas of improvement. Middle management is terrible (micro managers or completely incompetent) and upper management is completely out of touch with levels under them. Performance management needs to be completely revamped. Employees are rated more on defined “competencies” than actual metrics of performance. These “competencies” are things like communication or influence which are completely subjective and at your managers discretion. Basically you can be terrible at your job but if your manager likes you, you can get promoted.

3092,Capital One,"Exceptional Benefits, Very Matrixed Org",2020-06-08,4.0,Product Management Manager,"In most cases, some interesting work - most of the org really does try to 'Change Banking for Good'. Both the Richmond and McLean (the new one, M2) are amazing places to work with countless amenities, think kombucha on tap, medical centers, gym, collegiate-like campus with bikes to ride from bldg to bldg for your meetings. Shuttle buses are available between the campuses so when you do need to get to Richmond for a meeting, just hop on the shuttle in the morning and catch it in the afternoon to get back. Compensation and benefits are exceptional. Even in comparison to large tech firms (Apple, Google, etc.) Capital One offers similar or in most scenarios, more benefits. Work life balance is pretty great depending on your team, general start time is 9am and employees are encouraged to take the time they need to tend to family business. Hours and wfh can be flexible, but again depends on the team. Adoption assistance is up to $35k and they offer fertility benefits with up to 3 IVF rounds with meds included (no PGT testing unless you meet specific conditions, you need to utilize all embryos before doing a second IVF round, and all FETs are covered until the last round of IVF in which case they will only cover 1 more FET).","Not necessarily a con, but need to be aware of the environment - it is a very matrixed organization. So most teams don't have full ownership over what they are building and will need to collaborate very heavily with multiple other teams because another product owner will have accountability over the vertical while you own the horizontal. This causes projects to take much longer than they might otherwise. This also means that if your Sr. Dir. isn't very strong, you likely won't be able to your projects to move forward if discussions have to move up the chain. The YE rating system is cut-throat. You need to prep and stay prepped all year. Make sure you are socializing your work to every single person you can. It will come down to stack ranking with a required 5-15% needing to be rated lower than 'meets expectations'. If you keep upping your game every year, you'll be fine but that may mean taking on external public speaking engagements, leading projects that will have massive business impact that can be 100% accounted to you alone (you'll get docked if someone else can share credit, which is in a matrix is hard to not share credit). I've seen people with $100MM in project value get average ratings so know that you aren't coming here to go with the flow....if you do, you won't last more than a year."

They may have been decent at their jobs at the time that they were an associate, but that doesn't mean they're capable of connecting & leading a team of 20 agents. What you got was immaturity, politics, power-hungry type-A's.....and it created the most toxic atmosphere.  My last manager was a work-horse with the personality of a T800...he fostered unethical behavior to ramp up stats...was called out for it, but since the stats made him look good they promoted him to a PA overseeing an entire department. Execs came down once or twice a year and were given the red-carpet treatment by management who spent a  considerable amount of time covering up the truth and having them ONLY speak with agents who were glorified cheerleaders."

That attitude leads to a lot of backstabbing and politics across the culture.  Told to just ""keep my head down"" and not ""rock the boat.""

Less is best, just say you have kids or family obligations like everyone else.","Performance Management - Once they lock you in, they'll promise you the moon and stars and then blame the performance management rating system when they don't deliver. They do not pay you more or incentivize your growing skillset, which is why they cannot retain top talent. Based on the current performance management rating system, the likelihood of you being promoted is 15%. Most are only promoted then they throw temper tantrums and threaten to leave... who wants to work like that? Also, the wage gap is real. That's why it is ""frowned upon"" to discuss what you make. If you're a female, it's pretty much guaranteed that your less qualified and lower performing male colleagues make 15-25% more than you do. As your skillset grows, leave Capital One. They do rarely offer compensation when moving across LOB's or departments. You lose money by ""growing within"" Capital One internally.

A lotta talk, no action. Look elsewhere."

Your Capital One expects you to use their knowledge base to do everything whether it is in your scope or not. You will receive write ups for not knowing something. The Knowledge Base is pretty grim. It is in no way something you can use while speaking to a customer. It is a link within a link with in a link that opens so many windows you forgot what you were there for in the first place. Management is aware but hold you to every word on your QA's. Management does not take calls, they have no idea what you are facing on the front line nor do they care. If you question anything you get pointed to ask someone else. You are not looked at for your individual contribution to the team unless you suck up to the manager and they like you, then you will be put in for every recognition there is and mentioned in every meeting. They rank you with everyone on the floor which is very unfair especially when in the same pool as tenured employees. This means you won't get a raise, won't get a transfer, and choose your shift you want to work forever when you get your offer because you will never get it changed, ever.

3292,Capital One,Changing banking for good?,2020-06-30,1.0,Associate,They have really good benefits,"I chose Capital One as the HR reps who visited my school touted it as a really healthy, progressive environment that differentiated itself from the old school finance way. I was a part of the rotational program so I got to experience several parts of the bank. 

The most major issue I experienced was sexual harassment. My first week on one of my rotations, there was a work happy hour and a senior male commented that I “was going to be his second wife.” Then, in the office, another senior male made a sexually charged comment. I told my manager about it and a sexual harassment case was filed but there was no real resolution other than he had to stay away from me. For the rest of the rotation, he bad mouthed me (even to the interns that were there for the summer). I heard quite a few racist and sexist remarks that he either announced publicly or someone else would tell me how uncomfortable they were by something he said to them as well. Yet, nothing was done. After I left, I received a request to pay back some of my compensation for leaving early. I called HR to see if we could come to some sort of agreement as I had left early to get out of a toxic work environment but they “had no record of the sexual harassment case.” Ultimately I ended up just paying it in full so I could move on and not have to worry about fighting with Capital One anymore. Overall, I was disappointed by how they handled this incident.

Also, they market Capital One as a place motivated people come to build something great. Most of the people I encountered were people who came from big banks who were now ready to take it easy in a less intense environment. It didn’t really feel like a place to start your career and learn from the best. 

Last thing, performance reviews are very subjective and not transparent. If you don’t have a manager who has your back, you’ll struggle to feel fully valued. I tried to communicate with my manager early on and was constantly told that my work product was timely and of great quality and that I would likely receive the highest ranking, though it wasn’t set in stone. At the end of the rotation, I suddenly got a lower ranking because “I asked too many questions when I should be trying to problem solve on my own” when my male counterpart (who several times turned in projects late and spent most of his time on linkedin looking for other jobs or facebook) got a higher ranking than me. All the other feedback was the same as throughout the rotation but I was downgraded for that reason (even though it was never communicated to me when I asked). Looking back, it just seems like a weird process to me as I ask more questions than ever in my new job (and my manager has commented on it) yet I still get the highest rating because of my timely, solid work product. 

I now work at one of those “old school” financial institutions and it’s a much more meritocratic and supportive environment than either of my teams at Capital One (plus to be blunt, the pay is better). Looking back, I learned a good lesson and found my way but I think I could have saved myself a lot of trouble if I just started off in a big bank."

Many people in leadership positions who are not qualified to lead or manage. Executives have different rules than the rest of the company.  Think what banking would be like if consultants ran the show. 

You are also fighting others to get the last 10 to 20 percent of your salary.

3312,Capital One,"Lots of promise, some positive intent, poor execution",2020-02-22,3.0,Director,Work life balance. Innovative and industry-leading work in some areas (but not outside of the core front line businesses),"I have never seen a company offer so much promise based on its reputation, and then succeed in beating the potential and enthusiasm out of highly capable people. I have worked at several companies during my career and see the specific problems at Capital One as:
1) ""Tell me what I want to hear"" - the senior-most leaders are so sure that ""what got them here will get them there"" that they only want to listen to people who use the exact same kind of language, communication style, and ideas. 

2) The emperor has no clothes - This follows from #1 above. Leaders don't want to  listen to ideas from people who have gained expertise in other banks. They are rewarded for being generalists and lack depth of expertise - yet they do not want to leverage the people who do have that expertise, for fear they'll be overshadowed.

3) Lack of maturity in people leadership  -  Little weight is placed on the maturity of  people leadership skills and talent development, even at the executive levels. This leads to short-sighted org decisions, lack of investment in talent hired from the outside, and external hires at all levels feeling like they're not fully utilized or challenged.

4) Performance management - claims to be objective and transparent but is very susceptible to favoritism and disproportionately rewards loyalty above other factors. Old timers at the company heavily favor other old timers.

5) Cultural hubris - Only Capital One experience counts. Only Capital One has a ""high bar for talent"". Skills built at other institutions aren't recognized and made use of."

This does wonderful things for team cohesion and makes people optimize for very strange things. 

If you are a software developer, expect to get stuck in an on-call rotation at least once a month and doing a LOT of devops work even if you weren't hired as a devops engineer. Toward the end of my time there, 90% of the work my team did was related to scrambling to comply with some new enterprise-wide mandate (fix X, switch to using Y, etc.). In the end we had almost no time left to build our product. The product owners and tech leads are really out of touch; a lot of them have no technical background.

Also, the decision to abolish assigned seating and move to ""everyone scramble for a seat every day"" (excuse me... ""Flex Seating""! Yay!) is a horrible decision. It makes the day so stressful to never have any idea whether you will be able to find a decent seat or not, and yet despite the overcrowding many teams do not allow for regular remote work."

It's a good place for fresh college grads but everyone else not the place to be.,"Frequent reorgs and top level management changes all through the year. I have had 4 reorgs in less than 3 years of being there. Whenever someone at the top leaves, management takes it as an opportunity to reorg the deck across the division. One of the most regressive performance management process I have seen which they take great pride in, it's done 4 times a year with no time for associates to focus on learning and development - it's deliver or out all the time but when you couple that with the frequent reorgs it's hard to settle in a role and deliver. Very short term focused managers. Managers are not interested in your development, they just need results to go after their promotion. They run quarterly survey on employees but managers are busy trying to figure out who gave bad ratings than focusing on how to improve morale. There is a lot of corporate marketing speak which is says and means two different things. Be prepared to just preparing atleast 100 slides a week, that's all there is to their work."

Fantastic subsidized cafeterias with amazing food. Some very talented people (who will leave).,"Your experience will vary greatly based upon for what part of the company you work, and then even more so by your leadership team.

The company repeats ad nauseam that it is ""a tech company that just happens to operate in the financial services space"" -- saying it does not make it so. I've worked for many companies in my career; this is more like a Soviet-era, government-owned manufacturing company than anything else.

Organizationally, it is highly fragmented and lacks both vision and leadership. The various LOBs are so very siloed, and driven by their own goals and politics that serve the sole purpose of getting leaders fat bonused, that is nearly impossible to get anything meaningful done. Unless it is a Cyber remediation activity, then all of a sudden everyone is aligned -- and that's what a takes to get alignment.

The vetting/hiring process for Directors and above is a) do you have a friend here? and b) do you have a pulse? This means that the excruciatingly painful and laborious hoops of tests and interviews through which Senior Managers and below must go through are not equally applied; as such, you will undoubtedly encounter some absolutely terrible people in senior leadership roles that have no business being in such positions of authority.

Despite what the Capital One PR machine claims, it is ridiculously far from being an Agile organization. Small, sporadic pockets of something slightly resembling Agile exist within the company. I was very disappointed by encountering people (in leadership roles) who have only been with Capital insisting ""we're doing Agile"" [flag!] and who, when you thoughtfully challenge that inaccuracy, you're persona non grata for telling the Emporer that s/he has no clothes."

3467,Capital One,All that glitters... is not necessarily gold,2020-01-29,4.0,Software Engineer,"1. A very lax culture with a startup feel for being such a large company. Hours vary per team/manager, but it's usually around 9:30-4:30-- you never get the stink eye for coming late/leaving early.
2. Working remotely is heavily encouraged in situations that warrant it, such as being sick/house work/doctor's appointment/etc.
3. (Sort of a pro, sort of a con) Some managers are amazing-- and some are very lack luster. Thankfully, Capital One encourages movement around the company, so you don't have to be stuck in a position that you hate.","1. Capital One is growing far too fast for comfort. The parking situation is absolutely horrendous. If you're not in the office by 9:15, you're kind of screwed. It's sort of like a college campus-- lots of growth and 0 parking. The thing is, colleges have subsidies for/free public transit; Capital One has no such thing. The employees have been making a buzz about this issue for years with no response from the company.
2. Employees (specifically those brought in through the college grad program) are hired in flocks. This is okay on the surface, but the overcrowding situation is at a tipping point (some people don't even have desks!!) and it's looking more and more like Capital One hires these college grads as cheap labor. In general, the vetting process isn't the best-- it does a pretty good job most of the time, but every now and then you meet a person and think, ""who in the world interviewed you?""
3. As you've probably guessed, politics are major here. Playing the right cards, not necessarily doing great work, gets you promoted. Your manager alone is the one who pitches your competencies during review season. You can have 10 great things on your brag sheet, but if your manager has a vendetta against you/a favoritism for another employee, you're going to be torn down."

-a PT center also staffed with doctors

-treats pretty much everywhere (every floor of every building has a very reasonable for purchase snack bar)  
-basketballs courts
-tennis courts
-bikes everywhere to get around campus
-a fedex office where you can get next day AM delivery on personal packages for about $6","Unfortunately, all of the above is meaningless because Capital One's performance management system is an unmitigated disaster. I could write a book about how horrible it is, but I'll try and condense everything below. (I WISH I KNEW THIS BEFORE I CAME TO CAP ONE. PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY)

1) At capital one there's an assumption that the level you came in at is the absolute highest that you could have, and once you start, nothing you did before capital one matters.

2) You will stay at your current level unless you kiss up to your manager because vertical movement at Cap One is seriously messed up. The ONLY WAY to get a role at a higher level is to get promoted by your current manager, which is very hard, or to find a role at the next level and humbly ask the posting manager if he/she would consider you for the role even if it's above your level. The posting manger will then snoop around and go to your current manager. If your manager doesn't tell this manager that you were on the promotion track you won't get the higher role. Period, end of story. You will not move up unless your current manager loves you. The assumption is that all movement is horizontal. Promotion is the only way up. (To get around this a lot of people leave the company and come back at higher levels. DO NOT come here lower than you think you're worth. It's not worth your time. Hold out for the higher role)

3) Your colleagues who've been with the company longer than you understand the culture and you will suffer because of it. They know that you're the sucker for trying to get stuff done while they spend all day brown nosing with your manager and accomplishing nothing. They will get promoted and rewarded at year end and you will get the ""inconsistent rating."" If you don't ""shape up"" and drink the kool-aid you will be pushed out. If your ""poor behavior"" continues you will be shown the door.

4) You get pushed out by being given this ""inconsistent"" rating that has no grounding in reality. When this happens you can't apply to any other roles until you've sufficiently kissed up to your manager who then raises your rating. Don't like brown nosing? Too bad, it's your only way out. Please direct yourself back to point #3. Really don't like brown nosing? Too too bad, direct yourself back to point #3 twice and then find the door. Try and fight your managers rating? Too bad, you're going to lose and then your manager is really really going to hate you. You're never getting out of inconsistent and we're beyond point #3 at this point. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

5) Influence not achievements, just remember that. ""Influence"" at cap one is simply ""justification for accomplishing nothing while still feeling good about oneself."" You can't make this stuff up. Try running  a department where every decision requires unanimous agreement from all stakeholders. Want to see how this works (or doesn't)? Work for Cap One.  Do you dare have an opinion? Please direct yourself back to point #3

6) Cap One is filled with managers who've been with the company since the earth cooled. They will force-feed you the kool-aid. Direct yourself back to point#3 if you have a conscience or morals.

7) Calibration... Oh I havent even gotten here yet and I'm already 7 points down. At end of year you're ranked amongst your peers and given a year end rating. Did you drink the kool-aid and were you buddy buddy with your manager? Congrats, you'll be fine. You're a high-strong to exceptional. Did you challenge the status quo and question unethical decisions made by peers and managers? Direct yourself to back to point #3 please. No, really, back to point #3. Cap One doesn't actually care about ""doing the right thing"" or ""acting ethically."" 

8) Ok i'm actually just getting started but I'll stop here. When in doubt, go back to point #3"

Management is only impressed if you do your job but also know IT to fix your own stuff, basic coding and creating reports.  That's the only way to advance from an entry level position.

The pay is not competitive when compared to other banks and ""other tech companies"", they need get better comparison methods and stop being stingy. The only way to move up salary wise is via promotion, which is hard to attain no matter what level you are.

Meetings for meeting sake, they love that here.

There aren’t any good things about this problem.,They cycle through people and don’t like older workforce. They only want young young people working for them. Have two friends who were also downsize due to age. There’s laws against age discrimination but because they do this such a clandestine way (even though we all know they do it) the government never gets a complaint.

3699,Capital One,Great Company!,2019-03-17,5.0,Senior Unit Manager,"Initiatives and strategic vision is industry leading - you truly feel like you are working for a technology company instead of a bank. They are innovating, instead of reacting (like many other institutions).

Many talented, smart colleagues - you work with motivated individuals who are trying to do more with their careers can just cash a check. 

Committed to employee satisfaction - employee satisfaction surveys are taken very seriously and management is expected to have action plans to address areas of opportunity. The company invests in facilities, benefits and other perks to make associates experience as enjoyable as possible. 

Tremendous quality internal training - particularly useful for exempt level employees. If you take advantage, you can learn things you will use your entire career. 

Endless opportunities - many associates can make career changes within the company and/or generally find jobs in whatever geographic area they want to live.","Performance management - associates in the same job level are ranked against each other by management. The perception is politics can have a significant influence on your rating. It can be particularly difficult for higher performing associates, who are not skilled at corporate politics, to receive higher ratings. 

Promotional process - in operations, promotions are often ""stretch roles."" This translates to you performing the role (including all responsibilities) without having the title or pay increase. ""Stretch roles"" can vary from six to as along as 15 months. This can be frustrating."

I've have become very close and gotten to know a lot my coworkers, of whom I still keep in touch with. They made coming into work everyday a pleasure and only made me love my job more. Also loved both the atmosphere at the the bank which was always very positive and friendly, everyone would help each other regardless of our positions whenever help was needed. I also got to know a lot of my customers on a personal level and looked forward to seeing them come in. All the managers I've been lucky to have work with have all been great role models for me and I've not only learned a lot from each one of them but I've grown and it has only made me better at my job in the long run.","Although there is not much I did not like about working at Capital One Bank, if I had one thing to say it would be the Sales aspect of the Bank. Although I can understand it is our job to inform  I do not like to push people to get it and at times I felt like that is what is was like. Another aspect that I would say I did not like was the goals we had to meet. However, I usually did meet my goals most of the time but then there were times I was not able to meet them, but a lot my customers were regulars so it was hard to open new accounts."
