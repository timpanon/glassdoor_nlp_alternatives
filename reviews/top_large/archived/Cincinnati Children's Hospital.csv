Their responses are rehearsed and pathetic. The way leadership treats employees is nothing less than insulting. They never listen to or act on feedback even though they have employee surveys. The working environment is ""my way or the high way"". The company is much too woke also. They need to focus on healthcare and not social issues.

I never grow tired of being able to say that I used data to help improve children's lives. There are also some amazing, hardworking clinical staff out there and it's a joy working with them.","BUT if you consider yourself to be creative, passionate, skilled, and innovative person, I would highly advise that you exhaust all other job opportunities before settling with this position. The tasks are mundane and repetitive, the management is inconsistent and hypocritical, and our entire business model is centered on looking as productive as possible while not actually improving anything long-term.

Be prepared to be thrown in headfirst with little to no guidance. Some get mentors, others do not. Our ""standards"" are only enforced if it is convenient for the manager. There are always glaring quality issues with projects I inherit. When this quality issue was brought up, my manager brushed it aside. I had several instances where customers told me that my manager has historically been a barrier to improvement. There is a real lack of accountability for management and don’t expect them to solve any concerns you have. Several coworkers have left the department in a matter of months.

Management is also always quick to push the blame onto others (especially other internal departments). When I tried to advocate for better data quality and data access my manager, once again, brushed it aside and told me multiple times that “We used to have it a lot worse back in the day”..... THAT is the quality improvement mentality from leadership. Instead of constantly improving, employees are told to just be thankful that it’s not worse. In my eyes, a quality Improvement team should NEVER settle for less. But it turns out you do when you work in this department.

There is also A LOT of bureaucracy between my department and IT. I have seen a countless number of clinical staff members be neglected because their project got abandoned in the nebulous void that is IT bureaucracy.

The department really needs to practice what it preaches.

You’ll do well if you keep your head down and do exactly what your manager says. Just don’t get invested in the mission. As soon as you do, you’ll see that we are so far behind in living up to it."

One of few pediatric hospitals in area if peds is preferred.

Multiple locations to work at.

Cafeteria is good. 

Research & teaching hospital which means many opportunities to learn about or practice latest treatment options.  Most providers are excellent at teaching their staff about what they're doing or answering questions to help you become a better, more knowledgeable provider.","Since they're so well- known they don't pay as well af other hospitals. They think the payment is the honor of working for them. 

Shuttles at the main hospital. You have to park 20 minutes away and stand around waiting for an inconsistent, over crowded shuttle (peak times) OFF the clock and get taken to the hospital where it takes several more minutes to get to your assigned floor before you can clock in. If you have to arrive or leave during non-peak times, the shuttle options are even more limited and it can take nearly 45 minutes between clocking out and getting back to your car. 
* This is especially important since you can risk getting fired if you're more than a few minutes late for your clock-in time. You might be there 30 minutes before your shift, but if you can't get a shuttle quickly enough, you might be 'late' by the time you actually get to clock-in.

Management never on the same page and often had no idea what other managers were doing or not doing in the same unit with their assigned employees working side by side.  Very, very frustrating and confusing.

Facilities are state of the art and the hospital eagerly demonstrates best practices. The inpatient staff are competent across the board.,"Hospitals are inherently disorganized. You will not be individually valued as an employee. Rules and regs are strict, protocol exacting. Pay is below standard for the region. They  have lots of people trying to work there so they can depress wages as a result. High turnover after people put in their time. They sell this by claiming to be a ""young hospital staff"" but this really means they cant retain their workers. UC hospital a block south pays nurses and medical staff much better, because they are a unionized hospital. You get ample vacation time, but almost no sick days. You can only be sick 3 days for the whole year, after which they will start disciplining you. This is difficult because it incentivizes you to come in to work sick, which is not best practices for a children's hospital.

Benefits package continues to be reduced. Took away paid maternity leave, increased out of pocket expenses, increased parking fees, etc. Mix this with the lack of opportunity to advance and grow and you essentially lose money year after year of working here. I understand that something is better than nothing but for being a top children's hospital, the employees aren't fairly compensated. Raises are 2-4% each year but inflation lands around 3%.

It's obviously rewarding to contribute to children's healthcare (no matter what capacity).  Overall good work-life balance and good culture.","Leadership will state great initiatives/goals, but their actions oftentimes directly contradict them.  Example, the organization has a ""priority"" of developing ""great bosses"" that have more time with their direct reports.  After this goal was stated, my department completely reorganized and teams were shoved together (giving already strapped managers more direct reports).  Certain projects are stated to be ""the highest priority,"" but then resource allocation decisions are made that don't align with stated priority.  In my eight years of employment, I've noticed that the employees that are promoted are the ones that don't voice concerns.  Therefore, if you question decisions and give honest feedback (in a sincere effort to improve the organization), there is a reasonable chance you'll be labeled as a complainer and not promoted.  Finally, even with an exceptional yearly review, expect the max raise to be 2-3%.   The employee cost of benefits each year increases at a higher rate, leaving you feeling like you're less successful from year to year despite excellent performance reviews.  This is a little hard to swallow when the organization posts great profits, achieves a #2 national ranking and continues to build new buildings/purchase new practices."

This means that someone from an institution other than CCHMC seeking a job change with similar education, experience could request a salary higher than the minimum and receive it because CCHMC does not know their previous income.

743,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,CCHMC Review - Administrative/Office,2016-12-30,1.0,Temp/Administrative,"1.) Work Environment
I cannot think of a better reason to get out of bed and come to work. The patients and families you meet there are wonderful and you really see the difference your work makes in their lives, even if it is behind the scenes.

2.) Co-Workers
For the most part all of your co-workers at CCHMC will be very friendly and helpful, especially if you're new. There are definitely a few ""bad eggs"", but that is going to be anywhere you work.

3.) Decent Pay
I thought the pay was pretty good overall. It is definitely far from the best when compared to other major corporations of this size in Cincinnati, but that is kind of what you expect when you go into this kind of work. 

4.) Work/Life Balance
I'd like to start this section by saying that I worked behind the scenes in the offices at CCHMC, not in patient care. I cannot speak for the clinical side or researchers. However, I think the Administrative employees have a very good work-life balance. They VERY rarely will have you work overtime and you will generally stick to an 8-hour day with a 30 minute lunch.    

5.) Affinity Groups
There are quite a few affinity groups for minorities at CCHMC that are easy to become a part of and get involved in.","Personal Complaint/Con
If you are a YOUNG professional trying to come into CCHMC I would read this section. If you are NOT a young professional, or would just prefer a quick summary, feel free to skip to the General section.

I wanted to put this in here because I do not want young professionals to be stuck in the same boat I was in. To give you some background, I started working at CCHMC 3 years ago while I was still in college. I generally enjoyed my job, but I did notice one huge issue: lack of diversity. In my 3 years, I did not come across a lot of minorities represented in CCHMC despite their constant claims of ""diversifying the workplace."" In addition to that, I very rarely saw anyone in their early-to-mid 20's working at CCHMC unless they were a PCA or on third shift. The majority of people I saw that worked at CCHMC were Caucasian middle-aged women. In fact, approximately 80% of CCHMC's workforce are women. This should have been a giant red flag to me, but I was naive and very determined to work at CCHMC. 

After I graduated college I went on 5 entry-level interviews, and they were the most unprofessional experiences I've ever been apart of. The first interview was with an older gentleman that 5 minutes into the interview gave me a very condescending lecture about what I needed to study in graduate school when I ""grow up."" Obviously, I didn't get that job.  The next 3 interviews were just as unprofessional. All 3 of the interviewers showed up about 15 minutes late and barely asked me any questions. I cannot prove it, but my gut tells me all 3 of these ""open"" positions already had someone to fill them. In other words, they were just conducting the interviews for show. These ""interviews"" happened a handful of times in my own department so I'm sure it happens throughout other parts of the hospital as well.  I never heard anything back from those 3, but I did check on CenterLink (CCHMC's Facebook) to see who got the job and sure enough it was 3 middle-aged Caucasian women. I have no problem with this, but do not put ENTRY-LEVEL POSITION on a job that you clearly want someone with years of experience in. I also think it is great that an organization is hiring so many women (especially since I am a woman), but you do not need to exclude every other group of people to accomplish this. 

The last of my 5 interviews was probably the most infuriating of them all. I went through three rounds of interviews that went seemingly well. A few days later, I received an e-mail saying that I was enrolled in New Employee Orientation with a message saying ""Congratulations and Welcome to CCHMC!"" I waited for HR to call me with the news, but I never heard anything. I called my HR rep 2 times and e-mailed her but still received nothing. About a week later, I e-mailed the general HR address trying to find some answers. A few hours later, I got a very short one-line e-mail from my HR rep (who had still been ignoring me until this point) saying that it was a system error and to feel free to apply to other positions. No apology, no phone call, nothing. Needless to say by this point I was completely fed up and left the company. So please, if you are a young professional wanting to go into Healthcare find another hospital that will treat you with respect and not be extremely shady. There are plenty of other wonderful healthcare organizations that will welcome you with open arms. 




General
1.) Parking
This is probably the biggest complaint of every employee. Parking at CCHMC just sucks, there's no nice way to put it. Unless you have a medical condition, you will be placed in a parking garage in a very unsafe neighborhood and be shuttled to the main hospital or satellite location.  

2.) PTO
This is another aspect of CCHMC that I personally think is awful. Your PTO, sick days, and holidays are all rolled into one bank. Yes, you read that correctly. Legal Holidays come out of your already very limited amount of personal PTO.  

3.) Attendance
If you are a person that enjoys a flexible work schedule, do not even think about working here. CCHMC is extremely strict on attendance, especially with what time you clock in and out. If you are later than 5 minutes past your start time you will get a 0.25 point occurrence. If you call in sick you will get a 1.0 point occurrence, even WITH A DOCTOR'S NOTE. Your department will keep track of all your occurrence points for an ENTIRE YEAR. For example, if you called in sick on December 30, 2016 you would get a 1.0 point occurrence on your record that would not go away until December 30, 2017. These are a big deal because occurrence points can rack up quickly and greatly effect your raises, bonuses, and ability to transfer. Some departments will even hand out ""attendance report cards"" to their employees… 

4.) Getting Hired
If you do not have an inside person to recommend you it is nearly impossible to get hired at CCHMC. The already very unorganized HR department gets flooded with 1,000's of resumes a week. Therefore, it is very hard to get noticed in a sea of paper unless someone tells HR who to look for. If you make it into CCHMC, it is extremely hard to get promoted and move up the career ladder. Finally, do not fall for the shift trick they always tell new-hires. A lot of managers will sugarcoat how easy it is to move from second or third shift into first shift. It is possible, but its not as easy as they claim.  

5.) Management/Going Down Hill
I know management is a huge complaint about a lot of companies, but at CCHMC it is a giant issue. Not that long ago, CCHMC was more of a simple ""mom-and-pop"" hospital.  However, due increasing popularity over the years, CCHMC has grown into a massive corporation that is now running on a macro-level. As a result of this growth, CCHMC does not have the managers with the skill-level to efficiently run the hospital and it is going downhill fast. I'm a person that prefers quantitative facts rather than someone else's opinion, so if you're really interested in what I'm talking about look up CCHMC's ranking in the U.S. News and World's Report's for FY 2016-2017 and compare them to the previous years. You will see for yourself that they have dropped dramatically. As an added note, CCHMC used to be ranked as one of the Top Places to Work For, but it has been years since it has seen that list. I know meeting the bottom line is important, but you do not have to sacrifice your employees happiness to do so."

There is an incredible mission vision that the hospital has to be the best. They set what seem like impossible goals and then meet them. It is easy to be a big believer in the institution. And that can get you far. They will do their absolute best to find you another job internally should your position be eliminated due to a lab not getting funding or moving. In some ways they take care of their own.","The career ladder setup is abysmal. There is not a clear way to jump from one track to another. HR is ridiculous for people trying to get in but especially for people trying to hire people. HR controls access to resumes from the public. So you end up getting THE most ridiculous set of resumes, some of which are clearly not qualified. THE best way is to contact the department head or someone you know in order to bypass HR completely and get an interview. 90% of people in research get hired informally and THEN HR gets involved."

I really like everyone I work with but moving to another position within division has been a challenge that I have not been successful at.
1012,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,It could be SO much better.,2014-04-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Understand... Cinci Hosp consists of three major areas and they are each run very differently:  Clinical, Research, and Academia at Univ of Cinci.  All three interweave, but have distinctly different management goals and approaches.  I can only speak to the Research areas.  I have worked there for about 8 years.  
In the beginning it seemed one of the best places I'd ever worked (i've worked many places around the country); but now it is one of the worst.  I've seen behind the curtain and it is very, very disappointing.    

Reasons to work here?  mmm... 
* it's a job.  
* you like working for years with no chance to advance or $ increase (it's for the children, after all).
* you like meeting some very interesting individuals (plenty of that, at least).
* the parking everyone complains about is very cheap and easy (the complainers must all be locals). 
* the town believes what they hear about how wonderful the place is, and it's viewed as tops in USA. 
* the medical side may, in fact, be tops.","I work the research side (~8 yrs), so I cannot speak to the clinical side.  The clinical side may be wonderful, and I suspect it is in many ways... but research is one extremely messed up place. 

All the complaints here about money are very true.  It is their mission to lowball new hires as much as possible, because once they are hired they're stuck with the pay.  Forever.  No one can have more than 10% increase no matter what - but it's almost always more like 3% or less.  Lowballing employees is a very major complaint among workers I know.  They soon feel cheated, lied to, and underappreciated.  I see a great deal of passive-aggressive reactions because of that. 

Policies and changes are always presented as something special for the employees, yet it is clear in each case that the real consideration is saving the company money or making them appear like more than they really are, even if at the expense of employees.  

One of THE biggest problems in research is the view that since the research PhD's bring in the grant money, they are free to run things as they see fit.  Problem is, almost none of them know anything at all about management or working in business.  Some become like little gods, yet cannot see that they are running people into the ground, or ignoring their workers for years on end, etc.  Managing people is difficult in the best of situations, but execs seem to think it's no big deal.. anyone can manage.  But as long as research is run like common academia (where seniority and degrees rule utterly), then it will contrinue to be the MAJOR mess it is now.  It needs to be run like a real business, but is not, and not likely to change in this century.  

I could say plenty about some of the so-called research that goes on, too.  Trouble is, I suspect that the whole world of research has a high percentage of baloney like we see here so often, so we're no different in that respect.  That seems more of a problem in the research industry as a whole, and especially in academia.  In academia, apparently, you can be a complete idiot in the most basic life issues, but as long as you have the right degrees, had some success somewhere, and can bring in the grants - then you are all powerful.  And if they get the grant money, that must mean someone in the Fed agreed it was a wonderful idea for a study - but most people I know would laugh at what some of them do.  I'm telling you.. I know people who never got beyond high school who have WAY more on the ball than some of the PhDs, and even some MDs, who are allowed to 'manage' things any way they want with no interference."

This leaves lots of room for miscommunication and conflicting directions. Can't use your PTO without repercussion. Performance feedback was not timely or lacking entirely. Policies and rules are selectively enforced even within the same division.
1014,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,Not what they claim to be,2014-04-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working in research, it was nice to see where the research efforts were headed having the hospital nearby.  Nice people.","Buildings are older.  Management is ineffectual.  They would rather hide their heads in the sand than deal with the real issues.  Many new employees coming from other institutions quickly realized how far behind the institution is as far as HR policies, processes and efficiency.  Older bad bosses remain in positions of power polluting departments and ruining morale.  The institution will not change unless upper management changes and lets younger new management infuse new ideas and processes."

Diversity is a priority, and it is a comfortable place for those of all races, religions and sexual orientations, with women, those of color and non-traditional sexual orientations in leadership positions.

1066,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,Generally positive but nothing specifically great.,2012-07-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Fast growing hospital with lots of new opportunities. The heavily reinvest in growing the organization so there is always change and the opportunities that come with it.,There is more drama in the organization than anywhere I have ever worked. Lots of power struggles between the doctors that trickles down to the staff. Poor behavior among the staff is tolerated by a disciplinary process that is difficult to navigate and not helpful to managers.
1067,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,Only work here if you feel like being back in high school,2012-07-02,2.0,Registered Nurse,Working with children and their family.,"The back stabing, brown nose culture is hard to deal with and management encourages this type of behavior. Management does not listen to concerns. Encouraged to get a higher degree but no reward only to help with magnet status.  The company waste money on meeting after meeting that never amounts to anything happening. Spent a lot of money to have a company come in to save them money only to cut raises, benefits, and replace RN positions with Medical Assistants. Way to many Chiefs and not enough Indians."
1068,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,"Very overrated, its time to move on",2012-06-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"tuition reimbursement, opportunities to advance in certain titles, cater to many cultural families, flex schedule","lack of diversity among professional staff (nurses) but cater to a variety of diverse cultures, inconsistency among management and staff, if you are not kissing up or have courage to voice your concerns without hesistation then you are a threat or trouble maker and these factors will stop you from advancing forward
 currently is interchanging people positions such as RNs, PCA's, HUCS and using them outside their job they are hired for (RNS should not to used as sitters at a RN rate and at the discretion of management, HUCs should not used as sitters because they are not direct care providers and lack the required skills, and PCAs should not be used as HUCs when they are paid on higher pay scales and have different responsibilities), 
you can be floated to other units that are consistently understaffed, 
management in my dept doesn't listen to your concerns and basically makes decisions based on arrogance rather than seeking staff opinon,
 doesn't address discrimination at hand but offers diversity training to the whole instead ( this is a big issue in my dept, its becoming overbearing), 
RNs who have many years of experience as an ASN can not advance if they don't have BSN. 
Value initiative to save money is not effective"
1069,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,Great place overall!,2012-06-15,4.0,,Very friendly place to work and definitely patient friendly care. I enjoyed my time there and was always impressed with the quality of people that I worked with.  It is a massive system but still feels small enough.  The culture is positive overall.,There did not seem to be much in terms of opportunity for growth.  They also love timelines as advancement has more to do with time served than productivity.
1070,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,Good Pay for good work.,2012-04-26,4.0,,"Good pay, Good benefits, Good people.","Long hours, understaffed for workload"
1071,Cincinnati Children's Hospital,Disappointing Experience,2012-04-17,1.0,Executive Assistant,"Flexibility (although I have set work hours, there is some flexibility as far taking some extra time for lunch to squeeze in a doctor’s appointment, run an errand, etc. As long as the time is made up, it’s okay.) Salary for what I do is decent, although I know that a majority of others in my position make more than I do. That’s about it on the good side (besides, of course, working in an organization that helps children).","I would agree with some of the folks on here who’ve talked about the culture of “brown-nosing.” If you don’t enjoy schmoozing and even -- in the case of my department -- goofing off with co-workers on company time, you don’t belong here. There is a great deal of favoritism (and blatant favoritism at that). Further, managers -- again, in MY department -- could really benefit from some management courses. They are unprofessional and immature, and it is they who perpetuate gossip and badmouth others. Needless to say, it is not a motivating or even pleasant environment if you’re not in the ""clique.” I’m reminded of junior high….

On a side note, the red tape you have to wade through here is unbelievable.  It takes weeks or even months to get done what could be accomplished in other organizations in just a day or two.  

Medical premiums are a bit high compared to other institutions. There’s absolutely no match on 403(b) contributions (they recently announced they were cutting the 1% match they used to give). In most admin positions you receive only two weeks vacation – you have to work here five full calendar years before you get a third week. Even then, be aware that when you accept whatever salary they offer, they're including your vacation time/sick time, etc. I wasn't aware of this when I accepted my offer. I was under the impression that I was getting a certain amount per hour as cash compensation, but my hourly rate equals less than what I accepted when my two weeks vacation and five days sick time are factored in, so, in essence, I am basically paying for my own vacation/sick time considering that I thought I was getting ""this"" amount but ended up getting only ""that” amount. Be sure to ask a lot of questions on this front before accepting an offer. The one great benefit is the 15% of your salary that they fund to a retirement account for each employee. They also will reimburse you if you’re working on a college degree, but only up to a certain amount. You have to have your manager's approval though, and the degree has to apply to your position in some way. (For instance, if you’re a business manager or AVP, they’ll help with getting an MBA). Needless to say, as an admin, I have no hope of ever getting financial assistance if I want to obtain my Masters degree since there is no career ladder here for admins – speaking of which….

I was assured when I was hired that I would have no problem advancing and/or moving around the organization. This was important to me since I took this position just to ""get my foot in the door.” Well, years have passed and I’m still stuck in this position … there is basically no career ladder for admins. FYI, there are four levels of admin: Admin Asst, Sr. Admin Asst, Exec Asst, and Sr. Exec Asst (which are few and hard to get, however). You might be able to “advance” to a coordinator title, although it appears to me that the coordinator positions pay less than even the Exec Asst jobs. My advice: Do NOT take a position that’s ""lower"" than what you desire unless you want to waste years stuck in a position you’re overqualified for!

Also, it seems that HR is here solely to help the executives/departments, not the staff. If you have a problem, you're directed to take it to the manager in your department. That manager can do whatever he/she wants to do in dealing with that problem, be it something or nothing. If you do take a position here, just hope and pray it’s in a good department with good managers. It’s really a matter of doing your research and talking to people who already work in the department to which you’re applying to get some honest opinions and viewpoints on what daily life is like. Even better if that person works in the same position you would have."

The Value Initiative that will be rolling out in 2012-2013 promises to drastically cut employee benefits:

Retirement: CCHMC matching funds for retirement will decrease from 1% to 0%. Also eliminating some 403b vendors and forcing everyone who wants to contribute to use one vendor TBD.
Time off//overtime/differential pay: TBD, but changes are being made to keep it ""sustainable""
Tuition reimbursement: will decrease from current $7500, amount TBD
Health: reducing number of providers - will likely be forced to use an HSA (no more PPO plans)
Dental: same as health
Pay raises: not changing with value initiative, but maximum raise per year is currently 2.5%."
