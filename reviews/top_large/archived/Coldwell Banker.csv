0,Coldwell Banker,Coldwell Banker La Jolla The Best!,2022-04-04,5.0,Real Estate Agent,Great staff and supportive office manager. The best real estate office I've ever worked in. It was like a family. Really miss my co-workers. Beautiful office with views of the ocean. CB has plenty of marketing tools to help you succeed.,Finding street parking for office and weekly meetings.
1,Coldwell Banker,increds,2022-03-31,5.0,Realtor,Real estate technology is top tier and 10x better than the pyramid scheme kw.,Not a thing. Absolutely increds.
2,Coldwell Banker,Agent,2022-04-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great managers and agents who helped me thrive.,I didn’t have any cons.
3,Coldwell Banker,Great company to work for ..,2022-03-25,5.0,Sales Associate,My office manager in Manalapan/Marlboro Office is the absolute best ... very supportive and helpful.,Stingy with the commission splits.
4,Coldwell Banker,In-depth Honest Review,2022-03-21,3.0,Marketing,"Pros if you are an agent - There is nowhere better than CB. 
They have the best combo of trainers, tools, and splits you will find. Amazing staff that will go above a beyond. Though each office has its own unique culture all try to be inclusive to all types of agents whether you just want to do one deal a year or want to do a hundred. 

Pros if you are staff - 
+Lots of opportunities to try out new skills. 
+No higher education is required (formal degree). 
+Challenging work but nothing extremely difficult if you are good enough with computers. 
+You are paid overtime if you go over 40hrs at your usual rate (though working OT is frowned upon). 
+Lots of paid holidays off plus 2weeks vacation after first few months, 401K matching, health benefits are... passable. 
+There are almost always snacks and drinks of all kinds in the office.
+Most managers (in our area) are flexible if you need time off or just to leave early for an emergency/life. 
+You'll work with passionate people who will bring out the best in you.","Cons if you are an agent - literally none. Seriously the best place for agents.

Cons if you are staff - TLDR: You will be underpaid and over-relied upon. 

-The staff who last at CB are the ones who truly care about their agents and the company - and both parties take advantage of that mindset. Agents have no boundaries for your personal life or time and will demand a 2-day project to be done in an hour.
-There is no formal training. If you are not a ""self-starter"" to an extremely high-degree these jobs will seem impossible.
-Recognition is not bad but it will never come in the form of a significant raise but rather in shout-outs and maybe gift cards. You can hit every metric and be the best employee but you'll likely still see the same 1-2% ""raise"" as the one who did the minimum. 
-If you work in an office, leadership will always side with the agents even when it's a written rule."

All the training was online at times early in the day which made it very difficult to join Zoom calls. In addition, I'm aware this is a very saturated career field and having will power and self determination is a must but it seems that for newer agents, getting help or mentorship from senior licensed agents is hard to come by. Most senior associates do not want to be bothered with newcomers getting accustomed to the life of a broker fresh off the exam.

102,Coldwell Banker,No Leadership - Poor Management,2021-10-24,1.0,Realtor,"I can't recall anything positive about the office in Los Gatos, CA.","The office is managed poorly since the manager is too busy trying to act he is best friends with the admin team and tech guys. Only two people from the front desk admin team actually perform their job and have a good attitude. The rest have an attitude and refuse to do their job and reporting them to management will accomplish nothing. When a manager does nothing about people having attitude and nothing doing their job, it is no different than condoning bad behavior. Initially, anything I needed help with at the office, the manager referred me to the front desk admin team. The agent website is not user friendly and only one admin person knows how to get your website up and running but she refuses to help you regardless of how nicely you ask her to do her job. She and the manager will tell you to wait for the company training. Their tech support guy has an attitude and refuses to answer your questions. It was very challenging to schedule one of the tech guys to do his job and come to the office to set up my laptop to the company network. The tech guy was extremely rude and unprofessional towards me even in front of the manager but the manager wasn't surprised and did not care. You really cannot get any work done until you go to the training but you have to wait until the training is available at a location near your office as they only have one trainer to show you how to use their technology. You may have to wait months for this training to be in your area and you must pay for the training but they fail to tell you this when you are considering to join this company. When you finally go to the training, they will tell the realtors to obtain some tech information from the designated office admin in your office to set you to additional resources you need to use technology and setup your computer to contract software. The admin in my office lied and had done what the training instructor requested to set up my technology for the class. As a result, I could get training that day since I could not follow the class because my office admin refused to do her job. All this was reported but the office admin who refuses to do her job is still employed by the company. Imagine getting paid for having an attitude and refusing to do your job; yet, the office manager does nothing about it even when several people having reported the same issues with the same people refusing to do their job."

Despite that nearly all staff can do all work 90% remotely, we’ve been called back in to work full time because agents “like it” and no other reason.

247,Coldwell Banker,Harassed daily,2021-03-29,1.0,Marketing Coordinator,None ever. Sometimes there were nice agents but the fact that my pto were some kind people because of the toxicity is sad,My manager would harass me and a few other women in the office physically and verbally. I was the only one comfortable enough to say no please stop that. Other male agents in the office would harass me and one time one try to kiss me on the head and I said please don’t do that and the office manager said he had a daughter so it’s not creepy and I shouldn’t get so angry. Verbal abuse was daily and it drained me or I would just become so upset and sad that it seemed to be normal. No one was ever truly happy there except the people making the big bucks and they don’t respect the staff at all. Coldwell Banker is a giant corporation that’s been around for over 100 years and their focus is to make money like most corporations. The fact that I would have to call corporate and tell them of my concerns almost weekly or monthly is concerning and I wasn’t the only one. When I eventually quit it was myself and the two other female staff members that left because we couldn’t take it anymore. Do you feel trapped. And nobody respects you. My manager at the time even though she was very great told me well this is what you do when you’re a people pleaser. I’m not a people pleaser but if you are and you enjoy serving others while they beat you down and then I guess you can work here but life‘s too short

Terrible management. High mandatory “insurance fee”. Mandatory land line fee. Who on earth uses a land line? Old outdated office. Death notices constantly because so many of the agents are senior citizens. Terrible lead system that gives messages that don’t make any sense. Office meeting emails that use pictures from the 70’s and take up 30+ MB. They also sell your contact info to overpriced vendors that give them a cut.

Usually able to schedule and keep vacation dates, superiors tolerant of time needed for sick days or doctor's appointments.","Apathetic, distant higher management; issues of agent accountability for submission of timely, complete transaction documentation RARELY, effectively addressed - onus placed on administrators to get transactions processed no mater what.  Big revenue producers almost never approached about their constant mistakes.   Pathetic pay raises with review goals set so high that it was almost impossible to get a decent raise.

Overall a great work environment.
431,Coldwell Banker,Be a Broker and Eat Your Own For Dinner (or Go Broke),2020-04-08,4.0,Real Estate Agent,"Oldest name and reputation in biz. The most offices and office agents. Fairly recent generation tech and systems however playing much needed catch up with others as far as concept and usability, to which there is often a glaring disconnect.","2019-2020 re-branding was really a refresh like an 80's K-car.  Affiliated agents are the 2nd biggest revenue stream, paying through the teeth for redundant and abhorrent per year/month/deal mandatory legal fees, office fees, broker splits, transaction fees and client fees. Its all the same disguised as a different fee.  And they all are charged. Plus they roll out training on new and updated tech and tools and you find that agents will now pay for these services which were previously free under the old tech.  And then even the new pay for tech and features is a gen or two behind the curve.  Forget this. The most important thing is the Brokers actually cannibalize and compete with their own agents through every conceivable way possible. Any newer school agents making waves by default just doing what they do well, showing a lick of momentum and a following, real talent for selling in these modern days and higher use of the largely underutilized systems are undermined and sold out from under in very systematic fashion. They are very upfront about it and make no real attempt to hide this fact. Their power is wielded and known. And this gratuitous profiteering is further measurably compounded by the fact there is no limit to how many agents work in one office no matter the geography and available inventory for sale. Hence they will collect aforementioned fees from everyone, one after another, as long as those agents choose to be affiliated. There can be hundreds in an office. 20% have sales. The rest peril at their own Broker's behest. Hence agents are not independent contractors. They are paying customers. The newest is that agents are coerced to join teams, so that there are whole teams paying fees and by default sharing inventory to make it seem like it works. All this to support an extraordinarily TOP heavy executive to middle management structure that remains in its own way."

There were times where it definitely looked and felt like they took greater care of their agents than they did with their own office staff. It doesn't really feel good when you can tell that they're investing so much in their realtors that the office staff get the short end of the stick. Pay and benefits weren't great.

It is also a company recognized for having agents who are knowledgeable, experienced and most importantly, are of the highest integrity.  In many markets, they are the best trained bar none.
