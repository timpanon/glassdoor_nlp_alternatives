0,Databricks,Amazing culture,2022-03-22,5.0,Senior Manager,"* Self-aware culture, where leadership is willing to adapt to fit business and team needs",* Immature development tooling compared to FAANG companies
1,Databricks,Stellar company to work in,2022-02-20,5.0,Resident Solutions Architect,"- great culture from CxO down to first line managers, and individual engineers
- very open in communication - very easy to reach out to product, and engineering leadership, and get influence roadmap 
- you will be working with top customers S&P 500 list, state of the art cloud technology 
- very fast pace of innovation and product excellence on edge of Big Data and Machine Learning 
- ability to contribute not just to your projects you directly work on, but also through community work including, but not limited to meet ups, writing blog posts, contributing to open-source projects, helping our customers through public online communities, etc. Many departments have this formalized. For example, in Field Engineering, there is a ""10x"" and ""Databricks Labs"" venues for this that Solution Architects can work on their own projects 
- I believe in power of open source and Databricks is the best company that aligns with this. Most of the Databricks products we contribute back to open-source (Spark, Delta, MLFlow, to name a few)","- fast growth brings its own challenges, this is not applicable to all departments though, Databricks mostly grows by adding more departments and adding verticalization, so fast pace rarely is a bad thing here, except additional workload to help onboard new people"
2,Databricks,It's about the people,2022-01-14,5.0,Vice President Sales,"If people are realistic, they don't want to work for a company that is perfect. That's impossible. They want to work at a company that continually strives to be great.

Databricks is a place where people can be themselves. They can be individuals and express their ideas. And because of this, our people come up with amazing ideas that help our customers.

People are willing to help each other out. Even if it doesn't help them. I've had countless experiences where I've asked people for help, and they embraced the effort as if it were their own. And I've been asked and done the same for others.

Our leadership routinely looks at employee engagement and tries to do the right thing by them. Are they perfect? No. They are transparent and people know they're trying.

We're setting records on growth, delivering amazing innovations to the market, exceeding customer expectations...but it's because we have passionate people who feel like they're making a difference.

I'm thankful to work with such incredible people in a tremendous culture.","This isn't a 9-5 culture. This isn't a place where you just work on a set list of problems. We're all very motivated about the potential to change the industry and we do what it takes to do the right thing.

If your primary concern is about how quickly you'll be promoted, or how quickly you'll become a millionaire... it's probably not the right fit for you. There are ample promotions and opportunities to become wealthy, but it comes from a desire to build great things."
3,Databricks,The right place at the right time,2022-02-22,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"- Fun and exciting atmosphere with an imminent IPO
- Extremely smart people across all departments
- Attracting top talent from top companies
- Compensation package (OTE + RSUs), benefits such as unlimited time off, and work-life balance working fully remotely with the option to go into a couple shared offices
- Tons of career growth opportunity as we look to double headcount in 2022 and beyond","- Not a con, but a challenge is learning the technical nature of the industry. It's a fairly long learning curve for those like me coming from outside data & AI (came from Salesforce). However, our talented Solution Architects help so much, they are top talent.
- H1 and H2 quotas vs an annual quota up front. I think this is part of figuring out comp packages at a hyper growth company with a fair balance of commit and consumption quotas.
- Various weighting of commit vs consumption quota (0/100, 30/70, 70/30) with the possibility of it changing halfway through the year adds to the uncertainty of compensation and how to align activities to compensation."
4,Databricks,We're building the next iconic software company...and it's working,2022-02-18,5.0,Vice President,"1) Bold thinking
2) Rarified growth
3) Truly a ""first-team"" company
4) Impossible to get bored
5) Solving problems/challenges nobody has seen before","So, surprise, surprise...there are cons to being part of a company that seems to about double every year, but I don't think these are really specific to Databricks, more specific to rocket-ship type growth. These are:

1) Solving problems nobody has seen before is hard work. Exciting and fun, but hard work.
2) The old analogy of ""trying to change the tires on a car going down the highway at full speed"" applies. 
3) This is a young company with immature process in many areas. We're addressing things, but it's basically a 6-year old commercial entity in terms of much of our process. Just be patient, cause we'll get it sorted out"
5,Databricks,Challenging but rewarding place to work,2022-02-22,5.0,Solution Architect,Team-first attitude ensures that you always get the help you need. My colleagues are some of the smartest people I've ever worked with. I am constantly learning both technical skills and business acumen. The company invests in its people often hiring from within and providing leadership development opportunities for ICs wishing to transition to management positions. I feel recognized for the work I do and supported when I work on projects that may fall outside the strict definition of the job.,"We're a big company now with small company problems. Our internal operational systems have not scaled with our growth. Still a lot of ""institutional knowledge"" from the field that needs to be better documented. High expectations for the company can create stressful stretches of time to meet ambitious goals. Programs are in place to address the lack of diversity but we still need to make way more progress to be a more diverse workplace."
6,Databricks,"Supportive, Competitive, and Uplifting Environment at Databricks as an SDR/BDR",2022-03-01,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),"-Well supported in every aspect (career growth, questions answered right away, given mental-health breaks)
-Each BDR is assigned their own AE's and territory so there is no fighting amongst colleagues over leads
-The team is filled with competitive, ambitious, intelligent, and hard-working individuals who are eager to succeed but also more than willing to help you achieve your goals 
-Some of my colleagues have become my best friends 
-Benefits: fantastic office, collaborative environment, spiffs, headphones/phone/gym reimbursement, in-office lunch, currently remote
-Executives are transparent and willing to meet with you to ensure you feel supported at Databricks 
-Work hard, play hard environment (challenged but never super overwhelmed)","-Could be paid more for being in the tech industry, BUT the perks & environment is second to none & you really can't put a price on that"
7,Databricks,"World class people, high visibility, high stakes, high growth, and low turnover",2022-01-23,5.0,Solutions Architect,"You work with world class people
You have endless opportunities to utilize your strengths 
You learn extremely fast and have a high degree of visibility and accountability
Competitive pay with big tech
The culture is positively competitive. Everyone competes but builds each other up while doing it. This is hard to create in a company.","It’s growing really fast, so you need to be the one to define the vision and direction for your career. 
In sales, the teams can feel disorganized.
Training is there, but maybe not completely relevant. The onboarding could be more connected to the day to day work."
8,Databricks,Databricks = Best Company I've Worked For,2022-02-22,5.0,Sales,"Amazing Career Opportunities, Product is Amazing, Huge Market Opportunity, Leadership is more transparent and willing to listen to feedback than any company I've worked for in my 11+ years in tech space.","This isn't really a con in my mind - Hi Growth Company with a massive opportunity. You have to be prepared for change and to move fast. I see this as a great opportunity to grow your career, but some may want more consistency quarter over quarter and year over year."
9,Databricks,A True Rocket Ship!,2022-03-15,5.0,Solutions Architect,"Never a Boring Day
Perks
Pay
Fun Tech Stack
Lots to Learn","This is barely a con, but Databricks is growing very fast, so there's lots to do until the head count catches up to the work."
10,Databricks,Fantastic company,2021-12-13,5.0,Senior Manager Product Management,"When you run through multiple loops, searching for that next best thing, it's not only them interviewing you, it's also you interviewing them. Databricks was one of the five in my panel and was the only one w/zero red flags. I was impressed by pretty much the entire process and especially by the level of talent. Greatness attracts greatness, so if you are looking for that set of people and challenges to solve, come interview here and make up your own mind.","If you are coming from a mature company, you'll have to spend some time figuring out how their IT systems piece together. It's not bad, but it's also not (yet) turn key."
11,Databricks,Rocketship,2021-12-13,5.0,Sales Manager,"- Incredible rate of product innovation - continues to deliver more value to customers 
- Increased investment in operational rigor as we prepare to scale even faster 
- Transparent leadership culture 
- There's a high bar on recruiting, it's incredibly hard to find a Brickster that is not competent and dedicated to their job 
- Our solution is applicable to many different industries which creates compelling customer proof points no matter who you're selling to
- Scheduled company days off that help employees to recharge
- Tremendous career opportunities, we are growing so fast that if you display hard work and dedication, you will get opportunities to move up or transition to a different role if you so choose 

There are many, many people that have been at Databricks for three, four, five-plus years. This shows you that this is a company you can build your career at.","- You will be asked to do a lot. The pace is very fast here. If you're not ready to bring it every week, you will fall behind"
12,Databricks,"Great growth, strong leadership, strong culture",2022-02-24,5.0,Sales,"Databricks is having record success in the market. Great uptake of our messaging and products.

Leadership is very transparent and does a great job of communicating goals as we grow

""Great culture"" is an overused term, but it's a real thing at Databricks. Strong sense of being able to work through any issues or mistakes without the politics that are involved everywhere else I've worked",There's really nothing I'd list here... any cons are simply Databricks trying to have systems keep up with the rapid growth... a good problem to have.
13,Databricks,Get on this Rocketship!,2022-02-18,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"- amazing culture. Truly honored to be a brickster. There are no egos (despite the immense talent) and everyone looks out for each other 
- leading product. Databricks will become the de facto tool for any organization that wants to have effective analytics 
- leadership that cares about personal development. 
- this really is the place to be",- some challenges that come with growth. Its what it takes to build the next iconic software company
14,Databricks,Hyper growth with massive potential,2022-02-18,5.0,Senior Engagement Manager,"Demand for enterprise Data & AI solutions is growing and the growth is going to accelerate in the coming year, which is great for Databricks as it is well positioned with its amazing products and services. Databricks is part of only a handful companies in the world who have or were able to create a whole new category with Lakehouse. So, as far as the organisation is concerned, it has a ton of potential and a huge addressable market!

People are brilliant. There is a very strong engineering culture and world-class  engineering talent aspires to join Databricks. Founders are still part of the company and they are all hands-on. 

The organisation is getting a huge brand recognition as well. This helps in boosting the morale of the existing employees and also helps attach great talent. 

Databricks also takes care of its employees with very competitive salaries, bonus and other perks. 

As of writing this review, Databricks is pre-IPO so there is a huge financial upside in joining the firm.","Databricks is growing fast and with such hyper growth comes intense pressure of work and delivery. Working 10 hours a day and on weekends is almost normal. This puts a huge strain on work-life balance as there is almost none.

Like any other organisation, Databricks has multiple teams/functional units. These teams work in silos. For instance, there is almost no close interaction between product teams and Go-To-Market teams.

While Databricks' product is light years ahead of its competitors but its sales and Go-To-Marketing teams have a lot of work to do. The mgmt. knows this and they have super high expectations from these teams, which in turn puts a lot of pressure on especially these teams."
15,Databricks,Amazing place to work and grow professionally!,2022-03-21,5.0,Account Manager,"- great culture

But we are right where we need to be.
18,Databricks,Lots of fun and energy,2022-02-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Interesting engineering projects with plenty of new development rather than mostly maintenance.
* Open source ecosystem is great for learning and sharing work with the community. 
* Incredibly dense talent pool.",* Using mostly open source tools involves a bit more work to get the same things done sometimes than in a closed source only world. But the benefits of this extra work include building the data stack in a way that is very useful for others to integrate with the rest of their system.
19,Databricks,"Really brings out the best in me, great culture, super transparent.",2022-02-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's impossible to work at Databricks and not become smarter/better with every month. Through mere osmosis you are exposed:

- Focus on building great products, cut through BS, company doesn't waste time on distractions
- Well positioned for lots of future growth","- Technical debt from organic growth over many years, but this is also an opportunity and company is prioritizing fixing it
- Internal tools could be better, but this is also an opportunity (if you work on a team that works on internal tools) and company is working on fixing it
- WLB is not ideal, but also not as bad as some people say. Seems to be more a function of the kind of people Databricks hires, than something imposed by management."

Lots of power tripping managers whose main skill is sucking up to their seniors, and in turn the managers are ""protected"" which means they can get away with unprofessional behavior and treating even the best performers on their team like crap. Rampant favoritism which means IC's who are amongst the lowest performing in terms of metrics get promotions and access to opportunities before better performing members on their team.

So overall everything made sense.,"i could not find any cons. Only one thing i would like to suggest in recruiting process would be that , weightage given to references is bit high.

Such work experience they provide can be transitioned to other companies should you decide to make a switch. Also, at least before COVID-19, the company serves free lunch and Happy Hour Fridays, which helps improve morale while helping employees save on food costs.","Unprofessional managers will wear everybody down. However, the company either doesn't care or are too gun shy to solve these issues. I know of several people who either quit/considering quitting due to unprofessional managers or are refusing to work with these managers. There are unprofessional managers in every department, including finance, sales, and engineering.

In addition, there is pressure from managers to work insane hours, hence the low amount of WLB for employees.  Unfortunately, this leads to burned out employees, who in turn are less productive and less efficient."
65,Databricks,Great Company - a lot to work on,2021-12-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,There are a lot to work on and people are smart and discipline here.,"So far so good, just joined."

67,Databricks,"Solid company, lots of potential",2021-07-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Leadership really understands the space, and the product-market fit is great. The strategic initiatives make sense, and the whole company gets easily aligned on them. It's pretty clear to all how the efforts being successful make the company successful. Also clear how teams and individuals can make the efforts successful, so overall rewarding work. There's no infighting, castle-building or passing the buck.","Still figuring out how to scale, and under-investing in program management. Generally at the inflection point between small and medium company, starting to see cracks where people don't document quite as well, still rely on in-person alignment, and struggling with the ensuing complexity.
Same on the product management side, some crises of identity between customer/sales oriented folks and platform/long-term product development. However, not finding it hard to resolve conflicts.

The usual growing pains around codebase, refactor, etc. aren't as bad; people generally know what to do, and are juggling it with the immediate needs from customers."
68,Databricks,Great people. Great product.,2021-11-18,5.0,Sales Development Representative,This company is full of incredible people. The Databricks solution helps companies leverage their data to bring greater value to their organizations.

This is a fantastic company to work for. In every department you meet brilliant, talented and committed people doing amazing things. We're growing fast and developing some amazing products and really transforming the industry. 

Management is super supportive of employees and has been fantastic during the COVID pandemic, making sure to check in regularly and find ways to accommodate needs. They always emphasize the importance of regular PTO and other forms of employee wellness.","Busy, busy, busy!

Growing this fast means hectic schedules, and an ever-changing landscape of people and processes. It's impossible to keep up with the deluge of email and notifications. There are lots of internal projects to help organize and optimize time and resources, but nobody can keep up at this pace. Still - it's a great problem to have :D"

Good comp
The software is solid. So solid that I'd choose it as the platform of choice if I were to start a data/ml company right now.
Plenty of time to ramp up.",You will earn your keep. That's not a con at all but this is no chill-all-you-want job.
74,Databricks,"Great culture, strong leadership, and huge potential",2020-12-05,5.0,Account Executive,"-Great leadership. Management is highly invested in the development of the individual. 

-Culture is strong. The company is not only selective in hiring, but hollistic as well in its approach. The result is the people you get to work with are not just smart, but also incredible people. I find myself humbled everyday by the calibre of my colleagues. 

-Market potential is astronomical and leadership is making all the right moves to capture it. The company is unquestionably a thought leader in the space, and it's great to see us actively innovating the product to both augment our TAM as we encroach on the traditional DW space, and continue to innovate our bread and butter AI/data science and core infrastructure offerings. As a sales person this is the dream - getting to sell a world-class product. 

-Every company can always improve diversity, but Databricks is by far the most diverse company I've ever worked with. They take DEI seriously.

-Sales culture specifically is incredible. Not the typical frat house sales culture you often see in tech sales.","-the classic hypergrowth startup pains, processes are a bit wonky, etc. Leadership is keenly aware of it though and working to remedy. Issues that happen as a result of this get fixed quickly once you raise it. 

-product has historically catered to data scientists, and as such is quite complex. As we broaden the scope of our market, and clash with DW players like Snowflake, we need to continue to simplify our product/messaging to cater to non-technical executives and analyst personas."
75,Databricks,Good Job,2021-12-09,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Typical SDR role - great company to be at if you are lucky with territory,Pay is less competitive to other SDR roles

- Academic culture. Smartest people I've ever worked with. Collaborative, open, feedback is always encouraged. 
- Product / engineering-led company + open source focus = unmatched pace of innovation.
- Low on the typical politics you see at other tech companies.
- If you care about money, you will make a lot of it here. Still very early days.","- Big opportunity calls for high expectations which can be interpreted as poor work/life balance. 
- The pace is frenetic and not for everyone. You have to be ok with iteration and constant change. No time for perfectionism. 
- If you're not in product/engineering and/or you don't have a computer science degree, you don't matter as much. 
- We're working on it but diversity - especially at the VP+ level - is a problem."

- Really, really great People Ops team. TONS of resources for BIPOC, LGBTQIA+. Tons of internal events to keep people engaged, motivated, connected. 
- Lots of attention paid to individual growth by everyone from direct managers all the way to leadership team","- Growing really really really fast so keeping up to date on product features, updates, supported integrations is a tough task. Everyone has their own repository of content so a lot of repeated work being done in silos. 
- Product surface area is very large and growing every day. Makes it hard to get a good grasp on who the target persona are and delve deep into a specific functionality or domain. Have to be a jack of all trades and split attention between many different parts of the platform."

They replaced an entire leadership chain with external leadership and they brought along a very toxic culture along with their own set of sub-leaders. The culture has changed dramatically. I've also never used the term micro-aggressions before, but my day is filled with head scratching passive aggressiveness. I finish work sometimes feeling completely shell shocked. Work used to be a passion, now it's just work."

I'm surrounded by smart people who aim to have a holistic view on the problems we're solving, no matter which department you're in. 
- Lots of untapped potentials in many of the departments. Since we are aiming to build a great company, with our exponential growth in the last few years and the current stage of our growth, there are a lot of rooms for us to transform the org into a well-oiled machine. By the time we reach the ""well-oiled machine stage,"" we'll most likely outgrow that and pursue the next growth stage. This has been the funnest and most rewarding company I've ever worked at.","In the scale of work/life balance, many of us probably tip heavier on the work side than balance. But then again, most people aren't joining a startup company for work/life balance."
91,Databricks,"Worth it, if you can handle the negatives",2021-01-08,4.0,Customer Success Engineer,"The best place to learn about cutting edge technology, business technology strategies and selling.
Compensation is competitive, borderline aggressive.
Lots of opportunities to travel","Everything is pretty hostile. Be prepared for people to make fun of you in slack when you don't know something that's deemed 'obvious' by someone else. There's a reason that minorities don't last as long as their white male peers, especially in more technical areas. Lots of inclusion hand waving from senior people that's not mirrored on the ground.
Borderline cultish, no healthy distinction between work and personal life. You'll be referred to as 'family' expected to give up personal commitments, and your LinkedIn should now contain the daily Databricks stories and milk your personal network for people to join the 'family'. Once someone leaves, they might as well be dead to the company. Next to no one gets a leaving card, gift, or even an announcement that they've gone. You only notice when you can't slack them anymore. 
Not a con as such, more a word of warning: everything is utter chaos. Don't think you can do anything as bold as have a plan for the week, someone will steamroller it with the latest ""urgent"" request that you absolutely have to help them with because they lacked the foresight (and incentive) to plan."
92,Databricks,The best place I've worked in my 27 years of technology!,2021-02-10,5.0,Solutions Architect,"The company is run by, operated by, and mostly staffed by visionaries and doers. The CEO can even write code and is super comfortable showing executives how easy it is to use the product. Then openness/transparency within the organization is top notch - something I can only hope sticks around as we continue our growth. We've been able to keep the bar high and hire great people who turn out to be great team members, all resulting in a great and happy place to work.",With rapid growth comes growing pains - sometimes you have to ask around for an answer to something that's super new.

Great C-Level management - Ali is a great CEO and the company is under tremendous guidance

Generally supportive culture. A lot of good people across different teams, and I'm fortunate to have a good manager and good sales team alongside me

Earnings potential is great, some of the most aggressive comp plans I've ever seen

Exciting place to be - Feels like you're making a difference in the world, and customers are happy to hear from you

Would absolutely recommend this job to a friend","Some overkill on internal sessions with middle management - Account reviews, deal reviews, territory plans, QBR's, several of these happening weekly. Doing this with more than just a direct manager adds a layer of stress and can get in the way of actual work.

Environment can be unnecessarily political. Any sales job has an element of intensity and critical judgment, but there is more CYA, criticism, and walking on eggshells than is useful.

While the technology is impressive and customers love it, it's a complex product set and sales motion that takes some time to get used to.

Less of a con and more neutral, but Databricks is in a rapid growth stage, so be prepared for rapid and sometimes dramatic change in sales motions, priorities, and even pay."

It’s so refreshing to be at a company that actually understands what it entails to be data driven. Most companies throw around terms like ML, AI, and big data with no real grasp on how to use the concepts. Databricks understands and often creates the playbook on these topics

The work is interesting and I really couldn’t think of a better company to work at given the growing importance of data in tech and business

Great cultural values that are actually adhered to.

Transparency from the executive level

best in class pay and benefits

Really making an effort with diversity that shows both in terms of the employees and the resources for employees","Still developing processes as they transition out of being a startup

Databricks by keeping their culture and leadership principles true to form both internally and externally creates an environment that, in my opinion, is the best of both worlds. They foster an incredible culture in a very high paced relevant technology space with a high bar for talent. This comes together in an accountable yet collaborative selling environment where everyone is willing to help and who truly believe that we are all making the world better together.",If you consider it a con this is a fast past rapidly growing organization that requires it's employees to adapt quickly and pivot strategy base on a rapidly evolving marketplace. Some may not be up to this type of challenge.

Good work-life balance-- strong focus on delivery but leadership has high trust in the team when there are hiccups/challenges. 
Engineering-driven organization, so engineers drive roadmaps and determine timelines
Deep technical challenges-- you're not just building another CRUD app with the same scaling strategies
Investment in engineers' careers-- lots of engineers here have 4+ years at Databricks and staying beyond initial vesting","Decision-making and ownership could be clearer. With some cross-team projects, it's unclear who is accountable for driving the project and who has the final say
D&I numbers are not great. While there is nothing negative if you are an underrepresented individual, there doesn't seem to be org-wide level efforts to drive representation or clear accountability tied to leadership to improve D&I."

112,Databricks,Transformative and disruptive platform,2021-03-10,4.0,Sales,Probably one of the most significant platforms/products I've had the privilege of providing to the customers I work with in terms of business impact and value. There is an open and transparent culture from the top down. Transforming how a customer views and uses data is very rewarding. Very disruptive to the data space. Awesome in those aspects of the company.,Sometimes the worklife balance is ignored. There is a lot expected of every team. Not necessarily a con. It's overall a good thing but understand the internal requirements and the amount of time we're spending with customers can be overwhelming. We have to spend time with customers as we're transforming the way they're doing business and it takes time to take a customer from 0 to 100. You don't just buy some licensing. This is really a pro but internal stuff on top can grow into a con.

118,Databricks,"Fast-moving, collaborative, and challenging",2021-05-18,5.0,Senior Solutions Architect,"Even as a large and growing company, Databricks has retained a lot of the fast-moving and exciting aspects of a startup: fast product development, energy in initiatives for improvement, and opportunities for learning and making an impact.

The culture is very collaborative, both at a team level and across the organization. I've always found my teams well-bonded, and it's pretty easy to reach across to other orgs when you need outside help.

Databricks moves quickly, and you're expected to as well. For some, that's a plus, and it means you have chances to grow and prove yourself. That said, as management has matured over the years, it's also become easier to get the time you need to maintain a work-life balance.

It also doesn't hurt that the business is doing incredibly well, has tons of funding, and is behind some of the biggest open source projects out there.","Employees are expected to learn and execute quickly and assume ownership of things. In such a culture, it's easy for a new employee to feel like they need to figure out how to swim by themselves. That's not the case: it's great to ask for help. However, you often have to ask for what you need, not wait for someone to reach out.

Databricks has and continues to grow quickly, nearly doubling in most years. That's great overall, but it does introduce constant change and growing pains. I'd say they've been managed pretty well. It helps when I view this as exciting, not stressful."
119,Databricks,Great company to learn and grow,2021-05-10,5.0,Account Executive,"Since I first started at Databricks, it was obvious that a healthy company culture was a pillar to their values.

They invest a lot into their employees and have a core focus on training, growing and promoting individuals from within.","I haven't had a lot of negative experiences at Databricks.

121,Databricks,Such and outstanding company!,2021-01-28,5.0,Technical Instructor,"The People: They are kind, helpful, motivated, and probably the smartest group of people I've worked with.

Management: Always there when you need them, you just have to ask.

Alignment: From the top to the bottom the entire company understands their mission and everyone is in lock step. We are all running with the ball and heading to the end zone.

Perks: The company is constantly giving us gifts, swag, etc. This is a little thing but it does make you feel like you are truly part of the company.

Compensation: The pay is great, above average I would say. Benefits are great (the cheapest health insurance I've ever had in my 20 year career)",The company is growing at breakneck speed. You need to be comfortable with a bit of chaos at times.

Awesome product, awesome CEO, awesome space, awesome co-workers, awesome clients, delicious kool-aid. It is a fantastic company with a pretty solid future ahead of it, if lake house is what they think. 

This company has to avoid being the next Cloudera","SDR work is  broken. Other parts of the sales team and company are really solid 

One month, someone blew the quota out of the water and everyone's job got way harder overnight. What the heck!

Apparently, a huge part of a sales development leader’s task is continually justifying the general existence of the SDR team as a whole. Not such a bad thing to get caught up in if you're learning and getting promoted, but nobody is.

Join this company as an SDR if you want to be a stowaway on the rocket ship. You constantly overhear your manager defending your value to the captain, but you don’t really believe what they’re saying."

216,Databricks,Downward trending culture,2020-12-02,2.0,Customer Success,The people there are great with top c-level execs encouraging teamwork in both intra-department and inter-department situations. Also it's very hard to not learn new things while there assuming that you are working with the right people.,"If this was a year ago, no doubt this will be a 5-star review. However due to rapid company growth, the culture has gone downward due to politics. Several managers and directors are uninterested in doing what is best for the company. Instead they only do what will make themselves look good in the eyes of top executives in the short run. This results in blame culture as several good people leave or remain unhappy there.

One example is my customer success manager before I left the company. The previous one I had was great as he was professional. However, the new one is cocky and arrogant. Even though I never missed SLA benchmarks, the new manager always gives the top assignments to the men he is closest with, several of whom has less experience than I do and haven't been there as long as I have . This is nothing more than a boys club.

Another example is the order management director Chris. If something goes wrong, he doesn't take responsibility for his work and blames others. He badmouthed several of his own colleagues and people he managed. He belittled the VP of Sales Operations. He blamed the IT department for some of his shortcomings. I found him impossible to work with as he acts like a professional victim.

I can go on and on and on regarding other examples of managers who play politics instead of working but that will take too much time. I will say that this kind of politics happens in every department (IT, sales, finance, customer success, engineering, etc.). So be forewarned."

- Great coworkers (except people with powers)
- Great customers","If this review was 1 year ago, my rating would be 5 star. 
It had a great culture, company who really cared about its people, we were a family, we believed in getting work done with no politics or drama - Employees were called cofounders.

Now.... no no no.. huge NO! 
The company culture has drastically changed over a 1 year period - mainly the culture and care for employees. 
One of the Databricks values is ""raise the hiring bar"" but it doesn't see the culture fit. It hired bunch of dirty political people in the middle management including some VPs who ruined it for the shining employees who cared about keeping customers first, building things and not care about drama. Databricks hired bunch of political people to ruin the company culture and it is creating an unhealthy environment for its employees. Of course, the new hires want to join the company now because Databricks has a well established brand in the market and soon going to be IPO. But it was because of the blood and sweat of its early employees who worked so hard to get it to this place. There is no good internal process, no retention efforts by HR or even senior management. Leadership remains quiet and doesn't care losing good employees. They do internal surveys and not care about taking action for those transparent words that employees have to say about their work frustrations. They don't seem to have any respect for ICs. They seem to celebrate diversity and care about women too - but for example one specific VP who is a woman herself doesn't care about creating healthy environment for her employees and believes in playing political games.

Some of the recent reviews giving it 5 star came through within last 2 weeks, of course so that they can get their ratings higher on glassdoor to make up for the bad and transparent reviews."

It's also unbelievable how the company is able to keep the hiring talent bar high while growing at such a fast rate. Our list of clients is as extensive as it is impressive no matter the industry.  All businesses are trying to understand their data to make better decisions. Databricks is the leader in making this possible.","- Typical startup growing pains due to rapid growth

230,Databricks,"Great Product, Culture Trending Negative for Customer Facing Teams",2020-08-20,3.0,Customer Facing,"Databricks is powering the Data and AI revolution. Our products are big value-adds for customers. We have many household brands, governmental agencies, and small businesses using our products.

Company has grown from 200 to 1400+ in just 4 years.

Decent benefits, decent pay.","I am on a customer-facing team. 

As the company has grown from the 200-300 size 3 yrs ago to the current 1400+, we've added multiple layers of middle management. Many of these middle managers are from other companies of questionable success. When we do this, we risk bringing the culture and practices of these companies into our doors... And in positions of  management, the culture effects are amplified. 

Every year, our practices and culture shifts (growing pains) and we add more red-tape. Growth is great, but within the customer-facing teams we promoted some ICs to first-time manager roles, added layers of reporting requirements on teams, and imported a ton of managers from outside. 

There has been more toxicity coming from the Sales team lately; if people in Sales have a complaint about your work they might just throw you under a bus instead of working it out with you. 

One sales rep told me a lot of reps are frustrated with the recent flood of Splunk alumni into our ranks. We hired some Splunk leaders a while back, and they brought in Splunkers by the busload. Some of the leaders are so-so. 

Some managers also don't protect their directs. They'll judge their directs based on feedback from folks from other teams, and won't defend the actions of their direct or bother investigating for context and jump to conclusions. 

Ben Howoritz (one of our investors) says many companies struggle to translate stated cultural values into actual practice. Old Databricks used to have great alignment on culture throughout the company, but New Databricks seems to be struggling with it. 

We also just got our internal culture survey results back and our work/life balance score and compensation scores were low across much of the company.

Within my team I've heard a lot of folks complain about micromanagement and general overwork. There is a lot more discontent amongst the teams than it seems on the outside."

The company's top executives have also demonstrated that they care about their employees by providing generous compensation packages & benefits. In addition, integrity is something that the top executives will never compromise on. If something is profitable but also unethical, they will not even consider doing it, knowing that if the company does not have integrity, then nothing else matters.

Also, CEO Ali Ghodsi is an easy person to get along with. He is not the type of CEO that just sits in his office all day and orders people around. He tries to get to know people by name and says hi whenever he passes you by. It may not seem like much, but a CEO showing a friendly and calm demeanor brings positive energy to the workplace. The same can be said for CFO Dave Conte, CMO Rick Schultz, Chief Revenue Officer Ron Gabrisko, Chief People Officer Amy Reichanadter, SVP of Product David Meyer, SVP of Finance John Winkenbach, VP of Legal Scott Starbird, and co-founder Reynold Xin.","As much as I enjoyed working for the company and as much as I appreciated the experience Databricks has given me, unfortunately it has been infiltrated by people (mostly middle managers) who are more concerned with office politics than with getting work done.

I reported to a middle manager who was clearly out of his realm regarding his job duties and responsibilities. But he never listened to others and was more interested in playing office politics by blaming others, making up stories, and omitting facts to ensure that he looks good while others look worse than he already does. For example, he was inundated with the amount of work to be done and was constantly falling behind, so I offered my services to help alleviate the backlog. He declined, which caused the backlog to grow even more. But rather than asking for help or admitting he was wrong, he decided to put all the blame on everything that went wrong on my shoulders, despite the fact that I either (1) was not told that I had to do certain things or (2) that I did not have the proper access to certain systems that will allow me to do certain tasks. He also told other departments that I was not a team player and that I did not care about my job. He then issued threats while continuing to hammer down the idea that everything was my fault and nothing was his fault.

As a result of the actions of this middle manager, some employees in the other departments zeroed in on me as the culprit for some of the things that went wrong on their end. The only things that saved me from a complete ruin to my reputation at the company were the (1) several positive relationships I built with a lot of employees there, both from within my department and with other departments, (2) the fact that many executives and senior directors noticed that I demonstrated willingness to work weekends and nights to help catch up on work, and (3) the raises and the above average performance reviews from my previous managers.

Just so you know, the same kind of dirty politics that I experienced also happened to a handful of other people in other departments. They dealt with a middle manager who is more interested in playing dirty office politics than with working towards the company's goals and objectives.

With this toxic environment that I fell into, I felt that I could not work any longer in that capacity and decided to move on to my next opportunity. Life is too short to waste on working with toxic people, especially if a much better opportunity is around the corner."

- Do you enjoy feeling as if your efforts are contributing to making a change?

Databricks, bar none, is the best company I’ve ever worked for.  The work is challenging and rewarding.  The Executive team treats every employee with a level of respect I’ve not witnessed at other companies and this extends into market teams.  

Look, if you’re a “hide in the shadows” type of employee, this is not the job for you.  If you’ve been in the shadows, waiting and wanting to step into a role where you’re actively engaged, this is a place for you.  But, do not be mistaken, barrier to entry is very high.  Not hard, but high.  We don’t run you thru a gauntlet of interviewers, but realize that if you’ve got holes in your chops, sand the rough corners.  This is not like other companies, where they will fill an open requisition to expand head count.  The company is lethal when it comes to protecting their culture and it begins at the hiring process.  Don’t let that dissuade you from applying, believe me, you want to be here.  It’s that they just won’t hire anyone, there is a common thread I’ve recognized.  Every single person here, at least the ones I’ve encountered, are more than willing to stop what they’re doing and help.  They could be embedded with the most complex code they’ve ever written, deep with espresso from Sumatra and whey protein chips, and they will stop to help you.  Think about that.  The level of emotional intelligence it takes to stop what you’re  doing, not signal a molecule of irritation and genuinely want to see you succeed, by helping you.  This, in essence, is why the bar is so high for employment, to protect the culture.  

I have a tremendous amount of pride in Databricks and have a genuine appreciation for what this company has become.  It’s really the people that make.  Well, that and our platform is the best at what it does.","It takes too long to get our branded Patagonia jackets?  It’s not really a con. Frankly, I’ve got nothing when it comes to this."

In addition, the company's original 3 bets -- cloud, open source, and AI -- are paying off big time. Databricks simply has by far the best product out there for unified data science and AI and we believe the best is yet to come. There's ample room in the market for the company to grow several orders of magnitude bigger -- every successful organization will be AI-driven in the next ten years, so everyone is a potential customer -- which is why it is still as exciting and motivating to work here even after 5 years of unprecedented growth. Last, but not least, the unified analytics platform we are building is at the forefront of technology innovation, and Databricks challenges engineers to innovate in everything from distributed systems, security engineering, machine learning, and user experience.","Databricks does not tolerate ""brilliant jerks."" We've had our share of really smart engineers that had to do things ""their way or the highway."" Well, those folks took the highway.

296,Databricks,The Company to Work For,2015-11-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Filled with dense knowledge about each facet of growing a company (marketing, sales, engineering, open source, management)
- Always looking to improve and is never satisfied with just being ""good"" (employees here have a ""make-it-the-best"" mentality)
- The management really cares about each employee and how he or she is doing at all times.
- Expertise and devotion to Spark alongside Spark's growing adoption really makes it an exciting time to be here.
- Everyone at Databricks is teamwork-minded so there is a strong culture of helping each other out.
- The company itself is growing fast but at the same time, it never lowers its bar in hiring so you can expect every single person to excel in their work.","- A lot of processes (engineering, hiring, etc.) are still developing.
- Many things still go wrong (i.e. fires), but the team really takes its time to learn from each one of these to make sure that similar occurrences do not happen.
- It may not be a typical 9 to 5 job (a con for people who prefers 9 to 5)."
297,Databricks,Nepotism and cult-ish,2017-07-21,1.0,Software Engineer,Great coworkers & Apache Spark is a technology that's growing a lot.  The Spark Summits are great.  Sales organization is doing a great job,"Management in engineering is highly dysfunctional.  There is a core crew of people who are close with the founders who are highly valued, and the rest of the engineers are not.  Additionally when concerns about management are brought up they are quickly swept under the rug or you are told to shut up.

Upper management have stated that it is actually a good thing that some female and older engineers left because it is normal.  Some of the non-favored engineers are publicly humiliated in front of the entire organization by being told that they are ""not the best people"".  One particular manager has a habit of telling people they are ""childish"" or ""unprofessional"" when people disagree with him and he is protected and highly favored by all the executives.  At the same time the younger engineers puts up a facade that it is a great organization to work for because they go eat pizza together."

Smart people at every level.  Extensive internal resources. Good internal systems.  In-demand resume logo. Partnerships bring in leads.

Especially hard for opps brought by platform partners in which customer doesn't want to be ""sold"" to again. Must submit recording of yourself giving the prescribed pitch - likely multiple times, as the positioning changes quickly. Lots of data collection (meeting counts, call counts, use of systems, etc). Long-time solution architects hard to get access too unless opp is highly qualified and substantial. Newbies on their own.  Success dependent on accounts you're given.  Average sales earnings in 2019 likely substantially lower than 2018 given how many salespeople added."

I think Databricks is one of the best places to work as engineer. The engineers here are uniformly competent, hard working, and compassionate, and the cofounders who lead eng set a fantastic example. I'm happy to be a brickster!","- We're still a young company and going through some growing pains, so production fires are a bit more common than I'd like
- It tends to be a hardworking bunch (by choice, not dictum), so not ideal if you're looking for a 9-5 gig

- Everyone is motivated towards a common goal
- Plenty of opportunities to reach out to the open source community / give talks etc.
- Leadership is super tech-savvy and accessible, especially to the engineers
- People are generally super cool","- This basically becomes your life. You're expected to answer calls and fix things after hours even if you're not technically the person on-call. Engineers here talk and think about their jobs after hours, on weekends, on vacations etc. If you're not part of this almost-religious culture then you probably won't be promoted.

- Engineers are focused more on the implementation than on the user interface. We have UX people but they generally don't chime in on every single feature. Time and again I've been shocked at how frustrating it is to use our own product."

No action the executives take can diminish the impact these relationships have had on my life and happiness.","I experienced a whole host of managerial issues at Databricks, but my exit process really takes the cake.

When an exec found out I was leaving, he sent my skip level to convince me to stay. My skip level started our one-on-one by asking me why I wanted to leave. I started to say that many of the points I made in meetings and code reviews were ignored, but he interrupted me to dismiss my point as minor. He told me I could not possibly find a job as good as what I had at Databricks. He monologued for twenty minutes after my initial two sentences, concluding by calling me childish. At this point, he asked me if I had any other reasons for wanting to leave.

The remainder of this meeting cyclically replayed the first twenty minutes. I would start to answer his question, and within my first two sentences, he would cut me off to dismiss my words and call me unprofessional, unreasonable, and childish. He repeatedly emphasized that I would never be able to find anything better. He told me I was lucky to have gotten a job at such a special company. He concluded this meeting by telling me I would never be happy no matter where I went.

For the months before and weeks after this meeting, I regularly brought up my concerns (including the challenging management) to my chain of management, but nothing was ever done. Instead, this skip level has since been promoted. Nothing has improved, and nothing is likely to improve in the future. It’s a shame."

No detailed check into their history/references. This is a tight nit community in the tech industry and word gets around fast.

I have worked at other large tech companies, but I have never seen such a concentration of talent in one place.
* Compensation: one of the best in the market.
* Tech driven: all the founders are extremely technical and they understand technology from bottom to the top. Same goes for the middle management. It makes it much easier to have conversations with the management or anyone in the leadership. They understand the ground reality.
* Interesting challenges: if you like to get yourself challenged, this is the place to be.","* As the company is growing, so are the number of processes.

The customers like to work with us and we are able to contribute into their value chain. This helps us to establish a position as trusted partner.,Databricks is still learning how to build a successful consumption driven organization. This results into many changes and less stability in customer facing roles. Customers love to work with long term trusted partners in all customer facing roles.

336,Databricks,Building and Iconic company with an amazing culture,2022-02-18,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"They hire extremely well, you are surrounded by extremely smart, driven and decent people who are all in the same boat. 

The product is incredible and when you get your head around the TAM and Databricks position in the market. You will release how big and fast thing company will grow. 

Leadership is transparent and genuinely care. They are looking to build an Iconic company. Not a one trick pony.

It’s been an incredible experience so far and would recommend it to anyone. Their is a reason staff attrition is so low. Incredible company.","This is a complicated software sale and alot of products to learn. The ramp period takes time and is nerve racking. There is a lot of support and you are not alone during this period but it’s worth understanding.

It’s unlikely you will experience growth like this again in your career. With growth comes change and a lot of it. This is unnatural for most people and takes time to adapt too. You will be 6 months in and classed as experienced.  (I still struggle with this)

We are moving extremely quickly, the intensity is crazy. Fora lot of people it is too much.  The leadership are very good at finding the right people so trust that if you get through the process you will be successful if you work hard and are really brought into the mission but the intensity of the company is crazy. 

I personally don’t think these are cons as it’s part of the excitement of the company and the journey but you really need to buy into the vision and the potential of this company as it’s current trajectory is phenomenal which leads to the problems above. 

It’s not an easy ride and you need a lot of Grit, Empathy and desire. It’s not an easy way to make money or a quick win. Its for people who are. Determined, want to build and want to walk away being apart of something bigger than themselves. Not for hero’s or looking for an easy ride."

For example, I saw rudeness/aggression/intimidation to databricks customer partners and nothing was done about it. There was also bullying from Sales Leads (AE's) and not only will you get no support, but you will be blamed for any issues.

Working here affected my mental health badly - the manipulation and narrative particular protected people strung was infuriating.

So Why it's a very nice place to work ? 

- Onboarding is very cadenced and you have all the support you need (Sales Perf team, Mentor, colleagues, execs call...) during this phase. Content is very interesting, not too difficult to understand and the way to present it make it easier to learn in the most efficient way. You get sharp feedback 

- Culture is fantastic and you really feel it with the people you talk to in the organisation. All aligned on the same basis and make it easier to execute our vision, collaborate... Colleagues are available for help in any request/question 

- Vision & Technology : UNIQUE in the market, that really fit with clients pains. (Each time I talk to clients, I only get really positive feedbacks on our products and vision)

- People : HR and people department are really focus on employee wellbeing (for real, it's not only words) many initiatives across the organisation to make DB the best place to work. Managers are very smarts and keen to HELP on any challenges. 

Many pros on my side but what I like the most is the ability of the company to react on any issue/change/event in the market. That makes us really agile to face new challenges ahead.

You're given the autonomy to shape and drive your own success and the support to make some mistakes along the way. Most people will learn a lot in a short space of time and it can really springboard your career forward. 

The company and the leadership teams are conscious that a positive culture is really important to productivity and everyone's enjoyment of their time here but as a company grows it inevitably does start to change and I think we're at a transition point right now from fun startup to more serious player.","There's a lot of pressure on a fairly regular basis so if you're looking for somewhere to coast this isn't the spot for you. You'll be expected to give everything you have and a little extra as the business really wants to establish itself as the key player in the space. This means you'll be held accountable for owning your part of that success, that visibility isn't for everyone.

With more layers of management, there does come a little reduction in the level of transparency of vision that the lower layers see but no different from any company at this size.

In short, if you can deal with the pressure and you want a high pace, rapid growth and very technical environment this is probably for you."

2. Supportive management
3. Flexible work environment
4. Paychecks!",Challenging work environment. If you think you want to do 9-5 job and continue life with same work pattern then this is not the company for you.
461,Databricks,Cons outweighs the pros,2021-01-16,2.0,Account Executive,"Databricks is a great way to learn and grow your career. In Sales, management will provide you with the tools and advice (if asked) to help you reach your goals. They don't do this just to throw you to the wolves. They do this because having you do things yourself is the best way to grow individually.

Top management, including CEO Ali and CRO Ron are great people to work with who engage in professional behavior at all times. They can be demanding, but they will never belittle you to the point that you feel small or worthless.

Finally, at least before the pandemic, Databricks provides catered lunches, Friday afternoon happy hours, and every once in a while mid-week happy hours. They do this to foster camaraderie among employees and to encourage teamwork. They also do this to reward the hard work every individual does for the company.","Databricks prides itself in having a cooperative culture to foster teamwork. However there are several individuals such as a few sales managers, a few of the employees in finance, one of the IT heads, and one of the officers who do not engage in such behavior and this list is steadily growing. This leads to blame culture that while not prevalent throughout the company, it is steadily growing. Blame culture will result in lack of accountability, lack of incentive to plan ahead, and employees who are unhappy.

I saw this blaming myself when I saw one of the customer success people visibly upset after having a meeting with a person in finance, who I think is the director of order management. Apparently this individual berated him unprofessionally and blamed him for every setback that occurred. I learned about this finance person's past work history and through a contact, found out that he was terminated after 3 months from his last job due to unprofessional behavior. Databricks should be on the lookout from hiring people with a shady work history.

I also saw one of my fellow account executives get terminated due to workplace politics. He had a simple disagreement with his sales director over how to handle a difficult customer. Note that he didn't give any freebies away to the customer nor did he promise anything that he couldn't deliver. He was right at the end, but the sales director terminated him anyway and took credit for his account despite him meeting his quota every quarter and every year. This is when I began to have a sour taste in my mouth regarding the company.

Another issue is the lack of a work life balance. I understand the need to put in the extra hours every now and then to reach company goals and objectives. But towards the end I felt like the work life balance that Databricks claims they want its employees to have has been changed to just a work life. This will result in people burning out quicker and being unhappy. Towards the end of my time there, I felt that my fellow account executives and myself were required to put in 70-80 hr work weeks. I have 2 kids to take care of and cannot continue putting in such demanding hours."

475,Databricks,Amazing interview experience,2020-12-14,5.0,Solutions Architect,"A great place to work at. The company is growing very fast.

476,Databricks,Working at Databricks,2020-08-19,5.0,Customer Success Engineer,"1. The working culture here is amazing such that it makes the employees think that it is they are contribution much towards their own company.
2. You are surrounded with Tech geniuses. The hiring bar for Databricks is high and all you are surrounded with is people with strong technical skills who are always ready to help you. 
3. The company has got many benefits for the employees, both tangible and intangible ones.
4. The company has a rocket speed growth. I can foresee a great future ahead.
5. If you want to be in a place where the work is so dynamic and things move around in a way faster pace, this is going to be it. So many people from the tech giants have joined here because of the way life and the product we are developing is.
6. The compensation is awesome, and any employee upon joining will be awarded with Company's restricted stocks which is of a great value.
One Liner - ""Databricks just rocks and I am very happy to be working here which feels like I am working on my own product"". Wish all the success to it.","I do not have as many cons, but I can list down a very few which I personally but it is not always persistent.
1. Your work-life balance takes a toll. But this does not happen always, just a few times when and ever really needed.
2. If you are someone who would want to relax at work and spend your day at work with minimum efforts, this is not at all it.
3. You might see some changes with org as you work. But this is just for the fact that the company is growing and the changes tend to happen."

The company is doing well financially, sales of product are strong
Theres enough rah rah to attract good people, but I'm sure many won't be able to put up with the mess inside for long...","Basically everything else.

Databricks is trying to grow up without a plan of how to do so well, and it's an extremely painful process to be a part of. The CEO still insists on being deeply involved in every decision no matter how minuscule which equates to disempowering any other employee below him (that means everyone).

Change initiatives are so incredibly slow and often derailed at the 11th hour bc of some nit picky detail from the CEO or CFO demands even though its outside of their domain, clearly they don't trust anyone else to be the experts which makes everyone else basicaly minions to what is being dictated to them. Why hire senior people and pay them tons of cash if you don't trust them to do their job? Also, any of the teams outside of Eng and Sales are so understaffed (yet expectations/OKRs etc are not created to consider that) and so therefore teams are set-up to fail.

There are no career paths, no recognition unless you're in engineering and pretty poor benefits if you're not employed in the US. Sorry non-US people, you'll be forgotten and HQ can easily look away so they don't actually have to address the problems. I don't really think they know how and won't admit it so you'll either be told for years that ""it's being worked on"" with no result or your problems will be completely dismissed bc the US has no empathy for international teams.

Also, expect to get meeting invites in the middle of the night, for hiring so many smart people, not sure why they forget about a thing called time zones..."

Firstly, I have to compliment the hiring team on a very organised, and rapid recruitment process. During the interview process, I very quickly noticed the genuine and professional nature of the hiring team, which reflects what I've seen of the whole company so far. I was also lucky enough to attend Sales Kick off in my first week, and this was the best kick off I've attended in my 18 year career! The energy, transparency, and level of achievement was amazing. This company is rapidly growing. I was also impressed by the way large partners acknowledged the importance of Databricks to their business.  I left Kick off feeling so inspired and full of energy, which is the way it should be!",I genuinely can't think of any cons.
483,Databricks,"The Most Toxic Company I Have Worked For, Avoid this company",2020-07-26,1.0,Account Executive,"Strong cloud native technology that solves some key business challenges
Competition closing gap quickly.","Databricks is by far the worst company that I have ever worked for. The culture is toxic in every way. You spend more time justifying your existence in endless management reviews, than working to deliver value to customers and technology partners. 

There is no work life balance to the constant micromanagement from the in-country leadership team, who offer no positive input to customer engagements, and have little interest in up lifting or supporting their team. 

The same can be said for more experienced and tenured Solution Architects, who are very difficult to work with, and treat their colleagues with contempt. I would not recommend this company for anyone who is looking for a collaborative, positive and supportive workplace."

Rapidly-scaling company, great product, brilliant co-workers, and an executive team that really cares about culture. I'm learning how to be a better product manager every day.

For the record, I have never worked anywhere where hiring the right people is more important (notice how I didn't say ""the best"" - Databricks has a strict ""no brilliant jerks"" policy).",We are growing so fast that office space (e.g. meeting rooms) is a bit tight.
