0,DocuSign,Awesome Company,2022-03-26,5.0,Account Executive,"Big upside for pay, great benefits, very cool product, very good company culture",A LOT to learn in order to succeed
1,DocuSign,Treated so well!,2022-04-01,5.0,Strategic Account Manager,DocuSign has been amazing to my career and my family!,Lots of turnover on the sales team right now.
2,DocuSign,The golden days are over,2022-02-20,4.0,Account Executive,"DocuSign is a great company. They treat their employees well, offer great benefits, stock options, mental health days, and are undoubtably the best product in the market.","Now is not the time to work in sales. Quotas are rising, territories are getting split in two year, seemingly year over year, and attainment is at an all-time low. DocuSign performed extremely well in the pandemic. However, continuing that growth at that rate was not realistic. Stock options are worth 40% of what they were due to management's inability to forecast our numbers.

The commercial org is really strugglingly across the board. OTEs are already incredibly low for market standards - and no one is hitting quota. 1/26 reps in the commercial FinServ org hit quota in Q4 (across all segments). People are unhappy and are really starting to look elsewhere. I worked at DocuSign for two years. Year one, virtually no turnover. In the past 6 months, there has been a ton (and many more are on the way out.)

There is no training program for sales. If this is your first sales job, it's sink or swim.

Our CEO told the company all-hands everyone would be getting raises. In the next call, our CRO specified - ""everyone but sales"". This really set the sales team off. The MDRS got raises, but the AEs and sales managers did not.

A relatively high performing MDR is out earning a commerical AE. Because of this, many MDRs don't even want to get promoted to AE - it's virtually a pay-cut if you're not an allstar AE."
3,DocuSign,Growing pains to the max,2022-03-29,5.0,Market Development Representative,"Pay, benefits, 401k, flexible schedule. Lower KPIs than other SDR roles. Management and people are nice. Options for promotion don’t have to be sales either.","It is so luck based. Meaning, if you have a good account team- they will tag you on opps, value it at best case scenario, and help you in right direction. If you have team members who don’t care or are unfilled, good luck. Management is constantly changing books. And people are quitting so you get teams changed often or just don’t have account team at all. Not an equal playing field- install is waaaay easier than newco. Same with smb vs enterprise. They adjusted quotas bc popularity during pandemic but haven’t readjusted now that almost all businesses have e sig. Going to burn through people real fast if they can’t get it together."
4,DocuSign,Upward movement is unlike anywhere else,2022-03-19,5.0,Sales Manager,"Honestly I've never been at a company where you can move up so quickly. I see promotions constantly and love seeing them utilize the talent we have internally. I've been at Docusgin for 16 months and just accepted my promotion to Regional Vice President. About 25 MDRs get promoted PER QUARTER, thats insane. 
The culture is great, everyone is so helpful and its just not a sleazy aggressive sales culture. We want to win but it's not cut throat where winning is put ahead of employee satisfaction.
I just love it. I've worked at a lot of tech companies, some really great ones too but this one by far is the most exciting in terms of career growth and just feeling good.","Coming off covid we do have some growing pains. We took off and trying to figure out quotas etc afterwards has been hard but we've adjusted if quotas were too high which is great to see. 
We're remote right now but I will say... when we go back to the office not serving lunch is pretty unheard of nowadays.... also we dont have Docusign backpacks lol seems small but those are my only complaints"
5,DocuSign,"One trick pony, slow to change",2022-03-08,4.0,Account Executive,"Higher level leadership is inspiring and professional
Amazing professional development for MDRs/SDRs when I was there (Sandler Training)
Great company to have on your resume","Lower Level leadership was the reason I left. There are rules in place where it is almost impossible to change teams. You have to be in seat for at least 1 year in order to be eligible for a team change, role change, department change. If you have a terrible manager that makes you miserable everyday, chances are you won't put up with that for a year+. My manager would mosey in to the office at 10am (after the rest of us got in at 7am) and when I asked him questions he would talk in circles and had no answers. And even when he admitted to not knowing the answer that I / the whole team was asking, he made zero effort to find the answer from other teams / departments... I was not learning and felt like I was not being heard. We all brought good ideas to the table and our manager never followed through on anything. at DocuSign, some people get promoted in to management and are near impossible to fire... so they just coast there in sub-par mediocrity."
6,DocuSign,"Love this company, great people & great opportunity",2022-03-01,5.0,Account Executive,"* Great people, can't say that enough. Many of my friends are current or former employees 
* Great product, customers love DocuSign and the solutions we provide have proven success in the market
* Quotas are very attainable, although that varies somewhat in opinion depending on the vertical and how external, pandemic factors are impacting the industry","* Promotion tracks are unsteady, pandemic has a huge role in that but for my part 2020 threw my career path for a loop, and DocuSign didn't amend their requirements to accommodate those factors
* Sales Management is fluid, especially after our Q3 results. Lots of organizational changes to find the right fit for success"
7,DocuSign,Absolute Disaster,2022-03-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A few good gems in an otherwise empty crater of a company,"There is zero company strategy from top to bottom. Leadership cannot articulate where the company is going or what the goals are. One week its ""partners"" the next week its ""acquire customers at all cost"" and then ""we need to be margin conscious"" and zero strategy on HOW to achieve those goals.

People who have been here 5+ years have climbed the ranks by managing up and taking credit for others work and pointing fingers when things go wrong, rather than actually supporting their teams and accomplishing anything. Hard work and execution are not rewarded.

The company under pays, does not provide good stock bonuses, and overworks the very few folks who are actually holding this place together with scotch tape."
8,DocuSign,Great company who cares about their employees,2022-03-28,5.0,Adoption Consultant,"Since being at DocuSign, I have yet to have a manager who didn’t make an effort to make me feel heard and appreciated. Through the benefits and the culture that’s been created, DocuSign has been an amazing place to work over the last 4.5 years","Although this isn’t uncommon with growing companies, it does feel like things are constantly changing."
9,DocuSign,The Exodus Has Begin,2022-02-17,4.0,Account Executive,"DocuSign is a great product that sells itself, we lead the market and can easily beat in any competitive situation. 

People are high quality, most of my friends i've met at DocuSign","I have been at DocuSign for a half decade and have never seen such a large exodus of talent. We missed hard H2 and management has decided to blame the salesforce instead of correcting their strategy. 

I have yet to talk to a single peer who is not actively looking for a new job. Our compensation was always a bit below market, now with teams averaging below 50% attainment and the market being red hot it no longer makes sense for people to stay.

We don't need more ""agreement cloud"" or sales training, we need an attainable quota and a salary that allows us to justify staying."
10,DocuSign,"Great Company, Some Growing Pains",2022-01-13,5.0,Market Development Representative (MDR),"-Great people
-Great management
-Great leaders
-PTO is fantastic

I love working here and being encouraged to have a work/life balance and it's meant truthfully from the company. I also love that from a position of MDR, I have the opportunity to go anywhere within the org from here - there is no hard set sales track that demands me to become and AE. I feel truly respected and am encouraged to do ""the work of my life"" and have the support to do such!","There seems to be a little bit of growing pain...I am in the sales org and I feel like there is a tiny bit of disorganization as it relates to committing to tech that will benefit and arm the teams. 

I also feel like there could be a more robust vertical-specific training program."
11,DocuSign,Great company,2022-03-31,5.0,GTM Strategy,Takes care of their employees,collaboration could be improved. stock hasnt done too well post covid
12,DocuSign,Great place to work,2022-03-23,5.0,Product Manager,"Culture is great. Employees build each other up in knowledge sharing for example, with the right attitudes. Leadership is open, responsive and acts on feedback.","More frequent organizational changes. Significant growth during the pandemic, challenge fostering the culture with remote work."
13,DocuSign,Great Company to Work For,2022-03-13,5.0,Manager,This company really took care of employees during the pandemic. The thoughtful way that senior leaders approached a difficult time was sincerely appreciated. The overall benefits package is strong and there are a lot of smart and dedicated people around you.,Work/life balance can be a challenge depending on role. The company has grown a lot and there are always growing pains.
14,DocuSign,Appalled at the treatment of employees- Get it together.,2022-02-10,1.0,Account Executive,Learned about technology and learned I will never let a company burn me out like that again,"Not sure where to even start. DocuSign is not a normal tech environment. It is stale, white and rigid. 

- Quota goals are absurd and unattainable- you are setting your teams up for failure and burnout 
- CEO is untruthful in his promises to employees- makes us feel needy for asking to be heard
- People getting promoted only to make less money
- Upgrade from web department is a complete disaster
- AE's and MDR's having horrible relationship with each other due to the fact that management tells them completely different goals to focus on
- SEQUENCING EMAILS DOES NOTHING- just creates lazy reps who burn their books of business and have no idea how to actually build on their sales skills
- People having mental breakdowns constantly or speaking to others with a complete lack of respect/ boundaries"
15,DocuSign,Toxic leadership in the C suite,2022-03-17,1.0,Program Manager,"I really can’t think of any, I suppose that since everyone is so unprofessional that you can also be unprofessional and it doesn’t matter","They say crap rolls down hill. This could not be more true at DocuSign. The boots on the ground or senior directors and below are all great people, but they are led by a cult-like, toxic, and politically motivated c suite. Daring your employees to find a better place to work, during the great resignation, might be the most short sited thing I’ve ever experienced."
16,DocuSign,Just another large tech company unaware of issues,2022-01-06,3.0,Account Executive,"Best product in the eSignature marketplace / excellent for enterprise customers with larger IT, legal and compliance groups. 

CLM platform has fallen way behind - many niche / category specific players now winning business at lower rates","DocuSign subscriptions are expensive / most expensive in the market. 

Most SMB & Mid Market purchase online - as a seller upgrading them to commercial plans is very challenging. It is all on the seller - there is no messaging coming from company about any required upgrade or rules enforcement. Usage compliance is an open ended loophole with many accounts in need of upgrade. Company does not enforce or usage limit T's & C's. 

SFDC is a mess, not a fun system to learn or work within. 

BDR Team not performing / over-leverages Outreach to spam large pools of prospects"
17,DocuSign,Awesome Company,2022-03-26,5.0,Account Executive,"Big upside for pay, great benefits, very cool product, very good company culture",A LOT to learn in order to succeed
18,DocuSign,Entry Level,2022-03-21,3.0,Sales Development Representative,"The pay is competitive (hourly, can clock overtime) and there is the opportunity to make a lot of money (commission) Great benefits and 20 PTO days which is really nice.",Hard to communicate with coworkers and managers. a lot of Cliquey groups. Coming from a non sales background I found that unless you are an allstar employee most people will look over you. My training was reduced from 10 days to 3 days and when I asked multiple mangers I wasn't given an answer.
19,DocuSign,Great place to work,2022-03-22,5.0,Market Development Representative (MDR),"Fun environment, non linear promotions available",Growth structure in sales is highly competitive and a bit back logged with highly qualified internal candidates (they recruit great talent).
20,DocuSign,Best company I've ever worked for,2022-02-03,5.0,Lead Software Engineer,"People, culture, opportunities and overall benefits are really good.","As an engineer, my only frustration is with the antiquated build dev tools. It's a byproduct of growing fast and now giving this space enough attention. It's a priority and I'm optimistic is will improve."
21,DocuSign,Amazing culture and benefits,2022-02-08,5.0,Market Development Representative (MDR),"Company culture is amazing. The company makes sure you are taking care of your mental health, gives you ample time off, breaks, vacations, weekly meetings and check ins, etc to make sure you are taken care of as a person. 

We are given RSU's of $20k
Health and wellness benefits of $600 per year to spend
Fully paid Medical dental vision
Fertility benefits 
Family time off in addition to FMLA 
Team and vertical support
Management seems to listen to majority of concerns to address them 
Work from home life balance","Quotas are high
Books get moved around after they've been burned with little ability to contact those companies 
Territories can be tough to work"
22,DocuSign,Work of your life!,2022-01-24,5.0,"Senior Manager, Market Development Representative","There are many reasons to work at DocuSign, but most importantly I feel a strong sense of inclusion and investment in my overall wellbeing. DocuSign offers great benefits, the people are great, and there is room for upward mobility. One of the company's mottos is to ""do the work of your life"" and there are many programs available to support that mission.","With any high-growth company, there will be some growing pains. Scaling from a single-product to a multi-product company has prevented some challenges with the go-to-market strategy. Additionally, the stock price has been volatile post-pandemic."
23,DocuSign,Stay Away!,2022-03-29,1.0,Account Executive,"Great benefits including health care monthly premiums being covered, internet/phone reimbursement, gym in office, WFH.","DocuSign is literally five times as expensive as their main competitor, Adobe. It is impossible to hit quota and I have now watched 11 of my colleagues leave over the last couple of months. I’ve never seen such a high attrition rate in my life."
24,DocuSign,Incompetence,2022-02-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Decent money, at least before the stock price plummeted. Good benefits. ESPP, 401k, all that typical stuff.","Never have I worked with so many incompetent engineers. The CLM OPS team is incredibly understaffed and incompetent. No one attempts to improve the platform, they simply put in a band-aid or reboot a box and move on. Constant failures and no high-level architectural vision. Not enough time dedicated to improving the developer experience. Product team does not have an aligned vision on what we should be building, and it ends up changing multiple times throughout the year anyway, leading to decreased morale and confusion. DocuSign is basically a decade behind modern engineering practices. A true failure of an organization."
25,DocuSign,Great Company,2022-03-21,5.0,Partner Development Manager,"Stock
Benefits
Collaboration
Company culture
Great Software Sales Experience","Competitive pay
Internal red tape for promotion paths"
26,DocuSign,Disastrously dysfunctional Legal Group,2022-02-06,1.0,Senior Legal Counsel,Most people are pretty good to work with.,"The Legal Department is an abject disaster. Other departments seemed to have a much healthier outlook, but I'm only commenting on Legal. Wow, where do I even begin?

1. The leadership at the top is the main cause. Fear pervades the entire department. The folks at the lower end of the org chart are ""fungible"". That's in quotes because that's what someone in leadership often said about her department. 
2. People are let go for no reason. People are let go because they refuse to work two jobs and only get paid for one. And when those people are let go, they are screwed over in multiple ways. I know someone who was let go mere weeks before stock vesting and bonuses. During COVID. Cruel.
3. People leave in droves. Mostly because of these reasons. They're always hiring NOT because the Legal department is growing -- it in fact shrunk slightly while the rest of the company was booming! -- but because they keep losing great people. This has continued into 2022. It's pathetic, really, the amount of turnover such a ""sexy"" company has in their legal department."
27,DocuSign,Great Company - Horribly Underpaid,2022-02-14,3.0,Account Executive,"Product is great. 
Dan Springer is an amazing CEO who truly cares for the company and it's employees. 
Great colleagues. 
Decent Benefits.","Incredibly difficult to get promoted - internal HR process to move forward is restrictive. 
You're under-paid, and when pay increases were brought up the head of HR mentioned that inflation was not a reason for them to increase pay.
People are leaving the sales organization in mass because of all of this.
Recruiters aren't honest about their offers."
28,DocuSign,MDR,2022-03-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great management and fair goals,No 401k at the time but now they match
29,DocuSign,Many changes going on.,2022-03-16,3.0,Account Executive,"Good benefits for health care and wellness fitness. 
Great brand recognition. 
Product is pretty good and reliable.","Attrition. Many AEs are leaving for other companies where they have a more realistic chance of making good money. 
Front-line managers aren't properly trained.
You'll need to be in the same role for 1 year before you are eligible to apply for another role (to another team or promotion)."
30,DocuSign,It depends....,2022-02-18,2.0,Solutions Architect,Good Benefits and generally a good place to work.  Fair compensation and room for growth,"Too many silos and not enough synergy between cross-functional teams.  
Too much of a woke company.   Many wasteful hours and energy is spent on unnecessary woke courses when should be focused on working on technology that clients love.  
I recall one time we were forced to take a personality test, and an ""Ally"" course in which the instructor literally said white men take up more space in the room than any other rave.  welcome to inclusivity.  It was an awful experience and I'm not even white.  
wake up DocuSign"

35,DocuSign,Great Place To Work,2022-03-08,5.0,Account Executive,Amazing culture. Great people to learn and grow from. Couldn't talk enough about the benefits DocuSign offers to their employees.,Aggressive sale goals. Perhaps wages are smaller than other companies.
36,DocuSign,"Amazing Perks, Great Culture",2022-03-12,5.0,Market Development Manager,"Overall, love the team here. Fantastic benefits, and the people are great.",More direction on back to office.

- Needs to bite the bullet and invest in some internal initiatives to speed growth and catch up to bigger companies like Salesforce"

43,DocuSign,Best Culture I have ever worked at. CEO is amazing,2022-01-12,5.0,Account Director,Dan Springer is the best CEO I have worked under in my 30 years. He is transparent and a great leader. It is refreshing to work for a place that truly cares about their employees. I have been here over 6 months and could not be happier with my decision. the clients love the product. The leadership is supportive and amazing. DocuSign Impact program (Charity) is incredible. If you are thinking of coming here.. do it!,Its a tough year with the stock drop. I find that some people do not realize the gem of a company this is. We are still growing and have great leadership!
44,DocuSign,I love this Company,2022-01-27,5.0,Market Development Representative,"Truly the best company I have ever had the pleasure of working for. Every employee is extremely supportive, friendly, inviting, and helpful. I have never felt so much team collaboration when working in a sales organization. I would recommend DocuSign to anyone! Company culture continues to prove how much employees are valued at DocuSign and that every one's voice matters and is heard. From the day I met with the recruiting team to now being here for over 2 years I could not be happier with my time with this company.",I have no cons with working for DocuSign
45,DocuSign,Awesome company to work for,2021-09-13,5.0,Enterprise Market Development Representative,"I've been at DocuSign for just over 6 months now and can honestly say they are an incredible company. From the start, the training program was great (even the virtual version I attended) and they really set up their MDRs to succeed. The level of attention paid to putting their MDRs in the best possible position was refreshing - I haven't worked for anyone that cares as much about their employees. My manager is also amazing - best manager I've ever had. He has his employees' backs to the bitter end and will always go to bat for us. The company cares about health and wellbeing - mental health days and company shut down days are relatively frequent. Benefits are INCREDIBLE, pay is as good as you'd expect. The ethos of camaraderie and friendly competition allows great relationship building and lots of drive to be your best self. EVERYONE is open and willing to help at a moment's notice. 10/10","Since DocuSign is fairly well-established, there's limited room for flexibility in terms of running your own piece of the business - despite this, efforts are made to allow as much flexibility as possible. 

Promotions are time-based rather than solely merit-based, which can be frustrating if you're outperforming your peers and they're getting promoted ahead of you.

Commission cap at 300% is a pain, but allows more than enough room to make some good money."

Leadership cares about every individual, respects opinions and takes care of you when you get into troubles like health issues etc.

Benefits are 100% covered and even co-pays, I'm diagnosed with Crohn's and I'm been treated by Shutter health and Stanford for the past 2 years.. many visits and haven't paid 3 digits yet.

Amazing product! Obsessed with the sign product and truly think its changing the world. Promotes female leadership. Excellent room for growth if successful.","Growing pains when it comes to creating scalable processes, training/enablement is weak - very self guided/management led which stretches the management thin, comp is lower than the average in Saas/limitations in raises outside of equity.

Generous time off, week off for Christmas
If you joined pre IPO solid stocks you own now","Many roles do not get annual increases, while other (product) get them along with large RSU bumps. Inflation doesn't matter you may not get a raise. Many departments such as the renewal management team have limited opportunities for growth. Outlook for RMs? The role will most likely be gone in a year or two. The surveys about continuing work from home that are mentioned in the replies by DocuSign - this was a survey we all took over s year ago that keeps getting quoted., Many of us changed our.minds since then 
Most of us don't want to come back to the office on regular basis.
Sales teams are often left by new managers, without any management experience resulting in uneducated teams that are not good at their jobs."

- I just transferred internally and that's supported, which helps you continue to grow your career and keep things fresh.

- There's a bunch of growth avenues for the company - international, new product categories, etc. that DocuSign is super well positioned to win and continue to grow.","- High growth, so things are always changing - that's good but also bad, meaning there's consistent reorgs and changes that make longer term planning a bit hard and sometimes what you've done doesn't get used because there's a big shift right as you come out with a new enablement/asset for example."

A lot of politics and alliances amongst senior leadership that is not good for the lower dogs. Many higher folks such as directors and senior directors need manager training - the way that bully behavior has been encouraged is difficult to see.

72,DocuSign,Growing Pains,2021-10-10,5.0,Account Executive,"Customers love the product, opportunity for growth, supportive front line management willing to hop on your customer calls, great benefits.",2021 quotas are unrealistic and seem to be built on the expectation that the peak demand we saw at the start of COVID would continue. Morale is low in my segment...hard to stay motivated when only a handful of reps are hitting quota and that’s mostly by one or two lucky deals. Stock grants are lower for promotion and hitting annual targets than they used to be. That’s to be expected now that we are a large public company but salary needs to be increased so total compensation is still competitive in the market. All that said...DocuSign is still a great company and I’m hopeful quotas and/or salary will be adjusted next year to make it financially feasible to stay at the company.

92,DocuSign,"Good place to work, with caveats",2022-01-12,4.0,Product Manager,"- CEO is very open, candid, not aggressive (hard to find), and honest. He seems to be honestly listening to employees.
- Benefits are good, on par with or perhaps above what you'd expect from a SaaS company (even when the leadership thinks they are doing a lot). Shout out for providing the ability to put money on a post-tax 401k - this is huge, and very uncommon these days. At the end of day, we are just employees, living off a paycheck, who will need to save as much as we can to survive in the future.
- The main product (eSignature) works well, and solves real-life challenges, which is rewarding when speaking with customers.
- People are very nice in general.
- I acknowledge it must be hard to manage a company with thousands of employees. So, in any case, the effort is very much appreciated.","- Products other than eSignature do not work well, have a poor user experience, are hard to integrate, and take months to be ready to use. All of this makes selling those products very hard, and make a lot of people wonder if past acquisitions were a good move. 
- HR is very conservative and puts the company first (falls on the side of managers, does not look at cost of living (hot topic) from the perspective of employees, reduces salaries if employees moves to another state (hot hot topic), and more).
- Top commercial executives (COO, Sales) that took the company through IPO might not be the best suited to take the company to the next level. Last big quarterly miss, and lack of attention by those execs about it, might be an indication of it.
- There is a blatant lack of creativity/vision with regards to the future of the product(s). Lack of vision causes a very tactical product roadmap, which will come back biting the company in the next few years.
- Data mining is an incredible mess, providing data that one cannot trust, and I don't understand how the organization has not fixed this.
- The top product executive is uninspiring, and has been bringing a lot of middle-class, uninspiring executives. This concerns me as it is gonna affect the overall culture of the organization (too many Indian execs who lack, culturally, empathy and understanding of others - Note: just bringing more Indian executives does not make the company more ""inclusive"" or ""diverse"", and can have the opposite impact in the overall culture).
- Leaders leaving has taken away a lot of knowledge, which has not been replaced with equally talented and knowledgeable people.
- Top managers (Senior Director and above) becoming increasingly political."

102,DocuSign,Working large accounts but selling SMB deals,2022-01-17,2.0,Sales Representative,DocuSign is the best of the best when it comes to eSignature. No one does it better with more integration points. Work from anywhere mentality. Uncapped commissions.,"They do not learn from their mistakes. Each year either the install teams or newco teams have a fantastic year, while the other suffers. Each new fiscal they change it up so the group that failed does better and the group that had success now fails. No one knows what they are doing when it comes to building out territories, verticals and quotas. They do not take into account any ideas from the frontline sales teams or their leadership. There are so many accounts with web plans and it's almost impossible to get them to spend more with a corporate plan when it's the exact same functionality. Deal sizes are very small and its impossible to hit quotas in newco. Very much a micromanagement style from leadership. There is no strategy put in place and there is far too much middle management. You will definitely not be ""doing the work of your life"" at DocuSign. If anything, you will be selling some of the smallest transactional deals in your career, with no possibility for promotion because goals are unattainable. It's all about the race to $5B in revenue and they do not care what they have to do to get there. Idea sharing is also frowned upon. It could be a great idea with a strategy to accomplish and you are told to get in line with the corporate vision or you are viewed as a ""complainer"". This goes for ways to improve sales, strategy to break into larger accounts, ideas on internal processes, leadership reviews, etc."

Is it a perfect company? No. Is this the most fulfilling and work life balanced job I've ever had? Yes. 

The company cares, all employee reviews and feedback are read by upper management and addressed at upcoming all hands meetings. Frequent team meetings and 1:1s keep things collaborate even through remote working. Generous tech stipends allowed for comfortable working even from home. 

I feel supported, and it makes me sad to read reviews of those who do not.","pains associated with hypergrowth, such as too much priority put on external hires and not internal promotions for folks deserving"

110,DocuSign,"Yes, you ARE missing out",2021-10-27,5.0,Director Engineering,"- I've worked at two other major software engineering companies and DocuSign has the best overall culture by far - the kind of people who work here, the values, the mission, the commitment to give back
- We have a cohesive product strategy and we are making smart acquisitions
- We have reliable technology and a trust-worthy culture - we work hard to be and remain compliant with many industry and governmental standards - Customers who use DocuSign trust us to meet our commitments and we do that every day
- The benefits are as good as the other two large companies where I have worked. Of course we don't have as big pockets as Big Tech however our compensation is very competitive; we have incentives and the company is performing very well right now!
- What I have stated year after year in my reviews here is that DocuSign hires the best people for each job in a thoughtful way - the people here are just plain nice - there aren't any a**holes here (well, nobody's perfect) - I continue to be very impressed at the quality of our hiring - even in a competitive market we continue to set the hiring bar very high and are bringing in excellent qualified talented people - it is such a pleasure to be surrounded by good people who are good at what they do - and good people who are kind, curious and motivated.
- I feel good about working here - our commitment to environmental sustainability - giving back - support for diversity and social justice - our adoption of Juneteenth as a corporate holiday says a lot about what we believe in
- The company is doing a great job in managing the transition to a hybrid remote local work culture. The company is making remote work as satisfying and as fulfilling and successful as possible - our company is well suited to remote work.","- we're not Amazon, Facebook or Google. But we don't chase after those things.
- I'd like to see more promotions happening. Our current job opportunities are excellent and fulfilling but I wonder about long-term upward mobility here at the company
- I'd like to see the company doing even more to reach out to diverse sources of candidates
- of course there are challenges in the transition from a start-up culture to a large-mid-sized company, however our management is doing a great job at filling in the gaps and strengthening our maturity in key areas"

After being overworked, overlooked, and feeling I had no option but to resign, I expressed my disappointment with the experience, hoping to leave my department better than I found it, he began to give me previously undisclosed supposedly negative feedback. It was retaliatory, disingenuous and shocking behavior. I had received nothing but positive feedback during my tenure.

121,DocuSign,DocuSign sold me a lie,2021-12-04,2.0,Market Development Representative,"Benefits, good culture (on the surface), great coworkers who are kind and helpful","I know these negative reviews get buried, but hopefully future sales employees (and management) will see this. Your success at DocuSign depends entirely on what team you wind up on. In my interview for my role, they told me over 90% of MDRs make quota. On some teams, absolutely. On MY team, about 40% of people make quota. It’s a big problem when you’re in the award meetings and some other teams are consistently hitting 200% of their team quota and your team is hitting 55% of your team quota. How is that fair? And now there will definitely not be a quota adjustment given last quarter’s abysmal earnings, so our team either has to suffer through and work harder to drive sales that just aren’t there or quit. 

Future sales employees at DocuSign please be warned. I wish I would’ve known the truth. This is an incredibly stressful environment and in order to try to get close to my impossible quota, I’m working 11-12 hour days plus one weekend day. The people who are hitting quota on my team are doing the same exact thing as I am. It is normalized on my team to be working these crazy hours (and we aren’t getting overtime pay for it because management says we are supposed to be able to do our job in our 8-hour work day). Also, nobody on my team is actually ever able to take lunch away from their desk, just something to note.

DocuSign has given us a week off in December. That is great, but how are we supposed to hit our quota losing 1/4 of the month plus all of our prospects being out of office for that week plus a few days too? No one on my team is planning on hitting quota in December because that quota is already too high + this week off will make it impossible. If they wanted to make us lose 25% of selling days in December, they should’ve adjusted quota down by 25% (not the measly 10% they did).

On the surface, everything is fine. The benefits are good, everyone is super nice, but management is ineffective and quotas for certain teams are impossible. The product is too expensive and that post Covid demand isn’t what it once was. I think employee discontentment on the sales teams will only rise in the coming months. Management, please do something."

125,DocuSign,Great Company with some serious department level pains,2021-12-16,3.0,Account Executive,"- Supporting Public Sector during 2020, a huge year of digital transformation was an exciting and sometimes rewarding growth opportunity.

- ""Enterprise Corporate Sales"" is an overlay roll supporting the Enterprise Field Rep's territory. As both a pro and con, I worked with a specific few amazing senior sales-folk who helped boost my sales acumen and professionalism. The role is really made or broken by WHO you work with directly in ECS. They are your pseudo-manager. 

- Great benefits and company-level employee care.","- This role specifically puts you in a position to face more internal than external friction. What do I mean? The adversity you face with tough customers and negotiations is superseded by the endless internal feedback loop you'll experience. Your manager will hawk over your sales calls and pick apart your weaknesses. That's semi-regular sales management practice, But it's accelerated with feedback from your pseudo-managers (the Enterprise Field Reps) who can literally control which deals you can and cannot close. There's little to no senior leadership level intervention. It is literally a game of personalities. 

- Internal CRM processes allow for Reps to be compensated then clawed back due to antiquated fields in their Salesforce. It's amazing how such a large global company can't manage to figure out a workflow in Salesforce to correctly compensate their overlay reps. 

- Expressed to HR that one low performing month and some anecdotal feedback from my ""superiors"" (the Enterprise Field Reps) suddenly put me on a performance plan trajectory. I was at 152% of my annual attainment, yet one month had my manager put me on thin ice. HR, as typical with big corporate, is out to protect the BUSINESS. They pretended to hear me out but passed the ball between different HR reps and never communicated important details, had to re-explain myself every time.

Too many silos between sales, order management/provisioning, customer success, and account management. This was being proactively address when I was employed but still had too many internal approvals holding up deals for days and days."

They work hard and are trying to build for the future / grow the company’s market share. The leadership is actively engaged and is passionate about the work.","This is a traditional and consensus driven culture. If you’re looking for a place to be innovative or to challenge the status quo - this isn’t it. Though they tote being a tech company, its atmosphere resembles more of a bank or financial institution. People do their jobs mindlessly and don’t collaborate as often because they haven’t figured out a way to effectively communicate across the business while driving results forward. Also, there is much nepotism that exists here. Employees are constantly hiring their friends, former colleagues, and promotions / internal mobility is mostly just available to the chosen few. If you don’t know someone in the org or have a good connection with an executive - it will be incredibly hard to get things done or to be promoted."
133,DocuSign,Overall Still A Great Place To Work,2021-12-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,CEO continues to set a good example.,"The IT org culture has unfortunately become worse. Many of the behaviors are contrary to the overall DocuSign culture and the one the IT group used to be like. Example: Much of the hiring circumvents typical norms like getting sufficient feedback prior to making an offer. Many of the hires in IT are friends or referrals but don't wait to get any feedback or discussion so the process is just a rubber stamp. To make matters worse, the new hire qualifications are questionable.

Another example is that some of the IT leaders ask employees to work weekends or holidays but do not show up to these additional meetings themselves."

135,DocuSign,I like it here!,2021-07-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"first off: my team. they are amazing. okay, maybe a bit heavy on the meetings, but what can you do? since we're in the middle of a pandemic, there are no longer water cooler convos, impromptu pow wows, etc. regular small team meetings are usually to check in and check on each other, coupled with some real work stuff. i'm pretty new, but i really feel included already, valued and respected. 

benefits. there's an array of benefits employees can enjoy - the usual medical stuff, pto, as well as other incentives like for gym memberships, or continuing education. i also particularly like the volunteer matching.

culture/management. so far, i am liking the open door policy and that the higher ups are getting the employees' pulse when making big decisions. there are a number of slack channels where employees exchange questions or opinions etc.

as i said, i'm fairly new, but i'm already liking what i see.",the IT response and interface can improve. there is usually no one to talk to (like a real person) to help you with IT stuff. the slack channels are helpful though.

2. Flexibility - I don't feel micro managed when I'm doing well and hitting quota.

3. Great company culture - In the 8 months that I've been at DocuSign, I've made some lifelong friends and mentors (including my Managers).

4. Ability to hit quota regularly as long as you put in the work (we have a great product, and customers are generally happy with our company's ability to improve their workflows).","Base Pay - If you are doing well, commissions help to make up for the slightly low base pay, but I'll be taking parental leave sometime next year, and will likely receive insufficient pay for however long I decide to stay home with the family. Seattle is an expensive place to live, and I'm not sure the base pay recognizes this harsh reality. 

Bottle Necks in getting promoted - It feels like there are so many XDRs being added to every team, I am a bit worried about promotion possibilities in the upcoming years. 

Other than that, this company is a pleasure to work for."

I have worked in many industries and functional areas and have never had such a positive overall career experience. I joined DocuSign a mere six months prior to Covid and for another organization, this could have spelled disaster, however, at DocuSign...the need to partner, to build, to run fast, well that only led to deeper connections (friendships) and my awe at how a tech company could be at once humane and on point for product delivery and customer success.

I worked as an SDR for Zoom Info before coming to DocuSign and was making 80k/year. I came to DocuSign to ""level up"" into a higher sales position and it felt more like a marketing grunt roll. The whole MDR role is sending out mass marketing emails to different titles/industry-specific roles and then cold-calling prospects. The quotas are pretty hard to hit and seems like the executives are still on the pandemic high for sales targets which are now realistic. Sales territories keep getting broken up making it hard to hit quota and there is frustration amongst all of the SDRs and MDRs."

If you do this, you will do well. I've been really happy with how I've been able to build relationships even having started remotely a year ago. At the same time, DocuSign is big enough that your basic support needs are covered, and there is capital available to be invested if you make a strong enough business case for your initiative.

Other pros: RSU packages are good (get them while you still can), many opportunities to get involved in social impact projects (3 days a year granted to Volunteer Time Off), generally good work-life balance","The only cons I can say are 1) there are some people just coasting, so if you're a go-getter you may need to follow-up with people frequently to stay on project timelines, and 2) Diversity in our leadership team is poor and inclusion/equity initiatives are nascent. Leaders are well-intentioned and stepping into uncomfortable spaces, but we are behind compared to some other tech companies."

The product is seen as a darling in the space by its customers. Brand recognition remains unbeaten.,"It's true that DocuSign was worthy of it's ""Best Places to Work"" designation years ago. Today, it's a shell of what it means to hold that title. The culture is broken and politics have overrun everything. I was there long enough to see the political infighting spread like a virus. Unchecked by a management team that was disconnected while the employees create redundant functions to satisfy their ego's and personal agendas. Everyone is on some form of empire building contest with no regard for how it affects others. It really hurts me to see how far they've fallen. I've worked for companies 50x the size of DocuSign and never experienced so many peers going on medical leave to deal with the stress. The term ""stress and vest"" is a real thing at DocuSign."

Excellent, well-defined onboarding process with clear checkpoints.","You will work a lot and the projects and customers tend to be very demanding, which can be exhausting. I regularly work more than 40 hrs/week, and most other consultants seem to do so as well. Management is attempting to address this, but burnout is pervasive. 

As DocuSign grows, additional position levels and requirements have been added which have made career progression more cumbersome. There are a lot of requirements you have to meet in order to move the next ""level"".

You can be a top performer with the longest tenure on a team and still never be promoted( Trust me I've seen it happen to multiple people) The worst part about this is the astounding amount of effort the company put into marketing to make it seem like diversity is an internal initiative. At the end of the day, it's all lip service and as a person of color, it's become borderline degrading to work for this company. 

No work-life balance - Many individuals on the sales team put in 10-12/hr days throughout covid to meet the demand. Our reward for our diligence was a 40% increase in our workload with a simultaneous decrease in compensation. They'll give you far more than 40 hours of work and then chastise you for not being able to get it all done. I've seen people cry, have full-on mental breakdowns and as of recently many are reporting health issues due to the sheer amount of stress they're under( Stomach ulcers, work nightmares, anxiety ect). 


Compensation - YoY you can expect a decrease in conpensation. Apparently, that's the DocuSign way."

You cannot trust anyone in Trust. The CISO is weak and uninformed. The leadership team know nothing. Back channeling and nepotism rule. I heard that you can delete bad reviews on Glassdoor, which is what must be happening, or people are too afraid to give truthful feedback or the fact that execs don’t act on it.

I watched people who started after me get promoted only because they were on a good team so it's strictly about numbers and luck. Also I would hardly consider the job inside sales.... sending mass email blasts and cold calling bad data teaches you nothing about actual sales and could probably be an automated job. 

In addition, they hire absolutely abysmal managers. I went through 3 managers during my time at DocuSign and only one of them was competent. The other two had no idea what they were doing or how to manage a team - I had never experienced such bad micromanaging. You hear from upper management maybe once a quarter and at the end of the day they will attempt to make your frustration feel heard but they could truly care less. 

Also they seem to be desperate for talent because a lot of the new hires seem to lack ambition and just accepted the job to have a job and not to learn and grow. But the interview process is the easiest interview process i've ever been through so I guess it makes sense how they're bringing in bad talent.

Maybe other roles/departments at DocuSign are better, but the MDR role and overall sales org in general is a trap and I would highly encourage anyone in sales to look elsewhere."
199,DocuSign,Great Company! No Complaints!,2021-11-18,5.0,Recruiter,"I work remotely, have flexibility in my schedule, and get the support I need.",Nothing I've found at this time.

201,DocuSign,Compelling Work; Even better people,2021-02-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"I worked in the tech industry for many years and happily progressed on my career path when a recruiter from DocuSign reached out to me. I used their products over the years and was aware of their frequent high ranking on the 'best places to work' list but wasn't actively looking for new opportunities. The recruiter, her name is Priya, was very personable and affable in her 'cold call' email. Her initial email was so personal that I felt compelled to thank her for reaching out. In short succession, and without 'sales pressure,' she connected me with a hiring manager. Again, it was a great first impression meeting with the Hiring Manager, and we were able to find a role that makes good use of my strengths and offers plenty of personal and professional growth. 

I've been with DocuSign several months, enough for the honeymoon period to wane (and vague enough so I can't be fingerprinted for this review), and I still feel compelled to write this review. I've found a great role; it is industry-leading in its charter (i am keeping it vague here), I work hard (this is a good thing), and I am challenged daily.

DocuSign's corporate consciousness aligns strongly with my own values; environmentalism, social justice, prioritizing mental health among their employees, work-life balance.",have not found any cons really.
202,DocuSign,Unfair and biased,2022-01-25,1.0,C N A,None to mention now to you,"No one, top down and bottom up, cares about anyone but themselves"

204,DocuSign,Growing Pains,2021-09-22,2.0,Account Executive,DocuSign hires well at the individual contributor level. They have plenty of money for additional resources in the tech stack. Our CEO is one of the best in the game. 100% employer paid benefits is awesome. We're a market leader and it's not hard to at least get meetings with customers / potential customers.,"Hyper growth has lead to plummeting eSat scores and rising attrition in the sales org. It's very hard to keep the magic in a company from pre-IPO to post. DocuSign managed to do this for about 2 years but has finally turned the corner to become just another tech company chasing $'s. It's no longer about the happiness of the employees let alone the individuals doing, ""the work of your life."" A mid-year change in go-to-market strategy has caused a huge rift between Renewal Management and Sales orgs. The main cause is that both teams are directly incentivized against one another. Depending upon which vertical you're in, you can expect around 15% of team to quota. Miserable numbers compared to years past. The DocuSign response has been throw as much change as possible, as quickly as possible to the problem (s) in hopes that something will stick. This 'fail fast' method works well at Amazon, it has not worked well at DocuSign. If you come in as an upmarket AE, expect to be doing your own account management and now your own pipeline generation. The MDR org is routinely turned over to either fill new AE roles because of the attrition or they get burnt out and move companies. The RM org will most likely not be around after this FY finishes. If you're interviewing upmarket, please ask as many questions as possible to the hiring manager. Ask the team % to quota, ask how many MDRs an AE has gone through the previous FY, ask how much pipeline is expected to be generated by the AEs, ask how many hours a week are spent on non-mrr generating activities, etc."

207,DocuSign,Great Company - has grwon too much,2021-07-12,4.0,Market Development Representative (MDR),"The organization has seen great success over the last 2 years. Luckily, I was able to come onboard before the pandemic hit. I started out as an SDR and then got promoted to MDR. The SDR is fun when in the office but can be draining virtually. Most of the management on the SDR is senior and has great experience to help you become a better sales person. On the MDR side, a good portion of the management team has never closed a deal themselves and you are left to learn on your own. 

Pros:
Great benefits
Very welcoming culture
Great exposure for your resume
If you got in earlier great RSU package","Again with the growth there is a lot of hiring and in the sales roles this means almost no movement outside of a sales roles. DocuSign is a sales company, probably 80% of our staff is in sales. When Docu was growing the pay was okay for their market but now the pay is not competitive.
Cons:
Inexperienced management team
Changing territories 
Your success is dependant on someone else
Low pay"

209,DocuSign,Used to be great,2021-05-10,3.0,Market Development Representative,Was an incredible place to work a couple years ago. Still working alongside a lot of great people and appreciate the benefits,"Sales org is solely numbers based yet getting promoted requires you meet your number and bend over backwards for the greater team. Too much pressure on a “team” environment when my paycheck depends so heavily on how well I perform individually. Because of certain skills I possess, I’m constantly pulled into side projects to help the wider team but these projects heavily take away from me being able do what I need to do to hit my numbers. I notice this doesn’t apply to everyone, however. There are a few of us who take on these leadership roles while the rest of the team sits back and waits for the work to be done- plenty of time to focus on their quota attainment and get promoted to the next level. 

My distaste for the company began when Covid hit last year. Felt like our managers added in extra team zoom meetings because they didn’t trust we were doing what we should be. Over the months we’ve given feedback around zoom fatigue and wanting less meetings but this feedback was never put into action forcing me and others to fall into deeper burnout."
210,DocuSign,Amazing company to work for!,2021-08-10,5.0,Account Executive,"I love working for DocuSign! DocuSign is constantly growing and for a great reason. I work remotely and the flexibility of WFH is amazing.

I work for the Small to Medium Government (SMG) vertical, working with local government and K12 customers. SMG vertical is a very tight knit group and although all of my co-workers and teammates are in different parts across the country, I have grown very close with them. I always feel included.

The pay is on par with industry average and you are compensated for overtime with 1.5x pay, which is amazing. As an Account Executive, I put in additional time to make sure I can juggle all of my opportunities efficiently. Very happy that I am able to get compensation for my extra time I put in. It motivates me to work even harder, and I do not mind putting in the additional time.

The benefits are great as well. Health insurance is 100% covered.

Diversity & Inclusion is a strong motion in DocuSign, which is great to see.

Culture - Great culture, everyone is more than happy to help each other when needed. Amazing teamwork, which drives success.","Quota - DocuSign has experienced tremendous growth, accelerated by COVID in 2020. This led to very tough quotas for 2021, and only a select few Account Executives in SMG are achieving/over-attaining their quota. This is a big concern when only a small percentage of the reps in SMG are hitting their quota.

Customer/Technical Support team - Our customer/technical support team are terrible, for a lack of better words. DocuSign needs to hire more competent customer/technical support reps that actually know what they are doing. It is very frustrating as an Account Executive to have to step in and handle customer/technical support due to incompetency."

- My responsibilities grew exponentially from hire to now and my hard work and effort was recognized accordingly through our year end review process.
- I feel very supported by my immediate manager and team.
- Benefits package is tremendous (some items that could be reconsidered/added but overall, amazing). 
- I've appreciated the diversity and inclusion efforts and opportunity to attend events hosted by our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). The ERGs put on amazing events, panels, and workshops that I believe are so beneficial.","As a Company, I do think we need to be more timely/aggressive in the hiring and recruiting process. My process of getting hired was relatively quick and painless but lately, in order to continue growing, we need more resources to assist with recruiting the large amount of jobs we've opened."

Clear values, clear expectations of managers that results in staff being well-supported and empowered to advance and grow. Excellent benefits - the range of benefits is extensive - for example, legal assistance, mental health benefits, wellness benefits, etc.","The company is a mix of startup and well-established.

223,DocuSign,DocuSign isn’t a people first company,2021-10-25,1.0,Market Development Manager,-The product itself is good,"-Everybody is very underpaid compared to the market average

-They are NOT flexible with remote. They’re not giving us the choice to decide how often our teams need to be in office. This is the opposite of a people first approach. They’re calling it a ‘flex’ plan but it’s not flexible. It still requires everybody to commute each week, regardless of how the team is performing. 

-Recently they subtly sent an email saying even if you’re fully remote you need to be vaccinated or you’ll be terminated. They didn’t even host a town hall or address any questions. It was a very odd and sneaky way to approach a sensitive issue. 

-They don’t listen to feedback. Multiple surveys were sent out and the overwhelming response was that people didn’t want to return to office. Nobody misses their commutes. Yet they did nothing with this data. 

There’s plenty of other companies out there that will be flexible (actually flexible, so choosing when and how often you want to be in office, not forcing you to come in then calling it flexible) with remote work and will also pay you more money. 

I’d encourage  anybody looking for a job to check elsewhere first. This company used to be people first,  now they seem to smile and refer to themselves with this title, but it feels very empty."

Now, a couple years later, I'm still thankful that I get to work with some of the kindest, smartest, and caring people I've ever worked with. From product managers who distill down customer needs into workable user stories to developers who care that they are creating the right solution for the customers, to QA who work hard to ensure that the solutions work right for the customers, this is a fantastic place to learn and to grow.

I've had managers who have worked hard ensuring I had what I needed to do the work of my life. I enjoy my 1:1s; my manager is happy to have wide-ranging discussions with me, yet she will dive deep on an area if I ask her to.

Even in the midst of the lockdown and subsequent recovery from Covid-19, the company provided us a generous amount to help with unexpected changes to cope with the new working arrangements.

264,DocuSign,Growing pains are rampant,2021-09-27,4.0,Sales Operations,Benefits are unmatched. CEO is awesome. Culture is decent.,Salary is below average compared to industry standards. Promotions are slow or non-existent and are based on an internal employment level. Yearly raise has decreased.

267,DocuSign,No life no impact,2021-10-12,3.0,Software Engineer,Pay is phenomenal. Granted my salary is significantly lower than my stock equity grant.,Base salary is stagnate. Almost no opportunity to advance. Minimal raises. I've worked 24hr/7wk/364days since I've started. Coworkers are noob. Poor understanding of reproducible and readable code as infrastructure practices. Ridiculously defensive when you even suggest they are even slightly wrong.
268,DocuSign,Great Company Culture,2021-09-07,5.0,Senior Account Executive,DocuSign has a very inclusive and collaborative culture.,As the company has grown over the years it has turned into more of a corporate environment. Return to office and growth in collaboration amongst teams will help this.

If you are looking for an amazing place to get started/continue your sales career, DocuSign is your place.",Only Con would be that they hire externally for positions that internal hires are looking to get promoted into. I believe internal hires should take complete priority.

279,DocuSign,Great place to work!,2021-08-03,5.0,Senior Product Manager,Wonderful teammates and perks. You get the sense that the company really cares about your well being. There are always new benefits being rolled out.,Very fast moving and trying to bring their product suite together can be tedious. The company is growing at a fast rate which can sometimes lead to over work.
280,DocuSign,Incredible company to work for,2020-10-19,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"Very engaged leadership team with a genuine focus on employee well being. Especially during these bizarre times with Covid 19 and working from home the company is trying to do its best to make things work for all employees by offering new benefits, additional funds for technology expenses, extra time off and programs that alleviate the stress that comes with working in uncertain times and remote. DocuSign has a great collaborative culture where we jointly work to a desired outcome and get the credit as a team, not just one individual. It's a shared success and that is a unique approach. You are hired to do your best work and get a lot of freedom to get your work done with the necessary support when needed.
Great benefits such as health benefits (medical, dental, vision), 401k, Life Insurance, Pet Insurance, generous time off, Volunteer time off and matching, Wellness benefits, Commute/Parking benefits etc. All in all a very generous package.","I have a hard time coming up with something, but one thing I would mention is that the business is growing/changing so fast that there is never enough people and time to get the work done, so you have to be smart in managing your time wisely."
281,DocuSign,Great company,2021-09-14,5.0,Product Manager Intern,"I loved working for DocuSign, very well run and caring environment",literally not one con to working at DocuSign
282,DocuSign,Internal Promotion System is Broken,2021-01-25,2.0,Market Development Representative,"DocuSign's product is superb, and upper management's vision is forward-thinking. Company provides generous compensation, and has handled COVID-19 strategically with genuine thoughtfulness for their employees. The Sales Org sets up the Account Executives for success.","Major issues within the Sales Development org. SDRs are easily promoted to MDR positions - simply by picking up the phone, and following up on warm leads. 
 But DocuSign has over hired for the MDR role. With so many people trying to get to the AE level, promotion criteria is as stringent as ever. This is problematic because DS is at a point in their maturity where an MDRs sales abilities no longer matter - but their success, and thus chances to be promoted, is dependent on which team they land on. Some teams average over 160% attainment, while others are hovering around 55% attainment. Thus, top talent on poor-performing teams are being forced to leave the company. Morale in the MDR org is at an all-time low. Managers respond to complaints by saying ""we understand"" and ""we hear you"", but do not actually implement meaningful changes. If you are an incoming MDR, be warned that you could be getting set up for failure."
283,DocuSign,Growth pains and opportunity,2021-10-25,3.0,Product Management,"- Lots of opportunity to learn and connect with experienced leaders
- No shortage of supportive colleagues for collaboration
- Passionate coworkers focused on customers and solving problems","- Poor management and politics
- Poorly defined leveling
- Few POC in senior leadership"
284,DocuSign,Lots of Movement - Growing Pains - Low Pay,2021-08-12,3.0,Market Development Representative,"DocuSign presents a good opportunity for fresh college graduates to get their feet wet and build a thick skin for their career in sales. If you work up the sales ladder, it does develop a lot of transferable skills - cold calling, CRM experience, industry specific knowledge and experience.","Low pay - DocuSign doesn’t pay their employees nearly enough for the numbers they produce. Commission is a set number rather than based off your production and the value of the deals you set up. Rather than raising our pay and incentivizing us to continue to work harder, DocuSign offered a higher referral bonus. 

Growing Pains - It’s more obvious now than ever that DocuSign is trying to scale at the pace they were during COVID. Management feels the heat with large scale team changes and constant shifts in rules and teams. 

Linear Sales Path - Promotion is based off of time in seat and attainment. It doesn’t necessarily promote people who are great at their jobs and often times it can seem like there’s no progression in role past the first 5-6 months. Burnout is inevitable. It really depends on how you overcome it."
285,DocuSign,I'm Doing the Work of My Life,2021-05-13,5.0,Human Resources Director,"Amazing manager, leaders and support system for me as I was hired during the pandemic. The onboarding process, the first few months and now this first year with DocuSign have felt natural, filled me with purpose and I genuinely feel a part of an amazing team changing the world.","I wish we could be back in the office, but I'm not holding that against DocuSign. Their plan to return to office, Back to Better, is thoughtful and focuses on me, the employee, and my safety. I appreciate that."

Great community of individuals",The location is a bit not ideal.
288,DocuSign,A+ for everything except recruiting,2020-11-05,5.0,Market Development Representative,"Amazing company with great culture, people and benefits","Recruiting department seems to go out of its way to bungle any attempt at properly doing its job. A recent round of promotional interviews was delayed one week. Then pushed out two additional weeks because it was EOQ. Meanwhile, external hires were interviewed and given offers, and internal hires were told there was not headcount for promotion. They made this announcement the day interviews finally began. To make matters worse, recruiting would not allow promotion eligible employees who were mislead about promotion availability to apply for any additional roles. So if someone only applied to a limited number of positions, they very well could have been shut out entirely and forced to remain in their current role for an additional 3 months - at minimum. 

To provide a little recap, I personally spent at least a full day's work preparing, talking to managers, and shadowing team members for roles that were rescinded. This was a giant waste of everyone's time. And because recruiting is inept, this prevented everyone else from doing their actual jobs."
289,DocuSign,Awesome Benefits. Great Company,2021-08-03,5.0,Market Development Representative (MDR),"The Benefits were great. The people, support and resources were great. 
Definitely a black area in sales where some reps pulled Opps out of nowehere, seemingly all the time.","Bad books, previously prospected contacts."
290,DocuSign,Great people first company,2021-04-13,5.0,Billing Specialist,DocuSign believes that the employees on the frontline drive the success of the company and it shows in the initiatives they have for employee well-being and happiness. This drives the underlying sense of community that otherwise might not be there due to the size.,DocuSign is a large company that can sometimes feel disconnected especially between the expectations for different departments. Sometimes it seems like their is lacking a top down call out foe the different expectations in different departments. This can be important where different departments overlap such as in sales and finance. A better understanding or at least a more committed understanding of the way your role overlaps with others would raise efficiency and employee happiness.
291,DocuSign,Majors AE,2021-08-31,5.0,Majors Account Executive,"- Compensation

294,DocuSign,Do the Work of Your Life,2020-11-11,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),DocuSign is a company that genuinely cares about it's employees. They provide amazing benefits and the pay is pretty good for a recent college graduate in the position I currently hold. They provide a launchpad for sales people looking to get their feet wet and grow with an amazing company. Management is the best at DocuSign and transparency is never a problem. They provide a crazy amount of PTO and match any donations to non profit organizations. I can't get across how awesome the company culture is here and how great the people are within the organization. The executives make you feel like you're one door down even though we're virtually remote right now. DocuSign will keep growing and I am more than excited to be a part of this awesome organization.,"As we grow, opportunities for internal promotion are more competitive and less seats are open in the next positions. Not so much a con, as competition for positions is needed and pushes us all to be better in the XDR org."

The products are impactful with a short time to value","Lack of diversity at the senior leadership level (2nd, 3rd and 4th line leaders). 
Health benefits aren't as good as some other tech companies
Seems to be a badge of honor to not take PTO"
301,DocuSign,"Respect, Growth and Money",2020-09-01,5.0,Account Executive,"- Incredibly inviting culture. I started in the midst of COVID-19 and my remote onboarding was smooth and seamless. I was worried about the learning curve with everyone being remote, but I actually think DocuSign has managed to master this transition and somehow make it even better. My bootcamp was incredible!
- Customers LOVE us! I have worked in SaaS for years and have never felt the love from customers they way I have at DocuSign. They love the product, understand the value and are excited to see how else we can help. It's amazing!
- Management respects your time and genuinely cares. They set realistic expectations and never impede on my personal time. It's exactly what I was hoping for and signed up for. I finally have balance again.
- Generous compensation plans that are stronger than ""top"" companies in the industry.
- Humble employees just trying to do their best
- Managers are not ""CRM DJs"" or ""Salesforce Zombies."" Unlike other companies I have been at, managers at DocuSign aren't just refreshing reports and dashboards. It's not about the end numbers, it's about the customer and their employees lives. It's probably why success seems to follow everything this company does - the priorities of the leaders are in the right place.","- Growing at a pace like DocuSign requires adaptability and the very scary word....""CHANGE."" Be prepared to roll with the punches but know that the company cares about it's employees and the customers first beyond anything else."

Dealing with a generation that wants to move jobs more than ever, people are not leaving DocuSign. Working here has been like having the resources of a big company and the connections of a small business. The Product Experience team has built a close knit community, and a brave space for everyone involved. All team members have a voice at DocuSign, and it is heard, all the way up to the top. Not to mention the compensation and benefits are above and beyond.","The only con would be I wish there were more verticals we were working in, but that's really looking for something to be unhappy about."

The company has a clear strategy and path to growth, capable and inspiring leadership, and a product that people love. We are focused on actively discussing and improving D&I efforts, and there are a broad range of employee resource groups so you can find ""your people"" within the organization. Comp and benefits are excellent.  

Remote work note: DocuSign has committed to being employee-first after the pandemic subsides, and all of their actions during the pandemic point to them keeping their word. We already have team members who are remote full-time,  and the company is investing in processes and systems that will enable remote work in the future.",The company experienced dramatic growth in 2020 due to external circumstances and acquisitions.

I'm thrilled to see that after this length of time, my pros have stayed the same along with my ""cons"" since my previous review. I truly love working here day in and day out, feel supported and recognized by management, and align with the vision of this company. DocuSign really stepped up to the plate during this year and I can confidently say they have made our WFH situation the best an organization possibly could. People stick around here for a reason. No point in changing a good thing.","Racking my brain to think of anything here. Things are busy for the sales org (in a good way). Expect to have a lot going on daily, but everything with a good purpose. I wouldn't even consider this a con personally.

2. Benefits are the best I have seen so far, no premium on individual insurance unless family 
3. Vary caring Company- have been provided a ton of support including financial support during the pandemic. The company does everything possible to take care of their employees, including free office shut down days so everyone can take break from meetings and rejuvinate
4. Diversity & Inclusion - as a minority, I feel included and appreciated. This is the best I have seen so far in Bay area Tech companies",None so far that I can think of

- I have a lot of opportunity in my current role to grow with the Company and tackle projects that I have expertise in and projects that will enable further my professional growth
- I feel very supported by my immediate team and manager
- The Company provided a COVID stipend and has provided additional days off throughout the pandemic to recognize hard work and give people a break - these were/are a gamechanger!
- Company wide allyship training and seminars offered throughout the year aimed to educate employees on social justice and other important current issues","While I agree that there are great benefits offered, I would like to see the Company remove the primary-caregiver requirement for parental leave and move past the idea that only one parent is more responsible for the care of a child."
324,DocuSign,Toxic culture mostly from leadership,2021-04-13,2.0,Project Manager,The benefits are generally very good.,"Toxic culture where blaming people rather than healthy discussion is the mode of communication. If someone is upset with you, you will never hear it from them but instead through word of mouth all the way to the top when the most direct method would have been to open a dialogue. Change in a large organization is hard; it is harder when there is a complete lack of communication from the top to get buy in."

326,DocuSign,Great place to be at,2020-07-26,5.0,Account Manager,"As an org, DocuSign has clear cut goals. Management communicates them and provides regular updates. Most people on my team have an owner mentality - we all have stocks and pay careful attention to the price. It’s a great mentality that keeps me excited to log on every day. 

I feel supported by my manager and team - our quotas are challenging, but I’ve been able to hit and exceed consistently. The commission pay out is great - I’m definitely making good money. 

Covid response: I’m impressed by leadership’s early response to covid. DS takes really good care of its people.",- Lack of clarity about go-forward remote work policy. Tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter have made a commitment to allowing permanent remote work. Please let us know.

328,DocuSign,Narcissistic leadership,2021-08-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay was alright and there were a few paid days off during Covid,"I left a bad manager and unhealthy company culture.
Leaders at DocuSign focus most of their energy on blaming / shaming other teams for failed projects instead of developing strategies for collaboration and accountability to deliver value and reduce complexity. Managers here lack empathy and do not have the skills and capabilities to motivate every employee individually, nor to coach and develop their people by focusing on their strengths. Leaders here make decisions based on politics, not productivity. You will be excluded (or experience various forms of passive aggressive behavior) if you do not have a personality type like your manager or leadership team. Effectiveness in your role is not valued as much as likeability and fitting in. My manager had no interest in adding value to their team through empathy, mentorship and coaching. Their way of adding value was to force their team to have happy hours over Zoom, which the team participated in begrudgingly. My manager also actively prevented me from taking roles on other teams at DocuSign and never once discussed career growth opportunities or even asked me what I wanted to do in the future. Ironically the role I accepted at a different company is the same as the role my manager at DocuSign actively blocked me from pursuing. Leaders/managers here focus on protecting their own position and do not invest in retaining their most effective people. This is obvious through the consistently bad Pulse survey scores, and nearly every competent person on the team being a flight risk. Most top performing team members would leave if it weren't for the golden handcuffs. I would rather leave future money on the table so that this place is in the rear view mirror."
329,DocuSign,Great place to do the work of your life.,2021-04-23,5.0,Market Development Representative,"DocuSign is a very inclusive place to bring your whole self to work everyday. They have adapted quickly during the pandemic and continues to encourage an ""employee first"" approach to decision making.

Great and attentive senior leadership.",None that I can think of at this time. Looking forward to going into the office.

- 401k matching
- Employee stock plan
- Recognizable name on resume 
- Easy to get hired as an SDR, even if you don't have prior sales experience","- It's extremely hard to move up outside of the sales org, despite them making it seem easy to make lateral moves during interviews; feels like a bait-and-switch
- Unlivable base pay in pre-sales and closing roles, especially to be based in cities like Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, and Toronto
- Unattainable quotas that management refuses to reevaluate, even though they are clearly based on inflated COVID numbers
- Management is not realistic about quota, they tell you to keep dialing but fail to understand that we will never hit peak COVID numbers again 
- DocuSign claims to put ""employee's first,"" but refuses to listen to employees when we voice valid concerns about not being able to hit inflated quotas 
- Performative activism throughout the entire organization - carefully crafted email messages that go out detailing the amounts of money invested in organizations, yet DocuSign refuses to actually take a stance against injustice. Sometimes it's more harmful to try and stay ""neutral."" 
- Check their demographics online - the lack of black and brown representation throughout the company and in leadership is laughable 
- Majority of recent diversity and inclusion initiatives are led by white managers, mainly men - that should be enough said as to how problematic this is 
- Hires unethical people - when I say unethical I mean they hire people comfortable enough to rant about how BLM is a political issue in all company Slack channels,
- You will be surrounded by frat bros - enough said as to why this will be a detriment to your mental wellbeing 
- They are currently offering $4k a referral, which just feeds into the lasting issue of nepotism and invasion of the frat boys - having most of the people on the sales floor being siblings, in-laws, and frat/sorority connected should not be the norm in a major city. There will be no diversity if you only ever hire people who all pledged the same PWI organizations 
- Your success is based on your team, so good luck. Your manager may or may not be willing to advocate for you it is solely the luck of the draw 
- Management can be problematic at times, and by problematic I mean classist, prejudice, and won't bat an eyelash at blatant favoritism
- There are a lot of AE's here that are truly unprofessional; they no-show calls, don't communicate with SDR's, try and be shady (which is a problem because that is how we get paid), and some even have the nerve to be rude"

The actively-inspiring (and inspired) Employees are serious about their work at the Company and are individually-motivated to succeed socially and apart from it too. You see it. You hear about it.

- Your job may be misrepresented to you. My recruiter did an amazing job selling me on DocuSign, so much so that it was definitely oversold. The responsibilities of my role were completely over-stated and over-leveled.

Executives frequently join customer calls when asked, and give their time and effort to their teams. Our CEO Dan leads by example in many ways. This quote describes his style: 'Where there is humility, there is more success, and lasting success.' – Patrick Lencioni

DocuSign really does care about their employees. I'm continually surprised by their generosity, whether it's giving a surprise extra day off, or giving remote workers a significant extra expense fund to equip their home offices during the pandemic. Compensation is fair, bonus plans are excellent if you work hard, and benefits are better than I've ever had at prior companies.

I can't recall ever contacting a colleague about meeting to learn something new, and they weren't totally willing to help. One thing I love here is the transparency -- Dan and Joan answer every question in real time during all-company calls. We published our diversity numbers on our website a couple of months ago. We were recently given a personal day off to avoid burnout. The product itself is great and continues to evolve.

We're also very proud of our sites' security and uptime.","Speaking only for engineering: the organization is under-invested in tooling (prefers to re-invent the wheel badly than bother learning how to use industry standard open source tools). Doing the simplest programming tasks turns into days-long misadventures due to no serious will to pay down tech debt and lack of docs. We have slow release cycles like an old company. ""Tenured"" engineers tend to have a bunker mentality and hate other engineering teams the farther removed they are from them. People generally feel too far behind to put any serious effort into helping their teammates (varies by team). Companies acquired by DocuSign are often not gracefully integrated in engineering processes, and are often asked to adopt inferior practices to their own.

Dan Springer and C-level execs are actually really great people but are so high level I doubt they actually know what is going on at the individual office level...","I'll keep it short.. 

No room for growth in sales, unless you are already established -

I wouldn't recommend DocuSign to anyone in a junior or entry level position. Managers get hired exponentially so you won't have the same manager for more than a year. There is little to no promotions happening within the sales org for actual reps. Management loves hiring outside hires versus internal hires. An age old problem that typically tanks retention.

Toxic culture - 

If you're a ""yes man"" you will thrive here. You are expected to put your head down and not question anything being told to you, typical call center or recruiting firm behavior. Metrics are absurd and you were expected to do more even through the days of COVID with very little to work with. Additionally, DocuSign's sales org is an extremely siloed environment that has caused a hierarchical sales org which in turn, has manifested a ""bro-y"" culture. They rely heavily on external referrals so they keep hiring the same persona. In short, lack of diversity in some offices.

Outdated technology- 

One would think that coming to DocuSign means you will be well equipped with new technology. Nope, you are given a windows computer even if you have only worked off of Mac computers. Nicer apple products are only given to management; hence, the hierarchical environment. When we were actually in office, everything was pretty old from the building, to the desks, chairs, desktops etc. Truly was surprising because its well, DocuSign?!"

- Because of the point above, it creates a status quo environment and a stay in your lane mentality. Innovation or new ideas? Forget about it.
- Recruiter does lowball you. Could have done a lot better after talking with other colleagues.
- Politics gets pretty heavy after you've been at the company for more than a year, so much that you don't really even code and are tasked with grunt work that no one else wants to do.

Leadership is very supportive of the employees, providing us with a lot of virtual training opportunities to improve our professional skills. They also support our philanthropic efforts with generous matching funds and support for volunteer hours served.","It is a fast growing company, so some processes and support teams need maturity to support our growing enterprise business.

I started in mid-July and won't see my first commission check until the end of September, and they don't pay equivalent OTE for the interim - that was a bit of a shock and disappointing, especially as the comp package is lower than the industry average in my experience.
Also - decelerators after hitting quota on ramp makes it less motivating to push to overachieve."

I can’t speak to how hard they try to make me feel supported and grow my career. The product is not super exciting on the surface, but there are a lot of machinations under the hood. It’s also exciting that DocuSign as a whole is moving towards being a multi-product company, giving me as a designer a great deal of opportunity to work on a portfolio of almost 60 products.","The same as any company of this size—inefficiencies in processes, lots of meetings."

404,DocuSign,6 months review,2020-07-06,5.0,People Manager,"Great culture and people support across the board. I feel safe making mistakes here as I am learning so much about my role and our company. There is a conscious awareness and desire to take care of employees as people first. Benefits are very competitive, good PTO, good healthcare options, and several other great benefits easily forgotten like health and well being, commuting, and donation matching. I also really appreciate the commitment to community and providing us opportunities to learn and volunteer.","Work load with covid and remote is higher than it was in office, work life balance is more of a struggle, If I had a wish list I would love to see 401K match growth in future and separate phone for business use instead of stipend on my personal phone so I could better separate my work and home life."

Very healthy work eco, great team and very empathetic people around. Challenging work and continuous learning.
Great perks.. of course

Poor mapping between responsibilities and staff.

It's rare to find an organization that really does look out for their employees, especially during these trying times. I thoroughly enjoy working with my team and while hitting quota can be challenging at times, it's definitely attainable. It's also nice to be able to sell a product that works and makes our client's lives much easier. Overall, this is a fantastic place to work and I highly recommend it!","There's really not too many cons that I can think of. The hardest part is when you're starting out and getting to know which team you need to talk to internally and since there are so many different areas to find information, it can be a bit overwhelming."

Alot of luck is involved is my point."
420,DocuSign,"Great company culture, still small enough to make impact",2020-04-23,5.0,Director,"* Culture, culture, culture  - estaff leadership is outstanding and not only focused on building a great product and achieving its TAM potential but also cares about employee base (Dan Springer is the real deal, genuinely great and authentic CEO)
* One of the reasons why I decided to join DocuSign was that it still felt small enough that you can make an impact despite being more than 4k employee base.  Thus far, really enjoying the partnership with the business partners and even within my department, I feel I have the opportunity share my ideas and a platform to showcase my talents
* Product still has tons of runway.  Our biggest competitor is paper and as companies  accelerate the digital transformation, our product delivers solutions to drive productivity gains with a positive impact on the eco footprint","None that you can't break through.  If you are a person that is passionate and have drive, I think anything is possible (assuming you are collaborative, solution oriented and willing to part hard work).  You can also coast by here...."

423,DocuSign,Be aware of the recruiters,2021-04-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"At first, it looks like a ""employee first"" company. Good work-life balance.","Once you sign the papers, you realize the recruiters low balled you big time (salary wise). Everything they say about ""This is the best we can do"" is a lie after you join and you hear how much other engineers in your band are making. Then you realize your manager is happy to ignore all the promises she made during the interview process. If you interview here, get the hiring manager to put everything in writing before you sign the offer. They're happy to ""forget"" about those promises made later."
424,DocuSign,"Another echo-chamber, never question anything",2021-02-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"People seem nice, and benefits are good.","DocuSign is just like any another Silicon Valley echo-chamber tech company. They push the progressive narrative through your throat in every company event. I came to the US from Latin America and have my own values. This company says it's all for diversity, but it's not true. They don't accept people who dare question their progressive dogmas.

On the other hand, management has a top-down approach, at least in the projects I've been involved in. I provide context for product decisions based on research, but they still won't listen, because they're driven by their assumptions.

I don't see myself in the company for too long. Too closed-minded."

- Strong leadership during COVID pandemic and commitment to diversity

- Exciting problem space: no other company touches the individual consumer all the way to Fortune 500 businesses and governments across the world. 

- Also, becoming the future of agreement is so cool, especially in the context of how different cultures across the world agree and building products to service those needs.

- Rapidly growing stock price lol","- Could have stronger pay/benefits

- Sometimes can feel not as exciting as flashy tech startups

- Product culture could be stronger"
427,DocuSign,Incompetent Leadership Depending on Dept,2021-02-17,2.0,Analyst,"Benefits, company culture as whole (depending on department), being remote.","Specific teams/supervisors/managers style may not align with what DocuSign promotes and promises employees. Since being remote management has become more micromanaging, less flexible/understanding and no matter how much you work or get done, how many contests you win, it's never enough. On top of the micromanaging, having management talk down to their employee's with a condescending tone during team meetings or 1-1s does not set the tone well for those meetings.

Not very diverse, everyone in upper management is white. This could be improved upon."
428,DocuSign,Great place to be!,2021-02-01,5.0,Software Development Engineer In Test (SDET),"DocuSign is a fantastic place to work. I've been there for 3 years, and feel incredibly fortunate to have found a company that cares deeply about the work culture, its employees and communities.","While there are downsides to working anywhere, and there is always room for improvement, there are no cons that even come close to outweighing the benefits."

432,DocuSign,Let the grind begin!,2021-05-21,3.0,Market Development Representative (MDR),Benefits are nice and easy brand to sell if you have a decent territory.,Getting promoted on time is tough and they cater to Account Executives and the position can feel more like a secretary than team work. You have to depend on others to hit goal. Too many cooks in the kitchen.
433,DocuSign,Consider Hiring Internally,2021-02-18,3.0,Market Development Representative,"Great product, smart colleagues, lots of support (financially and emotionally) during COVID-19. I love everything about working for DocuSign, except the lack of career growth opportunities.","Your success and promotional eligibility as an MDR is solely based on what team you are on. Some teams are at 120%, while other teams are at 50%. DocuSign hired too many MDRs and territories are decades old. As an incoming MDR, I would be hesitant to join this Org. The promotional path outside of sales is even more unattainable due to recruiting focusing on external hires, rather than promoting from within. Many talented MDRs are stuck and are forced to leave."
434,DocuSign,I LOVE DocuSign!,2021-04-13,5.0,Proposal Writer,"Belonging, Benefits, RSUs, Amazing coworkers",Pays lower than tech competitors
435,DocuSign,Great Culture and Career Growth,2020-12-09,5.0,Compliance Manager,"Culture:
DocuSign has an extremely supportive culture that is generated from the top down. The executive leadership, like most companies, gives plenty of lip-service to a desire to have happy employees. DocuSign is one of the rare businesses where leadership follows through on that desire. In just the last year, during COVID, we've had a couple of impromptu employee appreciation holidays. We've had multiple rounds of funding for building out WFH infrastructure which has made the COVID experience a bit easier. 

During the summer, our leadership stood firmly with BLM. One example was giving employees Juneteenth off as a company holiday. This was an impressive acknowledgement of the duality of American history by celebrating the emancipation of slaves in the same way that we celebrate our independence from Britain. This, along with a number of different workshops and guest speakers centered around understanding bias and diversity demonstrate a firm commitment to creating an inclusive culture. It seems like every company-wide discussion has a section committed to our various diversity and inclusion initiatives. 

Career Growth:
DocuSign is growing quickly. Whether it is through new products / acquisitions or entering new markets, there are a lot of opportunities to develop new processes and learn new skills and compliance frameworks. 

Compensation:
Above average as is typical of the tech industry. Other benefits, such as the fitness equipment stipend, have made the COVID experience much more manageable. The key is that work-life balance is attainable in DocuSign. Leadership is committed to employee welfare, of which work-life balance is a key component.","There aren't many downsides specific to DocuSign. The rapid growth of products, acquisitions, and markets has certainly been challenging to keep up with. Despite the challenges, as stated above in the pros section, the rapid growth has created plenty of opportunities for professional growth."
436,DocuSign,One of the best employer!,2021-04-13,5.0,Lead Software Engineer,"- Great team & smart colleagues

Growth/promotions are fair","Huge org changes, a lot of growing pains in the last year

447,DocuSign,"Amazing employer, great product, and great colleagues",2020-04-06,5.0,Product Manager,"Lots of room for product ownership, and contribution to the company's bottom line. Even though its a large-ish public company, the hierarchy is relatively flat in the product org, and all levels of leadership will collaborate with even junior PMs to allow for the most flexible decision making to be made at the level which is best equipped.

Compensation is good, it's not going to be as high as FAANG, but you probably get more ownership of the product than in those megacorps.

It's an exciting time for docusign too, lots and lots of room to grow, and the product is growing in all these amazing ways to serve our customers. We have an agreement cloud suite of products, and the challenge will be to get all these components functioning in an integrated singular way, but that's a great problem to have, and the runway for the company is long and clear.","None really.  Maybe compensation being lower than FAANG is a thing, but that's it. That said, our stock has a higher growth potential than some of those companies, so your stock grant growth is high."
448,DocuSign,Wonderful place,2020-10-06,5.0,Account Executive,"I started DocuSign at the beginning of the pandemic in March. I can honestly say it was the best choice I've ever made to join this company. I have not interacted with one person that isn't supportive and willing to drop everything to help you. There is a lot of training at the beginning, but I had to do a lot of self-learning to immediately hop onto calls and get the ball moving. Management and Execs have been making a huge effort to make sure everyone is supported and connected during WFH.","Days can be long because there's so much work to do, but it's not overwhelming.

The ability to ask questions and introduce yourself to anyone in the ENTIRE company without being looked over. Awesome company to work for. I have never wrote a review for a company I have worked at, but DocuSign just continues to come through day in and day out. eSignature is something that is going to stay with this pandemic on our hands and I feel so blessed to be working for this company.",Only thing I would suggest is putting a few more positions of management in central time zone.

453,DocuSign,DocuSign is a Uniting Force in a Divided World,2020-07-06,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"DocuSign cares deeply about its employees, customers, and the world. There is ample evidence from the action executives take on the results of employee surveys, the free and reduced services given to customers and potential customers for COVID response, and the work we do for global forests and other initiatives. If that was all I knew about the company, it would be enough.

On top of that, there are reasonable expectations for product development and solid leadership that allows us to get work done, keep the existing customer base happy, and develop for the future. 

DocuSign is a uniting force in a divided world. That is true of our products as well as the culture of the company.","The entire company is working from home due to COVID. On-boarding is happening at home too. I have heard that some of our new hires are struggling to be engaged, though I expect it to be a similar problem everywhere during the crisis."

She really did an amazing job, and the way she described DocuSign almost seemed to good to be true, but being here over a year all expectations have been exceeded!

Since I started at DocuSign, I've always had the support I've needed and my teammates are always willing to go out of their way to give support.

Another huge plus is you do not get micromanaged, which I think is so important. I've seen far to many organizations try to use a cookie cutter approach and manage/train employees all one way, limiting there abilities and I think truly hindering top performers, but not at DocuSign!","The Chicago office is awesome, if there was one small thing that could help out is providing a little more space in between the desks."

As the company succeeds the rewards are distributed throughout the organization, and it's evident in the perks, benefits, and fun events (like the holiday party).  I also like that the CTO is a woman, which is rare in the tech industry.  It really feels like the company cares about the employees and is open to input.  Even the review process is multi-directional, including reviews from your peers, and you get to review your manager.  The leadership is also very transparent about what the future plans are and why we are doing certain things.  Lastly, the ""give-back"" positive culture of the business makes you feel really good.  We get to volunteer a lot and the company matches charitable donations.  They also have a big focus on saving trees through the DocuSign Forests initiative and are heavily focused on reducing the carbon footprint for the company.","I wish they had fertility benefits in their health insurance plan.  It's a benefit that a lot of tech companies are adding to help attract top talent, and DocuSign wants to compete at that level.

Great products 
Amazing Coworkers","Our executive board are in the global top 1% and if you think they care about the other 99% you’re wrong and how this company has changed over the last four years completely backs me up on where their priorities really lay. (I’ll give you a hint it’s not their employees it’s their brokerages) 

Dan our CEOs salary is 60x what I make per year if I hit OTE.. I like Dan he’s a nice dude this just yells wealth inequality. Dan’s labor per year is not worth 60x mine. On top of that Dan got 1 million shares when starting at DocuSign 4 years ago which is 1000x what I got when I started at the same time..... 

Add in that our territories for FY22 have shrunk substantially while quotas have increased substantially while our profit and earnings per share has never been higher. To me this YELLS that DocuSigns executive board does not care about their employees rather they care about their shareholders first and foremost BECAUSE our executive board are the largest shareholders. As an employee I feel like there is this media blitz about employees first yet I see what is actually happening and how we’ve changed over the last 4 years and I would say we do not put employees first as shown by our CEOs ridiculous pay and share allocation and how they are making it harder and harder for their sales staff to make good money bc lower sales payout inherently helps our share price. This is representative across our entire C suite. To me when I found this out my view on Dan and our entire executive board has completely changed and I am frankly disgusted."

516,DocuSign,Doing good and enjoying it,2020-09-02,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* DocuSign provides a lot of great perks for their employees and regularly solicit feedback to raise the bar. 20 days PTO, 401k match, transportation, lawyers!? ( I don't know much about this), probably other cool stuff I'm forgetting.
* The positive impact on the environment from the software along with DocuSign's additional efforts in protecting the environment are inspiring.
* Employee Resource Groups and DocuSign's efforts to promote diversity in both leadership and non-leadership positions is great. I have a ton of respect for the way Tom Casey, our SVP of Engineering, dives into a lot of challenging conversations and is willing to change his thinking when challenged.
* DocuSign really does care a lot about trust, security, and respecting our user's privacy. I respect that I have not had to implement any features that are user-unfriendly/hostile. People actually care.","* I would not recommend DocuSign as a place to start one's career as a software engineer. Depending on your team, you might often work on code that is quite dated. While it is a good place to work, at some point, you'll probably want to move on, and the experience you'll have gained here might not be ideal for moving on to that next position.
* Engineering feels fragmented. Questions that feel like they should have a general, company-wide answer, sometimes require going from team to team to get an answer.
* Our process for planning and delivering new features is not agile at all. DocuSign is so focused on protecting its core business and maintaining its SLAs that new development can often be hindered as a result. I think there's potential to create more efficient paths forward for smaller products.
* Deadlines can be aggressive. I don't feel overworked, but I do feel a general sense of disappointment from often not measuring up to what DocuSign wants us to accomplish.
* Career advancement can depend on the visibility and success of your project."

ERGs are extremely active and allow us all to feel welcome and connected (esp for those who have always worked from home).

529,DocuSign,Baffling,2021-01-23,1.0,Software Development Engineer,"DocuSign is very empathetic and provides employees with work life balance emphasis. Releases are also very slow, so there isn't much stress in trying to deliver in a timely manner. DocuSign engineering is also very political - so it is also very easy to dodge work by playing politics. It's a great place if you are looking for a 10-5 job, don't care about technical growth, and make a career out of politicking with other B-player engineers and managers. The stock is also doing well, so you can expect something cushy if you do end up working there.","As I read through the 5 star reviews from engineering, I can't think of how DocuSign can seriously be a 5-star place from an engineering perspective. The tech stack is severely outdated and everything is monolithic. All the main services have different release cadences which makes it a nightmare to release new features and bug patches in a timely manner. There is also a very silly ""change request"" form and a ""release form"" that need to be filled out and ironically are done through the DocuSign product that gate the release process. I found this to be very ineffective, as these forms usually took a long time to be approved, and didn't stop the number of fires and rollbacks on a frequent basis. As another reviewer also has mentioned - DocuSign believes in reinventing the wheel when it comes to tooling. Everything from deployment tools, monitoring, test automation, feature flagging, and other infrastructure was done through poorly written home grown tools. It's a joke how any engineer can grow their technical skills here - personally speaking, I spent more time politicking in meetings than coding, which is why I regret having been at DocuSign for so long.

DocuSign engineering also has a culture of blame. Instead of solving problems together, people have this bunker mentality to blame other teams or individuals for fires rather than actually work together to prevent these things from happening. It goes to show how silly this place is. I recommend only coming here if you are looking for work life balance above everything else, if you want to do your engineering career a favor, look elsewhere."

We're at an exciting time for our company, transitioning to a multi-product company, with all the opportunities, and challenges, that this brings
Plenty of room for continued growth - our total addressable market is $50B and this year we'll get to $1B in Revenue (so, being the biggest player out there in this space, this suggests plenty of room to grow)

I hate seeing other reviews on here of people complaining about unrealistic targets or whatever. It’s sales. Don’t be in sales if you can’t handle the heat!

They are apparently under the erroneous impression that being good with technical matters is equal to being a good leader. 

My role was downgraded from salaried to hourly with no notice or recourse.  Seems like an attempt to offset budgets through attrition (better to have people just quit on you, right?).

Developer culture is exactly what you'd expect it to be--toxic--the same as some other publicly criticized tech companies (like Facebook or Microsoft). They've actually brought in a number of people from Microsoft, so that company's infamously toxic culture is now taking solid root at DocuSign and is widely unchecked (any behavior towards colleagues is permitted as long as you make the company money!). Cronyism is amok; everyone is a ""Director"" at DocuSign--it's laughable. Diversity in engineering is a joke, apparently only white and Asian people can do the job.

Company pretends like it cares about employees but it's just PR-- they are constantly asking people to review them favorably here on Glassdoor, especially if the person has been with the company under a year.

551,DocuSign,DocuSign listens to,2020-02-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Upper management and execs seem to absolutely care about their employees. There are plenty of opportunities to give feedback, whether it's within your team, about benefits, or onboarding. For instance, they recently increased the transit subsidy after receiving a lot of comments on it.  Our CEO  even makes the effort to visit non-West coast offices and talk to employees. 

I also appreciate that managers are required to go through training to ensure they are guiding and helping develop their team effectively. Benefits are excellent and the culture is welcoming and transparent. 

It's exciting to be here as the company grows in headcount and the product offering gets bigger and better. Personally my team is flexible about work hours and working from home. Managers trust their employees and value work life balance. Not to mention the array of snacks and stocked fridge is a good reason to come to the office!",Can be difficult to keep up with frequent product changes. Only some teams get catered lunch weekly

BIPOC are frequently policed for various reasons by HR (and more frequently fired or disciplined), there are few (if any) opportunities available for upward advancement and mentorship, 0 BIPOC are on the DocuSign Board, at the C-Suite level or even at the SVP or Senior Director levels; the ""D&I Team"" consists of two people and Employee Resource Groups are weak and powerless ""extracurriculars"".

565,DocuSign,Exciting product with tremendous growth opportunities,2020-11-30,5.0,Human Resources,"Responsible leadership, exciting products, growth potential",becoming more process oriented and political
566,DocuSign,Top place to work for a reason,2020-06-28,5.0,Product Designer,"DocuSign scores highly on the fundamental elements that constitute an ideal work environment:

→ Culture: There is a friendship first, open culture that emphasizes learning, promotes socializing, provides support, recognizes effort, celebrates accomplishments, compliments quality and induces inspiration.

→ Flexibility: The company and managers are very accommodating of schedules and worktime which shows their trust in employees. No need to clock-in and you can always leave the office to make your doctor's or vet's appointment. Not to mention you are more than welcome to work-from-home any day.

→ People: Co-workers at DocuSign are a pleasure to learn, work and grow with. Here, people accept you for who you are, value relationships, and genuinely care about each other.

→ Transparency:  Even though DocuSign is growing rapidly, the leadership is very approachable and provides opportunities to ask questions. They collect constant feedback, acknowledge problems and opportunities to improve and actively work to get better.

→ Reasonable and Focused: The company is prudent in spending it’s resources. It does not squander money on unnecessary lavish parties. Although there are many events, offsites and team-bonding hangouts which add to the culture, the spending is always balanced and kept in check

→ Business: The business, mission, and values of the company is something to be proud of. They are working to eliminate paper, which is great for the environment and transforming businesses, small and large, by helping them automate their contracting processes through the Agreement Cloud which is a great product the digital future.

→ Fun: Besides your day job, there are opportunities to volunteer for causes, join informal and formal clubs, and contribute to Employee Resource Groups.","Not many but there are some that the company can improve on:

→ Workplace amenities: The offices don't have great amenities and can definitely modernize the interiors. More, better co-working spaces, lounges, healthcare assistance on site, and areas to play would be a great addition.

→ Pay and Perks: Although benefits are great, the perks program doesn't offer much and has limited usable local options. Base pay is good but not great, it falls around the 80-85 percentile mark of the market but considering it's a top place to work, seeing it above the 90th percentile would be great.

→ Product and Resourcing: Resourcing is a concern sometimes as with any growing company and priorities are often assigned to product areas that add features which means that refining and modernizing the fundamentals has to take the back seat sometimes."

576,DocuSign,DocuSign is Truly Special,2020-06-26,5.0,Marketing,"DocuSign is a truly special company. We have a product that delivers real value, improves the experience for customers and employees alike, and make an environmental impact. Working for a company where people routinely say ""I LOVE DocuSign"" really doesn't get old.

Equally important is the quality of the leadership team. When they say they want DocuSign to be a place for people to do the ""work of their lives,"" they back it up. There is a real investment in employees and their well-being. No company is perfect, and our leadership knows that; but, they walk the walk and consistently demonstrate their commitment to employees.

And, while the company is firing on all cylinders we're not resting on our laurels. Expanding from eSignature to a broader Agreement Cloud to address the entire agreement process is opening new opportunities for growth while delivering real value for customers.

Finally, the company's response to Covid19 has only served to reinforce how special this place is. The company has gone above and beyond to ensure employees are able to try to find normalcy while finding ways to make it easier to work from home productively. If there was ever a doubt about DocuSign, leadership's response to this cleared things up.

I feel very fortunate to work for a company like DocuSign. It's a special company.","No company is perfect and DocuSign is no exception. That said, the majority of the cons can be attributed to the company's success and rapid growth. 

For example, internal processes are not always right-sized as the company keeps pace with growth. Some processes are lacking, relics from when the company was smaller. Other processes are probably too much, as the company looks to future-proof for when we're larger. That said, even here improvements are being made.

Honestly, DocuSign is a really good place to work."

DocuSign tends to promote managers that are consistently critiqued and disliked. It's almost as though the less you are liked, the more DocuSign wants to promote you. Culture is toxic, management feeds into this and has a blind kool-aid view as if we are the same company that we were in 2010. News flash - times have changed. Rip the bandaid off and get rid of poor leadership.

Literally no training. None. If you are not being promoted internally please do not waste your time interviewing here. If think that jumping into a sales career here is a good move, I promise you it is not. Go elsewhere (you'll absolutely be paid more, have more training, and can almost guarantee you'll have better management).

648,DocuSign,"Grow, compete and collaborate!",2020-01-10,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"1) The people: Throughout the organization it is clear that DocuSign excels at hiring quality people. From Exec’s to my fellow SDR’s everyone treats each other with respect and empathy. 

2) The SDR role: As a young sales person learning the cycle effectively can be tedious and energy draining. At DocuSign, they don’t fire you if you’re underperforming or in a rut. They encourage you to make little improvements! Lead distribution, the Sandler method and potentially collaborating (see cons) with AE’s & fellow XDR’s are all huge benefits of being an SDR at DocuSign!

3) Benefits: Coming straight out of college a big fear of many young people today are the hidden cost of being an adult. Insurance, DocuSign has you covered! Commuting to work, DocuSign mitigates the cost! Wanting to make a healthy habit, DocuSign will pay for your gym membership!

Overall, get on LinkedIn and ask SDR’s currently at DocuSign there thoughts on these Pros. They’ll all agree!","27 month minimum to be an AE

Moving to an AM or making a lateral move in the company is very competitive

DocuSign under pays in the sales role compared to other Tech companies. Though it’s an easier sell, has better benefits than the majority and has stock plan/401k match that will help you retire. So take this point with a grain of salt!"

I believe feedback is taken seriously and changes/actions are taken based on the feedback provided. Good benefits (time off, insurance, etc). Pay is low.",Pay is low. Promotions or role change can be tricky if you don't want to be in sales.

Eventually I couldn’t work there unless I was gonna fight her so I quit. Then I heard she got promoted after i left smh. 

Many black employees had similar experiences during this time and were basically forced to quit.

- Great team of people. Fun. Down to Earth. Helpful. Kind. 
- Easy to achieve quota when in the right industry/geographic region (see cons)","- If you're not in the right vertical, sales can be extremely difficult hence makes it hard to hit quota. Alternatively, if you're in a good vertical (i.e. lucrative industry or wealthy/hi-tech city/state) you can make a lot of money. You have no control over this, so when it sucks it really sucks. When I worked here, quota wasn't adjusted for different verticals based on these factors , so it made for a very uneven playing field. 

- Very fratty environment. And while everyone is really nice, most people don't want to work in a frat house. 

- Not as many benefits offered when compared to other successful tech companies in SF (i.e. minimal rideshare credits, no every day lunch, etc...)"

Accounting-Specific:
The great culture at DocuSign doesn't apply to the Accounting department. Accounting is still under the old-school ship who does not trust your professionalism.

-managers are constantly given leadership-training opportunities 
-attainable quotas
-incredibly supportive and fun coworkers
-work/life balance is essential - able to make your own schedule for the most part, and when things come up, managers are understanding 
-from entry level sales position, have ability to move into BD, account management, sales ops, leadership roles","-pay for entry level roles is fairly similar to other tech firms, but grows immensely with every promotion"
709,DocuSign,Exactly what I was hoping for!,2018-07-17,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"DocuSign treats there employees like adults and I just love that.  Not every company in the Bay Area does this. They are super flexible with you, if you need to work remotely for whatever reason you can.  

The management level here has been awesome and that's not again always the case for big companies. Transparency is key and they know how to respectfully be transparent while also helping you as individuals get to your next career goals. 

 The benefits are amazing as you can see from the reviews. They pay 100%  of medical and dental and vision, that's not heard of in most companies in the Bay Area. They stock the fridges with tasty healthy snacks, although I wish they had oatmeal like they do in Seattle (hint hint). They offer generous Maternity leave, 6 months which is honestly needed, 3 months is too short for any new mother. 

The overall vibe is a collaborative space and most people truly want to be here and that is what contributes to the great cultural. 

Our CEO Dan Springer is such a breath of fresh air! He truly cares about the employees here and you can tell because he's so open and honest. He doesn't sugar coat anything and listens.  Bravo!","The commuter benefits (which they have) could be a little more, by an extra 20-30 dollars. The only benefit they are really missing is a gym allowance.  That would be great to have! Most companies offer anything between 70-100 dollars a gym to stay active and healthy. DocuSign is so committed to a balanced work life balance so I'm surprised they don't have this perk."

Free snacks

Office space crammed 
My team was aloof to my joining and it continued throughout the time I was there. My direct manager was great but the other members were cold and uninviting. Hard to get things done that way. Other comments were right saying it’s a frat/sorority culture. 
Communication between departments needs improvement; everyone is worried about their agenda and definitely has an “I” attitude. 
You’re either going to fit into the culture and love it or feel unwelcomed and like an outsider. 
Not a fan of Docusign’s pushiness for current employees to review them on Glassdoor so that they can be on top."

721,DocuSign,Horror show,2019-10-11,2.0,Senior Account Manager,"RSUs, excellent customer success organization, amazing product.

Great career starter for anyone under 30.","If you are a seasoned Account Manager, think twice before choosing DocuSign.

Poor sales leadership, no training for managers, very young, very inexperienced. Toxic work culture for Account Managers. Management has created a shadow culture of favoritism, nepotism, and hostility against the rest. Management has no longitudinal view of their business. Everything is a scramble, everything is due yesterday. 

Account Managers have to smile, have ""yes men"" mentality, and are worked night and day. No real recognition or career pathing. Career discussions are merely a charade designed to target AMs who have low job satisfaction. 

Many AMs are treated poorly by their AE ""partners"", and AM leadership will not have your back. AMs are a ""junk drawer"" for the activities that AEs don't want to do. AEs and RVPs have all the power. AMs are not empowered, have responsibility for accounts/renewals/growth quota, but no authority, as the AEs are the relationship ""owners"". This creates an intrinsic conflict, and there are no ROEs or swim lanes.

No deal desk, unrealistic quotas, book shuffle ever few months, which makes relationship development a challenge. I was told I would be managing 40 accounts when I started, at one point I had over 90.

If you need help internally, good luck. ""Everyone for themselves"" mentality, instilled and reinforced by leadership.

Fyi: employees are instructed and pushed to give Glassdoor reviews right out of the gate, before they've even really start the job."

It's transformational and we're saving them millions along the way. That's powerful.

We have amazing leadership. Extremely experienced people that are taking this company to new heights. 

The company is growing and there's a feeling of excitement - we're creating a category and racing to claim global leadership in the space. which also means there's a ton of growth ahead an an opportunity to grow with the company.

People here are smart and excited to come to work and crush it. which makes for a great environment. It's a very collaborative environment and I feel I can speak my mind and will be taken seriously.

Our product is both consumer facing and enterprise facing, so you get to learn both sides of this business, which is great. 

We're still private. That means some upside as well as more flexibility in how we go to market.","While we're still private, we're not really a ""startup"" anymore. The company is growing at a rapid pace and we just crossed the 2,000 employee mark. That means we have some pains as we look to bring structure without loosing nimbleness.
One area that needs to catch up with our growth is Development. I work in a pretty unique part of the company, so can only speak from my own experience, but I feel the company needs to do a better job at making the career path clear, and offer training to help people be ready for their next step in their career in the company."

726,DocuSign,A vision that yields happy customers and employees,2017-10-09,5.0,Director,"In my role, I interview a lot of people who often ask the question, ""What makes DocuSign culture special?"" Short answer: the product and the people.

Long story: The problem that DocuSign resolves is one that everyone from a grandparent to the CEO of a large company understands, so whether you're talking to a customer who recently implemented the product or a person you've just met explaining what you do for a living, the response to DocuSign is a responding, ""Wow! I love your company and the product!"" Working for an organization that yields that emotional response is very validating. Our mission and our product change business culture, improve efficiencies, and truly make people's lives simpler and easier. Everyone can appreciate that, and I think that feeling extends into the second thing that makes DocuSign's culture special, the people. 

The people who work at DocuSign are smart, driven, and well-rounded. If you're looking for a place where you feel like a small fish in a big pond, surrounded by talent that will elevate your game, this is the spot. There are very few gaps in organizational effectiveness, and it's fun to interact with departments and orgs within the company, knowing that you're working with a truly best-in-class group.  But, the company is in no way done growing and evolving, so there are certainly problems that can be resolved and areas where smart people can make a meaningful impact.","With so many interdependent departments and processes, evolving some of the areas of inefficiency can be arduous. Mature markets, such as NA, may consider engaging with consultancies to solve some of the bigger organizational challenges."

The growth of the company provides a delightful array of technical challenges and opportunities, allowing engineers to grow in many directions and remain versatile and leverage multiple stacks (.NET, Node.js, etc.) in interesting combinations.

The company is poised for a great deal of continued growth and employs a number of very intelligent engineers, making it a delight to work here as a software engineer. The benefits offered to employees are also quite substantial.","While DocuSign is growing quickly, it is also working through normal growing pains, including how to organize and manage teams and priorities. There is also a tendency within the Engineering organization to form cliques amongst employees that worked together in other large companies; while not an outright problem, it does complicate making clear evaluations of software / technology as they apply to DocuSign, rather than the company at which that clique previously worked (e.g. ""we tried this at X and it didn't work out so well, so we will avoid that here."").

There are also limited opportunities for advancement as the company is still growing and has not yet established a clear track for career growth. Additionally, compensation - while the overall package is quite substantial - is lower in terms of raw salary than others. These issues are not uncommon for a growing company, but are still present."

There are many technical spaces to work in with lots of interesting challenges.  Leadership is good at aligning peoples interests and kills with problems and then letting them run with the solution and implementation.

The product management folks I work with are great at what they do.  They know the product, what we need to do next and how to help engineering get there.

Flex schedules are a real thing.  People work from home and/or work schedules that fit their life so long as they are available in the office or online during core hours for collaboration.  

Pay isn't as competitive as some other large tech companies, but the trade off is that you work with an engineering team where you know everyone.   There's a lot to be said for that, especially when it comes time to get things done quickly

Aside from being good at the core things that I value at an employer, there are are nice perks you would find at a startup.  Free food and beverages, donuts and bagels on Friday, beer on tap, very nice facilities with great collaboration spaces, scooters, team outings, etc.","Very high work tempo from time-to-time can get you a little burned out, but that's true for any companies doing great things.

2.  Work balance - hours are reasonable and flexible.  I am able to drop off the kids, get into the office a bit later, leave a bit early to pick up the kids, then get back online at night for an hour or two to catch up.

3.  Amenities - there's lots of snacks and food if you don't have time to go out to eat.  It's not a full on cafeteria, though they frequently have events with food, but you can easily make a sandwich if you have back to back meetings.

4.  Work tools - the laptops are decent quality and they have a variety of tools available to do your job.  I've worked at places where the tools are subpar and it's a pain to do the simplest tasks like submit an expense.","1.  Growing pains - there is some chaos but expected for a growing company.  Consistency is not there yet in terms of how things get done.  Some people are bothered by this but I happen to prefer it because it's an opportunity to do the work yourself.

Treat me (a female) different from the other male employees. When I brought this to HR, DocuSign was so interested in making sure there wasnt a lawsuit that no one really cared about how I felt. 
I was also once called entitled by a VP of a department for asking to be compensated the same as the rest of the team. Background, I am the youngest on the team. The response: I was called entitled. And even though this VP apologized, I will never forget the feeling of hating the fact that I was young and just wanted to be treated like everyone else.

745,DocuSign,"Team focused, empowering to employees",2016-08-08,5.0,Account Manager,"I've worked for a lot of companies, but DocuSign is the first place that I've felt like they actually WANT people to stay here for a long time. They aren't trying to burn you out and then toss you aside like many tech startups. There is a proven track-record of promoting from within, investing in employees (For example - just started a masters level leadership program through the University of Washington as a free benefit to leaders within the company).
Leadership is thoughtful, caring, and respectful of their employees and truly committed to seeing them succeed, and not only succeed, but be happy and fulfilled. 
The pay is fair and they do what they can to add perks throughout the quarter, but they're not throwing money into stupid things like bean bags and razor scooters just to make it seem like this is a cool place to work. It's just a good place to work and people want to come and give their best.
Plus, it's a pre-IPO company that is poised to have a great public launch.","There is getting to be a bit more corporate feel (more levels of approval to get a deal done). Comes with the territory as a company gets bigger and more successful, but it does slow things down a bit."

It is notoriously difficult to get hired here, but once in, you see why: Teams that get along incredibly well, management that acknowledges their own struggles and works towards commonly set goals, and pay/benefits that truly lead the industry. And we work at a verb.

Pros:
-Benefits are top notch like Aetna health plans at 100% paid, time off starting at 4 weeks, paid parental leave (SIX MONTHS!), flexible scheduling, and more
-Managers who genuinely care. Almost no one leaves due to a DocuSign issue.
-Advancement is likely if desired.
-Flexibility in scheduling.
-Our CEO is seriously inspirational. He is direct, honest, and passionate.
-Regular town hall meetings with both CEO and departmental SVP's, whom you can ask very blunt/direct questions and get thoughtful responses. I've been at places where these meetings were mostly for show - not here. They care and it shows.","-Work from home is common in most departments except for Account Management, where it is limited to one day a week after one year.

Not too many underachievers, and everyone does seem to strive to do their best work.  The market opportunity for the company is huge, and they're the leader in the space, just a matter of execution. Compensation is relatively competitive (but do negotiate).  Starting to get some better enterprise collaboration tools, but those are still relatively immature in their implementation.","Definitely feels more like a Seattle company than a SF Bay Area company. They'll tell you that they're HQ'd in SF, but a sizable chunk (maybe even half) are still in Seattle where they started, so don't expect to work face-to-face with a lot of colleagues. Video conferencing is in its infancy here, so it makes dealing with remote folks even more difficult, especially since the rooms aren't enabled for VC and nothing is integrated. Similarly, if you're expecting large, Silicon Valley company-like perks and benefits, look elsewhere. Healthcare is decent, but really for employee-only -- definitely gets more expensive if you try to add children or a spouse. Additionally, they don't provide any kind of meals so you'll be on your own for that. Likewise, they still use PTO instead of unlimited time off, and that includes your sick days. There are no company shutdowns either so expect to have to use all of your PTO and have a full inbox waiting for you when you return.  For a company as small as it is there's an incredible amount of red tape surrounding processes and technology -- to the point where it can make it very difficult to get actual business done. Definitely a squeaky wheel gets the grease/escalation culture, so be on the lookout for that."

758,DocuSign,Everyone should apply here,2019-07-15,5.0,Marketplace Development Representative,"Excellent working environment, offer employees great benefits that keep everyone motivated. Train their employees to be consistently successful more than any other company I've worked for.",The different offices all have different styles to them that some maybe friendlier than others.
759,DocuSign,Love it!,2019-07-15,5.0,Market Development,DocuSign really lives up to the expectations for company culture & work/life balance. I have been here for less than a year and each day brings a new opportunity to build and invest in your career.,No cons for me so far!
760,DocuSign,Micromanagement - a case study in a startup,2019-09-24,3.0,Senior Account Manager,Wonderful concept within the company of driving a new strategy for movement of important documents to the cloud,"Micromanagement. Lack of recognition, High stress, High pressure. Undermarket wages. Executive bickering and too much politicking."
761,DocuSign,Software Engineer - bait and switch!,2019-08-27,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Nice office, good snacks, good view depending on your floor (Seattle). Onboarding experience is mostly good.","I was told by recruiting that there is catered lunch Mon/Wed. This is only for the product team which I found out after I started.
Software engineering standards are antiquated at best, don't expect to see any current best practices. People here (except sales) are mostly not very social, and are pretty heads-down. Work hours are not flexible."
762,DocuSign,Fun,2016-06-21,5.0,Corporate Account Executive SMB,"Awesome product, massive customer base, and great vision for the future & trying to go public. You can really feel the energy and there's an incredibly strategic way DocuSign is approaching the next two years with the impending tech bubble. We don't spend money on extravagant things, but have covered benefits, free snacks & lunch meat/sandwich food, happy hours each Friday, standing/moving desks, etc. It doesn't feel like we're missing out on some of the startup ""perks"" that seem frivolous when becoming profitable is SO much more important. Company focused on longevity (13+ years already!) and really digging into vertical markets. 

Sales is a great group of people, mostly referrals from other employees. Lots of ex- Salesforce & Oracle people looking for a change of pace but not too startup-like... SMB group is younger (mostly <30) and growing quickly, with excellent management.","There is a bit of competition between the Sales team and the Website / Self Service team, which is kind of unheard of -- almost a bit of cannibalization competition internally. Just something to be aware of for the Sales team. Also, the team isn't nearly as drinking-heavy happy hour all the time as a lot of other companies, which honestly can be a good thing. Everyone works their 8-9 hours and goes home, really good work life balance and people keep it professional."
763,DocuSign,3 years in and still loving it,2016-06-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The product is amazing and the global opportunity is massive.  NPS scores of DocuSign rival Amazon and Apple..almost unheard of for a company who's main focus is Enterprise.
The people are smart, results driven but respectful.  Everyone is rowing in the same direction and the culture is one of collaboration vs sharp elbows.
We are growing aggressively (lots of opportunity to advance) and great to be the market leader.
We have upgraded the talent across the board from the earlier days and have some amazing leaders who can take us to a $1B plus company.
The CEO and the leaders genuinely care about the employees.
Work/life balance.  My experience here is that I have the flexibility I want as long as I deliver.  I think this is true across the company.  It is not a culture of ""butt in seat"" 14 hours a day. You can feel comfortable leaving early if you need to catch your child's play or sporting event and it's encouraged.","Hyper growth is not easy.  We have offices in SF, SEA, Dublin, London, Tokyo, Sydney, Paris, Tel Aviv and Sao Paulo. Systems, process and training are all playing catch up to the growth of the company.  We have invested in the right tools and systems but need to implement globally to make it easier to do the actual work."
764,DocuSign,"Challenging, Rewarding, and Enjoyable",2013-04-16,5.0,Direct Sales,"DocuSign is a truly great place to work, populated by talented people who work hard but have fun doing so. There is strong leadership in all parts of the business and the company has evolved its career path model to create opportunities for internal promotions that reward top performers. From a sales perspective the product is market leading, the customer growth is strong, and the market opportunity spans company size and industry. There are ample resources made available to drive sales results, including technology tools (LinkedIn, Eloqua, etc.), sales support (Sales Engineers, Managers, product experts, legal), and materials (presentations, demo's, case studies, etc.). It is a company designed to aid in goal achievement.","The biggest cons of the company are a result of accelerated growth and expectations. The company is growing and moving fast, and that can lead to a few cut corners or missed opportunities."
765,DocuSign,Pragmatists honest review,2018-10-08,5.0,Senior Software Engineering Manager,"The people here really try to live the values the company  espouses.  As a manager I can see the effort my peers in ""middle management"" try to be coaches, and really make an effort to address life balance, growth, diversity.   When there is conflict, it is healthy in that people have their hearts in what they think is best, vs a political agenda ( at least in Engineering ).  Life balance is great.  Folks have a focused 8 hour day and leave at reasonable times.  The realities of commuting and costs of living in the bay area is a reality we don't take for granted.  Working from home 1 to 2 days a week is not an exception, it's a norm.  If you are working late on a regular basis, then something has failed, it is not heroic.

we are in a high growth phase so with growth there is opportunity in many facets ( comp, career, learning )

I feel my most comfortable self here, which may be an artifact of my time in career as well, but for the most part I don't feel like I have to fit a certain persona to be accepted as compared to previous companies.","with growth can come some growing pains
we need to get better at not just doing things they way they were done before...for a relatively small company we have some slow legacy internal processes
Our Jira setup could be a lot more efficient."
766,DocuSign,Supportive Environment,2019-08-19,5.0,Sales,"-High energy and fun place to work
-Very supportive 
-Everyone wants you to succeed, even your peers","-Long hours 
-No flexibility with working from home"
767,DocuSign,I would give more stars if I could!,2018-05-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"DocuSign defines work life balance - work from home options & flexible work hours.
Excellent product - we truly make our customer's life easy.
Great pay package (base pay, bonus, RSU ) and benefits (free insurance, employee events, free food & beverages!)
Upper management have a very clear goal and are driven to achieve it.
Really smart and easy to work with colleagues.
DocuSign IMPACT is in everyone's DNA. They are always looking for ways to give back. 
Amazing Parental leave - 6 months paid leave for the primary caregiver & 2 months paid leave for the non-primary caregiver.
They really listen! This is the only company where the CEO reads every single survey feedback, and takes action based on inputs given directly by employees.
They take fixing the diversity and gender gap very seriously, and are actively working towards improving it across the industry and not just the company.","Needs more established leveling of roles within organizations.
Improve commuter benefits."
768,DocuSign,Really fun,2019-09-03,5.0,SDR,"Fun culture, good benefits, good snacks","Extremely low pay, unorganized at times"
769,DocuSign,Love it!,2019-07-15,5.0,Market Development Representative,"People at DocuSign are actually supportive, friendly, and caring. Such a great work environment where managers and co-workers want to see you succeed and help you - always.",I would say the commute benefit
