1,Estée Lauder Companies,"Good benefits & work/life balance, Poor pay & opportunity for growth",2022-04-03,3.0,Analyst Package Development,"Good work life balance, 35 hour work week, 13 company holidays + half days before many of the holidays, Summer Fridays, gratis, company discount, good mentorship can be found if you know where to look and the right people to ask.","Pay is decently less than the average in the industry, with only a 2% inflation pay raise once a year, (with the exception of no raises, inflation or otherwise during 2020) unless you receive a promotion. Promotion pay raise was surprisingly low at 8%. Any type of movement in the company takes multiple lateral moves before receiving a vertical promotion. Company promotes ""stretch assignments"" which are a nice way of giving someone two or more jobs but the Company does not allow the work, knowledge or experience gained in these stretch assignments to be used for internal lateral moves to another department. Any type of internal movement or promotion can take incredibly long, two years in my experience."
2,Estée Lauder Companies,Company cares even during tough times,2022-01-07,5.0,Regional Education Trainer,"I do love working for the corporation. There is a lot of opportunity to move around within different brands, within corporate as well as within the global department. They also know how to take care of their employees especially in the upper field positions. There are many perks such as a company car, gratis rewards, random bonus incentives, etc. Even during the tough economic times right now with Covid there has been a lot of restructuring that has had to happen that most businesses have had to do. Estée Lauder companies has really done it in a classy way of making sure that the people that they’ve had to let go that they’ve taken care of really well as well as they are quick to try to bring people back as soon as similar positions open up for them.",Because the retail landscape is changing so much that means staffing and restructuring Hass to happen quite often unfortunately. It does leave you feeling uncertain about your job at times because in the past five years the organization has seen continuous restructuring’s in the US. About 10 years ago there was a lot more job security than there is in today’s times.

It starts with the Leadership Team. ( Toxic, self-absorbed, out of touch with reality).
It is a top-down company. You have the toxic (all hands off) leaders in seats pulling the strings ( only their self interest in heart). If you are not in that group then you are just a number! 

Don't join this company if you have career goals. If you want to stay in the company just find your circle and hope you are in the right group. If not, just buckle up for real life Game of Thrones."

1. They formed a medical advisory board to provide scientific / medicine driven guidance with regards to safety procedures / reopening.
2. They increased additional benefits for backup care and mental wellness
3. They provided special masks to all onsite employees

The general benefits in terms of compensation is pretty good. If you're eligible for a bonus it can be a pretty significant portion of your base salary (5%-25%) and depending on your level and the year you are eligible for equity (5% - 25%).

I enjoyed interacting with customers and helping them solve skincare or makeup problems to feel more confident.","As the retail industry has gradually converted to more online sales, the company started making better offers online, that we could not compete with in the store, which seemed to strengthen customer tendencies to refill online. As a result, the opportunities for in-store sales declined, making it nearly impossible to make our goals. Even special events don't bring in nearly as many people anymore.
Also, less and less funds were used for training employees, which started to make us all feel like we were not as valued. When I started, we trained at nice hotels with nice meals and lots of product samples. When I left, training was in cheap locations (or back rooms) with cheap food (if any), fewer samples."

If you reach out continuously for what you need, you’ll eventually get an answer. 
Some higher-ups may not care to look into personnel issues since they don’t have to deal with that person daily.

- The company prioritizes leadership / executives, instead of cultivating young talent
- Teams are overburdened since open positions never seem to be back-filled, before you know it you will be working two jobs
- The job description rarely matches up with the day to day expectations and what you will ultimately be doing in the role
- When filling jobs, they are looking for people who have already worked and held that level of role (aka for a Manager role, usually they want someone who has already been a manager for years and has likely outgrown that role)"

The company really tries to save money by hiring many temps so they don't have to pay for the benefits. 

Temps enjoy light workload and a set 9-5, mon-fri daily schedule while enjoying the benefits of having a prestigious brand/company in their resumé. Since by law, the company cannot have temps do the same job as permanent employees, the permanent employees have to do the heavy lifting. 

For permanent members, having calls and meetings at 8pm or later is pretty common. I've heard some people had to work until 2am! Can you imagine being worked to the bone like that? (S*ckers)

To be fair, permanent members do enjoy higher pay and benefits but if you calculate the pay on hourly basis, I believe the pay comparison ends up quite similar.

And temps get to enjoy the same benefits of having the prestigious name of Estée Lauder Companies, the global leader of prestige beauty, in their resumé.",The day gets boring sometimes but not really an issue considering the benefits that come with it.

The company promote from within and transfer rather than exhaust.  A very successful intranet where any associate can read in on what is going on with the company as a whole.  A very well kept office environment where it is clean and a friendly atmosphere","In terms of MY specific department and brands I work in.  The work-life balance feels to have gone off due to the leadership being very successful and into their work loads the culture shift is an all work attitude.  Many leaders come in while they are sick.  The hours of operation are well into the evening hours - past 615p or so.  However I can only speak for the specific floor I am on.  No ""break room"" - no cafeteria to sit down and have your lunch away from your desk.  Many, associates eat their lunch at the desk and it is normal to have your lunch interrupted.  A break room is needed as not all people want to go out and eat their lunch, especially during the winter time - however, taking a full lunch break is frowned upon and almost impossible as many meetings are scheduled during lunch, too."
