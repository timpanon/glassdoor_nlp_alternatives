0,Fidelity Investments,Fantastic company,2021-12-01,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Accommodating, training and growth are big. If you take your development serious it is a good company to be at.",Networking is key. Must network to have good career development.
1,Fidelity Investments,"Tough job, Great Opportunities",2022-04-04,5.0,Financial Associate II,Great training and benefits. Leadership cares about associates. D and I focused.,Very metric driven. Customers can be rude and demanding.
2,Fidelity Investments,Great career-starting company,2018-06-11,5.0,QA Engineer,Benefits including profit sharing and bonuses are great. The breadth of this company provides a great opportunity to try out different career paths or boost your current one.,"In my current role, I am working overtime more often than I'd like with recognition that seems to only go so far until it sizzles out. That may be tied to the size of the company itself, where promotions work in a ""trickle down"" manner."
3,Fidelity Investments,Grow career and skills - then proactively leave,2022-04-04,2.0,Account Executive,"Profit sharing is the best in industry - you need to stay 5 years to keep it
Career growth and training is excellent - as long as you know the right people
Tuition reimbursement is excellent
Remote work is very nice","Read ""Think Again"" by Adam Grant - Fidelity is one of those companies that does not encourage thinking outside the box. 
Being wrong is not a virtue, nor is humility. 
Egoism thrives at Fidelity. 
Not a safe place for questioning the status quo. 
Do not criticize the process. 
Its all about who you know and not what you know.
Skills development is limited. Once you hit the limit, hit the door on your own and look for a company that encourages personal growth, otherwise you might get stuck in your role with no relevant skills. 
This is a spreadsheet and numbers company, not a people company. 
Your experience is highly dependent on your manager, who likely did not even do your job."
4,Fidelity Investments,Good company with good people,2022-03-30,5.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"The benefits are good, the people are nice, and the company does try hard to take care of the employees. 7% 401k match dollar for dollar and full health care coverage on day one. 25 days of PTO for first year employees.","A lot of people working from home so it is hard to get to know your coworkers. A lot of time on the phones, but I would say 95% of the clients are nice. You have to pass your Series 7 & 63 pretty quick, they let go a few coworkers for not passing on the first try."
5,Fidelity Investments,Great benefits not so great working environment,2022-03-03,3.0,Business Transformation Consultant,"benefits, bonuses, locations, peer expertise levels","not a lot of upward mobility, hybrid agile work environment (can't quite get there), having a hard time competing for high-quality talent, revolving door remote work model"
6,Fidelity Investments,Constant opportunity for development and growth for those who want it,2015-03-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Large, privately held firm with values that are reinforced at all levels of leadership. Career opportunities are ongoing and the vast majority of people at the firm will help you progress if you're willing to do the work.
Fidelity provides exceptional benefits with options based on personal needs and various family situations. While pay and bonus structures are sometimes criticized, being patient will pay off for those who are willing to wait.","Fidelity retail is open 24 hours, causing scheduling conflicts for some candidates
Career tracks within the firm can be limited due to licensing requirements, or lack of licensing flexibility in the groups"
7,Fidelity Investments,"College Grads Beware, this is a call center",2022-03-13,1.0,Anonymous,"benefits, beautiful campus, work life balance","During the interview process, they change the wording to make it seem like it’s not a call center, but it is. We take calls back to back and follow a strict schedule. If we don’t follow the schedule, then we get yelled at by our managers. I was in a post grad rotation program and our managers basically treat us like kids. It’s pretty cringey and not professional. I felt like I was still in high school going through this program and I don’t really feel much growth. I didn’t go through college just to be stuck in a call center role, getting berated by customers on the daily. I felt like I was lied to during the interview process, because they market this opportunity in such a different way. Just tell us straight up that this is a call center and not waste anyone’s time. Majority of the roles within the company are call center positions, so there’s no way getting off the phones. The one thing I don’t understand about this company, is that the pay is so bad, but people are still so enthusiastic about their job, getting yelled at by customers and being “customer obsessed.”It gives off cultish vibes. Anyways, it takes a certain personality to really like being on the phones and following a strict schedule with a timed 30 minute lunch."
8,Fidelity Investments,Fantastic Employer !!,2022-03-31,5.0,Contract Manager,"The company and corporate culture at Fidelity is outstanding. I couldn't imagine a better environment where everyone wants to help each other learn, be successful, and experience different positions. If you are looking for a company that has a fantastic culture this is the company for you.","There are a lot of acronyms used at Fidelity, and a lot of different titles that you will have to learn over time."
9,Fidelity Investments,Wonderful Place To Work,2022-03-31,5.0,Senior Technical Business Analyst,Fidelity is very invested in the success of their employees.  Very collaborative environment with room to explore different career paths.,"Annual bonuses are based on stacked-ranking, which means even if everyone on your team is goes above and beyond or does the work of 2 people, almost all will get ""meets expectations"" and at least one or two exceptional employees will have to be in the ""needs improvement"" bucket."
10,Fidelity Investments,Wow! They call it financial Disneyland for a reason.,2022-03-20,5.0,Client Management Representative,"Too many to list them all. The pay is good, extensive benefits, great training, fast promotions, and a contagious positivity! I have been around a decade in this business at 3 prior firms and none were half as good as fidelity. I am happy to sign on everyday and the relaxed dress code makes me feel comfortable! I could see myself retiring here and that says a lot since I’m 30 years away!",Not one that I have seen thus far.
11,Fidelity Investments,Great place to launch career,2022-04-04,5.0,Accounting Director,so many different types of accounting roles and easy segway into Finance roles,"morale, in the accounting department only, can be a bit dependent on your direct manager's attitudes"
12,Fidelity Investments,Great Culture and Hours,2022-04-04,4.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,CRA is a great place to start and get your licenses. Lots of PTO and an easy job. Pays well for what it is.,"Boring. Many hours of dealing with incompetent elders who can't work a website. No way around using the website, so you are stuck helping them. Not that much room for upward mobility. Stuck at the same role for at minimum 1 year, per contract."
13,Fidelity Investments,"Good Culture, Low Compensation, Weak PTO",2022-02-09,3.0,Director,"Work and life balance is very manageable
Your ability to move within the organization is very high
Generally, the benefits are quite respectable, if not good.","Very low take-home compensation in relation to competitors -- after I moved business units the number of people I talked to who took pay cuts to work at Fidelity was surprising. A variety of reasons for taking the pay cut mind you -- family moves, future opportunities at the firm, disliking their current employer that much, etc.

A very notable alert if you evaluate and offer is that the Paid Time Off is a shared pool between vacation and sick time. You are required to reserve days in case you get sick. If you use too much of either you then have to ""purchase"" additional time. I come from the tech world historically, and this was incredibly surprising. I am not alone in not recognizing that this was the case prior to joining the firm. I, and others, just assumed that PTO was vacation only."
14,Fidelity Investments,Overall a great place to start a career,2022-04-03,5.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,I always feel like I can reach out to any of my colleagues with assistance on a topic I'm not as knowledgeable on.,Rigid way of doing things
15,Fidelity Investments,Great Company,2022-04-04,5.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,Awesome work culture! Great company all around.,Licensing can be a bit of a hassle.

17,Fidelity Investments,Really great company if you do your time.,2022-03-11,5.0,Senior Business Analyst,"Very robust benefit package
-PTO
-Family/adoption benefits
-Tuition reimbursement 
-Medical
Lots of opportunity for growth and development 
They’re investing a lot to stay competitive and it shows.
If you’re in your early 20s get in early and it will do a lot for you.
Generally speaking, there is a lot of good leadership.","Base pay is relatively low for middle management/Sr individual contributor roles compared to other employers. This can make it hard to retain good talent. 

Some managers are incompetent. This serves to the detriment of the team and their goals. 

Bit of an old company but they are going to great lengths to modernize."
18,Fidelity Investments,Not what you think,2022-03-24,2.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,Company will provide additional supplemental income like retention bonuses because they know the job is tough,"Took this job straight out of college thinking I’d be able to move up quickly. But pretty much anything you’ll move into will be another phone role. If you’re looking to move into leadership, don’t bother, they look for mostly outside experience which I literally heard from the mouth of one of the higher-ups. 
Call center work, boring, monotonous, mind-numbing, especially if you WFH and take back-to-back calls for 8 hours a day. I found myself being cursed out, threatened, called incompetent, a criminal, etc by clients which only made it worse"
19,Fidelity Investments,Good experience,2022-04-04,5.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"Good work life balance, training and benefits.",Customer service with constant customer interactions.
20,Fidelity Investments,NOT THE PLACE TO WORK IF YOU ARE A SINGLE PARENT,2022-02-26,1.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,Decent pay and sponsorship for licensing.,"Lack of consideration for single parents who work from home with children. 
If you upset management in any way they will turn their back on you. 
Management should be more considerate and truthful. 
If you use your PTO too soon, but dont go over your limit, they will look to terminate you. 
If you fail the exam one time they will terminate you. 
If you have to take care of your child they will terminate you. 
You put in so much effort and time to study for the Series 7 and if you fail they will look at you badly. 
All in all, if you have a child and are a single parent and think Fidelity will understand if you have to help your child....they WILL NOT and will terminate you if you are a great employee who does their job well."
21,Fidelity Investments,Great place,2022-04-03,5.0,Senior Technical Consultant,Learning Tuesdays are super useful for professional growth,The agile transformation has been painful exclusively due to the scrum masters
22,Fidelity Investments,Glorified call center role,2022-03-01,4.0,SOAR Program Associate,"- Benefits
- 5k employee appreciation pay for all FT employees, regardless of length of employment","Don’t be fooled - this role is literally just working at a call center, but the job description is very vague, and they are very deceptive throughout the interview process in order to make this role seem like more than it is. The first rotation was okay because you got to work in other roles and it wasn’t just a call center position, but in the second rotation, the managers and leads begin to micromanage you and treat you like you’re a child + you’re just taking calls all day every day.. Steer clear of this job if you’re looking for a position that’s not a call center role and will provide you with upward mobility."
23,Fidelity Investments,"Fidelity is a place to work hard, get paid well and enjoy a longterm career.",2022-03-22,5.0,Workplace Planning Consultant III,"7% 401k match, 10% profit sharing. They will pay for licenses (series 7, 66, etc) and other designation, such as CFP.","Long vesting periods - a career company, it pays off but be willing to stick around!"
24,Fidelity Investments,Fidelity,2022-03-23,5.0,Associate Analyst,"Great culture, does not feel like you’re working in a big corp setting. Extremely accommodating during the pandemic.

25,Fidelity Investments,Great Company,2022-04-03,5.0,Investment Solutions Representative,"Values employees, strong benefits, high company morale","Extreme oversight, political in nature"
26,Fidelity Investments,Great to Employees,2022-03-07,5.0,Director of Operations,"Fidelity is great to it's employees and benefits are outstanding. They match 100% of the first 7% in your 401k, give everyone 10% profit sharing, and most people get annual bonuses. It's also hard to get fired. There seem to be quite a few inept managers that do very little and keep their jobs.","On average, the pay is lower than the competition but I think that's why they make up for it with benefits. A lot of bad managers that get passed around but never fired."
27,Fidelity Investments,Stuck on Java,2022-03-24,4.0,Software Engineer,"* More than enough PTO (23 days + 5 days covid/family relief time)
* Deadlines are reasonable for epics and sprints, low stress to get work done on time
* Pay is pretty good for RDU metro area","* Stuck on Java as the primary language. Reasoning for that is legacy code integrates more easily, and they know they can hire for Java. But recent graduates like myself probably don't like using it as much as Python, Go, etc.
* Slow to lay out concrete details for return to office"
28,Fidelity Investments,Great Company to work for.,2022-04-01,5.0,Financial Advisor,Great Benefits. Managers do care about you as a person and help with development.,changing work schedule widely varies.

The only real way to get a raise is to move to a different role within the firm."
30,Fidelity Investments,could be great,2022-02-01,3.0,Processor,"easy to get in through customer service and phone role
decent pay to get out of other lower paying industry. 
decent benefits package 
upward mobility available
there are a lot of people who have been with the company for decades and love it.","self paced training which basically teaches you the bare minimum. 
a lot of trial and error, you learn by making mistakes everyday. 
a lot of research while having time constraints 
its a lot of work. and it can take anywhere from 3 months to a year to stop feeling like a ball of anxious mess, 
theres a certain level of fear mongering that is used to make sure you do the job like they want you too. probably not best if you already struggle with anxiety. it will definitely kick it up a notch... a couple notches. 
they calculate more stats than you can even think of. these stats will be thrown at you daily and you will be asked to explain every bit if its out of the desired window. bonuses and pay increases depend on that. 
if any of these feel like pros to you then it may be the right fit for you."

If you’re in a middle-grade job, even if you’re a top performer and in a money-producing role for the company get ready to be disappointed about raises annually, whereas front-line associates receive multiple lucrative benefits (more bonuses, stock plan benefits, etc) to the point where they are making more than company veterans

Top performers in sales did not get a raise, nor large bonuses, and all the while front line associates are being rewarded MORE!"

41,Fidelity Investments,Good if you need stability,2022-03-19,4.0,Associate Software Engineer,"Things move at a pace that is fast but so fast that you feel overwhelmed. If you need a place to start your career that nudges you forward until you can really take off, this is a great place to work. People with a lot of experience out of the gate coming out of college might feel this is too slow-paced for them but it is still a good place to work for stability.","New ideas are slow to be incorporated on the technology side of the company. If you want to work on the cutting-edge of tech, this is not the place that will offer you that. Big finance companies don't change tech until there are certainties."
42,Fidelity Investments,Fidelity Will Ruin Your IT Career With a Smile,2022-03-21,1.0,,The benefits package is above average.,"Fidelity will destroy an IT carrier.  

They will work you to death on out date tech that won't do you any good outside their doors.  

Manager's are immune to repercussions for their actions. While employees are expected to follow very high standards of conduct.  Discrimination of all forms is common and well accepted by HR.

If you are going to work for Fidelity make sure you fall into a category of person your manager likes, or they will destroy you with the full support of the HR department. 

You also better make sure you don't have kids to take care of, or turn 40.  I worked there for a decade and no one ever retired by choice."

46,Fidelity Investments,Best place I've ever worked,2022-02-09,5.0,Central Relationship Manager,"Benefits, pay, schedule, culture, management are head and shoulders above any other financial firm I have worked for in the past. The job is incredibly reasonable and the pay is significantly above competition. If you can get a job offer from fidelity and you are working for another BD just take it. Upward mobility is real and they push it. If you are happy in your role you can stay in it without absurd changes in metrics. The company is solely customer centric so if you make a suggestion that makes the life of the client better that comes before profits.",I work fully remote so you do miss some human interaction but that is a downside of any fully remote job.

This is a call center role. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
-thousands of zoom calls very pointless
-moving to other departments outside of the call center can be difficult and met with a lot of resistance. You will often hear you have to “pay your dues” before you pursue a career aligned with your degree"

- A lot of focus on learning and development. 4 hours every two weeks is left open for any trainings, lessons, or experiments you are interested in doing.","- The base pay is lower than the market, making you reliant on your end of year bonus to bring it in line.
- Raises are low unless they come attached with a promotion.
- People tend to work at Fidelity for a very long time, which makes it difficult for new talent and ideas to come in and mix things up.
- Fidelity loves to pretend its a tech company, but does not have the technical talent to back it up. This causes there to be a lot of ""flashy"" things like containers and microservices, but not a lot of talent to utilize them fully which can make things worse than traditional architectures."

For many roles, you will have great job security and be extremely well-compensated compared to other companies in the industry doing the same role.

I will say that they do have a vested interest in taking care of their associates and I do feel more valued than I would in other big-name companies.","-Does not sponsor you for licensing unless you are in a role that requires it.

Overall most of the cons can be applied to any big corporate organization.

-Job growth and ability to be promoted within is definitely there, but I have seen some people become stuck in their roles if they stay too long or do not develop skills to move onto the next position. 
- In addition, moving up to management can take quite a while. I have seen it happen within the company, but a large number (especially an overwhelming number of upper-level management) either left the company and came back or were recruited externally. However, this is something that can be seen in almost any company you go to. 

- From the above my experience with management has been great, but I know on some high-intensity teams (such as sales or fund management) can have more stressful managers, but I have not heard anything terrible to note.
-Career center is just incapable"

124,Fidelity Investments,Unhealthy environment,2022-03-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people, the benefits are great","The higher the leadership closest to the top, the more close minded and attached to old school culture they are, trying to force everyone into outdated thinking.  They will also lure you into new roles and lock you down without being honest about what the role really is.  You get “used” as a vessel to push upper leadership personal motivations and accolades, while slowly being quieted down and eventually silenced.  .  It’s just a bunch of senior leaders trying to outshine each other and get their name on something even if it’s not best for the employees.  Will get overwhelming associate feedback in surveys about wanting to work remote and will only tell you about the one comment from someone who wants to be in the office and then try to gaslight you into believing it’s the majority opinion.  Leadership will “threaten” that you’re luck the President is giving you any flexibility because she would prefer not to and force you to give up all of your flexibility if you don’t agree to work in the office sometimes.  Kind of like “ you’re lucky to get anything.  Don’t push your luck or she will take all your toys away.  The culture was going in an amazing direction the past couple of years.

Less than all of the participants are rude and ignorant. You'll always be able to ply your craft because there is always a queue of participants to speak to. The Fidelity RSP 401k match is strong and, coupled with 10 percent profit sharing, makes it very easy to save a lot of money for retirement. So you'll only be poor during your career and not also in a long retirement.","Fidelity wants Workplace Planning and Advice and its Workplace Planning Consultants to refer opportunities to the Investor Center. That's the job. Say whatever you need to get the referral and you'll advance in your career. Any personal ethos of Do what's Right will be compromised in WPA.

Example: Requests for approved time off must be sent in 2 weeks in advance, otherwise time off is an occurrence. If you request time off in the two week advance time period, despite being an emergency request, it may count as an occurrence because Fidelity decides that they will be busy in that day and forces you to take an occurrence if you dare keep your emergency time off that you needed for a doctor visit. This place is all about being an employee revolving door like most call centers. They claim to be family centered business but you will see in time that is not true.

Success is entirely in the hands of your direct manager, so while it depends on who your manager is, largely the culture reinforces doing what the boss says and being very cautious about expressing any alternate perspectives.

282,Fidelity Investments,Great Company for the Ambitious and Energetic,2022-01-24,4.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"Lots of pros! The pay, the perks, and the people are all great. Fidelity has tried really hard to support employees during COVID, through extra paid leave specifically coronavirus-related, counselor-finding services, fun activities and food provided for people who are willing to come back into the office part time during virus lulls.

Fidelity is also working hard on diversity-and-inclusion, and on making sure employees' voices are heard from the ground up. The company supports outside volunteer efforts and onsite environmental initiatives. You can feel good about working for a company that wants to do good, not just do well.","Most people are hired into Fidelity at this position. It's a pretty rigorous process, from submitting the application through multiple interviews. Once you're hired, there are two potential hurdles: first in learning the job then in doing the job.

Oh, the learning process! Even entirely online as it has been since the pandemic, it's kind of fun. There are get-to-know-you activities with your newbie group. But there is also a LOT of information to absorb, and it doesn't let up for months. First you learn the Fidelity systems, then you go through licensing training. You must pass the licensing exams to advance within the company. From hire, this all could take 4-6 months. Yes, they pay you the whole time. Once you're licensed, you alternate more Fidelity-specific classes with actual customer support for a few more months before you settle into full time on the phones. After a few more months of that, you may start applying within the company for new skills and new roles, your options being more self-directed.

So, the cons: the pace of learning is set to warp speed, be prepared! Realize that while you're learning you cost the company quite a bit. It's a lot of stress, but they'll want to push you as fast as they can get you to go. And once you're on the job, well, it depends. Some people like inbound phone customer service, or at least don't mind it. Fidelity customers are usually quite pleasant really. But especially in the busy months, from maybe November through tax season, they can spend more time on hold than they like, which makes them cranky. There will be constant pressure from Fidelity for you to make each call as brief as possible: they will measure both your customer satisfaction stats AND your calls per hour. It can be hard to balance the one against the other. And, this is the job: call after call after call. There are breaks, of course, from weekly team meetings to personal lunch and break time to refresher education. If you can continue in the inbound phones roles long enough, you can eventually get promoted out of it if you choose: perhaps 1-5 years, generally?"

Beware, this is not meant to be a job that you only do for a year or less. Choose this job if you’re ready to commit to a career that is going to be very long-term, or even lifelong.

They say they encourage trying new positions and roles, but in my experience, that is not true. 

Overworking is standard protocol for multiple groups, business units, and teams. If you are not working more than 40 hours, you are not considered a team player.

Transparently, my financial future will be dramatically and positively different because of my career at Fidelity. Very proud to tell others where I work!","The only con I have is that Fidelity is more focused on hiring externally than promoting from within. Much of this focus is due to recent cultural and economic events (i.e., 2020). From a business perspective, I understand the desire to capitalize on available and diverse talent but not at the risk of frustrating and overlooking your highly qualified and tenured associates. There is a simmering frustration among the ranks and will soon result in sizable attrition if not addressed. 

For example, I am the most credential and skilled associate of my team and keep getting overlooked for a particular role. The individuals that are being hired into this role are under credentialed and/or have less experience. It is the most frustrating thing in the world! For the first time in my tenure at Fidelity, I have started proactively looking outside the firm. It genuinely PAINS me to think I may have to join a competitor to advance my career and compensation."

335,Fidelity Investments,"Tech divisions lag the market in tooling, processes, comp, management, leadership, dev experience.",2022-01-19,3.0,Software Engineer,The benefits packages are fully-featured and health insurance is affordable. The best perk of Fidelity is the 7% 401k match and the 10% annual profit sharing; 17% contributions to your 401k overall each year. The work/life balance ends up being very reasonable - it would be uncommon to work a 45-hour workweek more than a few times a year. 40 hours is the very common norm.,"Fidelity does not use public cloud, which has many negative side-effects; they attempt to replicate that experience with older, internal tooling which dramatically slows developer velocity. For example, engineer's ability to access compute resources is blocked by request processes. Libraries are all subject to a security review which can take a small number of weeks if requested with priority, or many weeks without. Licenses are purchased by a remote requisitions team with a similarly slow resolution timeframe. Releases are produced manually, there is no continuous deployment. 

There is no universal devops/platform team, squads maintain their own services. 
This self-sufficiency produces isolation, practically and socially; process standards and tooling varies a fair amount between them. There is no architecture team or unified technical leadership group. Each squad has their own tech lead and that's it.

Pay for engineers lags the market, targeting approximately 80-100% of the market rate. There is no option to acquire equity. ""Chairman shares"" are offered to top performers, but those are simply 2-year vesting cash bonus - not actual equity. Anecdotally, the very talented engineers remain due to not knowing their own market value. 

The manager-to-report ratio can vary wildly, 50+:1 in some cases, offering virtually no manager facetime or development opportunities to members of those squads. The daily routine of managers and directors is primarily comprised of liaising with customers (other business units) rather than anything related to developing their engineering teams.

Because the tech groups service internal business units, customer requirements are often poorly defined, change frequently and are conveyed verbally to product managers over calls. Oftentimes a change will be reverted due to a customer's whim, not the functionality of the feature itself.

Leadership is adamant about working from the office and will not support remote work post-covid.

Leadership has frequent messaging about undergoing an agile transformation, yet none of the shortcomings described here are eligible for reevaluation. The remaining set of factors that can be changed are virtually meaningless in impact.

Talented top-level leadership want to lead other business units which are revenue centers (all are financial business units) rather than cost centers, so the tech groups end up with a steady rotation of SVPs (the head of the tech group, equivalent to a CEO elsewhere) every 1-2 years. 

In short, the engineer experience at Fidelity is stable, yet slow, uninspiring, and poorly-compensated when compared to the broader market."

Pretty generous PTO, especially after you have been there a while. The base pay is okay.","Fidelity can be great. It depends on two things: what department/role you are in, and your manager. My major complaint about WPC is that people who play the game and burn through calls get promoted and those who spend time with clients don’t. You are not encouraged to spend time and plan with a client. You are supposed to get your tool clicks, uncover assets and send a referral to a branch. It has developed a culture of work 12 hour days to get your numbers, or cut corners. 


Also, they required mandatory overtime on Monday’s and Friday’s for over 6 months. Demanding total flexibility from all reps and continually asking for more, more, more. But good luck using your PTO. Some managers will act like you are stealing PTO hours from their own bank when you ask. The “COVID relief days” they offered were total BS as well. Their policy stated you could use it for anything that required “flexibility” during the pandemic. However, most managers would only let you take it if you were sick COVID."

-Flex time! With this position getting one planned paid hour off a week. ( i.e Getting off at 4 instead of 5 on Friday and getting paid that hour. What company does that?

- Management and the people I worked under always made themselves available to me at my convenience. I'd even say they were some of the best people I have worked for.","- As a CRA my entire job was answering a nonstop stream of phone calls
- While the training program is nice, you will NEVER fully be trained or prepared for what calls you may receive. 
- There is a massive variety of calls you may receive, which can leave you juggling a client, researching a solution and reaching out to other departments to find a solution.
- Once training was done I was put onto a new work schedule that ruined my work/life balance. I tried for multiple months to get a new schedule but since I was a newer employee I was never able to get something a bit more accomodating."

Will pay for your licensing if you’re in a licensed role.
Pretty easy to get vacation days approved.","This is not a job for someone who can’t sit in the same chair, staring at the same computer screen for 8+ hours.
Working from home is miserable, but working in the office requires either weekly testing and tracking or the vaccine. 
I’ve never felt so lonely at a company, even though this is the biggest company I’ve ever worked for.
I barely even know my manager’s first name, that’s how disconnected everyone is.
I only lasted one month after I finished training because the job isn’t rewarding in the slightest.
Be prepared to get yelled at or called incompetent at least 5 times a day.
Don’t expect more than minimal support from any supervisor.
This position should pay much more than it actually does. 
During onboarding, they make it seem like you can move around as much as you want, as quickly as you want, and your manager will help you advance however they can, but that’s a joke.
By the end of my shift, I’m exhausted and can’t even build up the motivation to make dinner.
EVERYTHING is scheduled. You get two 15 minute breaks - one in the morning and one in the afternoon - and a 30 minute lunch, but you may not be eating lunch until hours after any normal lunch time should be scheduled. And you don’t get a say on that either."

Also, there is constant change with the call model which they eat, sleep, and breathe. You could be the worst employee and as long as you use their call model word for word youll be able to move up quickly. Its also at manager discretion if you hit your call or not. Overall?

My managers were amazing mentors and each provided an amazing perspective on how to work your way up to corporate ladder. Huge piece of advice, from the moment you start, think two steps ahead on where you want to go. Let your managers know and they'll help you get there.","If you are passive, you'll be stuck in the same role for years. There are opportunities out there, you just need to look for them. I started in Customer service, and that first year was definitely the hardest. I knew nothing and felt incompetent. After a year, once you begin to build your knowledge base, you can actually have meaningful conversations so I'd say stick with it. Entry level jobs usually feel exhausting and difficult.

Although limited and flawed at times the company does care and tries to help every associate succeed. Also a lot of upward and sideways mobility, if you work hard the world is your oyster. Also you gain SO MUCH important knowledge about economics and the stock market that you can use in everyday life.","Internal systems are a nightmare, its a Frankenstein mishmash of all these old in house systems that don't play nice together and are not very user friendly. Also training is rushed adding an un-needed degree of pressure to new hires already working a difficult job.

 And the job no matter how good everything else could be is a tough tough job. It takes at least a year to get any good but once you pass your ""trial by fire"" and give it 100% this can be a very rewarding career especially for someone like me with no college degree."
425,Fidelity Investments,"Better than the service industry, but still service",2021-11-29,4.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"Lots of assistance offered to get you licensed (SIE, series 7, series 63).
Inclusive culture is pushed (don't expect everyone to be that way, but at least they try to make it welcoming).
Better than minimum wage.
Opportunities for growth.","UNDERPAID! This role requires you to live within 100 miles of Fidelity, yet they do not pay enough for a person to afford to actually live by themselves near Fidelity which is absolutely shameful.
It is like being in a minimum wage job except with better pay (though, like I said, still underpaid). You get limited breaks, you are expected to clock in ten minutes early each day, it can be difficult to use your PTO. The customer's rate us on a 7 point scale, but the only acceptable score is 7 points. If you get rated a 6, that is considered failing.
This role is very challenging and directly customer facing. There is a lot of pressure because you are dealing with customer's money. Fidelity throws you right into it, I did not feel ready to be moving money for customer's on my own but you just gotta do it.
It is great that they sponsor you through the licensing process, but it is really easy to get burned out by their pace. Then, if you fail, prepare to be ""let go.""
It is a FINRA rule that licensed employees cannot work from home full time without an exception process that Fidelity is not interested in participating in (it would require them to inspect your home office so I can't blame them for not wanting to do that). We can WFH right now, but will be forced to go in at least part time once it is deemed safe.
Fidelity is really pushing for people to return to the office, lots of pressure to participate in ""connect weeks"" which is where you volunteer to go back to the office.
They send you a lot of free stuff but most of it is junk. Like cheapy backpacks/mugs/merch you didn't ask for. I am putting this as a con because even though it is nice to receive free things and in the moment it gets you feeling part of the group, this practice has to stop. It is not good for the planet to keep producing useless junk."

Help by management was always promised on the horizon, but after being told that for two years, it was clear nothing was being done.

* Good people are leaving. Many great leaders who build core systems from ground up are not rewarded. Sycophants who have no knowledge of product, business, or technology are constantly repelling them

Remote work
Great place to start your career. Get out and get paid more after.","Have worked here for 6 years in 3 different locations. Management has gotten worse. I used to think “Wow. The management really cares about advancing my career and helping me” that tune has changed. It’s become a corporate boys club and full of toxic negativity. You have to leave the firm and come back to get any type of promotion or pay increase. They don’t hire from within they literally have jobs that say external hire only. What kind of garbage is that? It’s a boys club so if you’re a female in this finance world, good luck. Management is fake and can’t be real with their employees like they used to. They have to drink the corporate Kool-aid and give everyone corporate BS answers. Fidelity has started to care so much about money that the client experience is going to the way side. I used to love how client oriented we were. They are changing everything to be about money and how do we make the most money and work the employees the hardest."
465,Fidelity Investments,Great Place to Start,2021-07-03,5.0,Customer Relationship Advocate,"If you have a business degree and not sure where to start - look no further. Fidelity really invests in you by literally paying you to study for the first 9 months. 2-3 of those months are for studying for the SIE, Series 7 and Series 63. The rest of the time is learning Fidelity's training and the way they do things. In this time you might have to take some calls but its fairly easy. There is a lot of room for career advancement. You most likely won't stay in a position for longer than a year without some type of promotion. I think its a great place to start off your career in the corporate world.","Calls do suck after a while, but if you apply yourself you can get out of there pretty soon because Fidelity is hiring so many new people each year."

-Complete lack of mobility between departments. Many employees joined the company because they were told that it was possible to transition to analyst work. When they became eligible to move departments, they were mysteriously kept in customer service (even if they worked very hard and networked well in order to be able to leave).

Decent pay, they raise salary slowly based on the current economy. Hasn't changed much for this role in the last 15 years from what I have seen. Good benefits for people with families and medical expenses.","I went through the hiring process three years ago with about 30 people. A bunch left during the first year. I've interviewed several times with a 20 to 1 ratio for applicants vs. positions offered. Everyone that stayed made a lateral move within the company. They changed positions but didn't get a bump in pay. A lot of promises and motivational meetings are given on career mobility, but most can't move anywhere easily. Climbing the ladder takes years. For most, it takes a lot of education, experience, and exceptional stats. I saw a guy with a CFP, 3 years of financial advisement experience, a degree in finance, and excellent testing/current role scores lose a job to a woman with 1-year furniture sales experience. He couldn't move out for a long time. I've seen that happen to several people where the promotions were not fair based on diversity hiring. Qualified people get passed up frequently for diverse applicants. I worked with several people that had multiple years of financial experience and a few that had MBA's that didn't move any easier than people in their 2nd year of college. Experience/education/certifications don't help very much. Lots of people apply for every job.

819,Fidelity Investments,BEWARE!!,2021-01-12,1.0,Anonymous,They allowed workers to work from home.,"Where do I start? I spent a decent amount of time working at Fidelity. Overall, I would say it’s not a great company to work for at all. From my observations, many people have gotten stuck in this company, and it’s drained the life/soul out of them. For starts, many full-time and contractors (Fidelity TalentSource) are underpaid for the amount of responsibility on them. Many people are very unhappy here, but their soul has been trapped here way too long. They don’t know how to leave; all they know to do is stay around and complain.

Racism is obvious in this company. After the murder of George Floyd and many others, there was a lot of lip service from upper-level leaders and money donated to non-profits, but the core of this company has not changed at all. It’s racist!

Human Resources and Recruiters for the most part are awful. I think this is one of the MANY reasons why they don’t attract quality candidates, let alone keep them exceptionally long. Speaking of that, turnover is HIGH.

The leadership is really what makes or breaks an organization. The leadership here is awful. I met with a Senior Leader about issues with a product that they oversaw, and they admitted it was problematic and had obvious issues. However, since our meeting nothing about the product has improved, it’s only gotten worst. Do companies think by ignoring constant issues/problems that they’re just going to float away?

I conclude by saying, proceed with caution. Don’t let the nice buildings, benefits, etc. fool you. Once you get in, you will soon realize it was a BIG mistake coming here. You deserve better in life, STAY AWAY!!"

They deff show favoritism because a girl and I passed the SIE and didn’t pass the series 7 but we were let go that day over the phone on the spot! There were other people who didn’t even pass the SIE the first time but still kept their jobs! How does that make sense? It makes no sense to hire people, invest this time and then simply let them go when it’s a call center job..I legit was doing the job while in training. No suprise so many people quit even after passing all the exams. They hype themselves when it’s just a call center. DONT kid yourself.

Top of the line training for licensing should your role require it off the bat, or sometime down the line.

The workplace culture is excellent- every single manager I've had is excellent, and that's likely a result of trickle-down from *their* higher ups. Willingness to accomodate work from home is an excellent push, as long as you're okay with online training.","Certain products like the one I work with currently very much feel like they're on the backburner when it comes to updating resources, educating customers, etc. It makes a call with an insane hold time even more distressing, and just leads to more OT asks. I've had the term ""F for flexibility"" thrown around more times than I can count. Having covid PTO is great, but the distressing air of the call center floor makes associates feel almost guilty for not doing OT, nevermind taking days off during ""peak season"", which, since the pandemic, has been virtually every day. I love what I do and I love assisting customers- but beware, if call center work is exhausting to you, it's going to outweigh most pros I'm giving here."

In addition, they are rolling out another bonus, on top of the performative bonus we already have, for those who simply passed their license exams within a certain time frame of their hire date. In addition, we get 18 days of PTO, paid holidays, and this year, we got 40 hours of COVID Relief Time.","The job itself is not fun and can be stressful.

The company does try and help managers improve, but it is still a challenge if you do not get a good one. Also, many departments can feel like a silo; you may not like the lack in variety of jobs in your business arm and it can sometime feel difficult to move to a different department if you have already established yourself in another one.

Great benefits and retirement package (except the 5 year vesting requirement on 401k).,"Fidelity isn’t the best option for mid or late career scenarios. The pay isn’t as competitive and promotions are based on bureaucracy and not efforts. Work life balance is horrible in technical areas (80 to 90 hours a week is not uncommon), the on-call competition is below the industry standard and cell phone reimbursement is garbage. There is a passive aggressive expectation to work long long hours but take time off. The internal application process for careers is insulting and garbage.

Tuition reimbursement 90% if you pass your classes with a C. Masters degrees converged at 10k per year if you major in a relevant field.

Flexible time off without fear of reprisals.
Stay employed even in lean economic markets. 
Fathers get 3 months of parental leave for new borns.
Adoption services.
Concierge services for those who want to plan that special date or marriage proposal.

Paid child care by the firm on days they need you if come in if another sight is snowed by request. Discounts on other days at approved sites.

Night time Differential pay at 5% for folks who work past 6 PM. That increases to 20% for those who work past 8 PM of your eligible based compensation per hour. 

Christmas bonuses 2 to 3 times every five years. Usually 1 pay period awarded. There have been other types of incentive pay depending on call volume to encourage us to not cancel auto OT when applied awarded in cash, stock grants, one day off, Fidelity cash for merchandise, etc.

No weekend requirements for those supporting workplace roles. Personal investments roles may have weekend hours depending on the job.

More Telework is available due to Covid19.

Real career development exit here. Some managers are better at this than others. I’ve always felt that they’re pushing me to take up the next challenge. Even at times when I wasn’t ready to move up or just getting complacent.

Fun stuff at call centers. Choose any of these clubs: Women in Leadership, Aspire, FidVets, FinTech, President Circle, Leadership Summit, etc... they always have something going on for you to network and use to move on up. It’s up to you to hustle and play the game.

Pre Covid19 we had hot air balloon rides, dragon boat competitions, BBall breaks, volleyball teams, zombie nights for Halloween, BBQ competitions, ice cream socials, team outings, camping trips, visiting chefs at some sights, team potlucks, free food and I’m talking about the good stuff NOT pizza. You can definitely gain major weight at certain sites.

No worries because some sites have a full service gym w/ personal trainers, classes, and nutritionists.

 At Our sites we got the choice to take a walk and discuss our development plans or monthly business results around one of the many nature trails.","Bonus metrics change a lot.

Managers depending on the site location change a lot in the call centers for sure.
 
Will push you hard to keep up with the ever changing metrics in order to stay relevant if you want to get promoted. Only to hire a guy off the street to the branch with 6 months of car sales experience, no degrees in the field, and has to still get his S7 & 63.

You have a better chance of jumping a few slots to get to where you want if you work at Fidelity for 1-3 years. Quit; then work elsewhere for 1-2 years only to come back to Fidelity.

Serious issues at to many of the branches when it comes to hiring women, professionals with ascents, or they may serve in locations with above average demographics or immigrants without one person in the branch that can speak their language. These folks tend to have small to midsize size businesses. They horde cash and don’t have someone they trust to reach out to them. However, executive management is aware and working on making the hiring process better. I can tell that change is happening. It’s not HQ more so the mindset of the financial industry at the local levels. 

Management feedback for the interview process can be largely lackluster. Heard from other top performers that the feed back was non existent or borderline suspect. Being told to smile more during the interview or joke more at team meetings is NOT productive feedback for a job interview. Especially when they seem to selectively provide this to certain “types.”

Healthcare plan is average. Family plan is 3k high deductible. They do give you $1500 per year to your HSA to offset that high @-&:?:?’ Plan. Prescription med and co pays prices were higher for me than my previous employer.

Pay is actually lower than the national average for a license professional."

There’s a lot of really kind and good people at the company. They’re the one thing that makes it good. This is specific to lower level employees, not any form of leadership.","I wouldn’t know where to start. 

Abby Johnson attempting to create the cult called Fidelity is failing and outflow at the firm is coming. They’re anti-fiduciary approach will cost them majorly with the CFP Board.

 They take no feedback from employees with knowledge of this and other things that are unethical and would violate even Reg BI.

Recruiters will tell you that unless you have a CFA Level I upon graduation from an Ivy League school , or you can never be an analyst. After LinkedIn review this is not true, and I cross referenced who didn’t qualify for those “standards” I found those not from Ivy League had some nepotism within the company, generally at a VP or higher level 

This east coast bias here is incredible. Call centers everywhere else-with about 1/5 the pay of anyone in Massachusetts. 

I don’t recommend this firm to anyone. They’ll preach a holistic happy fun approach- the reality is nothing close. 

Abby Johnson just because you were born into the most successful mutual fund company- does not mean anyone should worship you the way it’s demanded from the top down. It’s actually pretty pathetic you feel the need to plaster your own quotes and face everywhere. 

Best of luck to all those who dare enter these jobs. Congratulations to those who’s dad bought them an Ivy League education and nepotistically raised the wealth differential in this country. Fidelity is the epitome."

Returned to work after STD for surgery and everyday was a new nightmare until terminated without much evidence and treated like a criminal. Becoming pretty standard way of thinning out tenured reps. Loved this company and mgmt. in the beginning. Made a lot of good friends. Mgmt. now just worried their stats and look the other way when cheaters don't even care to keep their stats within reality. Very toxic and political environment with unbelievable micro-management pressure , if you're not cheating and getting these mid-mgmt cretons promoted.

Everyone knows who these bad actors and bad apples are. Members of their teams can't move away fast enough to other teams, departments, or companies. 

Though the company allows them to punish or push out struggling yet sincere frontline employees, it does little to recognize that these ineffective managers are better at managing up to their bosses than lifting up their teams. Just recently, I saw a manager who was recently promoted to an enviable post who has a seriously horrible reputation. He is a poster child of everything I mentioned and is one of the worst managers in the building."

High chance that you will be working with an outdated tech stack after LEAP. You may also be placed into an unfavorable role with little to no technical mentorship and with minimal transferrable skills. They will try to tell you that Fidelity is a ""tech company that does finance"" but this is not the case.

If your a person of color as well there is no diversity at the the maagement level besides one woman of Asian heritage. Expect if you are white to be promoted even though you're not the most qualified for the role. Expect to be accused of being bad on the phone when you did everythign you did for a client yet they give you a bad rating for the 1 hour hold time they waited to talk to you, and the best part is then the company will use that against you to screw you out of your bonuses saying you didn't do a great job. Of course, there is no way to throw out the ones that that were just an upset customer and not your fault. We were told they didn't have money for raises then they cut their commissions and magically found a way to still give us a raise. They do not do any cost of living adustments so expect to live harsh while some people live comfortable in other states. So pretty much expect to be disregarded at this company they don't care about you."

They don’t care about your mental health, they will always put customers who are abusive first, and then coach you on how you could’ve controlled the abuser, they didn’t get abusive. You will never be good enough, because one bad survey and no one will ever forget about it. Not sure what it is but sometimes I feel bad if they feel you don’t have an outside work, life. They want you to work lots of OT and when you opt out once in a blue moon you are guilt tripped and belittled."

1240,Fidelity Investments,Fidelity Clients with $10MM waited for 50-200 minutes to speak to me and were never in a good mood,2021-07-04,1.0,High Net Worth Associate,I got paid on time,"This is, despite the description, a hard core call center job. But, because its Fidelity, the clients wait for 50-200 minutes or more to speak with you, they are, as you would expect, not happy by the time you speak with them. (These are the clients filling out your survey, and only PERFECT surveys count). The queue of clients to speak to is endless. Over time the bad attitudes and angry people yelling at me wore me down and I lost 15 lbs, because skinny anxious and depressed, and essentially sacrificed my personal self to chase my professional goal to move to a different job where the clients don't wait as long. However, the rhetoric and promise of changing jobs, the date keeps getting pushed back. Now they are refusing to do internal promotions, due to the egregious client hold times. This is a LOSING TEAM. Go join a winning team. 

If you don't live there already, you have to move to the city to WFH

No real team atmosphere

Clients yelling at you and disrespecting you.

In the words of management ""this is the bottom of the company""

In the words of my former manager ""this is the hardest year at the company, and this is the worst version of the hardest year at the company ever""

Except, this year is different, because the company is literally NOT PROMOTING the loyal employees who worked through the hell of December-March.

If you call Fidelity this upcoming December 2021, you will experience an unacceptable hold time of at least 70 minutes, and you will work with someone brand new and incompetent.

Since I joined, my class of 30 people, about 14 have quit or been fired for yelling back at clients, or failing their Finra exams.

Again, I cannot emphasize enough, this is a LOSING TEAM and the teflon-covered management give you lip-service about the future getting better, yet the carrot gets pushed farther and farther away.

Even in this terrible environment, when my peers got only 40% ""perfect surveys"" my record month was 91%.

I have been asking for help since January to get into a different role that fits my background and skillset.
Now, I have other companies offering me jobs that pay more than 2x the $48,000 at Fidelity.

We could be more of an industry leader in Diversity and Inclusion - some senior leaders have always been focused on this and are greatly admired throughout the firm. Generally speaking from an enterprise level, these topics are only addressed under media attention, though this level of attention has been increasing. compensation could be higher, but personally i feel is justified through their fantastic benefits. culture will vary based on business unit - some have more of a start up vibe, other units don't have that flexibility given the nature of their work."

- Very low stress and hours requirements if you land in the ""right"" department.","- Career progression is extraordinarily political. I've seen multiple unqualified people get promoted because they spend all day assembling powerpoints and meetings despite having zero expertise or knowledge.
- Deadlines and accountability are non-existent in many departments. 25% of the people will do 75% of the work. I once had a (full-time) coworker complain that she never worked more than 32 hours in a week before when we asked her to stay late leading-up to a deadline.
- Company is risk-adverse to a fault. Rather than identifying short-term solutions to problems, they will have a five-year plan to eventually fix the problem. In the meantime... oh well.
- It will take you >2 years to get comfortable in your job. A large part of being successful in your roll is dependent upon knowing who you need to contact rather than simply knowing what needs to be done."

Everything related to my actual job was horrible.,"The upper management all sort of do there own things and have their own expectations, creating confusion throughout the company. I don't think Abby really has control over some of her subordinates. Site management changed every year that I was there, adding to the confusion. Team managers have entirely too much power and there is very little recourse given to appeal their decisions or seek redress of grievances when they act in an inappropriate manner. The pay is well below industry standards and while you are able to make lateral movements within the company, moving up is EXTREMELY difficult. Pay raises rarely keep up with inflation and while I was there our variable comp was changed making it impossible for anyone to meet the new standards. My pay went down a couple of thousand dollars per year as a result. HR is not responsive and negligent at times. I went an entire year without insurance because I was somehow disenrolled in the plan that I signed up for when I got hired on. HR knew that this mistake had happened and it was documented in their system, but they didn't do anything in time to correct the problem despite my contant pressuring them. The company became even less invested in its employees during my time, essentially turning from a somewhat tolerable work experience into just another high turnover, turn and burn call center."

Reasonably priced insurance
Flexible PTO
Positive company culture/values
They hire pleasant people
So many perks and benefits I literally cant fit it all on here.","Ever ask yourself ""How can I simultaneously destroy my career prospects and waste my expensive college degree?"" Well then , Fidelity Investments in Jacksonville has the perfect job for you! 

First, it's a call center people...through and through. You will talk to dozens of people on the phone. Every...single...day. Eventually, that ""ding!"" sound of a new call coming in will haunt your dreams. Most people don't last more than a year. You can either go the sales or service route. If you go service, there is very little room for advancement. In addition, if you move into whats called a ""High Net Worth"" service role, you will be responsible for a HUGE range of knowledge and actions without commensurate pay. One call could have you rushing to get a complex option trade placed within minutes of market close, while a pushy day trader berates you, and the next call could be spending an hour helping a 90 year old man reset his password as you bang your head on you desk asking ""I went to college for this?!"" If you go sales, then get used to working long, awkward hours and having your success defined in how many more calls you can take than the next guy/gal. 

The coupe de grace (ATTENTION ALL RECENT COLLEGE GRADS): None of the jobs they offer in Jacksonville are real finance jobs. They're just customer service/sales jobs parading as something fancier. Even the ""Financial Advisor"" roles are just sales, albeit well paying. Also, call center jobs are only marketable to other customer service careers. Having a call center job on your resume will actually HARM your chances of landing a job in world of ACTUAL finance. So, before you go thinking ""I'll just work here for a year or two to get something on my resume""....DON'T DO IT.

None of what I just said should reflect poorly on the company itself, because Fidelity is a great company in terms of culture, mission, and values. That's undeniable. The problem is very specific to the extent of their operations in Jacksonville being call center based and that these are very stressful and career-limiting work environments. Consider yourself warned!"

- Established firm, respected in the industry","They have no clue how to keep their employees happy during this Covid world. Your voice will never be heard. The firm's true colors started to show once reps had to work from home. They don't care what your skillset is, what motivates you, and how well you can fit with another team. If your scorecard isn't green forget about moving up in the company.

There's a reason why people are sprinting to Robinhood, but the leadership refuses to acknowledge reality. Instead they spend the exit interview belittling their reps decisions to leave and it's not a good look."

Great intro job to finance, and Fidelity will offer opportunities to move towards your finance-industry-related work, even if you have little to no experience. You MUST understand that this is a call center job, however. As such, your job is to take X number of phone calls each and every day, day in and day out.","What used to be all about the customer experience has, over the past few years, heavily diverted into a metric-based environment. This leaves associates ""kicking the can"" down the road to the next associate who can help better, leading to a terrible customer experience, simply because associates are watching out for their KPIs. Poor KPI results will result in heavy-handed ""coaching"" sessions and absurd amounts of micromanagement."

Good job to have straight out of college, but they definitely throw you right into the role so be prepared to work with little to no guidance.","Work life balance can be difficult for this role because you’re expected to be the first one in & the last one out. You basically do everyone’s busy work & you don’t get compensated for it. The role has evolved a lot due to COVID, you’re basically doing the relationship manager role just without the extra pay. I worked in an investor center so you won’t be micromanaged, but it’s hard to do anything when you don’t know what to do. Clients can be hard to work with. If you’re not looking to get into sales don’t even bother. They advertise how quickly you can be promoted within the company but it’s harder than they make it out to be, doesn’t matter how long you’ve been there."

My manager was there for 15 years and even he ended up leaving because he couldn't find a role outside of the call center. Fidelity Investments and the Fidelity call center might as well be two completely different companies. The only positions available to you are in sales or some other medial phone position. Managers either can't help you out or won't help you out. Like my headline says I would take the position, get the licenses and then start applying elsewhere.

If you bite back, your managers will gaslight you into thinking that you are the problem, not the super bizarre environment that they have created.They will ask you, if you are only ""there for a paycheck?"" The answer is yes, because they're only ""there for metrics."" 

The environment is not collaborative, and they will use you up until you are done. They are not dumb. They know exactly what the average associate's shelf life is(a manager told me so), and they will coldly and callously move on.

1621,Fidelity Investments,Hard work and skills don’t matter,2020-09-29,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Benefits ..... that’s all I can say,"Hard work and skill doesn’t matter. All based on favoritism so all you gotta do is kiss their butt. If you apply in a phone call center, expect to stay there and rotate between different call centers for the rest of your life. Only opportunity they offer is different call centers. Two 15 minute breaks, one 30 min lunch and they choose when you take it. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT AT EXACT TIMES . They recently made it so that you can take it 20 min before or after . Break feels like 5 mins and lunch is 10 min cause the lines are sooooo long in the cafe and it takes time to get your butt up off your prison cell and walk all the way over there sooo technically you got 5-10 mins to shove the food in the mouth. Easy to get burn outs and forces you to do OT or else you’ll look bad and lose that opportunity for progression. Flexibility my butt! they give you a list of unattractive hours that is available and you just gotta choose from it.

Just avoid applying for phone call centers unless it’s your last resort."

Meeting-heavy culture...lots and lots of meetings.
Have to wait 1 year to participate in 401K.
Tenured employees (15-20+ year) are mostly unwilling to change or transform the way they work, or be influenced by new thinking.
Career growth is limited for back-office employees and most job requisitions require you to live in the geographical area (TX, NC, or MA) in order to be considered for the job.
Lacking leadership skills at Director level, VP, and above creating a micro-managing culture and toxic work environment. 
HR is passive in giving employee support and really only advocates and acts upon anything for the benefit of the manager and company.
Way too many Executives and layers of management.
Spending or investing via your Fidelity checking and 401K accounts are monitored by your manager.

1753,Fidelity Investments,LEAP Associate Software Engineer = Grand Opportunity,2019-10-09,5.0,Associate Software Engineer,"Within the LEAP Program as an Associate Software Engineer, you get trained for roughly 12 weeks. After this, you'll have dedicated project time where you work on a real project within Fidelity Investments. A great plus is, you get paid during training. You'll learn things such as front end, middle tier, and back end technologies. You are basically getting equipped for your future role within the company. You work closely with your manager and they'll try to find the best role for you. Ie, if you want to work more on front end(html/css/angular), they'll try to find the best role for you. 

Trust me, as a recent college graduate, this program is unreal. It truly is a gateway to success for your Software Engineering career. It helps you get your feet wet, and feel the least bit comfortable to get off to a good start. 

Here is a list of Pros:
- 401k match (7% at 100%) + ~10% profit sharing (Ie: its ultimately 17% 401k match)
- Student Loan Assistance (Up to $10,000) 
- Great networking along the way (You are in classrooms with recent graduates just like you. Great life long friendships and connections were made!)
- Learning Front End, Middle Tier, Back End Technologies (The general ones Fidelity uses.... and no, these aren't legacy software technologies)
- Learning coding concepts/design patterns",There aren't really any cons. You are getting paid to learn(say what?). It is what you make of the program.
1754,Fidelity Investments,Wonderful place to live a well-rounded life,2020-03-09,5.0,Marketing Director,"The work-life balance, benefits, and compensation package are the best I've ever had at any companies. The culture is collaborative and not stressful. There are many senior leaders that are women, including many that have young children at home, which I believe helps set a great tone for work-life balance.

Given the business is privately held and family run, I've found leadership to demonstrate more long-term and strategic thinking compared to large publicly traded companies. There is a desire to deliver today and plan for tomorrow.

Over the last few years, there has also been an earnest push to keep pace on rapid innovation with the rise of fintech and operate under agile principles. People do value pace over perfection and speed to market, but there is still a ways to go to truly be agile.","Like many large companies, it can be bureaucratic and slower moving than I'd like (although better than most of the large companies I've worked at). Some individuals are motivated by self-interest and politics and kissing up can trump business results."

We are going through a pandemic right now and I feel so appreciated and valued. They have gone above and beyond to make this transition so much easier, not perfect, but it felt effortless. The benefits even prior are unmatched, you come to work but folks care about you and you leave work feeling like you made a difference. I haven’t been here but a few months and I’ve already moved up!

1766,Fidelity Investments,Glorified call center job,2020-10-24,2.0,Financial Consultant,Reputable private company with good benefits.,"The company/hiring managers are not looking for experience, creativity, or diversity in candidates. They want young and cheap (and White.) They want you to advice clients with written scripts and one-size-fit-all investment models, albeit the obvious fact that each client is unique. Team-oriented culture usually means everyone looks and sounds identical. It is a private company, so they can run the business whatever way they want, without any pressure from the public in regards to diversity and inclusion. In interview, they often tell you that the median pay for FC is around 165k, with many earn above 200k. The base is about 45k, most people get paid around the base. That's one of the many reasons why the company struggles with high turnover."

Mostly horizontal movements unless you network well & have great relationships with your managers. Job can get stressful and at some point of time, you will get yelled at by customers. 

It's a big company, so even though sometimes management asks for your opinion, they'll make changes that does the opposite. You're just a number in the company and most people leave within a year or two."

1777,Fidelity Investments,Good luck!,2021-03-19,1.0,Financial Representative,The people and how you can move up on the corporate ladder in this position,"I'm not a negative person but this topic makes me so angry so 

Compensation: The base pay (at least for my role) is way too low for what I do. 

Job: My job itself is manageable but stressful at times already. When people leave, they put that person's job on other people, with no raise or any acknowledgment of how the person's doing. The job you add on, you may not even be qualified for under in the industry. Also, they add on useless tasks to do (that other locations don't do) just for no reason at all. We have all of these tasks to do with no extra pay or help from higher management. The higher up people do not even know how to do the jobs we have which I can say from my experience here for sure.

Customers: some of the clients are absolutely absurd. they come in asking for things and you try to help them and give them caring honest answers and they dont care. it just adds on to the stress.

Company: During the pandemic they've put completely unrealistic protocols that do not make the clients happy (not being able to walk in places). Although I understand it's important to be safe during the pandemic, other companies allow it, so why not here? This just makes the clients very angry, more than already about their needs, and they go off on us service reps as if it is our fault. We take the heat. When we present it to a manager they do not care and tell us to try to resolve it more. If it escalates too much to a manager then they just blame the company and seem not to care. 

P.S. If you have a fidelity account and need help, do NOT call the service number because there is a 1% chance someone will answer in the first 10 minutes."

I was a Customer Relationship Advocate (fully trained and licensed) and each day on the phones was anxiety-inducing. I did not feel properly trained, nor did I feel comfortable answering a ton of questions on margin balances, options, etc., and despite that, I was not supported further. Just about every day, I would get yelled at by clients, and yet nothing was done. There were also very few breaks from the phones, and I woke up each morning dreading work and realizing just how miserable this position was. At one point, I had to go on a medical leave and I think I went 5 weeks without hearing from my manager. He did not respond to any of the emails I sent to him, he did not check in on me, and generally, he seemed to care very little about the associates; instead, he was very focused on the metrics instead. All of this contributed to a sub-par experience."

1863,Fidelity Investments,"Amazing potential, great community, cares about culture fit!",2021-01-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"Honestly they care a TON about making sure you fit within the culture of the team/company. The technology community is really helpful and full of such a variety of people. There's good events, they invest in you as a person from internal onsite training, to in-house education platforms to big name course platforming tools (not even counting their benefits package, that's incredible, especially for families). You can really ""Blaze your own trail"" when it comes to your career and people will support you as much as they can. The connections you make there can/will extend far after you leave and most of their networks are very far reaching across other large companies (or even internally).

Additionally, work/life balance is AMAZING. Most managers (particularly technology, since call center workflows are different) will let you handle life because they know that it can be unpredictable, and will help you adjust however works for you (obviously within reason), whether that's having to leave somewhat early to pick up kids or have an extended lunch because of a crisis or appointment. There's a trust that you can develop with your team and manager that you can truly make the experience less stressful, and they're willing to work with you in whatever way they can.","If you're coming in as an entry-level technology role, make sure you get the best offer you can. They've historically paid under market even in their industry (though it's much closer these past 2 years) because of their benefits, but total comp is still somewhat lower than anticipated for their size. Depending on the team, it may be hard to rise up the ranks past a point due to too many managers, and organizations find it difficult to cut them, especially if they've been there a while. It's pretty hard to negotiate any pay change since raises only happen at the end of the year, and there's not a pay discussion until they're locked in."

Their benefits are really good and affordable, and they have very generous PTO and 6 weeks paid paternity leave for men. I have read a lot of reviews about there being a lack of movement. I can honestly say that I could see that being an issue for some people. In my own experience Fidelity rewards being ambitious. A lot of people here have been in their role for a very long time and become jaded. Be ambitious,  take initiative, and it's not that hard to move up here. Comparitively there is a lot of opportunity here, if you miss out on that you have nobody to blame but yourself. Not to mention every manager I have met at fidelity seems to genuinely care about advancing your career. Quarterly comp is nice. Working from home is a other nice part if fidelity, but this also varies depending on your function.","The salary is the worst part. You get quarterly compensation which is nice and can be a lot depending on your function but they rarely budge on raising your base pay. This is used as an excuse to not raise your base pay when you move around. Also, this is a call center job so not specifically a con to fidelity but these type of jobs have their ups and downs."

You're graded on your CEI (customer survey) and your CPH (call per hour), which sometimes you get surveys for calls that is not your department (wtf 401k calls).

Promotion is not based on your CEI and CPH alone, they will promote you if they like you enough. Good luck on getting a manager that you'll get along with, some of them don't care (looking at you Lauren, coming in at 11am and leaving at 3pm), and some are so obsessed with stats that they'll work your until you die. 

Oh you're putting in overtime? That's great, we're expecting you to, who cares if you don't have work/life balance. 

Stay away from this job if you can get anything else. Don't believe it when they tell you 'oh here is a Ping Pong table you get to use', or 'you can sit anywhere you'd like', because they're too cheap to build their own place, and they're overcrowding this office.

Can get stuck on bad shift (SAT, SUN, or Nights). Constant ask for Overtime and even ""Pre-scheduled Overtime"" which is essentially them putting overtime in your schedule without asking and is very frowned upon if you opt out. Low base pay that basically never increases."

Best benefits in the industry and they are now offering flexibility to work from home. They will pay for your licenses and CFP. You can learn as much as you want to learn, plenty of resources available for you.  Great place to gain experience.  You'll never have to cold call for prospects.","At the end of the day your job is to sell a managed solution to the client by giving the illusion that you are actually doing financial planning for them.  The turnover at the branches brings down client satisfaction. It is definitely a what have you done for me lately type of place. Monthly business reviews can be brutal for people who are not producing. 

You might have managers or trainers that have never been in your seat, or could not cut it so they transitioned. Makes it difficult to have them coach when they have not done it. 

 You make just enough money that its difficult to leave, and they do that on purpose. My advice for people is to get your certifications and a few years experience and then look elsewhere before you start making so much that its hard to leave."

I remember the day I got hired as a temp. My world changed, and I was so excited to start my new hire training class. The people at Fidelity are top notch from the security guards, to the cleaning crew, to the executives. This company is ridiculously good at finding the right people who fit the culture and help others grow.

My manager had flexibility where required, and demanded excellence where necessary. I was never unsure of expectations because of the constant feedback loop, and I always strived to do the best work possible because of it. In my group, we had executive leadership involved as well, and even though I was a lower level employee, they were fun, respectful, and always treated me like part of a very important team. I couldn't have asked for more from Fidelity, and I was sad to leave.",I honestly never had any issues here that weren't my own fault (and I had a few for sure).

2244,Fidelity Investments,COVID has shown their true colors,2020-08-12,2.0,Financial Associate,"It used to be a pretty relaxed and laid back job...but that's all gone now. They've even redesigned their phone system in the midst of a pandemic to make sure that everyone takes every call and is talked out of their voice by Tuesday, but you better show up and sound cheerful for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday...or else.
The benefits in terms of insurance coverage is decent. On the surface their retirement plan looks good with all the match and profit sharing, but their vesting schedule is draconian and traps you working for them for YEARS before you would ever get to take any of their retirement contributions with you when you leave. And you will want to leave quickly.","Metrics. Matrices. Benchmarks. Expectations. Goals.
Forget Fidelity being a Finance company. Their business, what they do best, is perfecting the art of micromanagement. Think you've learned how to do your job effectively? Think again. Every few months they've designed or redesigned a new system for you to learn to use because it is NEW AND IMPROVED with many more reporting features to keep an eagle eye on every single insignificant facet of your job performance - all in the name of assigning a number and a statistic to what you do that they can then set the goal for just high enough that they can use your performance as a reason to short you on a bonus or deny you a raise.
And they have no sympathy for their front line workers being abused on the phones either. They cleared out their offices and sent everyone home in March, but everything else has been business as usual ever since. No changes in expectations even an inch even though everybody in the trenches has been putting up with 3-4x the work they were doing 100 days ago. No guaranteed bonuses. No time off availability. Overtime has been expected and mandatory from the beginning, otherwise you're labeled as ""not a team player"" and ""hurt your Fidelity Brand""
FIdelity Green is for Greed."

2499,Fidelity Investments,"Good place to start right out of college, but rampant incompetence",2020-06-19,2.0,Software Engineer,"- There is a big focus and investment on education, training employees
- There is a strong focus on diversity and Employee Resource Groups
- Colleagues are friendly, managers treat their employees with respect and kindness.
- The company has a new talent pipeline in its internship program, and a great bootcamp program for new hires. The company's best employees come from this program.
- Embrace of Agile Scrum and Kanban
- Upper technical management is staffed by good, eager, and talented people that want to change things for the better.
- If you are a go-getter, there is much opportunity to make it up the ranks.","- Low technical talent: The company uses about 45% contractor workforce (even in the US). A lot of technical knowledge leaves company every year. Huge turnover rate in the technical ranks. Many of these contractors have low skills that do not match their resume.
- While it is good the company gives people low on experience a chance (sometimes the first chance of their career), the flip-side is that there are a lot of people that don't know what they are doing. Huge brain drain in the early 2000s at this company that the company never fully recovered from (many firms in the same industry experienced the same).
- Very incompetent teammates. ""Very"" with a capital ""V"". You have to constantly get on people just to get the work done that they promised to do. Sometimes takes weeks to find an administrator to grant access or turn a setting on. Sometimes requirements are completely misunderstood.
- Agile scrum meetings go on for too long. Oftentimes, over half a day is spent in meetings. The prevailing attitude at the company is that strictly adhering to Agile ceremonies will magically get the Sprint work done.
- Non-technical people are scrum masters (SMs): Although it is technically not a requirement, it is a bit of an obstacle to have non-technical people as SMs for Software Engineering work. Despite my 17 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I often found myself being contradicted by SMs with less than 5 years experience, and zero years as a Software Developer. Sadly, most (but not all) SMs have very little interest in understanding the the work they were SMing for.
- You ask a question, and people are either too busy to answer, or nobody knows the answer. Either way, You are basically on your own to figure things out"

This was emphasized when Abby Johnson and Kathy Murphy said in the most recent town hall that because they always have so many people come back to Fidelity it doesn't really matter to retain them.

It's a good place to start, but there's only so much growth with in the company

There is no way to change things at a decent pace. In my role my manager knows there are issues with how things are run, our director is also aware of them, and the site GM has some knowledge. Each level agrees with our issues and agrees that present solutions make sense, but that they have no power or ability to do anything about it."

- Numerous business units offer a variety of lateral transfer opportunities
- Not one of the ""bad guys"" of the financial world
- ""Fidelity nice"": a culture heavily focused on comity and professional behavior
- Excellent compensation and benefits","- Probably the most hierarchical management culture I have ever experienced. Management evaluates ideas largely based on the pay grade of who submitted the idea.
- In the technology space, change is excruciatingly slow. Initiatives flow almost exclusively from the top down.
- Performance reviews are based solely on the feedback of your manager, so a poor relationship with your manager (or an indifferent manager) will doom your career.
- Underperforming employees tend to stick around in their current positions (making life difficult for their team members and customers) rather than being nudged into other roles."

Rising through the ranks can be difficult and incredibly frustrating as there is a lot of politics involved
You can go a lot farther doing mediocre work on side projects rather than outstanding work for your project team (which, by the way, typically has well-defined KPIs and revenue implications unlike the one-off side projects)

A volume based discount broker call center where even team leads (managers) are frustrated with leadership. Upper management is not there to help build a profitable successful environment but make sure numbers on spread sheet are met. 95% of the people I worked with actively are unhappy with their current job and only stay so they can get their 5 year vesting. I’m truthfully dumbfounded at the lack of communication with management down to reps. I’m disappointed to say I wasted so much time at the company and missed valuable opportunity actually being able to advise build relationships. This company the last two years had tried to put a square peg into a round hole and has lost a lot of talented people. This will continue to be the trend because Fidelity is slow pace when it comes to change. Culture there was absolutely horrible with people just struggling through daily life and I hope those who read this can take this as a warning! Unless you are absolutely desperate or doubt mind being an un valued easy replaceable cog in the Fidelity machine you can do so much better.."

2. Numerous different business units and sub-groups, many different career paths, multiple locations. Working remote up to 100% a possibility for many positions (off-phone), depending on business group.
3. Mostly good opportunities to improve your skills and knowledge.
4. Massive population to network.","1. Bureaucracy still reigns. Common Sense doesn't always prevail. The simplest things are made complicated... Every time a new senior leader arrives, there is a re-org or re-alignment... They say associates have a voice and they do survey associates, but if you speak up otherwise, do so at your own risk...
2. The company is making great strides towards improving career mobility but many legacy barriers remain in place, including attitudes of hiring managers and their superiors.
3. Very conservative company when it comes to risk...decisions are made by ""committee"" after exhaustive discussions, even over the most smallest and trivial things. Many times your work gets trapped by becoming all about the process and not the outcome.
4. Top Heavy. Appears to be a large population in the lower pay grades, but very few in the middle (managers, sr. managers), and an enormous Director, VP, and above segment. The top segment is all about taking care of each other when not competing or fighting one another.
5. Unless you sexually harass someone or get caught stealing something, no one gets fired unless it's an overall reduction in force. Lazy or inept associates are coddled or passed along."

There is no much room to grow as an individual contributor.

2697,Fidelity Investments,"""Technologists are expendable""",2020-04-28,1.0,Software Engineer,"- I worked with some very smart people. It's a shame they worked here where they aren't at all valued.

- Work isn't challenging at all. You can coast and do nothing all day and slip through the cracks.","Software engineers at fidelity are very low on the totem pole, probably a step lower than call center employees if I had to guess. 

The compensation is insulting. I went to a competitor in asset management for the same role level and tripled my compensation. You could probably quadruple your compensation by going to amazon, google, etc. A senior software engineer with 10yrs of experience at fidelity makes less than an entry-level software engineer at JP morgan/bank of america/goldman sachs with no years of experience. Don't work here unless you are in asset management. Those are the only people who make any real money.

The tech is severely outdated. Some engineers were working in COBOL while I was there. Once again, this is insulting and shows that no effort is made by management to invest in good tech. 

Management makes it very clear that technologists provide negative value, we were even told this during out first week. ""You are a cost center"" -- I can't tell you how many times I've heard this. It's so obvious. Why do you think there are barely any technologists in the Boston HQ? Instead they're pushed to the basements of New Hampshire and Rhode Island.

Bonus is insulting too. Don't count on that. 

People brag about the generous 401k match but it doesn't kick in for 5 years. That is 5 years you could be working as a technologist at a competing asset manager making triple your compensation. 

My first week at Fidelity a manager told me that technologists are expendable because their job can just be outsourced. Ouch.

This company has no path forward. Mutual funds are a thing of the past now that low-fee ETFs have become so popular. And their brokerage is so outdated."

There are also a lot of career opportunities as long as you are okay being stuck in a call center taking calls for awhile.,"I had such a bad experience with their hiring process, but I decided to take their offer anyway to give it a try. There is no flexibility with your schedule once you are out of training, and benefits choices are definitely not as good as advertised, especially with their health and dental insurance. They really don't offer a lot of options and they are very expensive comparing to what the market has to offer."

It would involve personal insults  and create a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" atmosphere. When achieving stated goals, you would be berated in the ""way"" you achieved the goals. The corporate culture at Fidelity claims an ""open door"" policy for its employee's. In reality, an employee is committing career suicide by complaining about an abusive situation. In my 25yrs as a financial professional, I have never worked in a more toxic unprofessional environment. Perhaps brought on by age discrimination."

The benefits are unmatched for New Hampshire (I would imagine the same for Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Colorado and Utah but I'm not 100% certain). The culture is awesome. Lots of positive people and I've definitely gotten my share of great managers that like to promote within. I believe that management culture does trickle down and inspire new and up-and-coming managers. Being positive at this company will certainly get your far. I tend to be a naturally positive person who is extremely driven. That speaks volumes.","It's stressful at times. The pay could be a little better, but it's not horrible by any means. I still feel like upper management is slightly disconnected to what we have to do vs. industry standards vs. their expectations. Lastly, we have an internal feedback board we can utilize to provide customer as well as coworker feedback, however the time frames from when the research of a project starts to when it completes can be well over 1 year.
