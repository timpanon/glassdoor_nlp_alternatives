0,First Republic Bank,Salesforce business analyst,2022-04-02,5.0,Salesforce Business Analyst,Great company.a good place to learn and grow.,No downside as such. no remote work
1,First Republic Bank,"Supportive, inclusive and fun",2022-03-14,5.0,Fraud Analyst,"High expectations for personal performance, great pay, great benefits, team very helpful and willing to train or answer questions.","Upper management offers empty promises of support and understanding to employees in personal crisis. In my case I was having performance related issues due to personal matters outside of work and a recent diagnosis of major depression. Management met with me to discuss and referred me to HR to take advantage of the ESP but during the process of completing the suggested steps of having a provider complete FMLA paperwork and request for accommodation I was fired. Clearly they were not interested in assisting an employee they claimed they had concern for and an interest in retaining as they said. 

Also, I was a remote employee and sat for 1 month after I was hired before training for my role even started. When training did start it was poorly organized and my suggestions were basically in one ear and out the other. The home office is based in SF, CA and I was in Boston, MA. We had to contend with technology issues and the time difference."
2,First Republic Bank,"It's great for some, but it's not for everyone.",2022-03-27,3.0,IT Contractor,"Good pay and benefits, reasonable hours. Cafeterias are subsidized. Stock has performed well for those in the ESPP.","This is not a traditional relaxed banking environment, more like a frenzied start-up. 

Turnover rate is high in the first 30 days (the Bank offers a financial incentive of an additional 1 months salary for those who choose to leave or are asked to leave within 30 days of hire). The termination process for all is immediate, and there are no probation plans. 

The Kool-Aid factor is high, so you either buy in or you don't. If you don't you need to be really good to stay in your job. 

The Bank currently has a hybrid work model, but some/many employees feel compelled to come into the office most days.

Some employees find their niche and stay long-term, but others find themselves in high burnout roles that are not sustainable for more than a few years.

Customers and customer service is the top priority of the Bank, with regulators coming next, then investors and employees.

The tone from the top differs greatly by department, so ratings for the firm as a whole may not be especially relevant.

Has weird cultural traits, like no org chart for a company with 6000+ employees."
3,First Republic Bank,"Fantastic culture, benefits & compensation",2022-03-30,5.0,Human Resources,"Excellent leadership, culture, core values (which everyone practices and recites regularly), compensation, benefits and perks. I feel so fortunate to be part of an organization that truly wants to do the right thing in every aspect of the business. They're also big on promoting from within and encouraging transfers if you're not quite in the right fit in your current role/department.","I've heard that the speed at which we operate can be a little too fast paced for some. But coming from the legal world where it can be like pulling teeth to move the needle on initiatives/projects, the pace here is refreshing to me."
4,First Republic Bank,Don’t Work For Lending Services,2022-03-03,3.0,Operations,Strong company with good pay and benefits.,"While the company has a great culture, promotes employees well being, growth and support, there are some departments that are absolutely awful and Lending Services is leading the pack. There is no respect, support nor appreciation for the production teams within this group. Closing and servicing teams have been mistreated, understaffed and overworked for a decade. The two senior authoritarian “leaders” that have been managing this department for over 10 years work in a vacuum and have zero compassion or respect for their operations teams. The level of their politics, favoritism, bias, control, gossip, lack of transparency and communication is unacceptable and shouldn’t be tolerated. Despite numerous complaints to HR, high turnover, especially amongst the managers who tried to make changes, nothing is being done by HR and executive management."
5,First Republic Bank,Lending Services,2022-03-24,3.0,Closing Specialist,"This team is dynamic, hardworking, and a proud team. We work so hard to meet banks needs and growth. The leadership team is amazing, ethical, they have the team members and the bank at heart. Our team had grown double its size in the past 2 years during COVID, they did everything they could to onboard, welcome, and train all new colleagues to do the best job they could. All this was done in a challenging time. Managers and team members worked side-by-side to meet the growth and keep our internal and external clients happy. Top Leaders are the motor of this team, and the most ethical, transparent, and fair leaders. Lending Services department is a great department to work for.",Work-life balance is challenging due to the growth of the company.
6,First Republic Bank,"Great Place to Work At, If You Find the Right Team",2021-12-19,5.0,Administrative Assistant,"Some of the nicest people I've worked with, but like all large companies, especially in the finance industry, some teams are more dysfunctional than others. Many in my department have worked for the bank for over 5 years. Other departments have much more attrition, as mentioned in other reviews. Luckily, my team's management keeps communication as transparent as possible. We are given opportunities to grow, but sometimes the onus is on us to really let it be known we are interested in more opportunities. 

Pay is above industry average for a bank, and the benefits package is well rounded too. With everything going on, the return to office date has been pushed back further into mid 2022 which is great because I love having the hybrid schedule of wfh and going in to the office twice a week.

I appreciate the bank providing opportunities to focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity now by creating and funding several community groups. Learning and Development has a mentorship program.","Sometimes the kool-aid about our special culture comes off as a bit too strong. Ironically, not all teams are not as friendly, or helpful, which makes cross-enterprise collaboration sometimes a painful chore.

Workload can flex at times, but nothing too unmanageable with good time management."
7,First Republic Bank,Leadership Crisis at First Republic Bank,2022-03-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits. Solid credit philosophy leading to stability for company and existing employees.,"If the recent developments within Lending Services are any indication, the evolution of leadership and culture at First Republic Bank is heading in a very concerning direction.  This company claims to value its employees but there has been a huge organizational shake up within Lending Services and no clear reasons have been given, other than a vague reference to ""growth."" 

As of two weeks ago, the department has been split in two, with the previous head of the department demoted to managing one half. The leadership they have brought in to manage the other half of the department was here in a leadership role about 3 years ago and oversaw the complete removal of overtime approval in that department. The result of this was a Department of Labor investigation, in which complaints of employees being forced to work overtime without being properly compensated were found to be accurate. The culture of fear and retribution created during this time is very well remembered, and many are anxious and afraid about the return to the department.

Additionally, this organizational change resulted in the sudden position elimination of someone who had served FRB for 21 years. They were not even given the opportunity to say farewell to the department. The fact that this person was given the unpleasant task of investigating the allegations made against the leader mentioned above during the period of overtime abuse has raised more than a few eyebrows given the current situation. 

The announcement of these changes came through a Town Hall meeting held for the department two weeks ago. Aside from vague mentions of growth as a justification for this re-org/position elimination, no other answers have been provided, other than ""we are figuring that out."" At best, this was a poorly thought-through, poorly managed organization shift initiated by so-called leaders with no concept of empathy or change management. At worst, this development highlights an extremely worrying cultural shift for First Republic Leadership - to care more about their own accumulation of power and control than to invest in sustainable business growth and the safety and engagement of its employees. 

Ethical leadership is on its way out at First Republic."
8,First Republic Bank,Fast paced and well compensated environment,2022-02-11,5.0,,"Echoing most of the reviews, the compensation, benefits, and bonus scheme are highly competitive.

Bankers feel like they have a voice or an advocate in Gaye Erkan because she has made them feel important and valued, not only in words, but in her actions as well.

I worked for the Enterprise Risk Management team for a year and a half, and the Chief Risk Officer was a real life Cruella Deville. I should have known things would be bad when the EA who’d originally hired me, quit and left the company the week I started. Stephanie the CRO degraded not only myself, but most of the members of the team behind their backs. And had several meltdowns during my time at the bank. Another risk officer “outed” a member of the team behind their back, which I overheard and brought up to HR. There have been probably 7-10 EAs that have been churned out of the ERM team within 5-6 years due to mistreatment and the toxic environment, yet there aren’t ever any consequences for the executives who are the true cause of this attrition. Avoid at all costs!! Also, the bank will not be offering a flexible working schedule as of the fall of 2021. They’re way behind the times."

Great place to both start and continue a career.","The fact they want people to be back in the office most if not full-time beginning September is a slap in the face to all of those that took the time to submit the exec team feedback over the last year and a half. If people wanted to be back in office, there would be MUCH larger numbers already returning as it is already optional. So why aren't there people in office now then (June/July), outside of the depts that are required to be in office? There'd be no need to bribe people (offering free lunches, etc.) that departments are trying to do. It's appalling after all of this past year and a half the exec team is still turning their heads to the fact people -- especially the millennial employees -- have expressed not wanting to go back, or at least having a say in how much they return. Taking the choice away from employees will only continue to make them leave. Is it really worth losing amazing employees?

The technology stack is really forward looking and you can directly influence that.  That's not something you can say at most companies of this size.  Working here is a chance to really affect outcomes at the ground floor.    The building blocks are there for this to be the absolute best place to work period.","Highly siloed teams.   Working cross team is more akin to working between unrelated companies.     Decisions are made by managers many levels above and there are no thoughts for how it affects those below.   The decision is made and the decree is sent.    The banking lines of business (clients, money, investments) and lines of the business that are not directly client connected work very differently.   Consider that when reading reviews.     

Your success here is highly dependent on your silo and your managers political pull.   If you have the wrong manager you're not going anywhere.   All titles are not equal.  Just because they appear to be peers doesn't mean they have similar influence.   Appearance matters over everything.  You have to be a cheerleader at all times or your career is done.   No one wants feedback that isn't how great they are doing."

The most highly valued jobs there were sales/relationship mgmt jobs, and to some extent cyber security jobs, anything else seemed to be considered an operational/regulatory necessity that just cost money.  Little value was placed on the money those roles saved the bank.  The bank's entire business model is to serve the interests of the ultra wealthy and the mass affluent.

Career advancement is a unicorn. Those who put their blood, sweat and tears into the environment are overlooked and considered disposable, while their peers and managers who take credit for their work are promoted. 

In order to get any meaningful work done, one has to sit through a day full of pointless and redundant meetings and complete tasks after hours and on weekends, making work/life balance a sick joke."

Middle managers are also mostly useless but they do mean well...they can’t be as effective as they need to be when they’re constantly drowning in the sea of BS being thrown their way.

All of our business used to be generated off of referrals and strong reputation. Customers used to comment on how they loved not having us call them to push products on them.

As a result, quite a few of the RMs are high-maintenance egomaniacs. 
- Lack of management support: regional sales director could not control the RMs under her; support staff were overworked and castigated for not meeting deadlines and/or making errors. 
- Poor approach to training new employees: I witnessed managers and line staff either refuse to train others or else train others (me) poorly. It felt like my manager and coworker jealously guarded knowledge because they feared training others would threaten their job security. 
- Although one of the company's values is ""have fun"", the pressure to underwrite and process a high volume of complex transactions on a regular basis - with little to no management support at times - limits one's ability to do so."

If you work at a corporate office, you have the advantage of goingto eagle cafe. You can get a solid breakfast and lunch for a fairly cheap price (especially in SF). 

Some of the people here are fun to work with it.","I will admit, when I first started at FRB I was so excited because I had always wanted to work here, that it casted a huge shade over all that was wrong with the workplace. I was told we were in transition and working towards the better so the environment would be less toxic. 3 years later, guess what? I still get that exact same message. 

Before I started here, even one of my trusted recruiters told me to reconsider. There is a high turnover rate, which is also a bad sign. There are rutheless management practices. I've seen people get fired for consistantly meeting all expectations. 

More than anything, is the quote that I and a few of my colleagues received from our VP in a skip level meeting, 

""I have no intention of doing any internal promotions. If we have hire level positions open, we'll just hire experienced staff to come in. If you want a hire position, you'll move on to another company. That's just corporate culture."""

I get to work with people who have a passion for service, enjoy doing the right thing and have a desire to help others.

The culture. There is a shared belief in the importance in and value of collaboration, the team, responsibility, trust, empowerment and accountability. 

The pace.  One of our values is quite literally reflective of how we operate: move fast, move forward. This creates a work day filled with a lot of activity and I enjoy being busy, having a lot to do and working in a fast paced environment.","If you are looking for a job or a company that is focused on a 9 to 5 work day, this is not the place for you."

The business units value their customers, which is really smart. First Republic has good benefits. They have a subsidized café run by Wolfgang Puck for employees, which is very nice. Jim Herbert is a great CEO and leader, but he’s only one guy.","Certain executives push their employees beyond their limits, making it difficult to manage work/life balance. Non-sales departments are VERY short staffed. Inefficient operational processes cause middle management burn-out. Support staff worked to death while sales people get bonuses and preferential treatments. Nepotism and favoritism is rampant especially among senior management. Loyalty is expected of employees but not reciprocated. No true HR functions, HR’s true purpose is to protect the company and senior management, not the employees. Managers are allowed to hire/ fire and promote based on cronyism rather than merit."
