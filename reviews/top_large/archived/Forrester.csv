0,Forrester,Wonderful First Year at Forrester!,2022-03-31,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The training process is fantastic. Basically an 8 week program with a mix of on-demand training that you do yourself, plus live sessions with fellow CSMs who are the instructors. 

Work life balance is awesome - we were given the opportunity to work remotely as often as we like, and it has been nice to be trusted to get our work done from home every day. 

The perks are great - nice vacation package with personal time, floating holidays, volunteer day, 401k match, employee stock purchase plan, etc. They are generous with bonuses and reward you for achievements accordingly. 

My coworkers are warm and were welcoming when I joined the Customer Success Org. A number of people took the time to have ""virtual coffees"" with me and introduce themselves during my first couple of months. 

The growth structure is well mapped out, so you are not stuck in the same role without being promoted for years on end.

Participating in meetings w/ analysts give you the ability to learn such a wealth of knowledge - the ""Forrester MBA.""","The pay could be better, but is not terrible. Compared to a SAAS CSM Position, it does not pay as well. 

Sometimes there's a disconnect between departments. Example - CSMs are told to give the client certain language, but other teams do not relay that same information so put us in a tough spot. 

Lots of products and information to learn right away - can be overwhelming.

Corporate rules can be annoying when it comes to annual raises and bonuses."
1,Forrester,"Well respected brand, but that's the end of the good",2022-03-31,2.0,Account Manager,"- Good brand name, people love to talk to us
- Lots of resources internally to help with selling
- Decent work life balance, not the highest stress or energy sales atmosphere","- Low energy sales atmosphere, little team feel
- Low pay relative to everywhere else
- Company leadership is laser focused on stock price, nothing else
- People are fleeing! Low pay is likely why
- Many people are overworked and way behind on SLAs
- Many inexperienced folks in roles that are critical to day to day functions
- Company is heading in the wrong direction, leaving it's legacy in the dust for that shiny new ""ARR"" (we wish we were a SaaS company, but we're not a tech firm)
- Sales leadership is not great, generally inexperienced
- Analysts (our ""product"") are overworked, unavailable, and fleeing the company at an alarming rate
- We're forced to sell products that our clients truly do not want, cannot use, and cannot afford, just to make quota"
2,Forrester,Forrester Practices What It Preaches,2022-03-01,5.0,Customer Success Manager,Working at Forrester for the last few months has been nothing short of an amazing experience. The people at Forrester are some of the kindest and most hard working people I have ever worked with in my career. Everyone is always willing to help each other out and collaboration is encouraged. Everyone has an impact and feedback is well received and implemented. Forrester analysts are a pleasure to work with and care deeply about Forrester clients. I would highly recommend Forrester as a great place to work.,"Training for my role could have been better structured and overall I felt as though I did not want to do next. However, I never felt that I could not ask for help or guidance when needed."
3,Forrester,Amazing Place to Work.  I may never leave,2022-03-01,5.0,Sponsorship Sales Executive,Forrester has a wonderful ecosystem of employees who value a work/life balance. The leadership team really listens to the opinions and concerns of employees and makes thoughtful decisions to improve on the employee experience. Leadership puts the customer first and uses the same train of thought with employees. This is by far the best company I have ever worked for and I feel very lucky to be here.,"Communication among different departments can be tough. Some information is learned by what is heard ""by the water cooler."" That being said, communication is still better than any other employer I have worked for."
4,Forrester,"Collaborative. Respectful, Welcoming Culture and Flexible Workplace",2022-02-24,5.0,Finance Analyst,"The company was transparent, innovative and inclusive when working through Covid related issues, mask mandates and back to office concerns. We maintain a flexible workplace; workers can continue to work remote or choose how many days they want to be in the office. 
Management regularly takes surveys and polls to include employee feedback in their decisions. 
The culture at the company is welcoming, respectful and progressive. 
The salary and benefits are good and the Cambridge office is convenient to the train station.",There are many career opportunities at the firm but you must be self directed to find them.
5,Forrester,"Great culture, poor compensation",2022-02-25,4.0,Research Associate,"Wonderful people, ample opportunities for career development and personal/professional growth, CEO is incredible. I've loved every team I've been on, and (for the most part) my managers have taken the time to develop me and push me past what I thought I was capable of. I do believe in our work and our industry leaders. I see how hard people work here, and it is inspiring.","Forrester believes they can compensate employees less for having a great culture and for being a leading research firm. It is true that I haven't left due to the people and environment but Forrester is not competitive enough in today's market. I think Forrester would rather keep salaries low, and lose talent then invest in their employees and compensate them appropriately."
6,Forrester,Not planning to leave Forrester any time soon,2022-01-31,4.0,Events,"Forrester really listens to their employees and has implemented Anywhere Work, which will enable employees to choose to go in the office if they want or work remotely (and when they do go in, work collaboratively). Over the years I have worked here they have always done their best to increase flexibility and promote the members of the team. They have amazing vacation time to offer and they also have a great maternity leave policy. There are a lot of different opportunities available as well if you decide to switch career paths.","It can be difficult to have a good work-life balance and to disconnect and use vacation time. It’s not easy to just consider this a 40 hour a week job and you will often take work home with you outside of those hours. However, they are now increasing headcount which should help with this."
7,Forrester,A great place to work with a choose your own adventure atmosphere,2022-02-01,4.0,Senior Consultant,"Forrester is a great place to work. I've been at the company for six year and during my tenure I've come across different challenges (in a good way) and opportunities that keep me motivated. I've found that the company does a great job giving you the space and resources to learn and grow. I started in more of a client services role, supporting IT leaders and learned a significant amount about technology. I was promoted in that role and when my family and I wanted to relocate (to be closer to family) they were more than supportive. I was then able to move over to consulting when an opportunity came up, which has allowed me to explore new areas and grow more skills. Of course, my accomplishments at Forrester haven't been given to me, they been earned. And that's what makes it one of the better companies to work for - they empower you to make the most of your career and recognize good work.",Change is a constant at Forrester so come with an adaptive mindset!
8,Forrester,Great place to learn,2022-03-31,4.0,Account Manager,Great learning and development environment.

10,Forrester,Going through Transition,2022-03-23,3.0,Account Manager IV,The executive team is very transparent. Good company morale.,"Many key analyst are quitting, they are giving significant increases on quota without being able to fulfill with the proper analyst team to deliver. Most employees are overworked and underpaid compared to market value."
11,Forrester,Great company culture,2022-02-21,5.0,Sales Executive,"Professional leaders, collaborative work culture, excellent products and services, customer driven and innovative company that evolves to meet client needs.",Sometimes challenging to strike a balance b/w work and personal.

14,Forrester,Great place to work and grow your career,2021-12-03,5.0,Client Executive,"Great work-life balance. You have the opportunity to work with the smartest people and most innovative companies in the world. You're at the center of business, tech, innovation, etc. Sales is very consultative and it will up your game and business acumen. Maybe just decide to skip the MBA and go work for a firm like Forrester?","Compensation may be a bit on the lower side but you can get to a point where you're be compensated well based on past performance. OTE can be strong if you're a top producer. If you can get there, you'll be working for an amazing company and earning a solid living."

20,Forrester,Good work life balance,2022-02-04,5.0,Consultant,"Great senior management 
Great work life balance",Need further investigation for time
21,Forrester,Opportunities to learn and grow supported by a strong culture,2021-11-23,5.0,Senior Consultant,"Whenever I talk to prospective applicants about why I've stayed with Forrester for so long, it always comes down to the culture. Client projects come and go; some great, some challenging. But over the last 5+ years I've found that I work with employees who are smart, kind, mature, and open to new thinking. I have never been made to doubt my value as a contributor, and in turn I am motivated to do my best work. 

Work/life balance is strong, and hours are flexible. As long as the work gets done, you can take the time you need to recharge. I have personally found that I can often make my own hours in a way that suits my working style / energy levels best.

On top of all that, I have made some of my best friends at Forrester. I could go on about culture.

As for the work: over my tenure I have played a few different roles within the organization, and have been encouraged to find what works best for me. Within Consulting, that encouragement continues where I have been given the space to explore and learn what I enjoy doing most. 

Forrester gives you the tools to build your expertise in whatever area you find yourself most drawn to. I am continually challenged to grow and am now miles ahead from where I started when first joining the team.","The workload is often heavy, and burnout is a strong possibility if you don't take the initiative to take care of yourself. That said - the team is highly supportive and understanding when you need to take the time to re-energize. 

Compensation could be better - but management is working to rectify this as we work our way out of the pandemic."
22,Forrester,Best Place I Have Worked,2022-01-12,5.0,Client Executive,"Family Friendly

24,Forrester,"Good people, but not a lot of opportunity for growth",2022-01-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,I loved the people I worked with everyday. They fostered an environment of collaboration and we got stuff done!,"There wasn't a lot of room for growth even though the company constantly said there was. Before I left I asked for a title change to match my current role (I was really doing the work of two people), and I was told that wouldn't be possible. They then posted for my replacement with that job title that I wanted."
25,Forrester,Consistently wonderful,2022-01-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great energy, genuine people, great benefits.","Not a lot to say here, really!"
26,Forrester,Great place to work.,2022-01-13,5.0,Operations Manager,Smart people. Relaxed corporate culture. Innovative.,"Found some of their WFH policies ridged and not equally applied, though this likely changed with covid."
27,Forrester,Out of Touch,2021-12-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Work/Life balance is pretty good,"Incredibly difficult to move forward in your career. There is a serious bias towards hiring people from outside the company whenever a more senior role is made available. You end up competing for promotions with professionals outside of the company and are at a disadvantage because of it. Since the pandemic began, Forrester has also seriously scaled back opportunities for advancement and to upskill (previously available perks like education reimbursement have been cut, hiring/promoting frozen). At this point, accepting a position at Forrester is a guaranteed way to put your career on hold."
28,Forrester,Great place to sell. Customers love us,2022-01-12,5.0,Senior Account Executive,Very very smart people and customer always comes first,Multiple solutions that weight differently for commission
29,Forrester,Good work life balance but little growth opportunity,2022-02-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The work life balance is great and the people are always kind!,There is no defined career path and growth here is slower than at most other firms.

31,Forrester,"Amazing place to work - great team, work-life balance, and flexible working options",2021-09-07,5.0,Associate Consultant,"My team at Forrester is beyond amazing. Everyone is very open minded, intelligent, and values work-life balance. Management (both at the team and corporate level) has always been responsive to feedback and proactive about collecting it. I'm always learning on the job and there are plenty of opportunities for me to progress my career forward in any number of growth paths. Overall Forrester (or at least the team I work within) is an amazing place to work.","The salary is pretty low compared to other roles across the country, but when you divide time worked by the salary, I think it compares to most other companies."

33,Forrester,Great company with highly connected culture,2021-11-18,5.0,Designer,"Working with people from high-ranking execs at Forrester to my tight-knit team, everyone has been open and genuine. Amid the chaos of the pandemic and a very large product launch, Forrester ensured that very employee felt heard and had agency to make change.",Forrester walks the walk with their slogan: Bold At Work. This requires a level of flexibility across all workers that can sometimes be hard to maintain.
34,Forrester,A Special Culture,2021-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Top notch culture from the top down. The Exec Team is transparent and accessible. The company has made significant progress over the past year in keeping current with seismic shifts in the future of work. The new flexible work policy allows employees to work up to three days/week from home. The org is being much more open about diversity & inclusion and what we're doing to get better. Gender diversity has always been outstanding - half the employee base is female and more than half the current Exec Team are women. This is a community where you can truly bring your whole self to work - colleagues are truly curious about who you are and the path you took to get here. It is a kind and caring place of very smart and talented people. I've seen many people really grow their careers here.,Not the most innovative culture - product has lagged changes in the market.
35,Forrester,"People, culture, work life balance, and PURPOSE!",2021-10-04,5.0,Senior Consultant,"I've worked at FORR for 3 years, and everyday I wakeup excited for my job.

Forr handled the pandemic well. 
Leadership communicates often and transparently. 
My team is full of kind, hardworking, and smart people... NO EGO!
Great work life balance
Realistic expectations and rewards.
Learning culture allows you to explore.","Pay and benefits aren't as sexy as a tech company, but you stay for the culture and the work, not to become billionaires."

Innovative, forward-thinking and profatable.","As with any research firm, the IP is the people and more specifically; the research analyst.

39,Forrester,Best Places to Work - pretty much covers it,2021-06-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Leadership team, corporate culture, kindness, consideration
- Employees encouraged to be creative and given platforms to showcase talents
- Teaching employees everyday to lead and resolve conflict with intellectual and emotional awareness.","- Technology Platforms - employees could use more guidance and education 
- Employee learning needs better structure and content to help increase competency and encourage growth across all functions."
40,Forrester,"Great company, culture and team - much lower than average pay",2021-08-21,5.0,"Great Company, Culture and Team","I have worked at Forrester for 3 years, and have had ample opportunity to grow and develop in my career. Most of the leadership really does seem to care about you personally and professionally. There is a high standard of excellence expected, and you get to rub shoulders with genuinely smart folks. I enjoy the impact we make on client's work, and that we get to work on so many different projects.","The pay doesn't seem to be keeping up with industry trends. Even after just recently getting a raise, I'm consistently tempted with offers on Linkedin to interview with other companies that are paying anywhere from 30% - over 100% more than I'm making now...and again, this is after two promotions/significant raises in 3 years. We are well above our sales targets as a company and layed off many high-salaried leaders at the start of this year, so I do hope that makes it's way down to us ""average"" workers or we'll continue to have folks leaving that don't necessarily want to. I would also like the option to stay completely remote in 2022....Other than that, it's great."

48,Forrester,An amazing place to work!,2021-06-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-The culture at Forrester is fantastic. If you're looking for kind, hardworking, and GENIUS coworkers, this is the place to be. The executive team is also lovely, very thoughtful and conscientious of employee wellbeing.
-Work-life balance here is wonderful. There isn't a ""work your life away"" mentality here. While we work hard during the day, Forrester is very respectful of their employees by keeping a firm work-life balance. 
-This is a great place to be if you love being challenged. Things are constantly shifting, so you'll never be bored. The growth I've experienced in the time I've been with Forrester so far has far exceeded any other company I've worked for. 
-Competitive salary, great benefits","Would love to see more diverse representation within the Forrester employees, but Forrester's new-ish D&I initiative is doing an excellent job paving the way for inclusiveness and representation in the workforce."
49,Forrester,Not perfect but overall a good place to work,2021-10-01,4.0,Consultant,"- Lots of very smart people. People in middle management roles really feel like they've earned those roles and are very competent.
- Generally a good work/life balance in consulting. The nature of the work means you go through the occasional crazy patch but it balances out.
- You're treated like an adult here. Nobody micro-manages your time and nobody is going to scold you if you don't always show up to work exactly on time or if you feel like you need to take a break so you sign off at 3pm on a Friday. As long as you're getting your work done, nobody really cares how it happens.
- The work is interesting. You learn a lot and definitely develop a ton of very transferable skills as a consultant.
- Benefits are good!
- The company is on very solid financial ground. There were obviously some dips during the pandemic but I don't believe anyone had to be laid off or any salaries were cut.
- Despite all of the cons below, I definitely have enjoyed my time here and have worked with some really awesome people.","- Salaries are quite low compared with the market. They're comparable with boutique market research firms but far lower than you'd be making in equivalent roles at big consulting/accounting firms or working for a vendor. Virtually everyone who leaves makes substantially more when they do. Promotion cycles are also generally pretty slow.
- The CEO is generally out of touch, often says pretty tone deaf or even downright offensive things and has far too much control over the company. Nobody seems to be able to check his worse impulses, he pretty much does whatever he wants, even if it hurts the company or employees.
- The company is VERY white. They have put together a D&I council which is doing good work so there's definite hope that this will change. The executive leadership does not seem to have much interest in it (see bullet above).
- The consulting department, in particular, seems to have become very much the forgotten child at Forrester despite it being by far the most profitable branch. I'm not sure how much that actually means long term but its definitely something that people in the consulting org have noticed."
50,Forrester,"Genuine, positive culture and leadership. Analyst role is very demanding.",2021-10-05,4.0,Senior Analyst,The CEO/Founder George Colony sets a great tone. Forrester is filled with very smart and hard working people. The firm has earned its great reputation.,"Analyst role is very demanding, so much client interaction and demands from sales, elsewhere, that there is little time to actually do research and write reports (only about 1/3 of my time is spent on the latter). Time management challenges and danger of burnout are major issues."

Flexible work life/balance
Chief people officer who is empathetic, thoughtful, and caring. Has done an amazing job keeping (most of) the organization human in a time of disruption.","Lack of coordination and communication
Toxic leadership within certain departments
**Proceed with caution** Culture varies widely by team

My role is being eliminated over an incredibly long time period to make way for the future alignment of products. While leadership felt that this was the best way to help us find new jobs, it has made it incredibly difficult to stay motivated. The lack of coordination, communication, and a plan for how we will move forward is has created an awful employee experience for those of us who work closely with clients. We have been buried underneath layers of poor management, and are slowly being pushed out of the company. Given all the transformation Forrester is undergoing, you would think that they would like to keep some of their talent and re-purpose them. The opportunities have been few and far between to transfer internally. Forrester is losing great people because of a very unthoughtful decision."

55,Forrester,Needs Improvement,2021-08-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Forrester has a great culture and team atmosphere. I appreciate the authenticity of some of my coworkers. It's inspiring to see so many smart individuals who have so much to offer.,"Lack of career growth and getting siloed into a position with no upward movement. There's too much ""do the job before you get the title"" going on with little review of how long this is happening - a person should not be doing the job without the pay or title for more than 3-4 months. Pay is way lower than industry standard and some managers undervalue their employees."

There's a genuine sense of respect and collaboration across teams, which makes it easier to have constructive conflict, all with the customer at the center of our actions. The corporate culture has generally been very good (although declining quickly -- more details in the ""Cons"" section), and I've learned more in my role at Forrester than I did at my previous employers and in my schooling.","Unfortunately, the executive team doesn't embody the same corporate values that my colleagues demonstrate and take to heart . Over the last 1.5 - 2 years, there's been a steady decline in the integrity of executive leadership decisions and communications to the both the employee population and clients, to the point where I would honestly no longer recommend this organization to friends, acquaintances, or prospective clients. 

Sadly, I no longer view Forrester as a research, data, and people company. And while I have the upmost respect for my colleagues' integrity and knowledge, I now view Forrester as primarily a sales company, that just happens to sell advice on best practices in customer and employee experience, while failing to follow their own ""playbook"" and recommendations."
58,Forrester,"Good brand, bad experience",2021-10-07,2.0,Product Manager,A great learning experience.  Smart people.,Underpaid which leads to the feeling of very undervalued. It’s extremely difficult work and the pay is well below where it should be. Disappointing.
59,Forrester,"Pleasant office culture, but lacking sense of impact",2021-02-08,3.0,Research Associate,"Great colleagues. Forrester is a great place if you're interested in surrounding yourself by intelligent people. There is a great buzz of information around the office, you can really engage with people around you on some interesting topics that range from research on marketing, financial services, etc.","The pay is pretty poor, especially for New York standards. At the end of the day the impact of the company feels rather shallow. The whole business model is rooted around trying to be a ""thought leader"" in the MANY verticals the company focuses on. The quality of research used to support this model is rather poor in my opinion. A research engagement basically consists of aggregating qualitative interviews from executives at different business. The only data used is survey data that in many cases is hard to access due to cumbersome internal processes. If you look at the way companies are operating now, what's the appeal of going to this outside entity when all the data relevant to optimizing business performance can be aggregated and actioned upon internally? Forrester feels like a dinosaur company flailing for relevance in the modern era of advanced analytics and data science."
60,Forrester,"Great culture, amazing leadership, and wonderful people",2021-07-27,4.0,Customer Success Manager,I love the culture and collaboration. Forrester feels like a family.

The opportunities to participate in the change vary, but they are there for the taking. My career has evolved over the 20+ years and continues to provide me with growth and challenge. 

Forrester is always looking to be better, for the clients and the employees, so change is constant.",Colleagues become impatient with career growth and leave Forrester. Forrester needs to provide competitive compensation to retain their amazing talent

67,Forrester,Sales Review,2021-04-29,5.0,Account Manager I,"It's great - let's you have control of yourself, book of business, and the company. They listen to employees, and change policies for the better frequently to increase employee and customer experience/satisfaction. Also it is really rewarding to talk to CEO's, CMO's, and CIO's of major tech companies to help them as a consultant and adviser. Also great co-workers, managers, and exec team.",Sales process can be long and product/solution line can be hard to learn/fully ramp up to in order to start making good money ($80k+) - usually takes a year to ramp up to that point.

70,Forrester,Supportive Environment,2020-10-14,5.0,Employee Experience,"Careers go through seasons and this season has been like no other, where personal and professional have inextricably collided. Forrester has been an unfaltering place of support during this tumultuous year - an element that has been critical to someone like myself - a working parent of a young child. They've provided words of support and actions to back those words up - through a day-off for parents, schedule flexibility, and general understanding of deadlines, goals, and emotional energy during the day. Because of this, I have continued to feel like a productive team member with a long-term place at Forrester. I am also proud of how the overall company is continuing to grow through our renewed focus on D&I, excitement about our offerings to the market, and a new/rich management development program. I remain grateful to Forrester leadership for their unwavering commitment to me as a person and as a Forrester employee.","I look forward to continued investments in our technology, which will only increase our effectiveness as a temporarily-remote company. Other than that, honestly, with everything going on, I am happy and content with how Forrester is operating. I'm sure that post-COVID, I'll go back to the typical ""wish we had thats,"" but for now my priorities are elsewhere!"
71,Forrester,Good Organization,2021-08-26,4.0,Account Manager,Good Leadership; Good product; Great team,Territories were not evaluated to be equal across the organization; Senior reps located at Boston HQ cherry picked accounts. Very hard for a new account manager to maintain success year over year
72,Forrester,Fantastic company to work for,2021-07-01,5.0,Principal Consultant,"Forrester has an extraordinary management team, led by Founder and CEO George Colony. George's passion for the company, its customers and its employees is remarkable and that passion cascades down and throughout the company.",I have experienced NO downsides to working at Forrester over the past 5 years.
73,Forrester,Happy to work here,2021-06-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Very inclusive workplace. Good promotional opportunities. And the work community is helpful and insightful. Inspires a culture that constantly has you wanting to better yourself and better serve your clients,"Pay scale may not be as competitive as other organizations. There is an internal salary structure, and have heard you can negotiate for more if you leave the company and return at a later time."
74,Forrester,First few years are good until you hit the brick wall,2021-06-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company decision making is seemingly transparent, frequent updates provided to employees along the way, good benefits, remained in tune with the “new normal”, enjoyable office atmosphere (pre-pandemic).",Lack of upward mobility and a very disconnected department that did not “grow in unison.” Certain people promoted repeatedly while others who performed highly were ignored. Promotions or changes only really occur when someone leaves the company = growth depends on “how many years you want to wait.” If you want to change departments you need to start over in an entry level role. Ultimately felt boxed in and undervalued.
75,Forrester,"Overall, really enjoyable place to work",2020-06-27,5.0,Researcher,"-I'm proud to work with really good people. I haven't met anyone there who I would consider a ""jerk"" and I'm proud to tell people I work at Forrester. 
-People generally work hard and care a lot about what they do. 
-The work we do is really interesting and we get to interact with clients to solve some of the most challenging problems that businesses face. 
-In my role (Researcher), you have the opportunity to learn quite a bit in a short time.","-Organizationally, we can do a much better job of coordinating knowledge and resource sharing across the organization. On many occasions, it feels like ineffective communication across different departments makes it more difficult to do our best work. We still always get the job done, but it's frustrating at times to experience these inefficiencies as an employee. 
-In my role, it's not especially clear what the career path is which is why many researchers will leave the company for a different role because they can't find a way within the company to advance their career. Sadly, more than a few people who have left the role wanted to stay at the company but found no path to advance."
76,Forrester,Love this company!,2021-06-03,5.0,Manager,Forrester is in tune with their employees. Upper management listens to their concerns and takes action towards a solution. We are a fast-paced company!,"If you don't like change, Forrester is not for you. We are not afraid of change. While I haven't always understood the needs for some of the changes I always look back and appreciate that they were made after the fact."
77,Forrester,Love the team environment & culture at Forrester,2021-08-02,4.0,Event Manager,"I love working at Forrester! Since the acquisition of SiriusDecisions over a year ago, it has been a very positive progression and time of growth for Forrester. From the executive team to individual contributors, everyone is kind, respectful, welcoming and personable. I've worked at the company for over three years and couldn't be happier.","Benefits are good, but not the best. The opportunities for promotion and salary increase should be more frequent throughout the year."
78,Forrester,Love this company,2020-06-04,5.0,Program Manager,"Culture. When everyone said how great the culture is during my interview process, I was like, yeah whatever. They weren't kidding. This company culture really is extraordinary. Everyone is collaborative and helpful across every team I've worked with. 

A huge part of the culture starts from the executive team. Every other company I've worked for had a divide between the C-suites and the rest of the org... not here. They lead with transparency and truly listen to what employees have to say. I actually feel like my voice matters to them. During COVID, decisions regarding working from home and travel restrictions were made quickly with clear communication. They've even given us a couple extra mental health days because they understand the challenges everyone is facing both at work and in their personal lives. They've taken a stand against the injustices that are being brought to light in our world and have given our Forrester community a place to openly dialogue and share resources on how we can be better. 
I appreciate that the executive team is willing to be flexible - if something isn't working or needs to change, they change it rather than falling back into the ""that's the way we've always done it"" mentality. 

I have been genuinely impressed with this company and the people in it.",None. Really. None at all.
79,Forrester,"Quality Company, Product, and People",2020-05-22,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"- Transparent, qualified, and quality executive leadership...I have greatly valued their leadership and transparency through this challenging year. I do feel like they genuinely have our and the companies best interest in mind. I can say the same for my direct management.
- Quality Teammates...I have so many smart and genuinely collaborative colleagues it's nearly an embarrassment of riches
- Important Product...it shouldn't take a pandemic to realize this, but I see how our research, content, and analysts are more imperative than ever to support companies in navigating these times and the future.","- I've said this many of times, but I think our 401k match is weak compared to similar companies. We are matched 50%, up to 3%. I'm not expecting it to change in this climate, but, when we come back out I think that's important.
- We are full time work from home now, and I think that the option to do so full time (while having a local office available) should be strongly considered. Most of my direct ecosystem live in different states or countries, and all of my clients are as well, so I don't see having the option to work remote/in office affecting my performance."
80,Forrester,Great place to launch your career,2021-09-21,4.0,Senior Research Associate,"- great mentorship

81,Forrester,Great people and Career Opportunities,2021-01-14,5.0,Consultant,"Forrester is full of great people and career opportunities. It has corporate benefits with a start-up vibe. Yes, we have 401k match, good healthcare, etc. But the best part is that senior leadership makes themselves accessible to you from the very first day by attending your onboarding. Unlike other corporate companies, Forrester leadership actually talks and listens to their employees. I feel comfortable emailing my manager, or even my director with ideas and questions. My manager encourages honesty and advocates on my behalf. The people are collaborative, not competitive. I have made good friends while working here and enjoy working with colleagues across the business.",Forrester is a corporation and with that comes rules and processes that can sometimes feel like red-tape. The company provides great opportunities but their are little short cuts - you have to follow the processes in place.
82,Forrester,Great place to start your career,2021-04-07,5.0,Program Manager,"Forrester has given me so many opportunities to start my career. I have been able to make so many connections within and outside of the organization. The benefits are great - including a strong 401k plan & medical & dental plans. Forrester has made me feel cared about during the pandemic , they have listened to their employees & taken care of our mental health. I am grateful to work for such an incredible organization!",Pay may not be as competitive as other places.

87,Forrester,Forrester AE Review,2020-07-22,2.0,Account Executive,Strong name recognition. Global Company Leadership trying foster culture to be better than most large public enterprises. Really cool product and IP to sell.,"Culture isn't very work/life balanced, seems to almost dabble into work is life. Sales leadership not the greatest from boots on the ground perspective, although front line managers are fantastic. Benefits are not great, or even competitive. Lots of process for the sake of process, If you don't know the ecosystem (which is large and nuanced) can be hard to get answers and support in a timely manner. Deal Desk can some times feel more like sales disablement.

Came into org via acquisition, our org was treated like the red headed step child and the established relationships were seemingly discounted as a lot of key partnerships were switched out."
88,Forrester,Great first year,2021-06-25,5.0,Director,Company culture is awesome! The people are great and we have an excellent reputation in the industry.,"Due to COVID, I haven't met my co-workers yet but I will soon!"

If you’re a white male, went to a hip top tier college, we’re in a frat, and use words like “awesome” or “cool beans”, you’ll fit in great here. Just look at the executive leadership. There is not one person of color. Words cannot describe how uncomfortable I felt being one of a handful of POC at this company."
93,Forrester,Good place to work,2021-08-12,4.0,Marketing Specialist,Great co-workers. Clearly defined tasks. Benefits are top-notch and pay is fair with bonuses based on company performance.,There is sometimes a drift towards needless bureaucracy (meetings for meetings' sake). Sometimes vision can get lost in the administrative weeds.
94,Forrester,Great team & company,2021-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing team, managers, & culture!",None really- more diversity would be a plus!
95,Forrester,Great Company W/ Some Pains,2021-01-21,5.0,Account Manager,Forrester listens to it's employee's and does it's best to practice what it preaches.,Tough ecosystem to navigate and the products/memberships are getting increasingly complicated for our clients and to sell. Constantly changing memberships leaving sales to clean up the mess while giving bigger quotas. Also you really have to have a friend in management to get in to management. A lot of middle management hires from outside the company which crushes team and employee moral. Could be much better about promoting from within.

Executive management is transparent and follows-through
Colleagues are supportive and properly challenging/motivating
Agility of small company, resources of a larger company","Compared to cons from other directly competitive companies, for which I've worked, there are no systemic cons at Forrester like ones at other companies.
May be limited growth/promotion opportunities in some departments due to flatter nature of business
Some resistance/reluctance to change/innovate from long-term colleagues"

This is changing."
103,Forrester,Favorite place to work,2021-03-11,5.0,Talent Acquisition Specialist,"Team was extremely collaborative, ideas were respected and valued. I really felt like I had a voice and when I didn't want to contribute because I felt unsure they made me feel like there is value in a lot of what we say and can improve on all of our ideas.

I appreciate the willingness to sit down with each employee to learn, grow and improve. I feel that my and our opinion(s) are considered and acted on as best capable to drive the business in a positive direction. I am thrilled to be working here and appreciate the opportunity I have been given. I couldn't have landed at a more supportive and energy filled environment. From the leadership team to my peers, all are willing to jump in an lend a hand to my success and the success of the business. As a collective, we truly believe in our mission, vision and values. We embrace curiosity and genuine interest in our client's success as a partner and collaborator.","We all have our struggles or inefficiencies. From what I have seen so far, we actively engage to better learn about ourselves as a working group and our processes, then utilize our tools and resources to plan and execute to solve for a better experience. This should probably go in the ""pros"" but I am surprised by the decisiveness and precision with which we identify and act on areas for improvement."

Difficult to learn how to align Forrester value with the client's needs. (This reflects the business model; it's not a Forrester thing)
106,Forrester,Forrester is a family,2020-08-19,5.0,Research Associate,"I've been with Forrester for 2 years now. When I first walked in I figured it would be just like any other job. It wasn’t until I was faced with one of the most personal hardships I hope to ever endure that I realized it was so much more than just a job. So many colleagues became like family, became a support system that I couldn’t have done without. And Forrester as a whole really took care of me.

Exactly one year ago today I had to make the very difficult decision to leave my position with Forrester to tend to personal matters. I didn’t think I’d have the chance to come back.

I was only gone for 2 months and I had the opportunity to come back, and my Forrester family welcomed me right back in.

Although we spend so much of our lives at work, It’s pretty rare to find a job where you feel a part of something bigger. I couldn’t have gotten through the past two years without the support of my fellow Forresterites.",There are few cons to Forrester worth mentioning.

Senior Leadership really tries to make the work experience the best they can. Great strides in D&I in 2020. CSO is a shining star: she cares about her people and is willing to pivot to make things better for them.,"Not a sales-first organization, but also not as flexible as it should be for Account Management or Customer Service. With the acquisition and absorbing of SiriusDecisions being harder than expected (my perception: George really didn't understand what he was buying or how to use it), and then the pandemic, 2020 was a tough year. Hopefully in 2021 the ship will be righted a bit to help Forrester achieve its promise."
110,Forrester,You feel your work makes a difference... because it does,2021-01-09,5.0,Research Director,A place where you're allowed to share thoughts - and concerns - freely. Continually contribute to ideas that change clients and the people touched by them. I'm surrounded by some of the smartest and passionate people I've ever worked with.,"Forrester, like all other organizations, has needed to adapt to a post-Covid world.

Inclusive work culture. Lovely office location. Transparent leadership. Open door policy (literally, there are no offices!) Nice WFH options. Decent 401K match. Truly and honestly concerned with solid employee satisfaction. This is a place you work very very hard but there is a really wonderful work life balance and the rewards can be fabulous.","SiriusDecisions (where I am a legacy employee) was acquired by Forrester 1.5 years ago and there are still bumps and potholes to work out, some slower then others to manage through. But that will all come to pass, just practice patience and grit. I'm coming from a way smaller company, so moving into a much bigger one has it's new challenges with work flow and a lot more management styles to navigate. Honesty and candid communication often works most of it out. Things in some spots are very slow to merge since acquisition. There is definitely ego in places fighting for prominence, ignore it and focus on your success. The robust medical is extraordinary (truly incredible) but very expensive at all tiers."
118,Forrester,Sales Management Ruins the Employee Experience,2021-01-20,2.0,Account Manager,"Smart, cool people everywhere. The company does generally put out a good product. Colleagues are generally great. Pay is decent (not high, but about average to above average). CEO is a character.","The sales leadership over a large part of the business is simply bad. High ups preach what they read in management books. Transparency is minimal. Open door policy isn't, well, open. Ground level managers are some of the worst I've experienced. They don't understand the company, customers, or processes, but instead harp on data, data, data. Then, the blame falls to you."

The company offers good starting pay and generous benefits, but the most compelling reason to work here is the corporate culture. The management team leads with emotional intelligence, compassion, and empathy. They promote an environment of learning, sharing and collaboration among employees and encourage team members to come together and create innovative “out of the box” solutions. 

The company continually shows employees how much they are valued. There are many impromptu employee socials at corporate office and even during the pandemic when business was negatively impacted, the management team made it clear that they support their workforce and our health and welfare is of their utmost concern. 

The company promotes social justice, sustainability, and corporate responsibility. They encourage employees to volunteer for their favorite causes and recognize their efforts by giving them and their charity a shout out on internal company video channels.",I wish the learning center had directed learning paths tied to open jobs.

Management wants sales to succeed and is genuine about helping each rep develop.,Comp can very dermaticy depending on tenor or position in sales. Seems as if some on the same teams have a significant variation in comp even though they might do the same job with the same type of clients.
136,Forrester,Good Intentions - but Unclear Strategy and Mixed Execution,2020-05-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"As many have commented, the culture is one of the strongest parts of Forrester. We do genuinely believe in - and live - our company values, collaboration being at the forefront. Leadership genuinely cares about the employees, as is evidenced by the large investment (people and time) in Employee Experience. We are a purpose-driven company, focusing on helping our clients to become better businesses (again aligned with the values)--and there is no shortage of smart, capable people to learn from.","Every year it seems one of the Executive Team members leaves (or is asked to leave) and the new regime hits the reset button on that function. This causes a lot of reactionary thinking, and although our high-level strategy has not shifted materially in recent years, the next click down strategy continues to lurch from silver bullet to silver bullet. Many of us have change fatigue, not because of the pace of change but because of the unclear rationale behind it."

140,Forrester,Best job I've ever had,2019-10-21,5.0,Customer Success,The willingness to help others is striking. I've never worked somewhere that people were so open and excited to help others succeed. There's not a feeling of step over someone to get ahead. The exec team is very transparent with where the company is going and changing. I have incredible teammates and I'm so thankful to work here.,"The cons definitely do not outweigh the good. I almost feel bad noting cons because I feel so lucky to work here, but there are some areas that could be improved. First, pay just isn't livable. Living paycheck to paycheck is miserable especially when the company constantly speaks on how much it values it's employees. We're offered some benefits that aren't even feasible such as tuition reimbursement- but only for further education. This benefit could be so beneficial to employees struggling to make student loan payments yet it can't be used towards loans already taken out to get to qualified to work here. Training could be updated and more connected throughout the company. It's very hard to understand what the rest of the company does and teams don't have a specified training program. It's almost like everyone is winging it."

- I have grown and seen others grow at this company. The culture is extremely supportive and we are encouraged to be our true selves. I don't feel the need to hide who I am around co-workers and feel supported in all my endeavors.

Some of the most dedicated and incredible people I have ever met. 

The work we do is incredible and one-of-a-kind. I didn't realize I would find the job/industry I want to be in for a long time so early in my career.

Great visibility into company performance and overall direction lead by the executive team during frequent company-wide meetings.","No formal investment in junior employees, but there is a culture of making sure junior folks are feeling engaged and valued.

Some of the people most invested in my professional development are not my manager (pro and con). 

It can be difficult at times to connect with other employees outside of your department and fully understand the work that they do.

- Solid benefits
- Nice office in Cambridge","- A lot of egos - if you're not in sales or research you might feel left out
- For CSM team, ways of working are not standardized across teams
- You ask 5 people the same question, you'll get 5 different answers
- Way too many cooks in the kitchen, working across various teams to get anything done
- Products are confusing, especially with recent acquisition of SiriusDecisions
- Sink or swim atmosphere, didn't feel set up for success
- Pay is low, can make a lot more as CSM at SaaS company
- Location is mediocre, there's a hotel with overpriced bar in office park but no where to go for social gatherings. One T stop away from Davis Square but not like being in downtown Boston."

They company pivoted very well during this COVID time, having us all working productively at home in a short amount of time. They care about their clients (that isn't just talk) and they want to do right by clients and serve them well. I also personally love by boss. No company is perfect but so far my work experience here has been pleasant and also given me lots of opportunities for growth!","I don't like the commute when we are not in a pandemic, but that is because I don't want to pay the high prices to live close to the downtown Nashville office. Mostly a personal choice, but really the only downside to the job."
162,Forrester,Client Centered Approach & Exceptional Employee Experience,2020-05-21,5.0,Senior Client Executive,"Excellent culture! I have 20+ years of sales experience, Forrester is by far the most client centered company I have ever worked for. Everyone in the organization thinks client first and is really to support that mission. Great internal partnership. The employee experience is top notch as well. So many incredibly impressive solutions we can offer our clients. Allows you to be creative in putting together actual full breadth solutions for your clients, not just pushing licenses or product.","There are so many solutions and supportive resources that it can be a bit overwhelming. However, that's a nice problem to have. Regarding compensation, while the commission and bonus structures are both very good, the overall package/OTE is lower than with other firms."
163,Forrester,Poor Management,2020-12-12,2.0,Senior Analyst,Some good people. Great access to industry insiders.,Senior management is a club of folks that have been at Forrester most of their careers. They have an inflated sense of themselves and are very clubby. The reality for most folks is they are kind of stuck and can’t move even laterally.
164,Forrester,Great work-life balance,2021-03-29,4.0,VP-Analyst,"Interesting work, always changing, good work-life balance",You have to be an expert at time management to juggle all the client demands
165,Forrester,Endless learning opportunities,2019-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester truly hires incredibly smart people. Our motto of ""Challenge thinking. Lead change"" is actually completely accurate. I am surrounded by people who push me to think differently. You are given the autonomy to change things if you see a better way to do it, to create processes that may not have existed, you are taught how to think about the larger picture, etc. (I could go on forever). It is a great place to start and/or grow your career in ways I never thought possible. In just over a year, I feel like I have learned 5+ years of information and have made connections throughout the entire company.

As for our leadership at the C-level, I don't think I could ask for more. They are willing to listen to feedback and take to heart what employees say they want/ need to make their lives better.","There is a need for increased working flexibility (flex hours/ days off/ WFH days/ etc), but I think that will come in due time. I have faith in exec leadership to stay up to par on industry standards."
166,Forrester,Great place enter the working world,2019-10-10,4.0,Research Associate,"The community at Forrester, and specifically the community of young professionals, is extremely strong. Co-workers are almost always willing to go out of their way to answer questions and help you solve a problem. 

The work that Forrester does is interesting. Being surrounded by some of the foremost subject matter experts in a given industry or on some technology is thrilling, if a bit intimidating at times. The opportunity to soak up information from those around you is nearly constant. People are passionate about what they do, and are usually happy to take time to share it with you.","The ability to seek growth, both professional and personal, is, at times, unclear. I find myself having to take initiative, and go beyond my stated day-to-day responsibilities, in order apply and grow the skills that will serve me throughout my career.

I don't have much visibility into what those outside of my organization are doing (and if roles in these organizations would also be of interest to me). Most opportunities I've had to learn about the different aspects of Forrester have been self-discovered and ad hoc. Internal recruitment, and the drive to always have its employees maximizing the value they are delivering, needs more emphasis."

170,Forrester,A great place to learn and grow if you're willing to work for it,2019-10-15,5.0,Principal Advisor,"There are always opportunities to learn, whether it's by reading research or engaging directly with analysts and consultants. You're given clear direction about what success looks like and you're given support to help get there. You're also provided tools that help you be productive from just about anywhere. Many (but not all) managers are flexible about work location, which should be the case 100% for a global company that has a good-sized remote workforce. You're constantly surrounded by really smart, nice people who are trying to do the right thing all the time.","The location of the Cambridge HQ makes for a terrible commute and there are no restaurants, coffee shops, etc. nearby other than the underwhelming shared cafeteria. The one-day-a-week WorkSmart program for office-based workers is outdated and needs to be expanded and more flexible."
171,Forrester,Great company culture with a focus on empowerment and flexibility,2019-12-11,5.0,Associate Consultant,"Great managers and coworkers. Lots of opportunities to grow and interdisciplinary backgrounds are not only tolerated but encouraged. The $5,000/yr education stipend is one example of the development-focused culture at Forrester. The culture here is also very egalitarian and collaborative. Worked hours are also less than typical consulting firms, with a higher than average degree of flexibility in terms of remote working options. The benefits are pretty standard but still good.","The salaries are significantly lower than the industry average (which can be particularly burdensome in major cities such as New York, San Francisco, or London), despite above average performance by the employees here. Although it's a big one, compensation is the only major con. Overall, Forrester is a fantastic place to work."

173,Forrester,Great Work/ Life Balance & an Engaged Executive Team,2019-10-15,4.0,Account Manager,"--Management at Forrester really seems to understand that their employees have responsibilities outside of work and are supportive and flexible. 
--There are lots of learning opportunities no matter what role you are in, you can take part. They even offer training on how to explore different opportunities within the organization.  
--I feel that the executive team listens to their employees. They conduct a survey every year to hear from everyone and take action accordingly, which they communicate with the organization. 
--Parental Leave - they just changed maternity & paternity leave to reflect the needs of employees and greatly increased the time available
--Commuter benefits - if you are brave enough to take the MBTA , they pay 50% which is GREAT. Plus the shuttle from the office to the T is a nice perk on cold or rainy days.","--Culture: It is an interesting culture. Everyone is very nice and respects one another but it can be hard to meet new people if you aren't on a team that collaborates with others or isn't involved in the companies culture, it can be a little lonely. 
--Compensation: Forrester is not very competitive with compensation and for sales, commissions can be a bit confusing to understand."

We are very focused on how research impacts or can impact our clients and take that responsibility and opportunity to heart.,"As a growing company, both organically and through acquisition, Forrester must rewrite processes to support that growth which, while required, are incredible frustrating to live through. They try to execute changes with care and consideration including getting input but sometimes they don't know what they don't know (don't we all)."
176,Forrester,"Great People, Great Place to Work",2019-10-16,5.0,Vice President,"-Great work life balance- this is earned but management seems flexible to different schedules accommodating long commutes and working parents of young children. You need to put in the hours and do what needs to get done but assuming you do, people are OK with accommodating schedules. 
-Great people- running a business is not easy. I don't always like or agree with the answers but the leaders and teams seem to really care about the people and the impact of their decisions, investing time and resources to make sure decisions are fact based and well though-out out.","-Based on the size of the organization, some things take longer to get done than I'd hope based on shared service and internal process. This is a double edged sword because I very much like the amount of internal support resources (HR, IT, etc). If we could still offer the same services but streamline request processes that would be great."

- Almost all colleagues I meet -- both in and out of my team -- are friendly, welcoming, and kind, and so many of them clearly love their job.
- I've never felt thrown to the wolves! All onboarding and training sessions are thorough, not rushed, and open to feedback, which helps a new employee feel truly valued and welcomed.","Some silly things like price of parking is pretty high, but that is often set by the town anyway."

The company keeps you on your toes, its ever changing as the market changes, we are the trend stetters. Everyone is very friendly, collaborative and willing to help at any time. Executives don't hide  in their offices they are visible, sitting in cubes like the rest of us, walking around and chatting with everyone. Opportunities are all over the company if you want to try something new as well. You won't get bored.","As great change is and can be - sometimes for some people change is difficult. Forrester is not the large gorilla yet - therefore change is felt quickly and impact is felt all over the company. We are not the highest paying company for salaries, and you will find more money else where - but for me the culture and benefits out weigh the salaries .."

I love my coworkers and managers, we celebrate each other's milestones and make each other laugh. My manager was so supportive during a difficult time in my life. People in general are very nice too, not to mention brilliant. I actually can't think of anyone I dislike working with. I feel respected, like I'm contributing to new, big projects with clear goals. I recognize this from the top leadership. From my POV, everyone is welcome to speak up and contribute. 

The office building is modern, open, and in a lovely location. I take walks along along Alewife brook pkwy all the time. Music is celebrated here, you often find guitar players in the main coffee break area.

-  A lot of opportunities for career growth in other parts of the organization (not just research).
- Culture is improving and execs are considering and acting on employee feedback more than in past years.","- Teams tend to be very siloed, and while collaboration is encouraged, analysts often keep data to themselves. 
- Career growth potential is unclear within the research department, and innovation can be hindered by corporate process or layers of approval. 
- Work-life balance and flexibility vary significantly depending on the research team.  
- Lack of diversity is a huge issue, and the culture on certain teams is very male-dominant. While the overall company may be evenly split between genders, research teams tend to skew heavily male and the company as a whole is overwhelmingly white."

198,Forrester,"Great place to work, grow and contribute",2020-03-03,5.0,Internal Audit Director,"Amazing culture of dedicated people.  Management is very transparent and collaborative.  Everyone, regardless of role has the freedom to try new things.  Non-traditional career paths.  It's more about what you can do, not what you have done.  Access to C-level executives is exceptional.","The company's recent growth has been very challenging in terms of individual workload.  The extra effort that everyone has put in does not feel to be adequately acknowledged or rewarded, except in certain circles."
199,Forrester,I started 3 weeks before the pandemic hit Boston and the all around support couldn’t be better.,2020-07-22,5.0,Account Manager,The work/life balance is fantastic and there is always opportunities to learn and keep things interesting.,Product offerings can get a bit confusing but currently being simplified.

It's exciting to be on the cutting edge of business and what is changing in the world.,"While we're getting better at this, following our own advice that we give to our clients. We still have a bit to go for some of our legacy processes that are Forrester centric vs Client centric,"

Flexible work environment and interesting subject matter makes work engaging and different each day.","Experienced some growing pains in 2019 and early 2020 after acquiring a few companies in 2018. With that said, we're coming out of that period of growth well-aligned and better equipped to do our jobs and serve our clients."
203,Forrester,Top Notch Company,2020-08-25,5.0,Principal Analyst,"I continue to be impressed with the level of genuine concern about the well-being of not just their clients , but also their employees.",Would like to see formalized growth paths by role.

207,Forrester,Great employee experience and culture,2020-01-27,5.0,Client Account Executive,"Forrester has an outstanding reputation in the marketplace. Business and Technology leaders rarely have not heard of the work we have done. Our analysts are in demand and work closely with our client base.

The culture at Forrester is outstanding. Everyone is curious and works extremely hard to provide value to our clients. Very few egos in the workforce and teams work very collaboratively all with a focus on the best client outcomes.","On occasion, the work load can be overwhelming. Forrester's products and services can be complex and it takes a while to understand how to present them to solve for a client problem. Additionally, time management and getting to know your accounts as deeply as required can extremely difficult, especially for newer reps."
208,Forrester,Great Career Support,2020-05-28,5.0,Analyst,Clear paths to succeeding here. Great to work with other teams across the organization - very cross-functional work! Finally updating how we deliver research so very promising future for our IP.,"Leadership is working on improving governance around research topics and this has been a little unclear, but will likely improve with time."
209,Forrester,Please. Get it together.,2021-02-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some of the people are amazing.,Now following their own advice.
210,Forrester,"Wonderful, caring company with a passion for helping customers",2020-05-23,5.0,Solutions Partner,"Understanding management, many different roles, global footprint, well-respected brand, thoughtful approach to the market",It's a large company. Some decisions made at the board-level don't appear to align with needs of some of our largest markets. New acquisitions have made product portfolio challenging to integrate.
211,Forrester,Best experience of my career,2020-06-17,4.0,Principal Analyst,"I get to work on things that matter, and help global leaders with the questions they're struggling with. Incredible visibility into the market. I'm paid fairly. Excellent leadership in research and consulting. Lots of great support for the work itself. Superb HR leadership. The best colleagues of my career.b Great place for recent college grads to learn and grow.","The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the company still has work to do with manager development. Bad bosses (bullying, abusive, grumpy) continue to get a pass here for far too long, and people who continue to do excellent client work and over-perform in spite of it, continue to go unrecognized."
212,Forrester,Good job out of college,2020-08-30,4.0,Research Associate,You have the opportunity to work with and learn from a diverse group of people. The benefits are also pretty good for a first job out of college.,"Because of legacy systems in place, there can be a lot of hoops for one to jump through in order to do their basic job responsibilities. Forrester is also going through a transitional period right now, which can make it hard to determine where they want to go as a company and what the long-term plan is."
213,Forrester,Great Clients - Terrific Analysts!,2020-05-26,5.0,Account Director,"Having a founder/CEO shapes the business in two great ways. First, the customer focus here is genuine, not lip service. Second, as evidenced through COVID-19 this company cares about its employees.","The advisory business has, like every other business, challenges that will always be frustrating and hard to extricate. I think Forrester does a better job with these than other companies in this space."
214,Forrester,When is the Age of the Employee?,2019-10-16,3.0,Director,The workforce is made up of great leaders and collaborative partners.  I trust my immediate team and have found mentors and connections across the org that I didn't have in previous companies.  The HR team is always looking for ways to share knowledge between teams and roles.  While I think Forrester is falling short in many areas the drive to change and help each other is there.,"Forrester has been pushing for high growth without fulling supporting the tech and staffing needed to achieve it.  This has created silos and finger pointing across teams.  While the tag line is ""Challenge thinking, lead change"" Forrester is following the same grow-or-die model without challenging the affect on employees.  The companies benefits and compensations has fallen below market level while the ""amazing culture"" is used time and again as an excuse for less PTO, minimal amenities and poor tech."
215,Forrester,Forrester - second to none,2020-05-21,5.0,Senior Analyst,"During this horrible pandemic, the Executive Leadership team has been extremely transparent, supportive. encouraging and accessible to all of us. We are all in this together, and Forrester is leading by example","The only thing that is missing during this pandemic, is the actual face to face with my co-workers (in the office). WebEx and MS Teams does make it better."
216,Forrester,Great Place To Learn,2020-08-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The smartest people I have and probably will ever work with. You will learn so much and the culture is great. They are very intuned with how employees are feeling and it's relaxed, but a dedicated place to work.","With smart people come big egos. There are some know-it-alls and your life can be drastically different depending on what team you are on. Managers are different and two people in the same role, but different jobs may have two entirely different experiences."
217,Forrester,"Flexibility, stimulating work, top tier management",2019-10-17,5.0,Account Manager,"Flexibility - management cares deeply about making sure you are available for your clients, which makes you feel like an mini-entrepreneur to handle your book of business. 
Stimulating work - you really feel like you have a purpose
Management - i've never worked under better supervision, each meeting I come away having learned something new. Always feel like my concerns are taken serious, very much feel taken care of in general with deep understanding.","There are few con's to working here, but the main one would be that there needs to be a little refinement on the promotion process. It could be outlined more deeply to give more of a checklist to sales on where they need to improve to get pay increases."
218,Forrester,Forrester is truly a great culture <3,2020-05-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester is all about its customers and employees, the level of transparency and communication has been wonderful during these times of Covid-19. Everyone has been so willing to answer questions and work together.","None at the time. The team has worked hard to be transparent, supportive, and honest through out my time here so far."
219,Forrester,Greatest company I've ever worked for,2019-10-21,5.0,Consultant,"The culture is first and foremost the greatest thing about Forrester.  They hire for culture fit and brilliance.  There is room to grow upwards and across the organization, and opportunities to try new things. Leadership is strong, transparent, driven, and caring.","1. There is a strong ""east coast bias"" - with scheduling and benefits. This means each office has its own microculture and all things are not equal from office to office. 
2. The pay can be on the lower side - but I would rather work here and get paid less than get paid more and hate my job."
220,Forrester,Great Company,2020-05-21,5.0,Accounts Receivable Associate,"The culture within the company is great and supportive. The healthy environment is very satisfying, and the amount of support received from everyone at all levels is tremendous. Moreover, it is a great brand and well known in the market. Their compensation system (vacation days, insurance, 401K...) is great.",Complicated management structure that is hard to follow
221,Forrester,Phenomenal culture - best in class!,2020-05-21,5.0,Senior Account Manager,Everyone treats each other with kindness and respect. Forrester understands that happiness is not based on meaningless perks. Productivity = happiness and everything is geared toward eliminating obstacles and giving you the tools and resources you need to succeed. Great work/life balance.,Haven't come across a con yet
222,Forrester,Economic Customer Enlightenment,2020-04-02,5.0,Senior Desktop Support Engineer,"I work with intelligent, compassionate, driven people with the customer as a main focus to empower through our research.  I work with very hard working nice people!","I have nothing adverse to say about Forrester.  I wish we had a Starbucks, Panera Bread or a Duncan Donuts at Cambridge Discovery Park."
223,Forrester,"Lots of Goodness, lots of opportunity",2020-09-22,4.0,Vice President,People are great. Everyone works really hard,Everyone works really hard because we cannot get out of our own way
224,Forrester,An Excellent Place to Work,2020-04-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The work environment, an incredibly interesting and useful product to support, and the benefits.","Work-Life balance can be challenging at times, compensation is average at best, and growth opportunity can be limited in certain roles.  Cross-functional training, particularly after a recent integration, has also been lacking."
225,Forrester,Great place to work!,2020-04-10,5.0,Senior Research Associate,Great place for young people to start their career. You get exposure to all facets of business and technology. Whether you want to be in research/consulting or not it is a great place to work and learn from. Brilliant colleagues.,None really. Experience varies by team.
226,Forrester,"Strong brand, excellent team, needs a clearer strategy",2020-05-21,4.0,Senior Research Director,"I came to Forrester through the acquisition of SiriusDecisions. Immediately on joining I felt the influence of the brand -- they have a phenomenal reputation and a clear respect among clients. The people are smart, energetic and driven. The culture is embracing.","The company lacks a clear and coherent strategy that will drive growth (or at least has not articulated this well). The SiriusDecisions integration process has been flawed, and a lot of good people have left. Senior management can come across as a clique that is impervious to change."
227,Forrester,Best company I've worked for!,2020-05-21,5.0,Consultant,"-Always putting employees first (genuinely care about their happiness)
-New ideas are welcome across the entire org
-Room for growth",-Certain functions can be political (only a few)
228,Forrester,We actually get paid to help our clients!,2019-10-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forrester's research, consulting, and data teams all work to help clients on a daily basis. And people are excited by that possibility. And it shows. And the clients are highly appreciative of the help. The atmosphere in the smaller offices (San Francisco and New York, primarily) is highly collaborative and energizing. Our new-ish employee experience focus allows the research and consulting practices to find what's next and keep challenging our clients reshape their thinking.","The technology we use is old and it slows down our work. If you are not in the Cambridge headquarters, getting adequate timely technical support is often a challenge. Overall, the Cambridge headquarters in the nerve center of decision making and for those outside of it, it can be challenging to understand the decision making process. Compensation feels slightly below where it needs to be, especially as many in the analysts ranks leave for the vendor or user world, where they are more generously compensated. Finally, especially in some areas, diversity in the company remains a major hurdle yet to be overcome."
229,Forrester,Endless Opportunity,2020-01-27,5.0,Principal Financial Analyst,"The company places heavy emphasis on great managers. I’ve seen managers at Forrester (who are some of the best managers of people I’ve ever met) say that they needed to do more for their people. 
I’ve seen most employees are in control of their Work/Life balance.  
Expectations are high, and I am absolutely set up to succeed.
A lot of recognition (almost too much!)
An “open door” culture that encourages growth in employees
I would describe culture as: smart, intellectually curious, competent, respectful",The location is not great. Lunch options are tough. I got good at bringing lunch.
230,Forrester,Dream Job,2020-05-25,5.0,Customer Success,Established and very well-respected company. Amazing benefits. Everyone who works here is encouraging and hungry to learn. You really feel like you matter even at a company of this larger size.,None that I can think of.
231,Forrester,Great Place to grow and learn,2020-06-02,5.0,Researcher,"Ample opportunities to take on exciting projects, gain valuable experience, and grow at the firm",Cambridge office feels very disconnected from main parts of the city
232,Forrester,Great place to grow - a 30 year old startup,2019-09-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"For a 30 year old company, still run by a founder, there is always the possibility that there is stagnation - NOT at Forrester!  The company is trying to be more agile and respond more to what drives our clients to succeed than what we think is best. The people and culture are something I wish I had my entire career.","working in the Cambridge HQ can be a tough commute, but once at the end of the journey, the people and challenges can make it worthwhile.  While there is no ""politics"" to speak of, there is an active value of ""Courage"" that takes some getting used to."
233,Forrester,Amazing people and a culture where you will learn so much,2019-09-18,5.0,Account Manager,"Before joining Forrester, I had no tech experience, and was intimidated by the highly intellectual employee base.  However, over the course of my 5 years there, I met the most incredible people, and learned more than I could have imagined. Truly an amazing place where you can jumpstart your career.","There was a lot of change and sometimes disruptive to your ability to close deals. However, in most cases, you have leaders and team members who will be there to guide you through that change."
234,Forrester,Here for the long run!,2019-10-09,4.0,Account Manager,"Today I celebrate my 2 year anniversary at Forrester and what a 2 years it has been!  It feels longer than that, but just because I have learned and grown so much professionally and personally.  As an account manager, I manage 14-20 Forrester clients and help them with their overall strategy to grow as a company; I've helped clients get funding, get acquired, or position custom content to drive more awareness to their company or close more business. If you like helping people and making good money, this is a great role for you.  There's a TON of opportunity for growth.  As long as you do well and tell management what role you would like to move into next they will make it happen, but you have to OWN it, not EXPECT it!","No job is perfect; I wish we took our own advice that we give our clients, like CX & Sales Enablement"
235,Forrester,Inspiring place to work surrounded by people who will challenge you,2019-09-19,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Everyone here is incredibly bright, very willing to help, and there is a great sense of camaraderie and community. Clients really respect the input of Forresterites and value the work that we do. Finally, there is a big emphasis on personal and professional growth and upper management wants to see everyone succeed.","Long working days and at times you will need to put in a lot of effort to achieve goals or project deadlines, but your team will rally behind you and help you when you need it."

great leadership
transparency
good role to make money

237,Forrester,Thrilled to be at Forrester,2020-05-25,5.0,Sales Director,"Incredible clients, incredible colleagues and winning culture.",Complex business that is exposed to the cyclical nature of the economy.
238,Forrester,"Amazing culture, interesting work, but slower pace",2019-10-15,4.0,Advisor,"I can't imagine a company with a better culture for people early in their careers. People here are very welcoming and friendly, and there is a strong sense of shared success in the company. On the personal level there is absolutely a sense of warmth in the office.","For a variety of reasons, the company can feel sluggish when it comes to innovation and change, and straight up sleepy if you're in the Cambridge HQ.  Despite a broad culture of community, most working teams sit siloed into their ""pods,"" with very little interactions with other teams during the day. Innovation projects tend to take place behind closed doors and most people feel disconnected from decisions that either directly or indirectly will affect their product/team."
239,Forrester,Lots of freedom and opportunity,2020-04-10,5.0,Vice President/Principal Analyst,"Work with really smart people. 
You get to solve hard problems for clients.
Never boring.
The only limit is you.

- Friendly, smart colleagues and a lot of collaboration.
- Constantly evolving and we are always aiming high.
- Dedication and smart work at every level.
- My manager is always supportive and pushes us to learn and perform.","- Let's work more on the brand marketing amongst the public.
- May be introduce more roles to keep employees motivated and not feel stuck on the career ladder.
- Revise the pay more frequently and balance it between new and current employees."
241,Forrester,Great place to work right out of college!,2019-09-23,5.0,Researcher,"Great work life/balance, unbelievable mentoring, great community, intelligent and friendly individuals. The leadership from Research and company-wide are great and open-minded individuals. Every day I come in to work I am working on things that make me feel successful, things that are interesting and innovative, and I love the people I work with.",Starting out of college as a research associate there isn't a direct progression path/career development after a short period of time. You spend a lot of time wondering what comes next which can lead to some anxiety.  For early Research positions you have to be a self-starter and advocate for your professional growth and development or it can be difficult to progress.

The result is an engaging, fun, and rewarding place to work in which I feel like an important part of the team.

Good benefits and generous PTO.

Great flexibility in work schedules  which is especially helpful with kids at home and in after-school activities.

Does a good job of being transparent with company initiatives so that employees can be involved and aware of the larger organizational priorities and goals.

Lots of opportunities to shift roles/jobs within the Forrester ecosystem.","Individual organizations within the company can be a bit siloed, and it can feel like several little companies operating within one."

Be opportunistic and make the most of your connections while you're at the company as it can be very beneficial for future jobs.,"A treadmill for most analysts to maintain their advisory and document numbers, thus quality of work and life-balance often suffers.  A lot of talk and aspirations to change this but, when push comes to shove, it's a numbers game.  Favoritism and politics at senior management levels means you had better be in the right group with sway. HR is useless when dealing with personnel issues and the lack of diversity in the workforce is overt."

I feel valued and not simply a number expected to grind so the street numbers look attractive.  People at all levels are accessible including the C-suite.  I received comprehensive training surrounded by colleagues genuinely willing to help.  I have smart and supportive management that provides the tools and knowledge for me to succeed.  I work with smart thought leaders who are passionate about their expertise and always willing to share what they know.  I learn new things every day.  Good work/life balance.  It’s easy to come to work knowing I contribute to my clients’ success.","401K matching could be better, high deductible health plans, pay to park"

252,Forrester,Exciting place to be!,2019-10-02,5.0,Manager,"- Exciting new products we are offering to our clients. 
- You get to work with some really smart people who will consistently push you to challenge your own thinking.

- Well established and trusted name in the market 
- Culture of learning and collaboration not often found at companies this size
- Not only is work/life balance encouraged, there are dedicated vacation days in the summer months that are 'use it or lose it' so it's like...really encouraged!","- Coming from a start-up environment, I was used to a fully stocked kitchen and dog friendly office, so that was a bit of an adjustment but worth it for the other benefits"
254,Forrester,Always striving to do better,2019-10-02,4.0,Employee Experience,"Forrester is a place full of change and while it can be tough, the changes are often for the best and reflective of employee insights and needs. In the past year, this has included being crisper about strategy, improving our leave policies, and remaining dynamic about the growth programs provided to employees. I continue to appreciate that Forrester is a place full of opportunity for those who work hard and want to drive their careers forward. Executives, for the most part, are very accessible and down-to-earth. New CPO is a breath of fresh air and bringing new vision and perspective to people operations.","We still need to work on how we manage change, including how that change is communicated to employees directly involved, impacted, and in the periphery. Need more transparency around pay - we live in a new world of information and connectedness between people; how we navigate the sensitivity of compensation needs to reflect that."

256,Forrester,Makes me realize just how bad my last job was...,2019-09-20,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The culture is supportive, kind, smart, collaborative and real. Top executives truly care about their team, enterprise wide. They show this by personally attending the required orientation, starting blocks. They travel the globe to visit our offices. Remote workers are always included in corporate activities and culture through technology, in creative ways.","On some projects there can be so many Forresterites working with a client/account and it can be confusing to the client why there are so many people on the call, and what everyone's purpose is. There is some lack of clarity between certain account team roles."
257,Forrester,Great opportunities to learn and grow,2020-05-21,4.0,Customer Success Manager,This role has been a transition that has opened new opportunities and created new skills. I have appreciated the supportive community.,"Learning new methods and new platforms has been challenging; however, Forrester employees work hard to support each other"

My team is phenomenal to work and collaborate with on a daily basis. Overall, I'm pretty happy, but there are things that could be improved on at Forrester.","There is a lack of flexibility for work from home especially for those with long commutes. I have also noticed a lack of positive culture for working parents. The culture I have experienced is basically we work hard and get here early and leave late. And if you don't you're seen negatively. Also, it's not a great office location. The website says our Cambridge roots run deep. If that's true, why are we barely in Cambridge?"
259,Forrester,Feeling Heard & Valued in HQ,2019-10-17,5.0,Client Manager,"I had never been surrounded by so many intelligent people who care about their work until I started at Forrester. There were a few roles I applied for before I got hired, and I’m so glad I kept reaching out – the work is intellectually challenging, and I am encouraged to bring ideas to the table. The trust I have earned from colleagues in and outside of my team has made the work feel meaningful, and on a personal level I have made some great friendships as well. The ability to show up and be my authentic self was a huge factor in my job search, and Forrester has allowed me to do so (plus I have a supportive manager).

I genuinely enjoy what I do, and I see myself staying at Forrester for a while, provided there are adequate opportunities for growth, recognition, and compensation.

•	There are some big egos in different parts of the organization
•	We’ve made strides, but there’s more work to be done when it comes to cross-departmental collaboration
•	I’d like to see less new hires fresh out of grad school and more representation from diverse industries, ages, educational levels, and backgrounds."
260,Forrester,leadership,2020-08-25,3.0,Sales Associate,colleagues were great to be around,lack of leadership and communication
261,Forrester,"I've worked for many organizations (of all sizes) in my career, and this is the best one yet, by far!",2019-10-03,5.0,Individual Contributor,"Culture: This has become increasingly important to me as I've matured in my career. Forrester really does care about their employee experience, including you as a person, your ability to respectfully disagree and challenge each other and leadership on business strategy and operations. Also, you will have the ability  to grow your skill set and advance your career. However, while Forrester will work with you to help you grow your career, if you start off in a position that you do not particularly like (entry level sales, for instance), you first need to work hard and excel in your role, before looking for another position. As long as you put in the hard work, they'll work with you to grow your skill set and career. It's a refreshing approach. 

People: This is the smartest group of professionals I've been around, and across the board: Data Analytics, Analysts, Advisors, Consultants, Sales, and others. If you want to expand your skill set and grow your career, just ask your colleagues and management, and they'll work with you to make it happen. 

Access: Forrester works with most major organizations, and many leaders across various industries. You get exposure to subject matter experts internally, and clients that are innovating and driving best practices across industries and functions. I'm not sure where else you can get this level of exposure, and thought leadership.  

Learning: I learned more in my first year at Forrester than I did in my undergrad and graduate level business programs, combined.","Culture (while also a major ""Pro""): Sometimes, the company can be a bit of an echo chamber, and feel as though it's displaying the negative aspects of academia. So while it's a ""Pro"" to have very smart people who challenge each other, and act as true and respected thought leaders, my belief is that some ideological challenges and dissenting voices are not welcome. To Forrester's credit, they try to foster an environment where you can feel safe expressing your beliefs, but I would not feel comfortable doing so if it doesn't align with progressive ideology. Some analysts are PhD, and they're all very smart, but there are some pockets of condescension, and they often times rely too much on theory, instead of practical application, which is a primary criticism expressed by clients.

Compensation: Depending on the role, compensation is close to, or slightly below industry averages. So this isn't a major ""Con"", but a ""Con"" nonetheless. In some roles, it is well below industry average.

Having said all of this...I still think Forrester is the best company I've ever worked for. Every company has its challenges, but I think Forrester's biggest asset is its employees and culture, and leadership recognizes and strongly supports this. Forrester also has a strong, respected brand across industries."
262,Forrester,Truly a great place to work,2019-10-22,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"Nicest & overall most competent group of people I ever worked with. Extremely supportive managers, which is a rarity in professional services firms let me tell you. Fairly generous benefits and nice little perks like the ice cream truck in the summer!","It seems to be an overly complex organization that takes a while for new employees to figure out. There's an oft-told  inside joke about the ""clown car"" of products & services."
263,Forrester,"Best Job I've Ever Had, But a Lot of Work",2020-02-28,5.0,Principal Analyst,Great mix of creative autonomy with big company class support when you need it.,A lot of work. 50 plus hour weeks not uncommon. Travel can spike to 50%.
264,Forrester,A growing company with exciting opportunities and transparent leaders,2019-10-15,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Forrester is honestly one of the best places I've ever worked. Most jobs start to get stale after a year, but Forrester and our clients continue to evolve and change. This allows me to learn something new every day.  I have been able to contribute to my team and the organization well outside my typical job description, and it is valued. 

The leadership is very transparent and open to ideas at all levels. They not only listen, but they act on feedback. Like all things, it takes time, but most people do have a genuine interest in doing what is right to make Forrester a better place.","Like all places there is bad that comes with the good. Forrester's products are very complex requiring lots of people to be involved in the delivery. Most of the time there is extreme collaboration, but competing priorities and lack of goal alignment across the ecosystem sometimes gets in the way. 

Some technology also slows down internal teams, requiring an insane amount of manual labor for what seems like an easy task. Luckily, there have been great strides recently in modernization efforts which should come to fruition and have a big impact in the next year."
265,Forrester,A wonderful place to work,2019-10-15,5.0,Senior Analyst,"From top to bottom, Forrester acts with care and consideration for each step of the employment process. The company's values feel present throughout the organization, and while we work hard, we have fun. The perks are great, but more because they feel like a natural extension of how the company feels about us. For the actual size of this business, a big business mindset with established processes for so many things AND an individual focus is really impressive.",Sometimes spread out far from your colleagues around the world
266,Forrester,A company with cultural challenges and benefits,2020-07-20,3.0,Senior Research Associate,They have been focused on our employees and stability fo a long time.,The difference in culture between teams is too stark.
267,Forrester,Sales Management and Product,2019-10-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Provides a brand, largely built on past reputation, that opens many doors for initial senior leadership meetings.",Tremendous amount of turnover in our Bay area team.   The company has  promoted many successful individual contributors into sales management roles in recent years.   They also have a knack for handing down a difficult territory from one new hire to the next instead of mixing some of those difficult accounts into the more polished reps territories for fear of alienating them.   Their Product direction is suspect and there's been a tendency to hire those that will not really challenge existing delivery model and push change.
268,Forrester,"Intellectual Curious Culture, Meaningful Work",2019-10-01,5.0,Director,"An amazing culture that values intellectual curiosity, customer-obsession, and growth.  Work-life balance is fantastic with great flexibility.  Coworkers are  great, humble, and approachable.  Work is meaningful and valuable to our clients.","Research is still very much the rock star of the company.  A lack of diversity.  Compensation is severely lagging the marketplace and we lose talent because of it, especially for newer roles like software and analytics."
269,Forrester,Meh,2020-06-25,2.0,Sales Representative,Some of the people were cool,Not for me. Selling was difficult due to a ton of things out of your control. Comp model wasn’t great either. Leaders all over the place.
270,Forrester,Great Place to Work,2020-02-25,5.0,Event Planner,"Great place to work. They have great benefits, flexibility, and care about their employees","Very large company, so it is hard to get to know people you don't work with."
271,Forrester,Great place to work,2020-07-06,4.0,Research Associate,"Wonderful peers. Intelligent, kind and enjoyable to work with.",Could have a more competitive salary at the entry level
272,Forrester,Getting Better All The Time,2019-10-01,5.0,Change Management Consultant,"Long term efforts to improve culture have paid off...and the work will never be ""done."" Successful leaders get results through their people. Forrester is increasingly focused on following its own advice. We have exciting ideas and market opportunity related to customer and employee experience.","We have small pockets of an ""apprentice"" mindset where early career employees are micromanaged. Our progress on inclusion is not yet fast enough."
273,Forrester,Engaging Culture,2019-10-15,5.0,Human Resources Director,"What has kept me at Forrester? The smart, engaging and kind people. Forrester has a strong community in each of its offices - each a little different but with the same themes of curiosity, respect, and good humor. Even when the work is hard, I know I have people I can count on.","Forrester has a fast-paced culture and change is constant. To get the most out of Forrester, you have to work with a curious, flexible, learning mindset. Colleagues expect high productivity and quality."
274,Forrester,"Great company, benefits and people!",2019-10-23,5.0,Senior Customer Success Specialist,I've been with Forrester for 2.5 years and it's been a positive experience all around.  I was hired as a remote employee and my managers and team are amazing.  There are opportunities for growth and I'm constantly reminded how lucky I am to have found this position.  I wouldn't trade this opportunity for any other job I've ever had!,I haven't encountered any cons and don't foresee that I will.
275,Forrester,Growth Opportunities,2019-10-17,5.0,Principal Consultant,"Forrester is the best place I've worked in my entire career.  Here's what keeps me here:

-working with amazing colleagues
-challenging work
-opportunities for growth
-stability
-remote working potential
-competitive salary","No company is perfect, and while Forrester has challenges, the senior managment teams seem to be working to advance initiatives to alleviate challenges."
276,Forrester,Thankful Home Worker,2020-01-17,5.0,CSS,Ability to work from home.  Decent benefits given the current landscape.  Co-workers are all great to work with!,Don't get some of the benefits office workers get like parties and get together's.
277,Forrester,Solid but not without flaws,2019-11-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- If you want one, you have a clear path to a platform, both internally and with clients. Capable folks get a seat at the table to really influence decision-making and direction. 
- It’s rare to find a bad manager here; a lot of training and resources put into empowering team leaders  
- Brand name carries weight
- Lots of opportunities to move between functions
- Solid benefits (recently extended parental leaves)
- Flexible commute (in some cases), good work/life balance
- Stimulating work and access to tremendous resources in the form of smart people and research","The company has been changing and innovating a lot the last few years, which is great, but executing on that change has missed and missed often. Growth pressures mean that new solutions are often put to market before they’re properly vetted, and when they fail, there’s a clear drag in morale. Recent acquisitions (FeedbackNow, Glimpzit) and product pursuits are initially touted as the next big difference-maker but quickly fade into the background. The company has pushed to digitize many client experiences but development resources to support them are simply not there. This means that Forresterites are asked to bring sub-par tech to their clients and hold the bag when something doesn’t deliver. 

Whether you ask for it or not, sales pressures are behind each and every role at Forrester, even if you work in Product. Pressures to renew, enrich, and hit revenue targets often distract from the core goal of driving strategy through thought leadership and research. This means that non-quota carriers are expected to play a key role in the sales process without being compensated for doing so.

The HQ manages to lack both the perks of being in a city (next to no food or entertainment nearby) AND the benefits of working in the burbs (expensive parking and congested commute).

Forrester is very conservative with compensation; some feel that the culture makes up for it, others don’t and move on.  Whether it’s related or not, attrition has been an issue more recently."
278,Forrester,Fantastic Work Environment,2015-04-06,5.0,Technology Management,"As someone who has mostly worked at small, ""scrappy"" companies, the first thing I love about Forrester is the physical environment. The office and surroundings are beautiful, eco-friendly, and well-maintained. It's just an amazingly comfortable place to spend half of your waking life. Every employee gets an identical workspace. There's no jockeying for the ""corner office"" (though the execs get to work in a glassed in area – but still in the same type of cubicle!) There is plenty of career mobility, most notably employees moving from corporate roles to analyst roles, and vice versa. I'm working on the corporate side, and find the pace of work reasonable and family friendly. 

Commuting here is easy. It's in Cambridge, but it's simple to drive here (you exit Rte. 2 right before it jams up at Alewife). It's also easy to get here on the red line if you don't mind a short walk through a beautiful nature preserve.

Maybe it's a sign of my age, but I appreciate the ""grown up"" feel of the company. We certainly have fun, but the culture is not gimmicky or immature. I feel like an adult among adults here, and it's a good feeling.","Well, if you're the kind of person who WANTS to strive for a private corner office, you won't be happy here. You also won't be happy if you like goofy startup culture or the (slim) opportunity to make a bazillion dollars in stock options. We also have a lot of silly euphemisms for things, like ""Strategic Growth"" instead of ""Human Resources"". Whatever."
279,Forrester,Great Opportunity for Recent Grads,2019-10-18,4.0,Research Associate,"There's ample resources for employees looking to learn more about business and technology. 
Provides recent grads with fundamental project managing experience.
Paid time off and work life balance are a plus.","Health insurance is expensive and doesn't ever cover as much as you would hope. 401k matching could be better. Your experience with the company, the opportunities you're given, and the chances you have to move upward in the company hinge upon your relationship with your manager (this can also be a pro if you have a good manager, but it's ultimately a detriment that so much weighs on this)."
280,Forrester,Solid Career Choice,2019-10-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are genuinely king, supportive and SMART.  I've been here two years and still suffer from impostor syndrome.  I've not stopped learning since I started and am constantly challenged to think in different ways and extend my current skill set on a regular basis.  

Senior Management is incredibly open and easy to talk to- I love that our entire Executive Team is so accessible to everyone in the company!","Sometimes there is lack of clarity in our priorities and/or we have too many priorities so it feels like we're all working hard, but not necessarily towards the same end-goal.  Additionally, resourcing can be tight because while we are a growing company the growth is moderate so there are no hiring bursts to support new areas of growth."
281,Forrester,Valuable employee experience,2019-09-19,5.0,Manager,"The Forrester ecosystem is nuturing my professional career for years to come. I feel well-supported throughout the organization, from work-life balance to professional development. I value the company's transparency and priorities for developmental goals; I have felt welcome, respected, and valued since the moment I walked in for my interview, under a year ago. I see myself here for a long time.",None yet - very promising outlook for future aspirations.
282,Forrester,My favorite job,2019-10-18,5.0,Customer Success Specialist,"I have been pleased so far with my experience here.  There are opportunities to work remotely.  They offer a great benefits package with perks you don't find elsewhere.  My coworkers are committed to teamwork.  My manager regards me as a human being, not just a faceless cog in the wheel.  There are tons of opportunities for growth here.",So far I haven't encountered a reason not to work here.
283,Forrester,Best Place I have Worked,2019-11-19,5.0,Program Manager,"Great culture and working environment
Great management- managers I have don't micromanage and just trust you are doing your job
Organized company
Flexible schedule
Good vacation and personal day time",We can work from home once a week. it may be nice to add some flexibility in that to do more.
284,Forrester,Great place to make an impact!,2019-10-01,5.0,Senior Consultant,I have been lucky throughout my career to work with some exceptional people and never has this been more accurate than at Forrester. I'm constantly challenged and supported by my peers and love that I come into work everyday and know that I'm making an impact in our clients everyday lives.,Senior leadership does not focus on consulting and sometimes it feels like they forget that we even offer consulting when speaking to high level clients.
285,Forrester,Opportunity to grow,2019-10-01,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"Learn something new every day
Have the opportunity to take on new and exciting work
Great overall culture, you really feel like people want you to succeed","Silos can cause some challenges

Exciting time to be a part of the company,2019-10-18,5.0,Senior Program Coordinator,Great team dynamics; Team managers are responsive and genuinely care about your professional and personal well-being; Lots of opportunities for growth and pursing areas of interest,A bit siloed with a disconnect between departments; Workload can be heavy making the work-life balance difficult
287,Forrester,Truly grateful,2019-10-08,5.0,Sales Manager,"We are truly making a difference for our clients. We offer solutions that always keep you in a position of knowledge and continual learning. Beyond that, the company truly cares for their employees.","There is a lot to learn. It takes time to ramp and feel comfortable with the company. This is not a con to the company, just a learning curve that everyone needs to go through."
288,Forrester,I regularly recommend Forrester to my friends,2019-10-15,5.0,Advisor,"- Very intelligent and hardworking colleagues. 
- Supportive culture both on my team and throughout the company.
- Best place possible to learn and develop your skills.","I get it, companies are pressured to demonstrate strong and consistent financial results - especially public companies. However, the constant focus on our projected revenues can be tiring."
289,Forrester,Good training program,2020-06-08,3.0,Financial Representative,The company puts lots of time and money into the training process.,Difficult to make money in first few years.

Good environment to stretch and learn (always learning, always teaching attitude). Healthy place to bring your brain and whole self to work.",Easy to focus on day to day function (lots of urgent worthy things to do) and miss the bigger mission (tougher important things to do).
295,Forrester,Amazing company!,2019-10-02,5.0,Recruiter,The people at Forrester are great. I always feel challenged in a good way to step outside my comfort zone and  grow professionally.,The New York office is in the best location but not a ton of people are in the office.

The benefits are amazing, including great healthcare, a gym, massages, and employee appreciation days. Great work/life balance.",Compensation may not be the most competitive

298,Forrester,A great company taking bold steps for our clients,2018-09-14,5.0,Manager,"Forrester is one of the most respected B2B brands in the world but this is a company that doesn't rest on its laurels. ""Leading change"" isn't just a phrase on a corporate poster here, it's in the company's DNA.  Pros of working at Forrester include:

- Surrounded by intelligent, curious, driven colleagues
- Genuine desire to help our clients grow
- Autonomy and a workplace environment that is increasingly entrepreneurial
- A culture of constant learning & development
- On the forefront of customer experience transformation (which will continue to be the biggest challenge for companies over the next 20 years)","The good news here is that the areas of opportunity for Forrester to improve are actually doable. The root of our challenges have to do with a fundamental change that is occurring within our industry and business model. Forrester's mandate over the next 3-5 years is to disrupt the model, work differently with our clients, and grow. Cons of working at Forrester include:

- At times, there is a struggle between academic prognostication and doing real work for clients (tactical, roll-up-the-sleeves work)
- The company is still working to be more connected and less siloed. Individual product teams have a tendency to think about their domain vs. the bigger picture of helping clients achieve outcomes
- There is a lack of urgency in certain pockets of the company when our clients require speed"

- Parking is a bit expensive (Cambridge office)"
300,Forrester,"Great team, leadership",2019-10-18,4.0,Customer Success Manager,The culture at Forrester is terrific. We are always learning new things and collaborating on how to help our customers. The work-life balance is probably as good as you can hope for in  a full-time job.,We are using metrics to drive our actions that don't seem to align with our customer needs. The goals and metrics we have as CSM's are focused on renewals and not always delivering true value to the customer.

309,Forrester,Forrester has a soul,2016-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Why have I stayed at Forrester for 15 years? The company has a soul. This is a culture of intellectual curiosity, passion, integrity, and respect. I am surrounded by colleagues who inspire me every day with their intelligence, quality of work, and commitment to do the right thing. I feel accountable to inspire them; to elevate their potential and experience. At Forrester, my voice has value. Executives much smarter than me not only know my name, they ask for, and listen to, my opinion. I have been given multiple opportunities to grow into new roles and responsibilities, each time both terrifying and exhilarating. This is a culture of discovery, where I am always learning and always teaching. This is a place with a sense of humor and a sense of humanity. In short, Forrester’s values are my values.

I'm sure most readers of this review see this a thousand times for other companies...but let me tell you why it's the case here.  I've been at the company for over 15 years and started in a junior role. I was given the opportunity to explore almost every part of the organization in various jobs and am now part of the leadership team.  What's the point you might ask?  The point is that the opportunity to grow your career here is limitless if you want to work hard and take on new challenges.  If that's of interest, then this is the place for you.

In addition, if you're looking for a place to collaborate with an incredible group of people that will result in lifelong friendships because of the culture that's fostered here, then this is the place for you.

If you enjoy working in a highly collaborative team environment where you have the permission to challenge your colleagues, and they can challenge you to come up with better end results, then this is the place for you.

I have, and continue to value my time here, the opportunities I've had and friends I've made.  As I mentioned above, Forrester is a great place to work...hopefully I've made it a little more clear why that carries weight now. :)",I'd say we are too risk averse and need to be more aggressive on new product development.
313,Forrester,Is there a better place to build a CS/CX foundation?,2019-10-15,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"1. Organization-wide adoption of CX.

I found Forrester people to be right at the top of the brilliance list, but more importantly, it's a family (yes family) of people who work together better than any I've encountered before. My calling (not just a job) is beautifully rich and exciting because of my brothers and sisters in the Forrester family! I've never worked harder, but I've never worked happier!","Forrester is not for the faint of heart - it's very demanding. Excellence is the norm here, which is great, but it can be an intimidating environment. If you are intent on changing the world, come here, but don't expect it to be easy. Still, member of the family help each other to attain greatness. A work-life balance can be tough to reach. If you let it, this place will eat you up. You need to be active and vigilant to make a life outside the company."

319,Forrester,Great place,2019-10-15,5.0,Consultant,Flexible work place; great coworkers,Outdated and heavy laptops; low compensation
320,Forrester,Great Company!,2019-10-17,5.0,Anonymous,"Great leadership, colleagues, and culture.",The company is complex and takes time to learn all the ins and outs.
321,Forrester,"By far, the best experience of my professional career",2015-09-25,5.0,Principal Analyst,"I have managers I trust, coworkers I admire and respect, and I get to work on research that I love. I get to build trust relationships with titans of industry and I get to share what my coworkers and I are learning with clients who have questions I can help them with. I'm paid fairly and feel cared for and supported as a person. What more could I ask for from my working life? It's amazing!","We're starting to stack rank analysts on readership and consulting dollars more, making it more visible, and I think that will have unintended, negative consequences as it has for Microsoft and others. Readership is a poor proxy for customer value when it comes to earning new business and renewals, and it can't capture the work people do to help their colleagues succeed in a team environment. Too much stack ranking with individual performance goals, and I'm afraid that customer experience and collaboration between employees and teams will suffer."
322,Forrester,"Amazing culture, smart people",2020-01-07,4.0,Leadership Board Advisor,"-Wonderful culture
-Smart people 
-Terrific brand recognition
-well respected company by customers
-Powerful, relevant insights at the center of the research
-good benefits, much improved due to excellent leadership in EX/HR","-Pay is generally not competitive
-Office location is tough"
323,Forrester,Fantastic company culture and a premier brand,2018-01-30,5.0,Consulting,"Work alongside super-smart, intellectually curious, collaborative, dedicated, interesting colleagues and make an impact on clients' real-world business and technology challenges and strategies.  

Huge opportunity for learning and growth (personal and professional) no matter where you are in your career.  Lots of opportunity to move to different roles internally and build new skills. 

There is such a rich treasure trove of research, experience and insight -- and colleagues eager to explain what it means and why it matters. It's impossible to get bored here.

Relationships are valued here, but it's not political. Trust, respect and constructive debate are all important tenets of the amazing and deliberately cultivated company culture.  

Bottom line: This is the best company I have worked for in my career.","The work can get consuming -- it's important to actively manage your work-life balance.

Many of the tools we use or need to do the work (project management, practice management, time tracking, expense reporting, video conferencing,..) are clunky, incompatible, outdated or non-existent.

The Research and Sales teams get top billing, and the Cambridge (MA) HQ is the center of the Forrester universe. If you work on other teams or in other offices, you may feel outside of the spotlight."
324,Forrester,There’s a reason why people boomerang back,2019-12-12,4.0,Account Manager,"Great benefits. Fun culture. The people are generally really nice, friendly people.",Seniority is #1 here. There can be a bit of a sit and wait for my turn thinking making go getters want to leave. The location is terrible!
325,Forrester,LOVE WORKING HERE,2015-12-08,5.0,Account Development Manager,"I am absolutely loving Forrester. The company's culture and the individuals that work here are all fantastic (seriously I have not met one jerk since starting here in March). The company cares a lot about its employees through a balanced work day (I've stayed here twice past 5:30pm in 10 months), and fun perks (quarterly parties, full instrument set-up in the cafe, on site gym). 

In regards to my position: I work exclusively with ad agencies under the Premiere Accounts Group. I help to engage them to use Forrester's resources and products that they have purchased, make sure they renew, and pitch some custom additional projects at extra cost throughout the year. 

It's a lot of fun to work with all these strategy teams on new projects for pitches and existing clients and align them with Forrester's research, data, and analysts. I have a fantastic manager and a fantastic team that I work with. The others that are in my position are always collaborating and helping each other out. We have weekly meetings with the whole group, with my agency group, and one-on-one with my manager.

 I've never felt so much support at a job.","While a beautiful building with great amenities, the location of the office is rough. 

It's right by Alewife station so the commute from anywhere other than Arlington, Belmont, Somerville, and parts of Watertown is hell."
326,Forrester,Forrester cares about thier employees,2019-12-11,4.0,Account Director,Very generous benefits and PTO.  Challenging environment but if you are willing to put in the effort management and teams are very supportive.,"As in many large organizations, the only constant is change and there are many every year."
327,Forrester,Great People,2019-10-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- I truly enjoy the people I get to work with each day. The people at Forrester are what make the job enjoyable. 
- Challenges and learning opportunities each day to continue to grow
- Amount of change in acquisitions and innovations make it an exciting time to be a part of Forrester and a huge motivator",- Amount of change can be overwhelming with fluctuations in the speed at which it occurs
328,Forrester,You can have an impact at Forrester,2017-09-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I thoroughly enjoy my role and responsibilities at Forrester because I know that I', making an impact. 
At times Forrester has a start-up feel to it, which is unusual for a company that is over 30 years old. Have ideas? Speak up -- management and your peers will listen. Are you willing to try new things? Do it (with permission) -- and help the company (or even just your group/dept.) to innovate. 
I've never experienced a company culture as strong as Forrester's, and I enjoy coming to work every day. 
Yes, there is constant change at Forrester - but the amount of change is no different than any other company that I've worked at.
Employees here work hard and are dedicated.  
There are numerous opportunities for career growth.","We need to change and innovate faster: that includes our products, our messaging, and even some of our people (when the wrong people are in place).
I'd like to see more coaching training for managers at all levels (although this topics seems like it's being addressed). 
We need to put more of our research into practice at Forrester (i.e., follow the guidance of our own analysts more often)."
329,Forrester,Research Associate,2015-04-13,2.0,Research Associate,"Decent name for a future job and the work life balance is pretty good. Forrester employs a lot of young, bright people and has some interesting opportunities to learn if you're placed on the right team.","Forrester does hire a lot of young, bright professionals to staff its research organization, though it does little to nothing with them. None of the ""opportunities"" available to a research associate are linked to merit, which encourages complacency and drives most of the junior staff to leave in the first year-18 months. The pay, as documented elsewhere, is barely more than half of the industry standard, and while everyone from the head of research to the head of human resources will tell you that it's not, it is. Many RAs wait tables, bartend or tutor in the evenings and on weekends just to be able to pay rent in a low-cost suburb of Boston or Cambridge. 

The work that RAs do is most often unrelated to research. 90% of the job within the first year is administrative, i.e. scheduling calls, running to the cafe to buy an analyst a Snapple, etc., and while there are some analysts that value the RAs that work with them, most view them as an expendable personal assistant, and exclude them from their research process. 

On a more general level, there is no connection between senior leadership and the rest of the organization. This has been commented on ad nauseam already so I won't get into detail, but when you're laying off employees and shredding their bonuses, is chartering flights to exotic locations and splurging on executive bonuses really a prudent decision?"
330,Forrester,A Rewarding and Challenging Experience,2016-09-19,5.0,Analyst,"Out of all the places I have worked at in my career, Forrester is where I find myself surrounded the best and the brightest employees. When I come to work I know my colleagues are going to bring their A game and it helps me bring mine. I think what I love the most is the fact that when I leave work each day I feel intellectually stimulated and that I have accomplished something important. The reward for the hard work is being seen as a thought leader and being able to drive actionable change in the ways the world's biggest companies do business. It's certainly no easy task, but the various managers I've had over the years have enabled me to be successful at every turn.","It is true what they say, there is a lot of change, but if you're business is going to compete at a high level it needs to be able to reinvent itself as needed. Now some people don't fare too well with change, and for them they may struggle. For those that handle change well, it becomes an enabler for career growth."
331,Forrester,"Outstanding, supportive work atmosphere",2019-10-15,4.0,Client Executive,Always learning and the peer-to-peer collaboration and training is second to none.,Work-life balance can be a challenge. Aggressive sales goals for less tenured employees.
332,Forrester,Positive Early Career Experience,2018-10-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I initially came to Forrester as a summer intern, and was rehired as a full time employee.

My experience with my managers at Forrester has been fantastic. Forrester does a really good job of making sure managers are well trained. My manager is accessible, knowledgeable about the company, and eager to talk about my goals/struggles/general thoughts. My management experience has also been very transparent: if I ever had a problem in my job or wanted to explore other areas of the company, I know my manager would be supportive.

As a whole, the people at Forrester are so willing to invest in you. As an early career person, I have been especially impressed with how willing people (both within my team and outside of it) have been to hear my opinion in meetings, involve me on projects that interest me but don't fall into my jurisdiction, or just grab coffee and give career advice.","Forrester does so much that, as a new employee (especially one new to the ""real world""), it can take a while to fully understand what the company does as a whole, and how your role plays into that.

Parking in Cambridge is expensive."
333,Forrester,"Generally happy, but there is always room for improvement",2019-10-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Easy access to executives, culture of innovation, growth opportunities, silo busting, decent pay and benefits.",Forrester is trying to figure out if it is a company of rules or a company of guidelines. A company that embraces flexible work in 2019 or a company with rigid policies and expectations.
334,Forrester,"Great people, great culture",2019-10-22,4.0,Global Council Manager,"I enjoy getting to work with smart, dedicated people every day. Colleagues are driven to succeed in a way that is collaborative and puts our clients first. I've had good opportunities to learn and grow in my career.","For an organization that isn't huge, sometimes organizational silos get in the way."
335,Forrester,Amazing product,2019-11-18,4.0,Account Executive,"Forrester has great products that clients find valuable. 
Expanded product portfolio with SiriusDecisions acquisition
Unique role opportunities","Unclear job / career growth paths
Poor communication from leadership on major changes impacting the sales organization"
336,Forrester,"Great company, great culture but salaries are low",2019-09-19,4.0,Senior Analytics Manager,"Great company, wonderful culture, flexibility, awesome work life balance.",The salaries leave a lot to be desired which is why we see a lot of turnover as folks stay here for 2-3 years get experience and then leave for a salary bump.
337,Forrester,Has Potential But Change Needed,2015-01-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Forrester has a great culture of collaboration.  The company is filled with bright people.  The job requires anyone in sales to remain current on important business & technology trends.  The product is research & consulting and is always a moving target.  What is new today and table stakes tomorrow so you're constantly learning.,"There are three primary ""Cons"" with Forrester:
1. Too many ""overlay"" jobs.  We have people (all different) who help sell data, who service data,  who renew data.  We  have people who help sell consulting however they really just coordinate the writing of SOW's.  We have people that support Peer networks yet they have little knowledge of the company the client works for.  We have people who manage service work (SU's). 
2. Innovation has stalled.  Our events business has not changed in years, we deliver the same format and sometimes the same content.  How our client access our research is the same, it's a report the client must read.  Our webinars are an analyst talking to PPT slides.  We haven't launched any new products to sell (CXi doesn't count, that was retooling an old product).  
3. Pay is below market and we lose good people too often.  A promotion guarantees less pay and is openly discussed as the case."
338,Forrester,"Need to focus on who you SHOULD BE, not who you WERE",2014-03-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Excellent people. Managers were willing to help guide and allow a flexible schedule and workload
- Good career ladder for college grads, if you work with your manager you will move up and gain invaluable experiences
- All levels of management genuinely see you as a person and not just an employee. Sometimes to a fault.","- Ability to execute is weak. Forrester thinks the company name sells things. Less and less so. Real investments in solid products must be made.
- Forrester goes through the same idea of how to change and improve results, about once every 2 years: Rearrange or realign the content. Managers get new silly titles, team structures change, and there's a new set of buzzwords or content tags to overuse.
- Unless you have a true passion for what the company does, you will be bored to tears."
339,Forrester,Learning all the time,2018-03-14,5.0,Associate Director,"I've found the Leadership Boards to be a fantastic place to get a crash-course MBA, the exposure to some of the most successful professionals in their fields (our clients) is an incredible learning opportunity. I've found my colleagues supportive and always motivated to do what's right for the client. Pros include the ability to shape your own path,  an accessible leadership team, a real interest in developing high-potential performers, and a genuine desire to succeed. Forrester has been a great place to grow and be challenged, and rewards hard and thoughtful work with opportunity. Colleagues genuinely want to help one another succeed, even when misaligned goals can occasionally get in the way.","Forrester is a company in transition to its next phase of growth. This is great for people who like being part of a transformation; uncomfortable for people who prefer predictability. It's also a lean business model, with a lot of tough choices to be made about where resources get invested, so it's sometimes disappointing that we can't invest more in the kind of internal and external digital tools that would improve the experience for everyone."
