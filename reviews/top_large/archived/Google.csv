0,Google,11+ years and still a great place to work,2022-03-31,5.0,Software Engineer,"I really appreciate the people, culture, and balance afforded by Google.",Advancing the career ladder is very challenging. Each level is like another PhD in some ways.
1,Google,"Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable",2013-06-21,4.0,Program Manager,"1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :("
2,Google,"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects",2014-05-10,5.0,Software Engineer III,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."
3,Google,The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.,2015-02-08,5.0,,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."
4,Google,Good company (If you’re a fresh grad or want a stable life),2022-03-20,5.0,User Experience Designer,"Hands down one of the best tech companies in the world. For a company this size, it’s very progressive and forward thinking. If you’re a fresh grad you’ll learn how to work within a system and learn from some of the best in the business. If you are a very capable person and are tired of grinding at a smaller company, Google is also a great place to cruise. You’ll get decently challenging projects without the stress of having to produce right away. If you’re looking for a big company with good pay, stability and flexibility. Look no further.","If you’re looking for a more challenging job or want to be able to see your impact faster, this is not the place to be. If you prefer to grow into your role instead of being groomed for a role then you’ll have to look elsewhere. As progressive and flat as a big company can be, Google at the end of the day IS still A BIG COMPANY, you will inevitably feel like a cog in a giant machine just like being in any other big companies."

The community of individuals is top-notch- amazingly smart, driven, and courteous colleagues.","Given the scale of the operation, it's very hard to create change. The best opportunities and problems are often ""gifted"" down from managers to select individuals who are on fast promotion trajectories. Challenges are often framed so positively, it can feel impossible to ask the ""real question,"" criticize efforts, or swim upstream. I saw individuals sent a strong message with their ratings for challenging the status quo. At times, this can feel toxic and insurmountable. The key here is aligning to strong managers who are transparent and supportive so you can get tapped for meaningful work, find a safe space for challenging assumptions, and get buy-in for your ideas."

- interesting tasks on the interviews.","I do not know how good Google is inside, however the interview process and HR is a face of the company. In my situation this face did not look good.
The hiring process is extremely long. However, I can admit, this time the sessions were much more interesting than all years before.

Since my recruiter said I passed the interview process and now I am on the team matching phase I thought it can take month or so. I was wrong. I took 3.5 months and based on my research this is not a max. Some people should wait months up to the year on this stage. However, this is not the end of the story. My recruiter were disappearing for a weeks and I had to ask her about
any updates. As a result, my emails sunk on the bottom of Atlantic Ocean. She replied in 3 weeks saying she had technical problems. Maybe, I do not know. Everything can happen in our complicated life. 
 Finally I got several teams to speak with. Awesome! It took 2 weeks to finalize the process and pick a nice team. During this process with Google I had several parallel processes with other companies. On the final stages I rejected all offers I had in my hand wishing to work at Google and learn tons of new staff and do something extraordinary. Why not, if I was already presented to the hiring committee and recruiter updated “We are finalizing your final offer”. It was a relaxing time. 
 In 1.5 weeks I got a call from Google and heard “A review team (hiring committee) decided to reject you. We made several errors. We apologize and want to keep in touch. You can try again in one year”. Nice outcome!

Advice to people who want to join Google:
- Keep in mind the process is extremely long at Google! For me it took 7 months.
- Never ever reject other offers from other interesting companies if you are in the process with Google. However, it is hard to extend such offers, while you are waiting Google. 
- I would estimate the approximate total compensation you can get (or may not) from Google, all pros and cons of the area of work and make a decision about offers in your hand."

337,Google,"great place, just be aware it's 2021, it's a big company, usually the third mover",2022-02-11,4.0,Google SWE,"The initial conditions of a company set a lot of vectors. Many of Google's initial conditions were good ones. The company still makes a big effort to be a nice place, not just because it's profitable, but because people (at least all the ones I see) genuinely want to get it right. They also want to at least try to make the world a better place, even if, arguably, that's not the corporation's big goal any more. Don't underestimate the value of this attitude, I've seen what it's like in so many companies that lack it. You see it in lots of things, big and small, that Google structurally makes an effort to make its employees life nice. Google got a lot right during covid, including being one of the first to provide free testing kits. I've got offers from a hot startup and AWS, and I'm pretty sure I am not ready to move.","Google is IBM. If you look at IBM in the 60s, they invented or reduced to practice so many fundamental ideas in computing (caching, virtualization, TLB) that we just take for granted now. They also made a bad guess and got bit numbering backwards, and decided to go with EBCDIC, and we still deal with that today, in code, docs, and programs. They can't back out of 50-year-old bad decisions. IBM has been around a long time, and it's harder and harder, post 1975, for them to innovate, as they are stuck in their cultural mold. Just look at the companies they keep buying. They break them every time.

Google is like that. They were the first to get to big scale in many areas, and you get stuck with that legacy base. It gets harder and harder to do something new. Microsoft has gitfs, Google has an older, not nearly as good srcfs. Everyone uses git, google is stuck with perforce. If you want to do anything really new, it's a giant effort, because there are so many stakeholders of ""how we do it now."" I've seen good ideas gnawed to death by ambitious, envious, ankle-biters. And, yes, performance review really does drive a lot of people to break things for no reason. Another chat app, anyone?

Google is like IBM ca 1990: still one of the leaders, but it's clearly not leading as it was, and there's blood in the water. Can the management fix it? That's not clear. The market is rewarding their current 'move slow and don't break things' model, so all the signals are green. As they were for, e.g., DEC or Sun or Intel, right before it all went wrong. Is Google the next Intel? Maybe."

- 75%+ (90%?) of projects are worthless/pointless & destined to go nowhere. On these projects, you can lead a team & the culture is typically good - but your work will never have a real impact.
- At most 25% of projects (probably less) have any chance of having much impact. On those projects, its very difficult to get a role as more than a cog. Also, those teams can afford to (and tend to) have a crappier culture & push people much harder because people want to work on them.
Most people end up working on things they aren't really interested in, or in roles they wouldn't take or stay-in at other companies.
Management quality varies *a lot*. I've seen some managers who were good at their job and also decent human beings. I've seen some that absolutely didn't deserve their roles, and/or that were vey sleazy. Google will basically always consider your manager to be correct in any dispute/disagreement with you, so a bad/sleazy manager can be very bad for your career at G."

Ambitious, new or young talent may end up hanging out at the office outside of work hours, often working or learning. This can develop into peer pressure to spend a lot of time at the office.

The way that performance in sales roles is judged heavily favors neurotypical people in that you are expected to have immediate recall and be able to task switch constantly. 

This is incredibly difficult for people with ADHD and despite going to HR and opening conversations with my manager I was managed out, despite consistently hitting all of my sales goals.

There has also been a marked cultural shift away from the original core tenants. This comes with the type of growth they have experienced but it can be disheartening to see the values the company used to stand for be cast aside in the pursuit of ever increasing revenue goals."

-) Variety. So many groups in one place, that when you're ready for your next career exploration, it will be easy and smooth. Google wants to be the last place you'll ever work.
-) Scale. If you want to have lots of users, in some cases billions, Google is a lot of fun and you are helping many people who use your product directly or indirectly. 
-) Free food and stocked ""micro-kitchens"" with snacks. And, the shuttles (okay, in 2020-21 this isn't a factor, but it will be when we all go back.)
Help the environment and make friends with neighbors, while riding a climate controlled bus with leather seats and friendly bus drivers, to work & back.

Very frustrating experience to be a part of -- unrealistic work loads on the shoulders of a few, constant clashing between different groups that were supposed to be collaborative and working towards the same goal (i.e. the customer). Very hard to make data-driven decisions for the customer with constant bullying and micro-aggressions from the Category Management team to push their specific agenda (i.e. revenue goals and merchant favoritism).

A constant revolving door of contractors who did the majority of the work, who were under constant pressure, overworked, and under-appreciated and under-valued. Direct management of such contractors couldn't even be bothered to manage, engage, or acknowledge these extended workforce folks."

1152,Google,Foot In Door To Google,2021-02-02,5.0,Associate Account Strategist,You get to work with intelligent (socially and book smart) people constantly whether they are your customers or your coworkers. You don’t have to know Google Ads to start the role and they train you in the product very well. By a year in the role you’ll be in the 95% percentile of Google ads experts and you’ll have the opportunity to explore other roles at Google if you please. If you do well your pay goes through yearly refreshes and It can make a huge difference. You get to bring your whole self to work and that’s really cool.,"If you are joining the role from another company It is very vague if you will come into the role as an L2 (hourly) or L3 and that can make a big difference in compensation. People with 2-3 years of experience can make the same as a college grad and that can be frustrating. While pay has the potential to go up if you perform well, promotions can feel slow due to only 2 cycles a year which can limit you from going to roles that require certain levels. You will be challenged and need to have discipline, but it’s not a cutthroat environment in the slightest everyone helps everyone."

1366,Google,Bad Promo Process and Mediocre Salary,2021-09-15,3.0,Financial Analyst,"Google has an awesome company culture and perks. Culture: management is accessible, your voice can be heard at team meetings and even all-hands meetings, people respect you, and I always felt cared about as a person. Perks: I thoroughly enjoyed the free breakfast/lunch/dinner, baristas, gym, commuter bus, and subsidized massages.","Google has to make some serious changes to improve its performance management and promotion processes. Called ""Perf"", it's a twice a year process that managers and staff alike despise because it takes up enormous amounts of time and results in questionable promotion decisions. 

In Finance, approximately 10% of the team can get promoted in any given Perf cycle and there are only two per year. I recommend learning about Google's internal level system during the hiring process and asking what level your role is before you accept the job offer. Talk to a friend or contact and see if the leveling of your role is reasonable to start with. I was hired at too low of a level and then slow (3 years) to reach my first promotion. 

Finance Levels at Google (rough work experience required):

L3 Financial Analyst (1-2 years)
L4 Financial Analyst (2-4 years)
L5 Senior Financial Analyst (4-6 years)
L6 Finance Manager (6-8 years)
L7 & L7.5 Senior Finance Manager (8+)
L8 Finance Director (12+)

L5 is the terminal level for many Finance employees. It's extremely difficult to get into management. L6 and above are very political promotions. For promotions at levels 3-5, they are largely time-based (2 years on average for L3/L4, 3 years for L5). Super strong performers do not get promoted more quickly, contrary to what Google claims. 

While total compensation (salary + 15% bonus + equity) is often competitive, the salary component is quite low and makes it hard to afford the SF Bay Area cost of living, especially in your first year before you get a bonus and before any of your equity vests."

The compensation is really good. Collaboration across teams can be great, although it does depend on product area. The culture in the company and much of the scandal that comes out is born out of transparency and freedom. Freedom to express yourself many employers stomp down on and sometimes.... it's too much but usually it's quite freeing.","The promotion process at google is well intentioned but poor, IMO. It is honestly probably the single biggest reason google is known for abandoning products. We develop things for promotions because that's what gets them. Maintaining and improving or spending the energy to rebuild and transfer data doesnt get you a promotion.

You need to land something, but you also need to excel for over a year this dissuades people pushing to do something to try and get a promotion which is good but also disincentivizing. The whole thing is political, you need to land grab at times to get work other teams might be doing so they can't do it.... again so you can get promoted. If you land in the right place at the right time it is easy to move up, rising tides raise all ships. A bad manager, a bad product idea, can sink you even if you are doing good work."

Health, dental, yearly bonus, vacation, and pay raises are amazing.","The culture and environment has become a joke. Google was once the most sought after company for employment, but it has lost it's unique charm from over a decade ago. Now it's a corporate monster that has grown far too big. We were once the #1 company on Forbes' 100 best companies to work for and it hurt us deeply when we dropped to #2 after many years at the top. Fast forward to 2020 and we don't even make the top 100.

There is a serious lack of coherence and communication anymore. Motivation to succeed is not based on making great products, but instead on what you can do for promotion. This is clearly evident in the products we develop - or develop then abandon. It's also why we once had nine discrete messaging apps while many other products included messaging functions.

The world would be a better place if great ideas like Google Fiber, Stadia, and Voice were better executed. However, we're left with products that are not only made fun of by the public, but given countdown clocks to when they'll be discontinued. What remains are disjointed products like Gmail - including a UI so butchered and bloated, they needed to add a loading screen so you didn't think long loads times means the service is down. 

We once did great work and were on the top of the tech world. This is no longer the case and I doubt we could ever get there again. We're too large, too slow, too disparate, and have so many competing visions, that there is no return to our former glory days."

Not necessarily something good, or something completely functional (even for the minimal features in the MVP), just something.

If you do not like to cut corners, do not work at Google. After spending 4 years here, being told by 3 managers that I care too much about my work and spend too much time making it right (while simultaneously being dinged on perf for it being 'not right enough'), and witnessing Google's willingness to protect sexual abusers and the bottom line over its purported values, the veneer of friendliness seems very disingenuous."

One beef; it's harder being older there. Explicit age-ism was very rare, but there was a strong strain of ""let's celebrate youth"" - the famous ""take your parents to work day"". Once in a while I was on the receiving side of some condescending nonsense as an ""unwoke"" ancient.

My first manager threatened my job in a private meeting. Told me other managers were gossiping about me. He told me my job was in danger if I kept submitting negative feedback about his (eventually proven to be bad) idea. I communicated that the expectations set when I started were being abandoned. I told him how my last job they hired me away from stuck to their expectations at least, and he told me to go back to my old job. 

Another manager, in a small meeting of himself and some ITRs did it to a group of people once too. ""Remember, we're the ones who sign your conversion papers"". I didn't feel secure and was often anxious around management, because I never knew who was gossiping about me and who wasn't. 

How would you react to this kind of hostility? I was too afraid to report him, so I watched him get promoted away from his mistakes and failed responsibilities. I was mentorless, directionless, and the guy who I thought was looking out for me was just looking out for himself. 

This kind of trash happened more than once, and the managers should be ashamed of themselves for starting cliques and discouraging honest, candid feedback.

The diversity and inclusion strategies are very tokenizing. As a queer person, I was immediately asked to get involved with diversity efforts. 
The culture also seems to be such that people like to pretend that Google is not a corporation that makes money.
Worth mentioning also that I was hired for a job description that had nothing to do with my actual role. 
They told me it was consulting but turns out it was product support. Big fat lie.
Also, the team I was on did things that were antithetical to the company’s “mission” and cloaked it under the guise of a necessary evil.

2762,Google,"Unique, one of a kind dream job",2018-07-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"Google is a world of its own. At every other company, there were lots of people who had serious gaps in their skills. At Google, I could have a serious work conversation about technology with everyone and could trust that they have solid expertise. In that way, Google is a sheltered garden from the rest of the world.

There is a general sense of trust in the company. You can leave your valuables and laptops lying around, and they are safe. People joke that it's the only place where you use an expansive laptop to reserve a seat at the cafeteria, while walking away.

At other companies, teams are very protective of their own code. Trying to execute another team's code requires following a 50 step installation process that's out of date and was never complete to begin with. Google has almost all the code in the same source repository. An engineer can look at the code, easily execute the code because it comes with intelligent defaults and standard build process, and contribute enhancements/bug fixes. The other teams are generally grateful for getting improvements. They understand that it's better for the company if the bug is fixed rather than holding onto territory or insisting on their own strange ways.

Google takes care of you all around. From food, health care, generous vacation, onsite gym, and so on, you are well taken care off and can focus on work rather than dealing with life's hassles. There are cases where Google goes above and beyond tremendously. Here is an example that floats around internally. A Googler had worked at Amazon before. Amazon relocated him. Because of the relocation, he had to change his partner's health insurance for some critical and expensive life changing medication. Due to same sex partner and relocation, the health insurance company refused. Amazon was so unhelpful that the HR representative who was forced to deliver the news broke down crying and then quit over it. He switched to Google. The Google HR department negotiated an exception for him with the health insurance and included the necessary change for the following policy year for all  employees.

A lot of Google products have a huge impact with over a billion users. Working there, you can feel that you change the world.

I was very happy with the compensation. There are also a lot of opportunities in the company to follow your interest. Pretty much anyone can get an intern, participate in setting coding standards (obviously you have to argue the case for your proposals), interviewing, supporting local schools with tech expertise. Google opened up a lot of opportunities in the community or in general in tech to volunteer in.

Google is considered the largest functioning anarchy. That has its good sides, like the glee of joy for operating without strict oversight. It also has its dark side, like a hands-off management tends to encourage politics.

Another beauty for engineers are internal tools. Your development environment is in the cloud. You can sit down at a loaner computer and be productive within seconds. There is a massive cloud compiling system that shards your compiles across many computers in the cloud. The search function across the codebase is powerful. You'll feel that downloading and compiling code on your own computer in your IDE is something of another epoch, like something from before the industrial revolution.

The Google badge is a wonderful thing to carry. It opens doors to a different world. The office spaces are beautiful with work, rest, and play areas. The MTV location is like a utopian city on its own. Everything in it, food, drinks, work spaces, swimming pools, gym, bowling alleys, showers, and so on are free (for employees). It is a whole world of its own.

Most companies have a one-over-one promotion model. Your boss has to decide to promote you. Your bosses boss has to sign off on it. At Google, the promotion is decided by a relatively impartial committee that due to promoting lots of people has experience in it. You can even get promoted in rare cases against the will of your manager. Rumor has it that managers won't hold a grudge if that happens but support it. The hiring committee looks at a promotion packet that includes reviews from peers. There can even be unrequested peer reviews. In general, it creates an environment that discourages bicycling - bowing to the higher ups and kicking the lower downs hard. However some people have realized that they can hurt colleagues with bad reviews and impunity. It's rare, but colleagues careers took a dive due to someone holding a grudge or simply writing a thoughtless review. (There is some concern about stack ranking, but I don't understand enough of the background to comment on it. There are plenty of discussions with insight elsewhere.)

To underscore how Google is one of a kind, there is an internal database with legendary things that happened at Google. Someone parked his car for many years on the employee parking lot. When after years, he went looking for his car, it was gone. He went to security. He found out that it was simply moved because the parking lot had been repaved. Another Googler lived in the office fulltime to save money on rent. He wrote a guide on how to do that. As there are showers and other facilities, it is possible to do so. And Google let it happen. After a while of saving rent payment, he could afford the down payment on buying his own place. All these stories make Google a wonderful place to work at.

An important topic to bring up is work/life balance. Work/life balance is an amorphous topic that means a lot of different things to different people. Getting up to speed at Google is consuming. Depending on your work, it could take a year to become productive. Many colleagues reported no longer having a personal life after starting at Google. Some colleagues simply love technology and can't think of anything better than  working until the AM hours on some tech that gets them excited. You can tell these people by physically looking at them. For them, it is a heaven. If you are a balanced person with personal interests and relationships, you are likely going to be challenged. If you signed up for one of the big five tech companies, you wanted challenge, right. If I would do something differently, it is to take advantage of all time saving things. Pay for a laundry service. Pay for a cleaning service. I've had a moral hangup about doing that because on a moral level, my time shouldn't be more worthy than that of another human being. If I could do it all over again, I'd pay for every possible service to save time. In the grander scheme of things, if you work at Google, your skill is so valuable to humanity that you should make use of it instead of standing in line at the grocery store. I don't mean that in an arrogant way. If you work on a service with a billion users, your ability to make life better for them with another hour of work is worth more than folding laundry. You've paid the price in education, training, and effort to be able to do that. Make use of your power for the great code. (The view that all those perks are only there to keep your nose closer to the grindstone is the wrong way of looking at it from a philosophical point, in my humble opinion.)

For full disclosure, there are some people who coast at Google. They probably don't have any complains about work/life balance or perhaps the worst complaints because they are all about coasting.

Many company mishandle projects. When the next time comes around, they mishandle it in the same way because the people responsible aren't the ones working late nights and weekends. Google does two things to get better: (1) There are honest and public postmortems. They are the pride of a lot of true engineers. (2) Zeitgeist is an annual survey about the work place and the company. The survey is quite exhaustive. Every manager from the CEO to the front-line manager reports on the result of his/her area. Then they take actions to attempt to improve areas that got low scores. Having worked at companies where now improvement effort is done, this annual and systematic process is very refreshing.","If you don't work in MTV (HQ), you will be given work. However if you are passionate and want to advance your career, you should relocated to MTV. Any project that started doing well and getting important seemed to get transferred there. Promotion opportunities are better there. It seemed that everyone who relocated from another location to MTV, was a lot happier.

Officially, the company focuses on impact. In practice, it seems to focus on being highly productive in producing code, but not necessarily in actually succeeding. In theory, if you have a simple idea that doubles the revenue/customer satisfaction, it should be more appreciated than an idea that took a lot of effort/difficulty and had less improvement. But it tends to be the other way.

Promotions tend to be tied to launching a project that makes peers at a higher level happy. That's often easier with an API that happens to be really useful for peers than launches that benefit users. Landing the right kind of project to work on is a big factor of getting a promotion, which is easier in MTV and also encourages politics. A colleague was told directly from his boss that he has to get better at ""turf war.""

A general rule of thumb is that everyone ends up in ads. Non-ads projects tend to be more volatile and have a tendency to end with people ending up on ads projects. This is not necessarily a con. One should simply prepare for it.

There seems to be a general trend as Google gets larger (60K+ employees) and the founders are withdrawing their impact on the company that Google's specialty is fading a bit. Microkitchens stock less eye popping snacks and drinks. The Christmas gift went from a nice bundle of cash to a coveted phone to a cheap phone to simply a donation to a charity of your choice. The hiring bar seems to get lowered to satisfy the need to hire more people.

Managers tend to become managers for their tech skills and not management skills. It definitely shows in the quality of management. Very smart people, very technically capable, not so business and people savvy. This is not necessarily a complete con because a manager without a clue in tech is definitely a lot worse.

There are some stars that people belief that Google still has but doesn't. The myth of 20% time is alive outside of Google. It's discouraged inside of Google. The only person whom I knew to participate in 20% time did so by working on another team, which he wanted to test out before transferring. Outside people belief that 1 day a week a Google can work on anything he/she deems interesting. Management doesn't outright deny it, but it's formulated as: If you work 20% time on something else, it has to have company impact worth 20%. This is not necessarily a con. It's more like a missing pro.

Another shining star that's gone is the ""don't be evil"" motto. It was silently dropped and replaced with ""do the right thing."" Google didn't turn overnight evil. There is some philosophical case to be made why the new motto is better. However it seems with the founders drawing back from company involvement that the dramatic standing up for users of the old times is also fading. Google is still a far cry from Monsanto.

If you work there and want to advance your career, don't volunteer for anything. It is kind of viewed as a ""vacation"" if you volunteer for things. For example at other employers, interviewing was viewed as a prestigious activity reserved for the most trusted employees to shape the future. At Google, any hour you spend interviewing means missing an hour to increase your performance score. You'll be rewarded for finding ways to dug out of the interviewing responsibility. Again this is not necessarily a con, simply something to understand.

You are going to meet some of the brightest and most brilliant people. You are going to meet people with interesting backgrounds. You are going to have wonderfully engaging conversations. But all of that intelligence tends to also have caused nature to create that intelligence at a trade-off (in some people). Perhaps a lack of humanity or emotion was the price of it in some people. You are going to have some lunch conversations that are going to make you spit your food back out, like a colleague seriously proposing to use nuclear bombs to solve social issues. I sometimes felt the need to take a break from the office to be around people who display normal emotions (or any emotion). While the general office culture is very liberal/progressive, there are some pockets of social beliefs that are breathtaking to how little they care about human life or different lifestyles/opinions out of some law of the strong or ultra libertarian reasoning."

I've liked all managers, and have been able to make my own projects and priorities.

Started as a contractor for two years and was converted to full-time employee.","Too many teams trying to do the same thing. The size of the company can make it challenging to get things done. Most projects require approvals from dozens of stakeholders with different priorities, and likely someone else is already working on the same project on a team you've never heard.

There's a paradox where collaboration is both necessary to get any project done, but also incredibly challenging. It requires you to navigate complex and overlapping org structures with simultaneous and competing priorities.

2988,Google,"interesting preschool environment, typical lack of appreciation for educators",2021-02-16,3.0,Children's Center Teacher II,"- work at a tech company and enjoy most of the benefits (if you can work It into your schedule)
- freedom in day to day work (*very team dependent)
- health insurance","- very low pay for the area - my recruiter literally told me my offer was considered ""below a livable wage in the bay area"", however I also had no room to negotiate based on experience ..lesson learned!
- unfair / biased hiring practices - theres at least one lawsuit in recent years alleging unequal pay between male and female teachers. I can confirm I knew of at least 1 male teacher who was hired as a level II when every female teacher I knew had been told by their recruiter they *must* start as a level I regardless of education or experience. I knew of at least one peer with a Masters who had to start as a level I - $16/hr. I am confident the male teacher did not have the same level of experience.
- unfair promotions - all about who you are friends with. if your team is a sinking ship you will likely go down with them at performance time regardless of your own individual performance
- HIGH attrition due to all of the above. constantly understaffed and making huge crazy sacrifices to stay in ratio 
- used to give stock options at hire - took them away without telling the population. huge uproar when everyone found out, followed by walk out protest and calls for raising base pay based on market standards. told by google leadership ""we know educators being underpaid is a problem, but Google is not going to focus on that right now""
- few growth opportunities - only 3 levels of teacher when I was there in 2017, otherwise like a handful of operations and leadership positions. 
- base pay is bad but promotion compensation was worse, a slap in the face. when I was promoted from a level I to level II teacher (the 2nd of 3 levels I could aspire to, remember) my raise was literally less than a dollar + a few stock thank god, and my manager actually acted like It was a big deal. I cant really blame her, knowing now how some companies manage promotions and $$ when It comes down to It, but that was just insulting..for the both of us. not unusual for educators, especially in preschool, but Google sets their own standard high and when a company is always preaching how ""employee first"" they are you kind of get to hold them accountable to it in practice."

Google executives listen and employees are empowered to speak their minds without fear of retribution.  Life at Google is far better than almost any company and just about every employee comes to work and leaves work happy.  All the news articles looking to find something wrong with working at Google are misguided.  The writers don't understand that voicing a desire for equality, inclusion, and diversity are cornerstones of the Google culture.  It doesn't mean employees are unhappy.  It means they are good people fighting for continuous improvement in these areas even if Google is already excelling in these areas.  People will always ask Google to do even more good for the world and their employees because they know Google will take action.

4535,Google,"Good Intentions, Struggling with Growth Momentum & Scaling",2019-12-28,4.0,Senior Staffing Services Associate,"Truly the cushiest place to work on Earth. Fantastic perks, benefits, and pay. There's runway to run with creative ideas (to an extent), but as with any organization of 100,000 full-time employees globally, it can be impossible to see organizational change move quickly.","Challenging culture of employee performance management, can beget an undercurrent of competition and rat-race syndrome to greater visibility, impact, recognition, promotion and better pay. Your experience can be really pendant on the manager and the function you're in. Managers are not as intentionally selected, well-trained, or well-incentivized as they should be. Not all managers are trained diligently enough to operate with a true servant leadership style, and it's palpable, and can be detrimental to the growth and development of employees underneath them. This is something Google is actively working to redesign, but a behemoth of an organization takes many cycles of evolution to move the needle. Prepare to constantly exist amidst re-orgs and change. The organization is so large, that the work is segmented into singular functions, and the result is that you feel this urgent need to pile project work onto your plate to prove your worth and get promotion-ready. Career opportunities are there, but internal mobility is a true black box. Feels slow-moving, inaccessible, and not very transparent. A huge hiring push across the last 3 years has made for growing pains, a culture of question-asking, and culture of leaks."

- great salary and equity compensation
- great work/life balance (depending on the team you work on)
- great job to have when you're ready to settle down, get a mortgage, have children, 9-5pm, work from home once/week, take lots of vacations. You will see people who have been working at Google like this for +10 years with very junior titles who are very happy. Success isn't always about the never-ending race to the top at work, spending time with families is also ok and Google provides the opportunities for that.","- Google sucks the best talent in the market, people who should be using their skills to be doing amazing, ground-breaking work to improve our society, are instead optimizing for how to get more clicks. You'll be surrounded by people who are way overqualified for the job they do but are only there because of the ""golden cuffs"" (the free food, the endless perks, and work/life balance). 
- eng vs. non-eng divide. Engineers get the best perks, salaries, off-sites, offices, etc. If you are not engineer, you're disposable, master degrees in anything else but computer science don't really have any weight here. MBAs won't automatically give you a different title or responsibilities at Google than a college grad.
- Really hard to move laterally once you have reached the plateau of your learning curve. If you're no longer challenged or happy with your job, why invest in you when they have hundreds of people lined up to take your job?
- no diversity among senior management (few women or people of color who are, in turn, not interested in raising people up the career ladder)."

* Performance review system is complicated but understandable.  You can generally understand pretty clearly what you need to do to get promoted and succeed. At least up to L5, Senior Software Engineer.","* It isn't as good as it used to be. 10 years ago, focus was entirely on doing the right thing for the user.  Now, focus is on keeping the money train going. This short term thinking is hurting long term potential, and is often bad for users.
* Management ""Ethics"" seem to be mainly: Whatever they can get away with, without annoying European and US governments too much, and makes money, is good.  Even if it is not good for our users.
* 10 years ago, we had a lot more bottom up innovation. 20% projects, taking risks, trying crazy innovative things. That's pretty much gone now.  Top down planning, lots of status updates to management, proving that what you are doing is working and contributing to the organization's goals.  Much more bureaucracy then there used to be.

4943,Google,"Solid Experience, would work again",2020-08-31,4.0,Software Engineer,"- Highly competitive pay, best benefits I've seen, best perks I've seen (yes, this doesn't matter, but when everything else is good, this helps).
- Very strong individuals. The average engineer here is very skilled and some of the best in the industry are here. This does not mean everyone is a genius, but there are certainly some here. To do the work, you definitely don't need to be the best, but the quality here is definitely among the best I've seen (I've worked at other ""top"" companies).
- Stellar work life balance. I've seen reviews for this that are negative, but I feel like they're on the wrong team or something. My team was busier than most and promoted people quickly and I still rarely pushed over 40 hours a week. I've seen some people work significantly fewer hours as well and still progressed. You can coast at L4 if you just do basic work and rest and vest.
- Good projects if you're on the right team. If you get lucky and get on the right team then the work is definitely interesting. This can be a con if you are on the wrong team.
- Interesting tools and learning opportunities. You can definitely learn a lot about system architecture if you are new to it. You can learn about any product area and go into the little details of that domain. Some tools at Google are used elsewhere and the knowledge can be transferred (Guice, Bazel, gRPC, protos, etc).","- Work does not translate to other jobs. You never get to work on stuff like Apache Spark, AWS S3, RabbitMQ, and other technologies that are very common in industry. Instead you learn things like BigTable, which is similar to Apache HBase but not exactly. Your knowledge of internal frameworks is mostly useless in other jobs. The concepts learned are not, however.
- Half the projects are objectively boring and stale. Most of the projects are maintaining some aspect of the system (cloud, ads, etc) and a lot of it is tedious infrastructure work.
- Office politics as usual. The general population is friendly, but this does not mean everyone. Office politics definitely do play a role."

Our department was understaffed for half a year. Which meant we spent more time working on tickets, and less on more interesting project work that could yield great reductions in ticket work.

The type of work was not good long-term for a career as it was primarily product support. If you are a software developer considering a role as a Technical Account Manager, it could be hard to get back into software development later.

No easy way to measure difficulty/complexity of a ticket, so an easy one would net you the same amount of credit as a difficult one. So the incentive was to take lots of easier tickets, which caused resentment.

You feel an implicit pressure to work first thing when you wake up, then again after work, and even on weekends to meet certain metric goals."

5400,Google,Misogynistic. Toxic. Retaliatory.,2020-07-12,1.0,Software Engineer,Money. That is the only pro.,"Google is the most toxic place that I have ever worked. Everyone is obsessed with levels. Yet, levels are largely determined by personal connections and stereotypes. I found out after I started that some employees had spent years researching the hiring system to game it. My coworkers were all significantly less qualified than my peers at prior jobs. My recruiter did not understand anything on my resume and pointed out that it was very different than all the resumes that she saw from entry level men. She assumed that meant that I was less qualified than them and never considered that I was far more qualified. She kept saying things that were horrifically sexist. She attempted to route me towards a non-technical position even after I had passed the interview and gotten approval from the hiring committee. The hiring processes are set up such that the recruiters determine someone's level and the interviewers and hiring committee cannot fix a mistake no matter how glaring. This results in some employees being underleveled. Most experienced women are underleveled by at least one level, but some are underleveled by multiple levels. Other employees are overleveled. This results in an entirely toxic culture. The underleveled employees are wondering what's wrong with them that their entire careers suddenly evaporated. The overleveled employees are extremely insecure and resort to bullying the underleveled employees (mostly women and people of color) because they know that they're less qualified than the underleveled employees. Even the managers who recognize what's happening are unable to fix the problems because HR is more concerned with covering up the problem. As a result, underleveled employees are being given work far below their competence level (because HR won't allow them to get higher level work) and told that they have to prove themselves again.su"

Not a gateway to Google: I joined thinking that the I could work in Finance for a while learning new skills and working on cool projects on my way to moving into the eng org. This is generally not the case. What I didn't realize when I joined is that I was on a Finance ladder. As a result, transferring to the eng org involves a full interview process.

Google knows it can pay less than it has to, because people want to work for it. Google has departments working on formulas meant to pay you as little as possible. Huge fight to get to the top - everyone is in a race. A culture of overachievers, which means you have to sacrifice personal and social life to move up the ranks. I've seen amazing rates of burnout among marketing. Too much. Also, middle management can be incompetent or too busy racing to the top to care about you. Everything is in formulas, and just doing a great job is not enough. You need to shop yourself and shout about your achievements as loud as you can in order to get promoted. Also, the commute from the city sucks. Oh, and the company's product strategy is a laughing stock. Google jumps on every shiny object. It's one thing to reinvent an industry, but to launch clones is just low. Google+ is shoved down everyone's throat. Google Offers was a Groupon clone. And nobody cares about the user, the company is totally evil. Decisions are made based on $$$, and not the user in mind. Don't be fooled."
5516,Google,Tons of Bureaucracy,2020-01-31,3.0,Software Engineer,"Lots of great things about Google that other people summarized. But to give my list:
- Smart coworkers (on average)
- Best tech infrastructure of any company in the world
- Reasonable work-life balance
- Perks and Food","- So much bureaucracy, tons of pointless meetings, lots of decisions being made for political reasons. As a ""rank-and-file"" software engineer, there were instances where I disagreed with what was asked of me and was told to do it anyways without being given a convincing reason for why (the cynical reason is that doing it would get someone promoted).
- Promotion process is broken. There were instances where I did what was best for the product/company, and it hurt me when it came to perf time.
- Hiring bar lowered over time. It's still okay, but definitely not as high as some smaller companies.
- The food is free, but it's not great. I'd rather pay for good food."
