They work with your schedule.",Very hard to grow in the company. They brainwash you to think you have all these abilities & make you feel special so they can use you. They promise you will have a bright future with the company. Then when you're not of use anymore to them & think for yourself they no longer want anything to do with you.

The pharmacy is a small department so it's easy to get familiar with your coworkers. It's a great place to work during school in this particular department.,"Grievances regarding technical issues, standard of procedure, or limitations of what staff can reasonably accomplish are not taken seriously at the corporate level. Departments are instead incentivized to work to the limits of what is humanly possible in terms of metrics. Raises are on a strict corporate timeline and cannot deviate much for hardwork, so trying to get to the top tier fast is not really possible, it just requires a lot of time."

720,H E B,Decent,2022-01-06,4.0,In Store Shopper,"- Decent pay.
- Flexible schedule.
- When shopping, you have time to yourself going through the aisles and gathering groceries.
- Lots of employees to interact with.
- Opportunities to transfer between departments within HEB, such as going from curbside to seafood, or to front-end, etc.","- Somewhat stressful shopping as they want you to maintain an certain speed per unit of groceries when shopping, but so many factors play into your speed on specific ""runs"", such as how busy the store is, how many questions customers ask you, how long you look for a substitution for a product, who is available to ask for a product (when the inventory count is above a certain number, you have to ask someone in that department if there is any if you can't find it on the shelf), the type of product you're shopping for (10 of one can of soup is the same amount of units as 10 different kinds of soup. So if you are shopping for 100 items, one run can have 80 unique items which is much slower to shop than 40 unique items), etc. None of this is really accounted for in your performance; they tell you, essentially, to just be back in about an hour (depending on the type of items you're shopping for. For cold/frozen items, they want you back sooner). But the location I work at isn't very strict on speed.
- The job doesn't organically foster socialization with coworkers when shopping, as you are essentially on your own with a phone going through the store shopping for hours, and when you come back you either shop a different category or go on break. You can talk to other coworkers that are shopping, but slows both of you down unless one is helping the other find a product or something similar.
- At times doesn't feel like a team environment when in reality it should be, as everyone in the curbside department plays a role in the customer's order, whether its shopping the order, delivering the order to their vehicle, or handling customer phone calls. Instead, they push individual shopper speed above all else, de-incentivizing finding good substitutions for products, helping others, etc."

If there is an incident involving harassment or abuse they will try to sweep it under the rug, the abusers will not get fired unless they hit you. This has happened to myself and several people I know in Central Texas stores. Management will try to exploit you at every turn. You get your schedule two days in advance every week, inconsistent scheduling. If your store has an issue with people calling in, they won’t fix it, they expect whoever shows up to figure it out.

To add to this, there is not much transparency between management and individual contributors. This is contrary to the ""transparent culture"" that H-E-B claims to have. 

To round it off, the company does not accurately promote or compensate individuals based on their skills and/or value to the team. For example, as a junior-level or mid-level software engineer, one should not be easily outperforming senior-level engineers.

Managers are unlikely to shield you from unrealistic demands from executives, so be prepared either to disappoint people or to be overworked.
Bad directors / managers can chew through the careers of 5-10 bright people below them before any action is taken by upper management.
Sometimes the culture is petty (one time a director shared to the team that people had been complaining that team members weren't turning on their cameras for zoom meetings. Not sure why the complainers couldn't just directly tell the non-camera user in the meeting ""Hey, could you turn your camera on?"" instead of tattling to our leader about it later.

Can’t have an earbud in. I have hidden wearing an earbud for 10 years and I’ve never had a problem getting the job done and helping customers, it’s the one thing that has kept me sane while doing this mindless job. 
They pick and choose which rules to enforce randomly.

Tons of drama. 

Unfortunately some people are stuck at this job for the rest of their life and want everyone else to be as miserable as they are.

10% discount is a joke. 

No recognition when you do good. Sure to jump down your throat when you do something they don’t like.

Constantly adding new work to do, no additional compensation.

Everyone is fake."

-Lack of appreciation or recognition from lower management; you can work yourself to death before being recognized for something if you’re not a “favorite”
-“Open Door Policy”: this policy is brought up incessantly, but doesn’t mean anything when it comes to actually bringing things up and using the policy


The level of retaliation and favoritism that I have witnessed and experienced during my time at H‑E‑B has been jaw dropping and straight up unbelievable.

The store is clean and you get a discount on their brands.","They are a Texas specific company and thus are allowed to use a non-subscriber ""worker's compensation"" plan due to the state's de-regulation. Once injured I was hung out to dry, they payed for the medical bills but they made their plan so that you don't get any income compensation unless you still work in the store (which was basically impossible due to the nature of the injury, they committed very little effort to create an accommodating position for me effectively denying me the ability to work and thus falling short of their requirements for the benefits plan). I feel like I was disposable once I got injured. They also severely reduce your hours at the end of the fiscal year to avoid your qualification for their employee benefits, and when I asked the General Manager for consistent full-time/part-time work hours (so I could qualify, although I didn't directly admit this) he laughed at me and said ""Only the best employees get full-time"", effectively calling me a bad employee."

- 3 rounds of interviews really weeds out bad coworkers
- opportunity to move to other positions/stores and keep your pay
-Wish I'd gotten a job here in high school because they love promoting from within and putting partners where they want to be

-amazing during the pandemic. hazard pay, extra discounts, to, holiday pay","-it's still retail so customers can be less than stellar
-some managers have been their forever and like power tripping, but that is in any job. most are receptive to feedback if you feel mistreated
-overnight is really hard. the only harder job is probably warehouse. I would only recommend these positions if you want to get a foot in the door and transfer after a few months
-they will ask you to work on days off if someone calls in. I liked getting extra hours, but sometimes it feels like a guilt trip

Very flexible for those who may be attending school.

Growth opportunities are available.","Management is rather incompetent and overly passionate about certain things.

Much of management and leadership related tasks are delegated to individuals who are not compensated on the same level.

Favoritism is a huge problem, but management will act as if they are fair to everyone.

Hours have been cut during busy time periods even though some stores make more than enough in a week to meet the demands of labor.

Customers are very entitled and rude to many of the employees that work there."

Working overnight means no direct contact with customers - a plus.
Rarely run out of work to do so you're preoccupied your entire shift","It's like they purposely underhire. One more employee (no matter the department) would be extremely helpful in helping everyone finish the tasks they require of you in the timeframe that they expect it. But instead they would rather have everyone work at full capacity every day just for us to *barely* make it by the time the store opens. Very often, we would still be in the store 2-3 hours past our shifts - especially on the days if one person had to call in sick or didn't come in for whatever reason. Losing a person that night made it impossible for everyone to get done stocking. I thought moving to the ""cosmetic"" section (diapers, medecine, hair supplies) would make for an easier workload than having to stock up rows upon rows of food. Negative. It was just me and another employee on that side so if she called in sick I was still expected to produce at normal levels. Add to the fact that she never picked up speed so I was doing my rows and a portion of hers every single night. Stressful."

2550,H E B,"Easy job, but too many leads and management in one dept that cause micromanaging",2021-04-05,2.0,Curbside,"-Met some nice co workers 
-Nice customers for the most part on curbside
- Easy job","-Constantly asked to audit in the cooler, even when it was kind of pointless because orders would start to show up on the screen after a few minutes and double checking quality of food should be the shoppers responsibility not me because I'm not the one picking the food.
-They eventually over-hired a month of me being there and lost my hours and I'm not sure why some people got more hours than me even when my hours were cut, I have no idea if that was performance based or favoritism or what?! 
-Once they over-hired people, there was so many many leads and managers in curbside watching your every move and even following you to the car to tell you how to do customers service as curbie, I think thats fine as a once or twice reminder, but they kept doing it everyday which actually aggravating and its like ""ok I get it!!! I know how to do my job."" 
-I saw a lot of favoritism, some people were there for about a month and were already trained to be both a shopper and curbside!!! While some were just only stuck with curbside. I've had tons of experience doing order picking at other retail stores, they didn't seem to acknowledge that and they leave you stuck as a curbie for 90 days or as long as they can I feel like, at least from what I see. 
-Curbside is easy, but can be boring that's why they micromanage. 
-This company is so hyped for how good it is, but it isn't that good I feel like its not long term at all, its just a job you get when you're in high school or in college as part time job. Their discount isn't even that good either.
-I just couldn't tolerate being talked to like I was stupid, I guess some people can put up with that, but I try my best to respect everyone and I just felt like I wasn't always getting that back from the leads and management.
-I don't even know how some of these people became leads, they weren't even personable or organized at times... they just stood around watching you and telling you what to do. 
-I thought I could tolerate this job, but I think I will need to look for something more professional because they don't treat you professionally they treat you as some extra help."

The general manager is great and very friendly, he remembers everyone’s names even though there’s TONS of employees there. 
The pay is good for what the job is, unless you don’t like doing the same repetitive things every hour of your shift.","The list really goes on. One of the department managers definitely has a big problem with playing favorites. They’ll let things slide with said favorites but if you’re not their favorite, they are on your butt about the same things. 
There is also a huge problem with everyone going around and talking about their “relations” with other employees in the store, which is pretty inappropriate. 
The customers can be pretty rude, especially with COVID going on right now. But that is expected with every service job. 
The department managers collect any tips you get from taking orders out, promises it’ll go to a pizza party or something for the team, but it just sits in a little box untouched. 
Attendance of other partners is very bad. We have up to 6 call ins a day which really sucks for the people who decide to show up. 
HOURS ARE A HUGE ISSUE. When you first start they work you 35+ (which means you should get benefits but the moment you ask about those or just shifting over to full-time, they’ll tell you they don’t have room then cut your hours). The hours get cut down to less than half. First few months you’re making 35 hours, then all of a sudden you’re down to 12. And if you talk to them about it, they don’t really care. Even if you have good reasons to be making a certain number of hours: children, rent, etc. There’s even been an incidence of one of the department managers complaining to an employee about their requests for more hours because of their need to fulfill monthly payments. 
The employees of the company are not expected to uphold the safety expectations of the company when in store as a customer. Our department had a small outbreak, and plenty of the partners do not follow safety guidelines in store off the clock. Which obviously nothing can be forced upon them, but it shows their lack of compassion for the people they work with. 
There has also been an incident of mild assault in which a partner pulled another’s hair with the curbside cart and nothing was done (because of the favoritism). 

If you look for work at Boerne HEB it may be best to steer clear from curbside."

Very difficult to obtain transfers to other stores as most positions are already promised to employees before they are made public.

Never expect to be made full time unless you get a new job that is already full time.  Ive worked 40 hours/week for most of this time too.

You can pick your availability and they will give you work based on that. It's the perfect job for a college student.,The equipment is cheap and breaks down a lot. HEB has a major problem when it comes to reading the chips on people's cards. It takes a lot of patience to help the customers over and over again with this same problem. There are times where they over-hire and you don't get many hours for a good while. The opposite is also true. They might not schedule many people for a day and there is a shortage of workers.

Discounts on store brands
Sometimes free items with your vpp card
One of the food leaders even provided me a number I could call that would assist me in finding an apartment. You could even get legal assistance through that number and some counseling sessions as well, and it's only available to partners!
When I was part time I worked enough hours to get vacation time as well.","It's VERY hard to transfer to a new store. I gave up after a while and decided a 1.5hr trip to work and another 1.5hr trip back would be the better solution since I couldn't get transfers anywhere I applied, and I even went to several different interviews.
Your job will be a bit more annoying if your coworkers aren't very friendly to the coworkers around them, or if people don't do their portion of the job. But then again that's with every job.

If you're wanting full time at heb, the best route is to get a part time position and keep pushing for a fulltime one. Took about a year before I was allowed to be a full time employee.

You aren't allowed water during work unless you go to the break room or go to a water fountain.

Friendly customers
Relaxed uniform
Can listen to music while I am in the parking lot
Management has upfront conversations with you","Inconsistent scheduling. I will check my schedule on Monday when it comes out and it will say I only work on Friday and Saturday, which is great. I check again on Tuesday evening to find that I missed a shift on Tuesday morning from 8am-2pm. They almost fired me for not showing up, even though this was never on my schedule to begin with. I show up for my shift on Friday to find I have been ""Suspended while management decides whether or not to keep me on board"". This would have been understandable if it was on my schedule but it never was and while I wasn't fired for it they had docked me for an occurrence (absence) and denied me a day off I had requested because of it. This happened three more times. 
Being outside is the most enjoyable part of the job but the management expects you to pick up after all the customers, even though we have a maintenance staff. This includes trash, beer bottles, broken glass, dirty diapers, rotten vegetables, anything you can imagine someone would leave in their basket in the parking lot. Some people are disgusting, man.
Being inside I feel as though the management is always staring us down and breathing down our necks. Not to mention the younger male supervisors are always pulling aside the females and having full on conversations with them while we are busy and understaffed, flirting and all. Extremely unprofessional.

Rampant gossip, harassment, and drama.  BPM means “Because Profits Matter”, not people.  Lazy, incompetent department managers.  Only people in the good old boy network and brown noses get promoted.  SORM interviews are a joke.  Merit and hard work goes unrecognized and unrewarded for partners, while their managers win exotic trips (ex. Italy, Spain) from the fruits of their labor.  Some part-time employees work 40-hours a week are not given benefits or the opportunity to go full-time.  Too much overt political activism and social justice with the 2018 General Election, trying to spread fear by saying, “This is the most important election in our lifetime!”  Lots of “white shaming” in the name of “Diversity”.

Medical insurance is quite good (they self insure).","Tends to be very cautious with seeking and adopting new technology.

They spend a lot of time training you and building you up especially as a new hire. They give you time to adapt to their general tech stack and figure out where you'd be a good fit.

Work/Life balance is pretty good, they are super flexible with you. Especially if you want to go to grad school, or have a family, or something comes up.

We are doing a lot of cool projects and are way more technical than you'd expect a grocery company to be.

As far as software goes, it's in a good place for people to come on board now as we are definitely ramping up and starting to embrace new technology and new projects.","Although it is improving, in the past the company has been a bit reluctant to embrace new technology. 

There are a few unnecessary practices and policies that the company holds on to tech-wise that are a bit outdated related to software security. 

The pay can be a bit higher across the board, and the vacation policy is a bit small for corporate employees. (Although I suspect the reasoning is that corporate and store employees receive similar benefits.) But at the end of the day I'd rather be underpaid with a great job than overpaid with a horrible one.

Unfortunately as a developer, whether or not you are working with a good tech stack and will have good modern coding environment largely depends on which organization within the company you are with."

- You’ll work with a lot of really good people and make plenty of friends along the way
- You’ll generally be treated really well by store management
- Customers appreciate H-E-B and they will tell you that
- If you want to have a career at H-E-B you can make that happen
- Your fellow partners and managers will always have your back when personal issues arise
- Pay is competitive
- Really efficient, well-run company
- Paid weekly
- Time and a half on holidays","- You only get your schedule one week at a time, so planning for life outside of H-E-B is hard
- If you have open availability your schedule will be all over the place, at least on the front-end. You could work 6-2:30 Monday, 3:30-12 Tuesday, and then 10-6:30 on Wednesday. Just makes it hard for your body to adjust and again, hard to plan for life outside of H-E-B
- Your first year of full-time you get very little vacation, although it does go up to 2 weeks your 2nd year.
- You can only call-in or be tardy 9 times in a year, which isn’t awful, but if you have kids or just a few personal issues arise in a given year it can become a problem. Some managers are more lenient with “occurrences” and may cut you some slack, but it all depends on your manager. Some are very “by the books” about things. (If you call in multiple days in a row for the same issue it only counts as one occurrence, so keep that in mind. If you have the flu don’t worry about getting multiple occurrences. Call-in every day until you’re well, and then come back to work.)
- Not a lot of opportunity for overtime, which isn’t an issue if you don’t want to work more than 40 hours a week, but if you need extra hours to pay the bills don’t expect to be able to pick up more than 40."

This employee has the right to tell a manager and the private conversation between the two employees has to be told to management and then you have to fill out a affidavit and tell them what you said and sign off on the affidavit.

Depending on how much insurance coverage you get and how many people are covered, the partners share can be substantial every week. Even base coverage (medical/dental/vision) is at least $30 each week for just one person 

While some of the policies for helping customers is above and beyond compared to others for the customers themselves, they can cause problems on the employee level.

-will document you for unreasonable things ( I was sick at work, literally vomiting inside of the store in multiple places, and they still threatened to write me up if I was to leave early)

- they will sometimes expect you to do the work of two to three people by yourself, and have  unfair expectations put upon you daily.

-  if you see them treating coworkers unfairly, there is virtually nothing you can really do to help them without being retaliated against .

These are just a few examples. I currently work at HEB montrose market in Houston, and although some people enjoy working there, a lot of people (myself included) feel literally like it’s hell on earth most if not all of the time) And it’s neither an exaggeration or a vendetta against the company. I’ve heard that some stores have great management and that each store is a unique environment unto itself. Everyone I’ve seen go to HR has just ended up fired, Or they just send them back to their store managers to deal with it, who are the ones who SHOULD be changing things but are more concerned with more profits and less work.

I think HEB, as a company genuinely cares about their employees.","I can't speak for other positions but overnight stocking was very difficult for me and my manager was unwilling to help. I worked my butt off every night and improved each time just to slowly have my hours cut every week and go home feeling like a piece of (insert bad word here).

5054,H E B,Truck Driver,2018-07-09,1.0,Class A Truck Driver,"I have been here 9 months.Decent benefits. In my opinion the pay isn't good enough to offset the work schedule, job duties, no weekends off and work environment.","If you hire on with experience you'll be called an ""external hire"" because they train mule drivers to be truck drivers. All the mule drivers that are in the program when you hire are already ahead of you on the seniority list that determines future work schedules and loads. They pay by the load so it also effects your pay. They're can be 9 or 10 drivers ahead of you but not driving when you hire. They fail to mention this when hiring you. Expect to be an ""extra"" in the rotation for a very long time. If there's not enough work they will tell the ""extras"" to stay home for the day, they also failed to mention this during my hiring process. 
Equipment. When you see HEB rolling down the highway they look nice, clean and well maintained. That is not the case. You will be driving pool trucks that have anywhere from 900k to over a million miles. They don't lease truck they buy them so they get all they can out of them, Shake rattle and roll your whole shift. They're just clean on the outside but trashed on the inside and ride and drive poorly.
   You will not know your pay until you're in class. They will tell you that its complicated because its activity based. It is complicated and you will have a hard time for awhile figuring out your pay. They told us our mileage rate during orientation. Its well below the short hauling average. They have pretty good turn rate here. Its kinda like the OTR puppy mills. They replace drivers with that leave with the kids driving the yard mules. When I hired there was three of us in orientation. Two of us had 20+ years with no accidents and the other guy had 10+. I'm the only one left an am currently looking else where. Bottom line is if you have experience and a safe driving record you can do much better in the way your're treated and pay.
 On the culture and values I put one star. They have all kinds of posters and stuff posted throughout the building but its seems like its just propaganda. I don't see it being practiced. 
 Just telling it like it is. If you're an experienced safe driver and are happy or semi happy and are making a living I wouldn't come here."

Depending on the store  and position you are in will depend on the experience you will have. Nepotism is rampant within the company. You may have a father, brother, aunt and cousins all working in the store in different areas including corporate. If you are a manager and one of those people are on your team good luck, you will be required to carry dead weight and even worse if it's two from different families. I myself was bullied, lied to and about and my job as a manager was made impossible. I left with grate stats in my department and I had a superior work ethic but my hands were tied due to the way the store leaders managed.

Even if you work 40 hours a week, like I do, you do not accrue the benefits a full timer does.  (vacation time, etc)  Their goal is to make everyone outside of management part time and work multiple departments to get your 40 hours.

You really get to see a look into the company, the stocks etc.. they also take all sexual harassment claims VERY seriously. 
Overall such a nice relaxed place, this is basically family.","There aren’t many downsides but one thing I will say is since HEB is held to such a high standard sometimes you’re asked to do ridiculous stuff and they really get onto you if you aren’t always 1. Moving VERY quickly, 2.smiling, 3. Give 100% most of the time. Also for call in’s it’s pretty bad the way they set it up. They have no leeway with emergencies or call ins and you get about 4 or 5 before probation/termination. It’s very strict. Another thing is IPM’s. I understand it’s importance but they push so hard for you to have super high IPM’s you can even focus on talking to your customer or badger sometimes. You have to check pretty fast and the computer keeps track of it all. Other than that there’s not much I can think of!"

You are provided with two paid, 15 minute breaks and a lunch, however I rarely get to take these breaks and thus wind up without food or water for all or most of the day. There is a great strain on employees to move faster even if work demands more time, such as heavy lifting. There are no floor mats even though I stand all day, and the equipment almost never works properly. They are extremely reluctant to maintenance or replace equipment that we desperately need and use constantly to accomplish tasks. I have truly stuck my neck out for this company, pushing my body to its limits and staying late almost every day. I have never been thanked or recognized in any way.

This job taught me interpersonal skills that I would not have been able to gain elsewhere, because you literally see every type of person and you have to adjust to each customer’s need.","Some managers are not always as nice, but they do switch CCOMs every so many years so you won’t always have to deal with the same CCOM if you work there long enough.

Very much still has the old mindset that you need to be over the age of 45 in order to be a manager, and they put loyalty of the company ahead of everything else. People who are more tenured time wise get promoted, over people who can do the best job. The benefits are very unsatifactory, no parental leave, only 2 wks of vacation to start with and they will not negotiate that. No working from home, unless it is a absolute emergency. Overall the mindset of the F&R department, and HEB is very behind the times when it comes to it's people. No work life balance, as you're expected to work long hours and then when you get a promotion to a new position, you only get a small merit increase vs being on the proper pay scale. HEB has forgotten about it's corporate employees and focuses only on it's store employees.

5147,H E B,My thoughts and experience on career opportunity.,2018-04-03,4.0,Deli Representative (Full-time),"HEB has a great environment. Good pay, and great health insurance.","Sometimes, career opportunities are from what I witnessed and have been told about from other employees ""partners"" are based on weather or not the manager likes you as a person , not how good, or how hard an employee ""partner"" works,  or how long an employee has been with the company, or if the employee has a life change.  Management is ""personal based"" selective, and does not give employees ""partners"" a fair opportunity for every position . Additionally,  management treats employees ""partners"" differently.  Not with the same core values, and or does not help an employee ""partner"" with certain situations when needed or asked. I told management that I needed to get overnight because of my ride situation at the time, and that they would accommodate. The manager I interviewed with then went on vacation, and I had no clue a different manager took over hiring for the specific job I applied for within the company until weeks after they had already chosen someone for that job. The overnight job I needed because of my situation. I was not told anything about it. Days later,  I  overheard an upper manager interviewing another employee ""partner"" for that same  position I was told I would get a chance at. The manager said and I quote ""I have the authority to pick any partner I want for any position no matter what , and I know what you are capable of."" end quote. When I asked if I was chosen for said position, the same manager that I overheard doing the interview told me and I quote ""  Did you apply? and hiring is difficult, there are a lot of applicants to choose from"" end quote.  Also,  different store locations would also tell me they would ""get back with me next week"". And never did. I even called to check, all I would get is them saying the same thing to me. What I'm saying is, the company is a great company to work for, but management does not listen when you come to them truthfully and explain a life change. They pick an applicant based on personal relationships, in other words ""If they like you.""

* NOTE: This statement is from my own personal experience along with other employees personal experiences that I did not give an example of to protect their name and situation."

Decent starting pay and raises","The schedule can be crazy. It is possible to work a closing shift (after midnight) and then an opening shift (6 a.m. Sharp).
Changing availability and requesting off are incredibly hard, its easier to just swap shifts or call in sick.
As a cashier you can find yourself standing around for hours with absolutely nothing to do (crack open a magazine and the disappearing manager will a peer to rain criticisms and snide comments down on your poor head).
Being late from your very late break will result in a lecture about your work ethic and poor time management skills.
The worst part of the job however is the customers. Customers that make non-funny comments about your name, your hair, your attitude, how smart you must not be to work a manual job like this, blame you because their 35 cent coupon is expired and then you have a bad attitude for not smiling through the whole thing."

They are also quite flexible when you are sick or need time off. You don't have to feel pressed to do what feels ethically wrong. Management more than often wants the best solution for the customer which makes your job easier. If you don't find the department or the position you are currently in suits you they are supportive to providing you with other opportunities that you may better enjoy. Many folks I worked with over the years were very pleasant people to work with. That always makes the job easier.,"Depending on the department you are in you may be expected to do more work than is possible for one employee to do. They often will revamp a departments hours and expectations without the consideration if it is possible, only with the vision of getting what is 'most efficient'. Those who are higher up in the company often have worked for decades in the company. Although this does provide the benefit of having experience people they are often slow to change or listening to those who actually perform the jobs which run the store."

Do NOT go to work for the company and then apply for upper level management! There are two different interview processes and the internal interview is MUCH harder than the external one. When you go to work for them and have a bachelors, that formal education no longer matters to them. Because at that point, they want to see what you've done for the company and if you do in fact have the ability to perform the tasks that are required to obtain a manger or leader position. That, and playing the politics game  is crucial. It really is all about who you know and not what you know.  A lot of the upper management employees moved up the ladder from the bottom up so I guess they have the mentality that the younger generation has to do the same as well and that just isn't the way it should work."

They can also be hard to get to despite the open door policy. 

Department managers can either be great and knowledgeable and know how to treat employees, but others just terrible and chase away good, moldable talent with micromanaging, office politics, and petty nitpicking.

Department managers may play favorites with certain employees, and develop vendettas against others. 

If you work in Central Checkout, you'd better hope that the department manager is cool and will let you cross-train in another department. It's not unheard of to see them deny such opportunities to employees and/or deliberately sabotage an employee's efforts to either cross-train or transfer to a different department. H-E-B is supposed to let you train in other departments, so it actually goes against company policy for them to do this.
 
You can tell your department what your availability is, but if they need you when you need to be off, you'll find yourself giving away shifts and missing needed income."

It's happened to my coworkers and I a ridiculous number of times and it's honestly frustrating. We're often understaffed and cashiers struggle to manage large orders without a bagger because baggers get thrown on registers or sent outside so they can't. You know. Bag. Management hammers in the importance of raising IPMs so that the store can be given extra hours and schedule more baggers, but cashier speed tends to suffer BECAUSE of how few baggers are scheduled, which forces us to spend more time on each order. And though I've never worked in the other departments, management seems to still be a mixed bag throughout the store – people rave about how efficient and pleasant to work with the cosmetics manager is, for instance, whereas I hear endless complaints about the bakery manager being ill-tempered and making a ton of unnecessary changes to policy. However, I've known people who work at other locations who are not nearly so understaffed or mismanaged and love their managers. It seems to be a bit of a crapshoot depending on which location you apply for. I would recommend talking to employees before applying to a location."

Pay starts off well, holiday pay is nice, and not particularly difficult to get to full time provided that you do your best. Despite the difficulties, you may find the work rewarding and fulfilling. You and your crew will go through hell together, and as a result you will grow to consider them like family.","You might be fooled into thinking that because you're young and fit, that this job will be a cinch for you. You're wrong. It is absolutely brutal work, particularly if anyone on your team calls in, or the truck or low velocity (the second truck) happens to be bigger than the managers predict (all of which will happen almost 100% of the time.) You will never work exactly 8 hours a day. It's either 5 or upwards of 10-11, and there is no inbetween. After time passes, you become more efficient at your job, but there has not been a single day where you will not come home sore or tired. There is some divisiveness between fast workers and everyone else, and unless you're on the receiving end of it, the brow-beating almost seems fair as the team is judged based on an average.

Which is what I am in hopes for. Every day that you step into this facility you are risking your life because of production, nothing any longer is focused on the well being of your employees it's about how much product you can push out on our, ever so weak backs, legs, shoulders etc. I'm sorry it's way more of a risk to work here than it is worth it, you definitely don't make the money that you all say and incentive is a joke when the system bends you over backwards when your at 120.

There used to be a lot more training and time shadowing new partners. Not the case anymore so the already high turnover rate is even higher.

The good employees get taken advantage of because the non-trained dumb employees are useless.

It's hard to move up, easier to move to different departments, but they all usually end up back at the front end.  If you don't have a degree, the front end is where your career goes to die.  You're better off leveraging your current position for one at another company."

I guess I need more words but I honestly can't think of any pros except for ""its a job"".","Where do i start? They overwork everyone that's not management. Every shift I worked up front on the register was 9 hours on average with 2 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch but if it was busy, the shift managers would simply ""forget"" to let me on any sort of break. I would also see at the end of my shift that someone had clocked me in and out of breaks I didn't take. Probably to cover for the fact that they were overworking the staff illegally. 
Management make huge errors and mistakes and then blame and punish the people under them so the higher ups wouldn't see that it was them
There's a lot of competitions for the cashiers or ""promotions"" as they call them where whoever sells the most of whatever is on promotion gets....drumroll please.....NOTHING (except not berated and written up for not selling 50 things of cheap cafe ole coffee bags in one friggin day) the pressure to sell as as cashier made me feel like a pusher and customers would really get aggrivated with the constant attempts aggrivated selling something no one wants
There were also ""bpm"" quotas. Beeps per minute. It means how many things u scan in a minute. The standard was 30 when I worked there which was impossible. That means u have to scan an item a second. Management (who it was also impossible for) would try to teach cashiers how to achieve this which basically consisted of nothing more than just saying ""use both hands and hustle"" or ""after awhile that burning in your shoulders will eventually go away"". You remember i mentioned the shifts were 9 hours on average right? Good. You're keeping up.
The system they have for scheduling is ridiculous amd promotes a nice clean separation of the managers and ""lower people"". In order to ask off or take vacation, or even check to see when u work, you have to log into a computer (one computer) in the break room with no chair and use the 15 minute break when you're lucky to get it to stand at this computer and request time off on your online profile which gets sent to your managers profile who is probably sitting in the breakroom with u but would rather not commnicate with u face to face because they probably dont remember your name anyway. 
When u do ask for needed time off, it's rarely granted. I asked for two days off for an operation. Specified ""major surgery"" as reason. Got message two days after requesting it on my profile that it was denied by my manager. I simply didn't show up the two days I requested off for the surgery and no one even said anything when I returned. 
There's little opportunity to tranfer to other departments or even train in another one despite every department being short staffed which is constantly being complained about by department managers
I won't even go into all the rules they set in place when interacting with customers and by rules I mean lying about products in order to sell. You're treated like you work on commission when you don't. It really puts blocks up that prevent you from truly helping customers. 
HEB is a huge supporter of the Jewish community in texas. They sponsor a lot of Jewish and other multi cultural events, businesses, and charities so the fact that they force jewish employees to say ""merry christmas"" and write them up when they don't is illegal. Just plain illegal and one day they will get sued."

You can make some great relationships with those on your position level, and below. Being able to transfer stores can be an easy process since they are always needing help. 

Pay is good for a high school or college student.","Where do I start...

They don't give you enough hours to support a family, and the only way to get more hours is to pick up shifts on your days off which only gives you one day off a week sometimes. 

The partner discount is the worse I've ever had.. 10%? Really? Sometimes it's only 10 cents off

If you want to get into management you have to know someone in management. There's a lot of politics, and nepotism that goes on behind closed doors. No matter how hard you work, if there's someone on the outside who knows someone they will most likely get the opportunity over you. 

Managers let gossip go around the store, and never put an end to it. 

Upper management doesn't hardly do anything around the store expect pick things off the shelf (cardboard), and sit around in their offices on their phones talking about sports. 

If your in any type of Lead position/assistant you are always micromanaged. 

Upper management doesn't consider your opinions on different types of systems, and new methods to increase sales."

No one in the upper echelon is held accountable for their actions. And, they spend their days sitting on their fat butts, eating popcorn, and drinking cheap coffee.

Not every peer will agree with things, and sometimes people are not willing to work well with others. This isn't the companies fault directly, but there should be a better process for removing those employees. You are on your feet a lot, so if you do not have comfortable shoes then you might be uncomfortable.

6234,H E B,"Good, not great",2016-05-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salary is competitive for the area.  Problem is that the area is lagging behind a bit.  There are some nice side benefits like discounts on groceries, and a free item every couple of weeks. Relaxed dress code - jeans and sneakers allowed with collared shirts. 401k match is okay, but not the best.  New Partner stock helps to supplement.  Altogether, the retirement contribution with the company match and PSP can help to get you where you need to be.","Paid Time Off. 5 holidays off throughout the year...""because it's a retail company."" Partners start off with 2 weeks (10 days) of vacation, 40 hours of sick time, and 3 personal holidays.  It's not terrible, but you don't get an increase until your eighth year, and the lack of given time off around holidays requires the use of the majority of PTO around those events (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, Memorial Day) if you wish to spend a little time with family. Salaried partners are expected to work 50 hours a week.  If you work less, then you're generally expected to use PTO.

Company culture.  I often hear this trumpeted as a positive within the community.  I'm sure it is a positive to the majority of the 80,000 employees, because the focus of the culture is to make the hourly wage earners feel valued (primarily store employees and drivers).  While I don't disagree with their value, I feel that the salaried employees are not valued here.

Systems - each organization has been allowed to procure their own information systems for their respective area.  This approach has created a nightmare scenario for IS and Accounting.  Many of the systems do not communicate with one or another or back to the GL.  The expandability and often maintenance of these systems requires outside consultants or OEM support, which means the many of the needed changes never happen.

Cubicles.  Need I say more.  I know it's the norm, but I hate them so much."

Give part-timers 8.5 hour shifts. Grueling and boring cashiering all day long. No variety of tasks. Grocery hours are long and conflict with family life."

- Flexible hours I guess","- Managers expect too much from you and get nitpicky. They tell you that they expect you to smile 100% of the day and they don't care what you're going through, they say you need to leave your personal problems at home. They'll walk by and be like ""why aren't you smiling?"" literally expecting you to smile nonstop. Some of them are also rude and hate doing their jobs, for example once my computer crashed while I was cashiering so I asked for help and my manager rolled her eyes at me. I also have coworkers who are rude to everyone and somehow haven't lost their jobs yet even though they make the work environment bad for everyone else.
- It gets hard to keep a friendly face on for 9 hours straight of cashiering. Typical tedious customer service job, although at least it pays well."

Within a month or two of ""impressive work,"" my managers regularly made me take care of ""environment"" (ie sweeping the store inside and out). This was no big deal and I was happy to have five or ten minutes to myself every hour - until it became my job to clean the restrooms as well. Custodial work at HEB is a separately paid position and a well paid one at that, but I had no bodily fluids training.

If you work here as a night stocker, you will be doing painstaking physical labor. If you begin to get good at your job, they will cut your hours and spread the pain around more.

Many free on site activities such as health fairs and vendor food fairs. Family oriented, Great work site as you are on the river walk at the HQ. Great company to have under your belt, as HEB is a industry leader. Debt free company.","Employees rarely get promoted for their actual work, but instead it is all about how many 'years' you have with HEB. Company puts years of service over actual talent, and everyone has that mind set. Very difficult to move up as HR has extremely broad requirements on positions, so you think you met the requirements but actually do not. 

Dept is very limited on when you can take vacation as only a few people of the same title can be out at same time, rotating time off every other year  for when you cant take vacation; Christmas eve, new years eve etc. If you even mention that you shop anywhere else like most people do it is very much looked at negatively. 

Once you are in this dept any want to learn about systems or anything that is related (procurement, buying etc) is not allowed. No room to grow unless you plan to be there for 20+ years and become the old person who is an expert at everything. Lower payinig vs industry average. Many people work late every day and go in on weekends as the work load is very intense. If  you do something well, you get rewarded with more work and same pay."

6324,H E B,Cashier,2016-03-12,3.0,Cashier,The new employee stock plan is great because the company contributes and you don't have to spend anything. Insurance coverage is pretty good - the company is implementing new health care centers with lower costs and individual health care people to guide you about questions or needs.,"The company doesn't really promote from within like they used to. If you work in an area for a long time and add value to the department, managers often play favorites and hire the people they know or external people who don't understand the company's culture. The great culture that values it's own people isn't really there any more. People who stay with the company, get their degree and perform well are forced to go to external companies for experience and opportunity. It is too bad, really, because so many of the other benefits are really great."

You may get 40 hours one week and 4 hours the next week, or work mornings for a whole month and then they switch you to working late evenings, and nights. Nothing is set in stone, if you can't keep your schedule open they won't bother putting you on a schedule at all. The department I worked for was often overlooked.

Physical work in cold all year round. Is possible to grow with company.","It is hard to come up with good things to say about working in the RDC wear house. Pay is low ($13 something and Hour). It is incredibly physically demanding. And not in a good way. You will not get built and your strength gains will plateau in a few weeks. And that is because you will never truly get the time to rest. Your days off are spent recovering from the shifts you just finished. The job is driving down aisles with a double pallet jack and picking orders from their assigned spaces. That is simple. But they want you to do extremely fast. WITCH IS IMPOSSIBLY TO BE DONE SAFELY!!!!!! I wore a heart rate monitor for a week just to figure out how may calories i was burning. I was burning close to 6,000 a shift. There is an incentive you can receive every check if you keep your production rate above 95%. The people who are able to do this ""back their pallet jacks into pits"". They also have to clock back in from their breaks early to save them minutes on their overall production rates. Lastly, you must take advantage or screw someone else over for you to come out a head on your production rates. Because at the end of the day it is you against the time and anyone who get in your way is messing up your money. There are very few people who pull off the 120% production rate. pretty much if you drop a pallet most people will help you pick it up if they see you working but your rate is pretty much messed up. You cant make any mistakes on your assignments because they don't give you enough time to begin with. Once again THIS JOB IS VERY UNSAFE!!! There are too many people in the aisles and becomes crowded very quickly. Also they have loaders bringing down pallets in the same aisles as you which I found to very dangerous. I worked there for 6 months and we could only go 2 times over 30 days without someone getting hurt. Most of the time we couldn't get over 20 days. They own your schedule and it rotates every week once you are out of training. Its hard to get off holidays. The turn over rate is high. I pretty much saw someone quit once a week in the muddle of an assessment. I didn't blame them either. Pretty much everyone wanted to walk out but they didn't have any other jobs lined up. Last thing I'm going to say; even if you can do this job well I am almost certain you will still absolutely hate this job. It was not uncommon to see someone ""lose it"" every few hours because the made some simple mistake that was going to cost them money and have to make them work harder to make up for it. I can't believe HEB over looks this problem of its wear house. Makes me ashamed to have witnessed the horrid inter-workings of a good company that so many people/customers have pride for."

I think HEB tells its employees to write these reviews. 

HEB is the most political place I have ever worked.  In order to receive promotions or for your word to be  valued, you have to be well liked.  I personally saw management pick on employees they dislike so much to the point where those employees were unjustly terminated.  All the while, I witnessed the ""favorites"" constantly break policies and these ""favorites"" to date are still employed with the company.   Also, you have to endure a huge amount of emotional and verbal abuse from co-worker, managers, and customers alike.  There is no one for you to turn to.

6491,H E B,Bakery Associate (Closer),2015-11-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good work environment, everyone was pretty friendly. People were willing to help, and you get to interact with a lot of friendly kids. HEB cared about their employees, I was constantly asked how I was feeling, and felt truly cared for. Free turkey, any size given out around the holiday season. Overall I liked it.","At my particular bakery a lot of work would be put on one person. I would close by myself and between all the tasks I had to get done (preparing donuts for the next day, slicing all the bread on the wall) and handling the customers it just felt like there was too much work being placed on one person. And you can't leave until you finish all your tasks for that day...so sometimes you would leave 1 or 2 hours late. It never happened to me...but other people ended up working until midnight. Considering the fact that the bakery closes at 9 that shows there needed to be a better distribution of work."
6492,H E B,driver,2015-11-26,3.0,Driver,"Pros??? The only real Pro is a decent paycheck, and benefits.","Ok here we go. If you are a driver for heb YOU WILL HAVE ZERO WEEKENDS OFF. The current wait to have weekends off schedule is 25 - 30 years. When you first start driving you are called a non bid driver, meaning I do not know what time you are coming to work. For example one day you might come in at 5 p.m. and you'll get off at 6:00 a.m., the next day you may not come in until 11 p.m, or they might give you an 8 hour turnaround in to be back at 2 o'clock p.m. which gives you no home time no family time and no time to rest or eat. Even though you do have two days off, you will work until your day off you only have enough time to reset your hours which is 34 hours. Now on to Dispatch, we have seven different dispatchers and 5 of which are black. If your occasion or Hispanic you will not get a decent truck you will not get decent run you will work up to 65 to 70 hours to make what a black driver will make at 55 hours."

6499,H E B,Definitely one of the best places to work in America!,2015-11-10,5.0,Checker,"I have been with HEB for 3 years, and this has been, by far, my favorite place to work. The people I work with are excellent. New employees are warmly and openly welcomed by ""veterans."" Insurance is affordable with decent coverage for the price, and I love the Valued Partner Perks program, which gives employees 10% off own brand products and allows certain free items every month. The pay is very competitive for the industry, and we get twice yearly raises that are usually pretty generous. But my favorite thing is, despite working in the service industry, I'm proud to say I work for this company. HEB does a lot of charity for its surrounding communities, and the culture of the place is amazing. It's no wonder it was voted among the best places to work in America and our CEO Charles Butt was voted THE best. I feel truly valued by upper management, especially by our unit director, who always greets everyone and never forgets a name or face--whether you've been an employee for two years or two weeks. I find it endearing that HEB refers to its employees as ""partners"" and views us all as a team. When I started here in the fall of 2012 after deciding to take a year off of college, to be completely honest, I was embarrassed to be working as a checker and didn't think I'd want to stick around longer than 6 months.  Here it is 2015, I'm going back to school for my BBA in accounting, and I'm considering applying for upper level positions--either in the corporate sector or as a top store leader--after graduation. You'll find this theme resonates a lot with HEB. What is supposed to be a temporary job after high school or in between college semesters turns into something bigger.","The cons are the same with any job in which you work with the general public. Dealing with unreasonable and irate customers, working during the extremely hectic holiday season. HEB hires at 16, so sometimes you have to deal with lazy teenagers who just want to goof off and not work. Granted, these bad seeds are usually weeded out pretty quickly. Last but not least, full-time can be difficult to come by. I know a couple of partners who had to be with the company 5+ years before a full-time position fell into their lap. I am typically scheduled between 24-30 hours per week, but because HEB allows people who work on the front end to post shifts that they can't or don't want to work, it's usually not a problem for me to pick up a couple of extra shifts to get to 40 hours. Otherwise, I have no issues."
6500,H E B,Great company,2015-11-09,5.0,Cashier,"When I began working, cashier's only made $9.50. Now, they make $10.25 which is awesome (not so much for me)!

They constantly keep hiring which leaves the rest of us with little to no hours of work. They constantly ask us to open up our availability which most times cannot be done becuase of school etc. They are horrible with making sure there are enough baggers on any given day, they do play favorites and do not treat us well. I wish we would get a new set of managers. Honestly the only bad thing about working front end at this Heb is the managers. There are 2 managers from my HEB thay are wonderful the rest horrible with their attitude towards us or just how they handle any situation. They often forget to give us our 1 break in a 4hr or 1 of our breaks in an 8hr, lunches will be given late almost when it's time to clock out. They are just horrible. They hold grudges if you cannot come in when you are ""needed"". If we have a family member who is not immediate family i.e mom or dad or sibling we cannot take off for an emergency. Horrible with scheduling OUTSIDE of our availability and we get punished for having to come in."

I didn't in fact get a job until I was 19, and I had applied at least 6 - 7 times over the years (you can only apply once every few months). Yes I wanted to work there that bad. I knew if I was going to work part-time, I wanted an environment that is open, clean and friendly. And it was. 
 
I had never had a job before, but working with the staff (mostly younger students and teens) and helping costumers was rarely unpleasant. There is no sales pressure from management, and giving costumer's your opinion and information is your own honest opinion. You can always request to do another activity or job (unless we are slammed) if you are tired of say checking, or pushing carts - which keeps you fresh and more energetic. Once you work at HEB you can change departments and jobs relatively easily (as long as they are at about the same skill level). I have worked in produce, front-end, deli, and have even done odd-ball jobs, like build shelving in receiving or power wash the sidewalk. It all helps to keep the job fresh and fun.

They are good with sticking to the schedule you give them, and with requesting leave of absences. You can call in a limited number of times per year and they do not question why you can't come in that day. There are few things that would make you be terminated on the spot and they try their best at helping you get better at your job rather than just fire you.","It is difficult to move up the ladder. Manager's are chosen through having a good relation with the CCOM (central checkout operations manager - the top manager of the front-end). But that is true with every store.

I have been ""randomly"" drug-tested multiple times during my employment, which requires you to have to drive to a clinic to pee in a cup. I've talked to my co-workers and most have never been drug tested. If you refuse to go you are termed right there. You don't get mileage for driving to the clinic."

She managed to run off most everyone but a couple of co-workers by her actions. When I reported her to the store manager, he just said, ""Oh, she's doing it again."" Shrugged and told me to basically suck it up. I asked to transfer to another department, but I was told there were no openings anywhere else. Ok, but I saw new people were getting hired all the time. Because of her, it was a daily struggle to go to work each day. Morale was very low in our area. If you didn't go along with her and talk about EVERYONE, even customers, she was out to get you. I didn't let her make me leave, but because of her, I was fired. I was very disappointed, because I loved my job and was good at it. She is still working there and I just don't understand.

Also if you're a guy all the dirty work gets completely handed to you, and that's not an exaggeration. Sarcastic micromanagement.

If you want to get anywhere ahead you need to prepare to suck up and suck up often. HEB loves promoting its in company Management schools and programs such as SORM. 'School of retail management'. If you want to become a department manager, get in, bag some groceries, suck up, push some baskets in 90-100 degree Texas weather, suck up some more, then apply and cross your fingers. If you wish to get into the SORL 'for retail leadership' you should go in with out any actual history with the company. I've heard all to many scenarios of managers with degrees in business who've worked for the company for decades who can't get accepted to be a store leader. HEB prefers to hire outside of the company, young inexperienced 20 something's fresh out college with the ink still drying on their resume. They can mold them better to make cut throat decisions, rather then have someone in charge who's actually done the work and knows how's it done. I work here to get through college and that's about it. Retail is not in my desired career field and HEB Is definitely not my future.

*Several people at my H E B had been working for the company for over a decade, so the job has good security.
*Unlike at another retail store I worked at, I never felt like I was cheating anyone through my work.","*Communication between employees is very poor. At least at my level, it felt like we were drones and not part of a team (despite them telling us that team building was an important part of the job). I learned after working there for a year to just avoid talking to employees all together.
*Too much favoritism/politics among employees.
*Very difficult to get overtime. Basically the only time is during holidays. Even on one of these, I was sent home early.

6917,H E B,My first job but definitely hard to beat.,2015-03-25,5.0,Grocery Stocker,"- Work Environment:
   I love working at HEB. Even though I work in a high volume HEB store (constant work; a lot of customers), I love it because it keeps me busy and energetic. 
- Cleanliness:
   Although this might sound biased, I consider most HEB's (at least all that I have seen) to be cleaner and more welcoming than most grocery stores like Walmart, Kroger, etc.
- Work:
   I work in the grocery department and although it may be too much work for some, I feel like it has a fair work-weight in order to keep improving as a company. Keeps you active, develops mental sharpness and you interact with customers to a fair minimum. 
- Management:
   Very easy to come forth and talk about anything. Management has always been willing to help their partners. But beware, if you are lazy during working hours and lack honesty and consideration for the store, dont expect them to pretend not to know about it. They will let you know if you are doing wrong and in what areas you can improve.

- Benefits:
   Awesome healthcare plans for such a cheap monthly cost! Absolutely great!
   401K
   Many other benefits that I cant seem to remember but they are all available to see at their website.","- Professionalism:
   In my department there are 5 employees. If one decides to call in or take a vacation, we are screwed because the managers do not have a backup employee that could work the department efficiently and even when the employees request off days with a decent amount of time before such date, management procrastinates to search for a replacement. Consequences? The whole department will crumble to pieces (figuratively speaking). Lack of products on the shelf, disorganization on the isles, sales drop, etc. The problem does not end there. Sometimes it takes days before the department falls back into place, and believe me, its like going through hell to get the department back in shape especially in a high volume store like the one I work in."

Older people are and have always been been discriminated against regarding job variety and being chosen for partner of the month or specialty jobs even though the requirements have been met.

6954,H E B,A self-promote company which leaves too many hard-working partners behind.,2015-03-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you're extroverted, this place can work well for you. They want partners who are driven, ready to meet the challenges of a fast-paced and unpredictable work environment. Diversity is embraced here. There are some truly great people working for this company, and if you're in the right store, you will find plenty of help to get you where you want to be if you're passionate about your job.","If you're introverted, you better find a way to innovate and call attention to your work, or you will be overlooked. Store leadership spends more time communicating with management instead of sharing their vision with Partners. Managers are pushed hard by store leadership for results and profit but are given the freedom to achieve these goals in whatever way works for them.

Not all managers attain these goals scrupulously, though. Some will intimidate you, cut your hours if you're part-time, or work you full-time hours without promoting you to full-time. Some will overlook your 15-minute breaks or at least sneer at you if you decide to actually take them. And others will push you hard for production, and insult you for any human error that you make. If you have a manager like this, but he or she is bringing in the results that the Unit Director wants, then no one will be too concerned if you complain about it.

Store leadership can be detached (maybe oblivious). Some don't understand the process of the work environment - the everyday struggles Partners face. Some don't know how to show appreciation for hard work - maybe they just don't know anything about hard work. Others simply don't care and only go to managers to gain any insight on what is going on in any given department. It takes more than a handshake, charm, and small talk to know a Partner. Not every store is like this, but My H-E-B is."
6955,H E B,Stuck,2015-03-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked full time for HEB for 5+ years. I received my degree while working for them and have worked in several departments as well as in different stores. I've met countless people and developed long standing friendships and professional relationships because of my time with HEB. During my college years, this company worked with my school schedule and I gained a better understanding of how a business is meant to be run from different department point of views. I am very thankful for those things because I was always unsure of what I wanted to do in life and now I have clarity in regards to my future...however...","When it comes to wanting to grow with this company, I have never been met with so many closed doors. For a company that says they stand by their Partners and their growth, I am now facing my hours being cut in my department because HEB has gone with a more ""efficient"" business model. Don't get me wrong, I have talked to my store leaders about using my degree and going the corporate route. I have been to several interviews for temp jobs and internships, but have been told I ""lack experience"" and thats after repeatedly calling and emailing recruiters for feedback. After working for several years with HEB, I'd hardly call it lack of experience but actually lack of clout as I see more and more external hires roll in than promotions from within. So as I inferred before, I have never felt so shunned by this company and now I am about to take a million steps back instead of going forward. Clearly, no one asked me if HEB was the best place to work, because I would have surely said not if you want to grow your career here."

They're always interested in any ideas and will forward them to the appropriate department for consideration and also will reward those employees if their ideas are implemented.
Every day or night I walk-in to the store to work, everybody is smiling and happy!  Our customer service quality is a huge deal, which is something I really push for with my subordinates and something I stress on ""Day 1"" of a new employee's training.  If there is a break-down in customer service quality, it is immediately addressed, dealt-with and corrected.
Despite the challenges, it's one job I can honestly say I enjoy!  I look-forward to continuing to pursue my career with this outstanding company!","The turnover rate in the grocery department is always high, as with any grocery company, but the high starting pay for overnight grocery employees with H-E-B (currently $10.50/hour) does reduce that rate because no other grocery store company I've worked for in the past (Kroger, Albertson's, Walmart) come close to that starting hourly pay.  As it is with any grocery company, training new hires, especially multiple at the same time, can be frustrating and stressful as work efficiency will suffer until the new hires are proficient-enough to begin ""carrying their weight"" on their own with less supervision."

Overall, this was my first job and it was great. I would still be working there right now if I didn't relocate to a new area that HEB does not operate in. Many days were enjoyable and fun and my co-workers and supervisors made it even better. The culture of my store was fairly laid-back except during peak hours and busy days. Everyone understood that was the time to get down to business and work to make sure our customers got what they wanted and were satisfied throughout. Outside of the regular job, HEB had many events that you could volunteer for and they were great from what I personally experienced and what I heard from others.

-Some customers are not in the best of moods and can slow down your workflow

Most of my time spent working at HEB, I had a great time.

Leave,"" which means that they will keep you in the work system, and when you come back for Winter Break, Spring Break, or the summer, you can continue to work at H-E-B.","Sometimes the people that you meet and greet while working are unfriendly and impatience, and they get mad at you for some unreasonable things that you cannot control. Just like any other workplace, you will always have those bad customers. But you still have to hold true to the value of the workplace that reads, ""The customer is always right,"" even if you completely disagree with that statement. If you work during the school year, H-E-B is pretty lenient when it comes to scheduling."

The break room was nice and cool and the boss always put out the expired baked goods for us to munch on before they went to the dump.,"Pay sucked but nothing out of the ordinary for a cashier/grocer bagger. They have favorites and give them the best break times, or don't make them go outside to collect stranded grocery carts during the hottest time of the day."

With HEB cutting day time hours and moving to a completely overnight system, mor and more gets piled on to us, and its not fair. Management refuses to hire more people and refuses to fire any slackers so that they can get better bonus checks off of killing us. Some nights were staffed as low as 50% of req. Work force so the hours look good on paper and then upper management rips us apart for being there too late. This company is getting real shady, and they will soon be Texas Walmart."
