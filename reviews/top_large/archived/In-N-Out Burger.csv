so many opportunities for growth and expansion

community and connection - having a family at work 

good intentions

when you find a manager who's in their heart and truly embodies what the company is about, WOO! everything changes - that manager will love you, lift you, and walk with you as you soar to new heights every day. That manager will challenge you and help you grow - that manager will make it all worth being there for because you will feel wanted, seen, valued, and loved :)

free burger and fries!! omg the fries are soooo goood!


you will learn so much about business, yourself, relationships, and your path!","not paid nearly enough for the emotional, physical, spiritual, and mental labor. we lose amazing associates because the pay is too low for the reality of the work. usually there are 1-5 toxic people in a store, often in leadership roles, and the ways they disempower others goes unchecked often. bullying and is a real problem in the stores - it's often very subtle and goes unnoticed. taking out emotions on associates is also normalized by leadership. harmful ways of communicating and relating goes without consequence, creating uncomfortable environments, especially for empathic people 

this is not for all the stores. there are definitely leaders in the company who model the company's true values and these people are so compassionate, they protect the space, and they recognize and value others."

- corporate are literally sweethearts. some of the nicest ppl you’ll ever meet. people who truly have a passion for ino and it’s history.","- your shift is based on business. if you’re full time and are scheduled to be off at 8pm during a rush, you will likely stay until it slows down again whenever that may be.
- I think we pay the tax on our break burgers but it’s small
- the scheduling is rough, especially full time. I don’t know my schedule until a week and a half ahead of time. it makes it hard to plan things outside of work."

293,In-N-Out Burger,Working in HR  in Corporate,2022-01-09,1.0,Human Resources,"Coworkers are nice and helpful.

You get a free meal when you work Monday through Friday.

The people at the stores are nice. 

Other departments are helpful. 

Everyone values customer service.","For working in a corporate office setting:

The different HR groups don’t work with each other and everyone has a lane. It’s hard for people to learn about HR as a whole. For example, recruiters don’t work with benefits or HR partners, and HR generalists don’t work with learning and development. 

Most of the team members are part of a call center system where you have to drop your work to help the person on the phone. Even if you are salary, if you are not a leader you have to do this. 

They only give corporate employees 4 holidays per year and two weeks of vacation if you are there from 1-5years. Other companies start you at 3 weeks and give you at least 8 holidays. 

If you prefer flexible scheduling or working from home this isn’t the job for you. Leadership made it clear that they don’t allow office employees to work from home unless it’s required by some sort of mandate. Office employees were told that they are not a culture fit if they want to work from home or if they want a hybrid schedule.

The pay is not ‘competitive’. Other companies pay anywhere from 10k to 30k more for the same role with similar experience. 

The workload is too much. If you are hourly you are not allowed to work much overtime so you feel like you can’t catch up. If you are salary, then you will probably work an extra 1-2 hours each day and 2-5 hours on your off days to catch up. 

If you are salary they still expect you to be at the office between 5pm and 6pm depending on your position and there is no flexibility to leave early unless you get it approved by your boss. For example if you are salary you will not be allowed to leave at 4pm more than twice a week to pick up your kids from school/activities."

I began making $13.25 an hour, and in the course of 3 years, I left making $16.75... So the compensate you very well. And you get paid for holidays and a free burger whenever you work.","I think the cons outweigh the pros... They're very strict about makeup, YOUR UNIFORM STAYING CLEAN (which can be very hard since you're working with food), alot of the times they run of uniform shirts, whivh typically I'm a small in women, but you'd catch me wearing a men's XXL... and you only take 10 min breaks which are TIMED by a massive tv in the kitchen so the can keep tabs on you, which sucks because you work 6 hrs at most and that's the only break you'd get... and there you are rushing to eat. Oh and its very stressful being forced to smile when the managers would yell out ""SMILE CHECK""! Mentally unhealthy... and they live by ""The customer is ALWAYS right"" saying, so just know they'll never side with you no matter how ridiculous the situation can be.

1843,In-N-Out Burger,Okay starter job,2019-02-26,2.0,Store Associate,"- flexible schedule 
- coworker","- Over worked : the reason why the pay is “ average “  is because they work you for every penny. Most of the times I was working a station by myself that should have 3 people. 12 / hr might seem good as a starter but when your basically doing 3 jobs at a time, it’s not worth it.
- Stress : managers tend to be little you if you can’t live up to their unrealistic expectations of doing 3+ tasks at the same time in a small time frame
- Worked around great coworkers but was barely allowed to socialize due to always having to be kept busy even if that meant recleaning the walls
- leveling up was annoying due to them just throwing you on to something new without half decent training and getting upset when you’re not able to do it properly
- As a teen I would recommend a job like Starbucks but if you had to then go with in n out. Once you turn 18, QUIT. There are so many more high paying jobs that don’t make you work to the bone and offer a much better pay.
- once you start working here for more that 6 months you’ll feel stuck, remind yourself there is way better opportunities once your 18."

You get vacation hours, sick hours and profit sharing 401K plan. The best part is that you become pretty close with everyone you work with and everyone hangs out with each other from your own store and other stores in the area.","There is not consistent pay across all stores. For example a level 6 (cook) gets paid 15 an hour at most stores, however in the Mill Valley and Milpitas location level 1 (cashier) start at 16 an hour.  Another Con is you will lose a normal sleep schedule as a normal week will consist of a couple day shifts (mids) and a couple closing shifts.

1987,In-N-Out Burger,Fun and Flexible,2018-06-20,4.0,Store Associate,"Working for In N Out is extremely rewarding. The company has high expectations, which causes the vast majority of store associates to rise to the levels expected of them. 

Everyone starts at a level one, but you are always working on getting your promotion to the next level. There 7 levels before management, and they only promote from within. 

The pay is excellent for a part time job. Associates start at $12.50, and you get a small raise every time you get to a new level. After two years, at a level 4, I was making $14.25 an hour. 

Everyone there helps one another. This is no teamwork makes dream work environment. Each person is expected to perform their individual duties well, and you will be called out when you don’t rise to their expectations. However, everyone knows that the more effectively they collaborate and communicate, the better the store does at meeting customer needs. 

Never had an major issues with other employees. It was a fun, light hearted, and engaging work environment. 

Free burger every shift!

Flexible with hours and scheduling.","You will spend a LOT of time on your feet. For every 6 hrs, you get a 10 min break.
If you’re lucky to work an 8, you’ll get an hour break. 

If you are not full time or a higher level or favored by management, you’ll never work more than a 6 hour shift. 

Depending on the store, you have to fight and use your voice to train for the next level. Only a few stores will start that process for you. 

If your store becomes over staffed, you’ll hardly every work."

They tend to hire high schoolers so if you are working here in your 20's or 30's be prepared to feel old. The schedule is pretty crazy. If you work night shifts you won't sleep well- some days you will wake up panic stricken and worried thinking you are still at work. For the amount you would be making it isn't really worth the negatives.

2235,In-N-Out Burger,The best company I ever worked for.  Hands down.,2017-07-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"INO is one of the few companies that genuinely puts their money where their mouth is.  They genuinely show concern for their Associates, and are extraordinarily generous and reward performance accordingly.  The environment is fun, and the pay and working conditions are wonderful.  The work is hard and physically fast-paced, but that makes it enjoyable and each day is different.

If you work in Corporate, same goes.  Extremely transparent working climate, generous pay, fair work environment and you feel cared for.  Show loyalty and commitment, and you get it back.  Talented people working here, committed to the vision.  Lots of loyalty to the company.  Good opportunity to move up, particularly if you have a degree.  If not, the opportunities can come a little more slowly.  But they're generally still there.","Being a Store Manager can be extraordinarily demanding, requiring strong time management, priorities, and leadership.  It may feel almost impossible to stay on top of everything. So you have to be on your game.

In exchange for achieving the desired results, the company rewards you handsomely.  So it's not really a ""con"", more like if you want the benefits, work hard and smart for them.  If you do, you can make lots of money and will have a company who has your back.

Given that the job is demanding, the work/life balance can be difficult.  Having said that, it's on you to make that work.  If you're disorganized or inconsistent in your performance, you'll have to put in more time because of your weakness.  In that case it may feel like you can't win or they expect too much.  But if you are on your game, it's manageable and very lucrative.  It's a job that rewards you if you perform.  

Like any company, the bigger they get, the more corporate they get.  Unavoidable, so not really a ""con"".  Just a fact."

Pay raises as often as every couple of months (frequency of raises depends on how much effort you put in and how much training they give you)

""Ladder climbing"" (you get a raise every time you ""level up"" and can get into management fairly quickly if you work hard)","Training (depending on your managers and your store's location, training can be very hard to get and almost never consistent, even if you work hard and put in the time and effort. It's easy to get stuck at levels 3-5 because training is hard to get)

Manager turn-over (managers get promoted fairly quickly and every time they move up, they change stores, so you can have a dozen different managers come and go throughout the year making it hard to bond in some cases)

Smelly! (If you don't enjoy smelling like onions and spread/ketchup/mustard, this is not the job for you (:  )

Lots of incentives to do your best",They have a level system which works very odd because it forces you to work against your coworkers to gain higher level/rank. It's very stressful and demanding work because they expect you to be perfect-- if you're not management will rain down on you. The customers are probably the worst part of the job because they are some of the most entitled people as they expect completely perfect service every time and if something is not to their liking they will throw tantrums. I felt discriminated against because only men were allowed to do certain tasks and men were allowed to wear revealing clothing such as muscle shirts while girls were penalized for wearing spaghetti straps (I am referring to the almost monthly staff meetings where we were allowed to wear casual dress).

-getting to interacting with customers and hopefully make their day is awesome! 
-some managers are really cool and neutral.","-FAVORITISM 
-I would really rather move up because of hard work and not kissing butt.
-higher levels are really rude to lower levels. 
-poor training process. On several occasions I've felt stupid for not knowing something I was never taught. -If you're not a manager favorite they will not let you learn train in new positions.
-if you're not a favorite, you're easily forgotten and tossed to the side.  
-no one takes the time to train you even when you ask and even when it's not busy.
-sometimes the stress is overwhelming. There are really bad days when a lot will go wrong and frustrate you. Impatient managers do not help. 
-when you do something wrong sometimes it's humiliating when it really shouldn't be. 
-the managers are not supportive/encouraging and get mad at the weirdest/stupidest things. I was once taken out of a position because I didn't have my button in the right place on my shirt. 
-managers can be really mean. I was once actually called a hot mess because I made a mistake, became frustrated and cried. I found this completely inappropriate. 
-little to no recognition for hard work when you're not a favorite. 
I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting. 

Honestly it really all just depends on you and the store you work for. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't. I know some people ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I had a pretty bad experience. I'd recommend trying it out because of the awesome benefits and the skills you acquire."

2423,In-N-Out Burger,Best company to work for,2016-10-16,5.0,,"This company really pushes you to grow to be a great person in your community and to grow as an employee. They help you gain skills and develop a positive work ethic you will use for the rest of your life. I was part time and worked 30-36 hours a weeks and the pay was very fair for the work they wanted in return. You start at 11 and after some time elapses, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year ect; you are given raises if you learn a new position. They praise you and coach you through development unique to you and you are given opportunities to go above and beyond. This is a very rewarding company to work for and it will feel like your second family in no time. I strongly suggest this company if your want to build onto your personal skill set but i do not recommend staying for more than 1 and a half years. The plus side of them really valuing you as an employee is that you will realize your potential and want to do better for yourself. I suggest striving to be your best because it will be recognized and appreciated but if you don't you will feel the retaliation from you fellow employees and management. Personally my store did an outstanding job with communication and staying on top of things and my store manager is was probably the best you can possibly have. Most of the managers are very understanding, and bring a sense of family to work and its very motivating.","It can be rigorous and mentally draining since you are doing the same thing over and over an over again, every thirty seconds, for six hours, six days a week. After two years I got really tired of this and I felt as if the content push for perfection was too much. Not to mention you are pushed to connect with customers and be service oriented but its very hard to feel a human connection with people who enjoy the food if you feel like a robot instead."

The wide range of shift helped me with my college school schedule. My managers were pretty good to work with when in came to school. Every few months, if there were no injuries, we would receive safety day gifts in the form on in n out merchandise or gift cards. Also, there are store goals every year and if your store makes the goal, you can earn opportunities to go to places like Disneyland or Knotts for free.","Expect to work weekends and holidays (except for Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas). Every other holiday is a working holiday and sometimes getting those days off for family vacations or events can sometimes be hard (ex. Labor Day, Memorial Day, MLK Day.. etc). Sometimes if you have closing shift, you will get off anywhere form 2am-2:30am. Also if work is slow, they may ask you to clock out so hours aren't guaranteed. You get paid good but you definitely work hard for your money. Don't expect to be standing around, you have to hustle or you won't do well at this job. Also, if you're a guy, by default you end up doing most of the grunt work. In example, taking out the trash, peeling potatoes and cleaning the grills. Due to this, sometimes it is harder for guys to be promoted to different higher associate levels (more pay) because their opportunities for training on new positions/levels are at times less convenient when they're  needed for those grunt tasks."

There is plenty of room for advancement.,"Opportunities are only part-time but you must be available for any shift at any time which makes working a second job to make ends meet difficult.  Also, the interview process is very challenging.  I had to come for three separate interviews.  I arrived prior to my scheduled appointment time and still waited 40 minutes to over an hour for each interview to begin.  Any company who expects their employees to be punctual to work really needs to practice what they preach."

The people get way to personal with you. People get more training time based off of personal friendship with manager to get more promotions, if you try and excel and take on new positions they laugh at you for wanting to try and put you down. The environment gets very hostile during rushes, and everyone is so stressed out you can't say a word without getting yelled at by 3 different people at once. Yelling is in n outs favorite thing to do to its employees, I have been told talking wasn't aloud in the work place while working because I'm not getting paid to talk and work I'm getting paid just to work.

I would constantly be sent home an hour or sometimes two hours early just to allow someone else to work. The pay is good but in no way worth it. One shift manger in particular was absolutely awful.

Management almost never says ""Thank you"",  ""Please"",  ""Goodjob"" etc and will ALWAYS point out what they ""Would prefer you to do"". Always finding the bad out of something you do and can be really frustrating never hearing a ""Goodjob, you did that fast!"". Anytime you get a ""Goodjob"", it is followed by a ""But can you do this instead of that because blah blah blah"" and 90% of the time you get the 2nd part without the ""Goodjob""."

Free meals every shift and the food is delicious and real.  Atmosphere can be fun and energetic, and customers are usually pretty polite.  Managers can make the job less stressful. These are times when the job is fun.","Workload and stress levels are fairly high, especially as the employee earns higher levels.   Most of the uniform is not provided, and must be paid for and kept exceptionally clean, which is difficult given the messy nature of the food service industry.  Depending on manager, you will be treated well or poorly.  Hours can be high and poor even when requested otherwise for school.  The standards are set subjectively high - one manager's highest priorities will be another's lesser ones, which leads to confusing demands.  Satisfaction with the job is extremely dependent on lower level management and employee treatment."

I loved working here for the first year or so until I went up in levels. With each level you go up, upper management and those around you get more and more catty and treat you badly. They expect you to eat, breath, and sleep in-n-out. One stipulation when you become full time is that even on your days off you need to be available to come in if someone calls in sick! When you're already working a ton of hours a week and 10 days in a row you're looking forward to that one day you have off, and then you may not get it! If you have good managers things are pretty great, but managers get switched around all the time so you'll eventually be stuck with someone awful, which makes working awful. Plus you will smell like onions no matter how many showers you take. Politics are a big part of this position and of your immediate supervisors don't like you, expect those that they favor to move up before you even if you're a better worker. Plus the rules are RIDICULOUSLY strict. Come on people, it's fast food!"

3. The people: some of my closest friends in life were my coworkers at In-N-Out.

4. Amazing experience for future career paths: I worked at In-N-Out to pay for college, but years later, I'm still applying the tenets of this company to my professional life. My experience with concepts like high-quality product, service with a smile and rigid work ethic have translated to professional career opportunities since. 

5. Quality, Friendliness & Cleanliness: These aren't just words that they put on the lap mats and tray liners; they're company doctrine. I will ALWAYS feel comfortable going to In-N-Out to eat. You always hear disgusting horror stories from restaurants about sanitation and health violations, but not here. After five years behind the lines, I have more confidence in this company's food handling and facility cleanliness practices and procedures than any other company in the world. Seriously.","1. Repetitive motion & posture issues: I'm 6'4"" so I had to hunch over to cook French fries 20hrs/week for 5 years.

Sure the starting salary is above minimum wage, but keep in mind that's a low standard. 

Once you're an Assistant (2nd) or store manager, you're making good money. Also, if you can get on the travel team, you work long hours and make good money while having little time to spend it. 

By far the best experience was traveling on the all-star team. It was fun, fast-paced and you typically were given more responsibility while there. 

Plenty of women are promoted, though this can be a con (see below)","Too many, but here's a basic list:

1. Was sent by the company to another location for 2 months. My medical care benefits package was sent to my home store so I didn't receive them until WEEKS after the deadline to enroll.... you guessed it, HR would not let me enroll even after my store manager called and told them it was his fault. Nope. So I went without medical insurance when I really needed it for a year. 

2. closed minded management: We often opened earlier than our official sign so customers would walk up early but then walk away even though we were opened. I proposed an 'Open' sign... something very simple, yet the idea was rejected, only to be picked up by the new manager shortly after i left. very small problem but we were losing about $200+ in sales every week. 

3. Sexual harassment and apathy. I complained many times about many issues. it was ignored. 

4. Caught a manager with prior problems such as partying with associates (big NO)  with weed INSIDE the store, nothing happened. 

5. the actual sexism in the particular district I was in for a short time. Women were promoted and the men were treated as inferior 

6. ridiculous write ups.  Never had problems with any managers but one manager decided to write me up for something that was not against policy after agreeing to something with me. sorry it's vague but can't give any more details 

6. Numbers over customer service. lower level managers typically work the night shift. Have you ever been at a store around 9-11pm and the service is super slow? The lower level managers have to make their labor marks and without question will always let people off work. It's bad enough that people are tired of it, but not bad enough to call customer service. 
It was bad when I worked there and it's terrible now even recently. 

7. Family/social life: I estimate that about 80% or more of my store and district managers all cheated on their spouses with someone at the company at some point. The hours are really rough. It's not bad if all your friends work at INNOUT but it was nearly impossible to have a social life outside of your innout friends once you reached a certain age. for kids, it's ok. 

8. Once during a management meeting I had a high level executive comment on how he admired McDonald's fries for their consistency... never mind the fact that we were serving fresh fries and McD's serves fries with TONS of chemicals in it. I mentioned it during the meeting, and he looked dumbfounded... this is a guy making $xxx,xxx a year too"

I think associates should get paid more or be able to receive bonuses if they excel.  I worked way too hard for years and never got rewarded except for a small paycheck.  I do think I was at the wrong store at the time with awful managers that took advantage of me.  Now I'm at a new store and I refuse to work that hard.  It's not worth it to me and I don't ever want to feel that unappreciated again.
I am slightly bitter at the company for my bad experience at my first store.  I believe the store manager should of been fired a lot time ago for treating people the way she does. 
Putting a complaint into HR makes no difference since its IN N Out's HR.  Some associated did call HR and nothing happened.  She's still working for the company and actually is at a busier store now making more money.  Maybe she's changed but I highly doubt it."

I thought working at In N Out would be fun, exciting and a great learning experience. It isn't. Working at In N Out is like being in high school all over again. Managers have favorites, higher up levels are snobby and will pick on you for the smallest mistakes. When you're first starting to learn order taking and you get tiny mistakes wrong, you'll get called back every time for a chat about what you're doing wrong, and they'll make you feel like crap. If you don't bleed In N Out, you're not considered a priority associate, even if you do work hard. Everyone is fake. There are the people who are die hard In N Out associates that kiss up to managers, and those who work hard, but can't move up because they're not on the managers' favorite list. In my year of working there, I never once got off in time. They never follow the schedules. Managers also love to play the guilt card and persuade you to work longer hours because they either want to go home, or they let someone off too early and now you have to pay the price. Managers are jokes. They're basically just higher paid associates with a lack of understanding about business. They also get switched around stores a lot which makes it very hard to get comfortable with a manager you like. Moving up levels at In N Out is easy if you want to give up your life. If you're not working at least 5 days a week, you're nothing important. It's also hard to work 5 days a week to begin with because they hire SO MANY PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. In N Out never stops hiring. I was lucky I was in the first hire group of last year, and started off with 4 days a week. But with all the new hires, I got to 1 day a week and basically had to beg others to let me cover their shifts. Bottom line is: This place sucks.

2716,In-N-Out Burger,Great place!,2015-06-29,5.0,Associate,"I don't have any prior jobs to compare this to as its my first job but I truly like it. The people in the business are actually really sweet and friendly and the company genuinely seems to care about the employees. (which I was told prior to my first real day and I was like ""lol yeah okay that's a load of bologna you guys probably care more about the money"" but I was actually somewhat shocked when they proved true to their word. I mean, I'm sure they care about the money but they also care about the costumer AND the employee. Something not a lot of places seem to.) The pay is amazing and the managers are really accommodating to employees schedules- a lot of us are juggling classes and even other jobs and they're more than willing to work with us with our schedules (there are a few coworkers I know of who are never scheduled to work on Sunday's because of Church and what not; again, something not a lot of places would do) and I always feel like I can talk to my managers about something without fear. It's also a really positive environment to work in and it's almost like a tight knit family; I actually trust each person I work with. I could go on and on about the pros of working for In-N-Out but then I'd never stop typing. Basically, great company, wonderful people, and I'm honestly so lucky and grateful that I'm able to be a part of this company.","I think that there's this misconception that working in the fast food industry is incredibly easy which isn't the case-especially at In-N-Out. There's always, ALWAYS something to do so you're constantly on the move (the first few days were a killer on my feet I'm not even joking). You have to maintain a quick pace, as it's almost like a machine; if one person falls behind on their job, it could slow the whole system down. Sometimes you'll have nothing to do and then other times, you'll be so swamped with orders that you're going nonstop for HOURS (I'm not even exaggerating, I just got off my shift and the drive through was packed for over three hours). Also-and this doesn't happen a lot- but you'll get a rude costumer every now and then, so if you can't be patient and kind, then I wouldn't apply to In-N-Out. Honestly, patience and kindness are two very important qualities needed for this job as you're going to need to practice it...a lot. Honestly, there really aren't a lot of cons though. Like I said, it's a pretty good company."

The fact that they pay a high entry level wage compared to other similar jobs is definitely a big plus while attending college. The work environment is very friendly and management is very understanding of each individual's circumstances. My manager is very comprehensive of my class schedule, which is really important. You need no experience as long as you have the desired attitude, which is a pro over many restaurant jobs, where the decent paying ones usually require prior work in the field. It is easy to move up as long as you learn quickly.","It is very fast paced in general, and sometimes painfully so during extremely busy days, which happen often. This is mainly due to the fact that it is the only In n Out in the city (SF) and that it is not a particularly big store. You are not allowed to receive tips, which means that although the starting wage is high, the monetary advantage over being waiter can disappear over time. At least at the SF store, there are a lot of things to deal with which might not be pleasant regarding homeless people and customers with bad attitude."

This might seem good but it puts people in management that have no business being there.  The level of favoritism that happens there is ridiculous.  The favorites get moved into management, the employees resent them because they see how it works, and then they hate them because they become horrible managers.  The cycle goes on.

2792,In-N-Out Burger,"Great Company, Great Mission Statement and Values, Takes care of the Customer AND the Employee",2015-02-19,4.0,Level 6 Employee,"Most managers can be flexible and are understanding of schedules. This was a great job to have while going to school. My fiancé is a manager and it's also a great full time job and career to pursue. There is definitely good money involved. You work hard, it's fast paced, there's training constantly, great employee benefits, pay in general is pretty good, it can be a fun environment, vacation hours are good, the mini parties and activities that the company offers are great. 
Overall, a great company to work for and the policies they have are in a place. It is really a lifestyle choice to work there because the policies are so strict.","You work your butt off and sometimes the association that your around (the younger kids) don't really understand everything. It is extremely hard on the body. 
Although the pay is good, if you are working there long term and say you don't want to go into management, your pretty much at a freeze in pay with no where to go. Example, I've been there 5 years, but if someone who's been there 2 years gets to the same level as me, they'll be making the exact same. It's like a union. 
There can be a lot of policies to follow, which I find to actually be a pro for the most part. 
Some managers are very power hungry and they know that some employees depend on their income and they take advantage of that. The frustrating part is when they are very ""clever"" about it and they get the company to support them in their motives. 
Customers at time can rule your life. You can do everything right, but a customer that has one bad view can kill a career. Love the customers, they're why In-N-Out thrives, but some of them are very... not understanding."

The company puts on several events for associates a year, 2 days of holiday pay, some medical benefits, profit sharing, and even vacation pay to its part-time associates. I have always felt that I had the tools I needed to succeed, and the pay is great compared to any other fast food joint.",The fast-pace and often high-volume nature of working at In-N-Out can be very stressful. There will always be more pressure to go faster and do more without sacrificing quality.

You learn to work very efficiently--hard work is a requirement,  as well as attention to detail.  Laziness is not tolerated. You also learn to take criticism well, because constant feedback is given.  Customer service is so important--many shy people burst out of their bubble in the job. The environment created is one of pride in what you do,  which builds a family feeling at work.","The hours are rough; working until 2:30 in the morning,  then coming back for a day shift the next day is commonplace.

2821,In-N-Out Burger,Wow?,2014-12-11,5.0,,Great leadership and great salaries and benefits. I loved working here while I was in college. I would recommend this company to all young men and women,I really can't think of any.
2822,In-N-Out Burger,I LOVE THIS JOB,2014-12-11,5.0,Board Person (Dressing the Burgers),"There are many things that I love about In-N-Out. One is that they train you very well. You watch about five hours of videos before you're even allowed to step foot onto the red tiles. You're not thrown into a situation unless the managers feel you are ready, and in general (at least in my store) everyone is usually genuinely nice and willing to help you out. I've been with the company a little over a year, and I have been promoted to a level 4. You get promoted by working hard, and although it wasn't always easy, you have your managers as a support team to help you level up. My store manager is very thoughtful in making sure every single employee gets the schedule they want (which is tough considering we all have different school schedules) but he gets it done either way. The coworkers are awesome! We all are on some level of friendship, and it's definitely a great place to work! In the area I live, the starting wage was at $11, and I am now making $12.50 per hour.  
Oh yeah I also love how high the In-N-Out standards are! If the burger doesn't look like the picture, we send it back ourselves. We always have the customers' best interest in mind. The food is fresh, our health standards are the highest among other fast food restaurant, and I love how customer oriented our company is. It shows that we actually care about the food we are serving.
This was also my first job, and I am very lucky I got hired here.","Like what I mentioned before, there are some rough days. Sometimes, the rush hour is too much, and being on fries by yourself is stressful. There are a lot of aspects about the job that are stressful, but the only reason we stress so much is because we want to make the best burger possible. Even though I've been there over a year I still stress about how perfect my fries turn out, how nicely I wrap my burgers, and sometimes even how clean the floor looks. And during rush hours it gets really hectic. Everyone gets stressed about trying to hurry yet keep the same quality, but as soon as the rush is over we kind of take a look around, sigh, and laugh about it. Work isn't easy, but the coworkers make it a lot more fun. And yes it's true, you will smell like burgers for the rest of the day. Oh, and since we are a customer based company, sometimes you get the customer who isn't in a good mood, and that might really ruin your day, but you just have to remember that it's one unhappy customer, among the hundreds who have come through and appreciate your hard work."
2823,In-N-Out Burger,Positive & FreeSpirited,2014-12-11,5.0,Associate Level II,"The best reason to work at In n Out is because of all the positive people, the smiles, the upbeat attitudes. It's a good atmosphere to be in. VERY great at making sure before you go up on your levels that you have enough experience and confidence that when asked to do something you know how to do it. It's very fast paced, so it helps you learn how to work well under pressure, but also being able to smile & give the customers the best experience. Reasonable AND flexible work hours. They are really good about making sure you do have a social life but that you also work. Especially if you are in college or have another job. The pay is great.",Not always getting off on your scheduled time..

Free burgers. Get to learn the ""secret menu"".  The pay is great considering it's fast food. INO prides itself in always giving more than minimum wage. Awesome first job (if you're up for it). Family owned (not a chain) so it still has strong core values. Believes in community service/ charity. Everyone gets Easter, Thanksgiving and Xmas off. There's also benefits available and room for advancement. Training is better than other places I've worked, they really push you to move up levels (at least at my store). Most coworkers are friendly, supportive and motivated.  Scheduleing can be flexible if you're a student/ religious/ have another job. Offers company picnics/ events and awards (theme parks, gift cards, sport tournaments). Fast-paced environment (can be a pro or con). It's the most demanding job I've had but my favorite so far.","Expect to work long hours/ late (clocking out at 2am on a closing shift). Strict dress code and policies (pro when it comes to quality). Some people say you gain weight from eating burgers haha but INO does offer discounted gym memberships. I'm part-time so I usually work 6hr shifts. Full time can work 8+hr shifts. So if your schedule says 11-3 they can keep you longer. I learned to live with it (more hrs = more money) but it seems to bug a lot of people. I've noticed management/ advancing can get political and cause drama. Also, seems to be more men than women in management, but that's just an observation. The customers can be very specific and rude or have no idea what to order and then blame you for not getting what they wanted. But you have to learn how to deal with people at any job. It makes the nice customers that much better to serve."

The company is very proud of their Californian heritage, which they should be! However, when people from California move out to different regions they sometimes become negative. You'll hear a lot about how ""it's better in California"", or ""everyone works harder back home"". It very well may be true, but it comes across as distasteful to local hires.

TRANSFERS. The biggest con that I still don't really understand is transferring, I had been on medical leave for 4 months and during those 4 months, I moved from San Jose, CA to Tracy, CA. The transfer system goes like this for INO; you let your manager know you need a transfer, you talk to the store manager of the new store you would like to/need to transfer to and they confirm with you a date for an interview, you go to the interview at the new store, and depending on how you did and what kind of review you get from your previous manager, you get hired or you're SOL, meaning apply to another INO near you or resign from the company. What doesn't make sense to me is why I would have to go through an interview process if I was already employed with the company, I was trying to return for medical leave to help support my family, but the new store manager already seemed to have a prejudice against me before the interview and the hard work of two years i had put in with the company already was lost too."

Corporate had regular benefits such as a day where your store could sign up to go to a water park for free. Free burger for everyday you worked, two if you worked 8+ hours, and free soda, though this is monumentally unhealthy, and it definitely showed, as many of my coworkers gained a good bit of weight, and could barely run as shown during our employee set up football game on thanksgiving. Also vacation time, even for part time employees, was a plus.","For starters management was terrible, over my time had a number of different managers, though a few remained constant. Each had different things that made them bad, one was terribly incompetent, another rude and passive aggressive, but the main first manager was loud, rude, would yell at employees in front of customers, and was just downright mean, but whenever the district manager (could fill another paragraph on him; long story short he operated on intimidation) would come around and she would turn into the nicest person ever. Favoritism was rampant and blatant, as well as many instances of sexism, and being a male I was actually on the benefiting side of this, this was against the female employees from the female managers.
But overall, my biggest complaint is that I worked there from age 17 to 18, and was still in high school and then college, and I was working SIX day weeks and 40 hours (except when the week came that they would have had to legally make me full time came around) nearly the entire time I worked there, which as a 17 year old in high school on a work permit is very illegal, however when I was 18 it was technically fair game, not that it mattered. I asked to move to a reasonable five days a week and was completely disregarded and worked six day a week till I quit. There were multiple occasions in which I was getting off at 2 AM just to go to school at 7 and then return for the night shift again.

2924,In-N-Out Burger,Good paychecks but a very stressful job,2013-12-22,3.0,Level V Associate,"Good pay, relatively flexible hours, good customer service skills can be acquired on the job, usually good employees and realistic/understanding managers.","late nights, hungry customers are rude, you can only fake happiness in front of customers for so long before it wears you out"

2926,In-N-Out Burger,Favoritism Over Hard Work,2013-12-01,1.0,Associate,"Some of the employees are lovely people to work with, other employers are happy to hear you worked for In N Out, You get a free meal with each shift (not including shakes, more than two meat patties, or two slices of cheese), everyone is wearing the same outfit, and it's completely unflattering so you don't have to worry about girls/guys judging your body (they can't see it) I liked the forced modesty. Customers were typically friendly and happy to be there, they hold In N Out employees in high esteems. I made some nice friends who are all very different. The diversity is awesome. I respect the Christian faith the C.E.O. Lynsi Torres brings into the privately owned company. The upper management are wonderful people, genuinely wanting to help better the service being provided. There are many different events the company puts on for the employees as well, creating unity. I admire the generosity. One Day I will own a successful business. Working at In N Out has enlightened me on how to improve a grand business.","To be blunt, the store managemt did not treat majority of the employees well, and let their favoritism over look many things that were considered ""unacceptable"" to the company. I would like to believe other In N Out stores are far less reliant on favoritism, and valued the hard work, and good character of their employees, but I most certainly cannot say that about the store I worked at. The managers appeared to be reading from a script that mad them politically correct, but when the script was done and they added a few of their own words, it was plain to see the In N Out values were not theirs. When I was hired I was told if I worked hard, asked for help, advice, and was providing excellent service, I could ""move up the totem pole."" This most definitely was not the case. There was a lot of drama. I suppose it is fast food, but I expected more from In N Out.  I noticed the spirit of joy in providing great service fell in many of the people around me as they realized they would have to suck up to the managers and spend time with their favorite group of people outside of work to get promoted. While it would seem a nice idea to have a sense of community, all they really did was talk about each other behind their backs. One manager in particular took a great dislike to me. No one knew why, but yes, everyone appeared to notice,  and ask me why I let her treat me the way she did. I came to work to provide excellent service for a paycheck, not to have childish bickering with a childish manager. I have a lack of respect in the idea that someone who behaves so poorly can become a manager and be expected to reap amazing results. That just sounds like and equation for disaster. A manager that is not good with high stress situations should not be a manager, sadly, those are the kinds of managers at this store. The main store manager was very uninvolved in the unity of the store, I wonder if he knew that was on his script. Oddly enough, these are only the very surface details of the problems at store 247. I feel liberated. Now that I don't work there. My hard work is actually appreciated now. When I own my own business, I will surely be on the lookout for mishaps like these that can strain the success of my company, and my employers well being."

- Free burger, fries, and drink every day that you work","- Favoritism: If you aren't a manager's pet, you'll see yourself get reprimanded for things other people do all the time
- Expected to be nice and peppy to the point of fakeness while managers themselves are rude and not motivating in the least
- Extremely strict dress code, once got in trouble for wearing ankle socks instead of mid calf socks (oh the horror)
- Some days you get off two hours early, the next you're held over your scheduled time by two hours without any notice
- Sometimes you aren't given breaks at all
- You will personally be mocked and made uncomfortable if you work at this particular store
- You will be shown once, very quickly how to perform a task, and then expected to do it yourself, just as quickly, without making a single mistake. To put it simply, the training definitely needs to improve
- A lot of the store's procedures lack efficiency 
- You'll stink of burgers even after a shower
- Managers give you a hard time for things you have no control over
- Employees will actually tell on you for things, and once again, if the manager likes them more than you, you'll get in trouble for it
- Managers behave extremely unprofessionally
- Takes forever to move up
