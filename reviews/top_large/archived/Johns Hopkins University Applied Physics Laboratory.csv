0,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,The best place I've ever worked,2022-02-11,5.0,Section Supervisor,"APL is hands down the most employee-centered place I've ever worked. There is careful thought and consideration that goes into every decision they make and how it will or could impact employees. The environment is supportive, highly innovative and extremely collaborative. The benefits are incredible and the acknowledgement of appreciation for employee work is second to none. I've never worked anywhere that views its people as integral to the operation as APL does. On top of that, the work is incredibly meaningful.",I don't have any cons
1,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Amazing Place to Grow and Learn,2022-03-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"Super smart people, impactful problems, challenging and engaging work. The best coworkers (they feel like friends)",Percentage based work. Filling up 100% with multiple projects can be a lot or not enough depending on the project. It’s really easy to maintain a healthy balance by having a good manager and leadership that cares.
2,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Motivated by Knowledge,2021-12-18,5.0,Engineer II,"Since APL a University Affiliated Research Center, it's not for profit. This place is motivated by Science and Learning, NOT profits. They really care about supporting you to be the best you can, via pursuing more education, leadership roles, lisetning to new ideas, exposing you to more work experience ,etc.

Compared to other giant organizations in the defense industry, it's way easier to move around and do different work or do different things, because they want you doing work that you are motivated to do so that we all can get the best results.

There exists a whole structure for any employee to come up with brand new ideas that APL will fund . And if you begin to show promising results they will continue to fund it even further.

This place just fosters improvement all around.

Diversity distribution in management positions reflects the diversity distribution throughout the rest of the organization

The gyms on site are wayyy cheaper than any gym membership elsewhere.

I'd highly recommend any engineer or scientist strongly consider working here.","Although every one here is incredibly friendly, it's very easy to be isolated. It may be related to my work specifically but there isnt a lot of very heavy team work involved in the tasks. You aren't working hand in hand with other people.

Location is not ideal for younger crowds who may want to live in bigger metropolitan areas like DC/Bethesda/Silver Spring or Baltimore. Though its totally feasible if you're willing to make the 35 minute drive.

Finally, this is an industry wide issue, and not specific to APL, but it is still dominated my predominantly caucasian males."
3,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Crushing Lack of Trust Between Upper Management and Technical Staff,2022-03-06,1.0,Senior Professional Staff I,"Good benefits, important mission, reasonable hours, opportunities to work with individuals with a diverse set of technical backgrounds who care about their work.

With so much turnover, there are more career growth roles available than usual.","Upper management does not seem to trust that technical staff can work effectively from home or that younger generations care about APL's mission. There is a huge amount of tension that spills out into meetings between management and staff as a significant number of staff members simply find their home environment to be where they are most effective, while increasing their quality of life and safety during recent COVID-19 surges. Upper management telling technical staff to return to cramped shared offices during the omicron surge was expectedly terrible for morale, especially with the addition of tracking employees' return to office via badge swipes. Upper management is making the return to the office the hill that they are willing to die on, and results are showing increased turnover and decreased morale. 

Pay is a bit low for the industry, but staff would overlook it due to solid benefits and their belief in the mission (as they always have previously) if they felt trusted and empowered by management.

Typical cons associated with large organizations: office politics, red tape, slow to adjust."
4,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Make your career here if you possibly can,2022-03-24,5.0,Associate Professional Staff II,"APL sets the bar for great companies to work for. Their primary concern is delivering great work product to government sponsors, but they understand better than most businesses that they cannot continue doing that on a long-term basis without investing in their staff.

Professional development is expected and supported. If the skills you want to acquire are remotely mission-relevant, you will find APL management supportive of your pursuits.

You will find yourself in an environment where brilliant people are working on cutting-edge technologies. But if you have come to expect brilliant people to be bristly and unwilling to share their expertise, as I had, you will find that the folks at APL are overjoyed to talk about what they're working on and open opportunities to get you involved in things that interest you. There is a subject matter expert on staff in pretty much any area you can imagine, and I never encountered one who was unwilling to make time in their schedule to chat with me.

There is an institutional commitment to diversity that they seem to actually follow through on. They still have a ways to go, but there are people from a variety of backgrounds, both culturally/ethnically and educationally.

Finally, I appreciate the degree to which all staff are kept up-to-date on the strategic direction and success of the company. Management will keep you up to date on tasking strategy, productivity levels, capital improvements, and other details of running the business. At first, if you're like me, this will be too much information and you will not understand why you should care. But as you settle into your position, you will realize what a rare prize it is to know these things and be able to use the information to plan ahead for your work and your career. Paying attention to these presentations is also how you can get internal money to explore your own ideas—this is encouraged and rewarded at all levels of the organization.

You will work hard at APL, but if you are bright and curious and dedicated, you will struggle to find a more fulfilling place to work.","Despite continuing progress on diversity initiatives, the management levels of APL are still mostly old white guys. They are friendly and approachable old white guys, but it would be good to see more diversity at the top levels.

Management seems resistant to having full-time remote employees on staff, even where that should be possible for a particular workload. I'm not sure whether this is because their metrics show that these staff are less productive, but I think they will start to miss out on some of the best candidates if they maintain this stance going forward.

For me, the location was a bit of a con. Howard County is fine, but it's a bit sleepy for my taste."
5,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Cutting edge work, some major issues",2022-03-26,1.0,Biomedical Scientist,"Cutting-edge work, mostly government but close ties to academics at JHU too.  Good work-life balance (for most groups and projects).  Good vacation time and 401k matching is the best I've ever seen. Very smart peers that are not competitive and are willing to help you learn & grow.","Salaries are lower than peers (but I heard management is starting to realize that and address it).  Senior management doesn't really seem very receptive to full-time remote workers. Very hard to get patents for inventions - tech transfer manager only whines about not having enough money and having too much other work from her boss...when you do convince them you have a good product, they're not very good at getting it out there (my advice to staff still there is to try to get the Baltimore technology office involved because they know what they are doing.)"
6,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Good place to work, especially for early career staff",2022-03-28,5.0,Software Engineer,Strong emphasis on learning and skill development,Generally not as fast-paced as other companies.

11,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Thinking Happens Here,2021-10-06,5.0,Senior Professional Staff I,"At the laboratory you work in an environment of technically competent people who value science, technology, creativity, hard work, and employee wellbeing. Mathematicians, physicists, engineers, computer scientists, and other subject matter experts collaborate to solve challenging problems. We have the option to participate in academic collaborations and to publish research based on the problems we solve at the lab.

The company is selective in choosing high quality employees, gives them a good salary and benefits, and keeps them until they retire so that expertise remains within the company. This makes APL stable, reliable, and innovative for both customers and employees. While working here you will feel like you are doing something good in the world. It is also a stable place to raise a family. It is completely the opposite of the cut-throat revolving door practices of other companies where hiring is run by Machiavellian third-party hiring companies.","The laboratory is located in between Baltimore and Washington, DC which is suboptimal for many employees causing some of them to commute from over an hour away. The reason is simple - the company attracts people who want to raise families and Maryland is not a good place to raise a family."

I've had the opportunity to take on new roles in my time here and my management has been committed to my professional development. Plus the retirement benefit can't be beat!",None that I can think of

16,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Weird place to work,2022-02-17,2.0,Senior Project Manager,"Decent salary and benefits, very good retirement match.","Overall the organization does some pretty cool stuff, but at a snails pace. The IT Department is one of the worst I've worked in. You're not truly part of APL unless you have been there for 30 years, and you have to comply with how they do things. Fresh ideas from the outside are not permitted, unless you come from an expensive consulting company."
17,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Work culture = toxic, conservative; promised work-life balance isn't true",2022-02-01,3.0,Associate Professional Staff I,"Pay is good if you have a PhD. Bachelors and masters make around the same starting. Salary increases are good enough in your first few years here, but then they only equate to inflation or less after that.

They'll pay for your graduate degree at Hopkins (or elsewhere). You can leave after, no strings attached.","The pandemic isn't being taken seriously by leadership. They once promised a flexible work environment with emphasis on remote work (since it had worked so well during the start of the pandemic). They nixed that and are forcing staff to be in a minimum of 3-days per week (but strongly encouraging 4-5 days), tracking our presence via badge scanning. The leadership is old, majority white, and majority male. Stuck in the past and harming the company's future by alienating their early-career staff (20s-30s) who are used to hybrid and remote work environments. The attrition rate in one of our sectors is 8% (increased by 4-5% since implementing the forced in-person presence and not shutting down operations in the slightest during the Omicron wave). This job doesn't care about your mental or physical health.

Tasking can be a mess depending on your group. You can be severely overtasked or undertasked at the snap of a finger. Burnout is common.

Emphasis on innovation, which can be great for fields that have a lot of ""invention"" going on. For others, it's difficult and you'll see a lot of reinventing the wheel, as to keep groups afloat with minor internal funding, in the hopes that a sponsor will fund an idea.

I'm a bit jaded as my experience here has been full of overwhelm and burnout. Group, branch, and sector leadership are failing their young staff, among others.

Little vacation time: 15 days for the first 5 years that you work here.
Little sick time: 7 days.
Location: Laurel, MD (boring suburb and a solid drive from both DC and Baltimore)

Demographics: very white, very male (both significant majorities) -- they will tell you the statistics during your onboarding. Most people here are moderate or conservative."
18,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Excellent employer for high performing engineers and scientists,2022-02-04,5.0,Principal Staff Engineer,APL provides the opportunity to work critical national programs.

Good work life balance and benefits. Most employees are intelligent and driven.,Compensation is decent but lags many other organizations and is not particularly merit-based. Fair bit of red tape and unique organizational structure can be difficult to navigate.
22,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,be careful,2022-01-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits. Great people to work with.,"APL management actively discriminates against minority groups in its organization. If you speak up at all you will be fired.

APL fosters an environment of fear.

APL actively discriminates against its support staff. There are different sets of benefits for support or ""professional"" staff.

Career opportunities for technical staff are very limited.

Senior management is not interested in listening when concerns are brought up. They want issues swept under the rug to keep their image clean.

If you are part of any minority group (women, religious, racial) stay away from this place. I observed so much discrimination during my 1.5 years at APL it was truly shocking."

27,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Can be a fantastic place to work if you don't mind being significantly underpaid; note: covid vaccine mandate,2022-01-12,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- great work life balance
- very interesting work
- lots of variety
- great job security
- lots of opportunities to learn
- great benefits
- sometimes you get to choose the projects you work on (if you and your skills are in demand and you have networked)

The experience varies depending on what role you have and which Sector you are in (and likely even which group), but I personally have had a really good work experience here. I have enjoyed it so much that I have often thought that I would work here until I retire and the very sub-par pay was worth it. The work/life balance and benefits are great; the work is interesting and incredibly varied with lots of opportunities to learn; the job security is generally good (other than recent covid developments--see below).","- pay is not competitive with comparable government positions, other federal contractors, and not even close to industry.  Note: get any higher-level degree(s) before you start if you want to work here
- ""promotions"" do not come with any pay increase
- bonuses are generally smaller and much more rare than in industry (do not expect one every year)
- covid vaccine mandate (get the jab or lose your job)

This is not the place to work if competitive pay or advancement/recognition is important to you. 

APL does not really have an advancement track for technical leadership, and that combined with a matrixed management (both line and program managers) means that you have to go into management of some kind to ""rise"" in the organization. 

APL is not the place to work -- at least at the moment -- if a remote/strongly hybrid work environment is important to you post-pandemic. For some parts of the lab (but not all), even if you worked fully remotely since before the pandemic but live less than 100 miles away from the lab, you are required to come in a minimum 3 days a week. This policy is hopefully temporary, and does not apply to all Sectors. But it sure is a doozie for some people when combined with the twice-a-week covid testing policy for those who are not fully vaccinated (see below).

There is currently a covid vaccine mandate in place (for all employees, including fully-remote) and the way that APL has handled the whole thing has been very, very poorly to say the least. It's become highly politicized in my opinion and it seems like management has forgotten all of the Diversity and Inclusion training that they have been giving to everyone in the way that they are treating some of their employees.

Lots of good employees have either resigned, retired early, or been fired between the forced on-site and vaccine policies. I am still working at APL, but am appalled at the treatment of some of my colleagues. It seems very atypical of APL and I'd have never believed that it could happen like this until it did.

If you don't think the covid vaccines are the best thing ever, you may want to look elsewhere (or at least keep your mouth very, very shut). Don't count on a religious or medical exemption, though some (few) have been granted on a ""trial basis"" (which they can revoke anytime at their discretion). These exemptions were granted after keeping everyone in limbo for 3+ months knowing that any day they could be told that they have just one week to get the jab or lose their job. If you do get an exemption (or are waiting months for one), APL requires twice-a-week negative testing, and does not offer that testing on-site."

I learned a lot about operations research and the operational naval domain. The working environment is first-class. And you are privileged to work with some of the brightest minds in your field. Furthermore, they were supportive and accommodating during the pandemic, creating a work-from-home posture, while continuing to serve the nation.","I decided to leave after they created a policy mandating that employees must be vaccinated for the SARS-COV-2 virus. While they accepted disability and religious exemptions, I felt that they could have better supported employees that could work remotely, and give them the option to be tested regularly. I understand that working remotely can be challenging in a classified environment, but I was able to obtain adequate unclassified coverage to work-from-home for one year. Furthermore, they provided one-month notice, and suggested that would be adequate time to find new employment. I would have liked a little more time, to be honest."

43,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Used to be good. Turned real sour.,2021-12-09,2.0,Research Engineer,"Before the 2021 covid vaccine mandates, APL was a wonderful place to work. Nearly everyone I talked to thought so. I thought so. They do a huge variety of extremely cool things across the domains of space, robotics, AI, medicine, security, IT, and more. Everyone is highly qualified and enthusiastic. Leadership is available to talk all the way to the top (I even sent an email to the top man once, and got a personal response.) There were some issues, but overall I could hardly have asked for a better company. I hope, if I start a company some day, to apply many lessons I learned from the management here.","Then the covid vaccine mandates hit. For most companies, exemptions were something reasonably considered and, if practical, an employee would be accommodated. Not everywhere, I know, but many places. APL, on the other hand, couldn't set their deadlines short enough or tolerate even the most benign exemptions. Exemption decisions took months, terminations were mere days after they _finally_ got around to responding (no ETA was given to anyone), and basically no accommodation was considered ""reasonable"". Fully remote employees were considered unaccommodateable. One employee offered to be demoted to an older role with active job openings to be easier to accommodate, and was denied. Numerous peers and managers were actively hostile toward the ""unvaxxed"", boasting in how little they cared about what happened to them (generally calling for them all to be fired without exception). Managers went around with social distancing sticks, poking and checking the distance between people. People who took the shots under duress, broken down in tears because they felt they had no other choice, were told that nobody ""forced"" them. Even vaccinated people who thought that their peers should be able to make their own decisions felt so appalled at the Lab's behavior that many felt they could no longer stay.

In short, in the past few months the lab has turned utterly toxic and has betrayed their core principles of integrity and inclusion. These betrayals are from both peers and managers, all the way to the top. I, and many others, look back on the past few months at APL with utter revulsion, dread, and gloom. I'm extremely happy to have left them behind me. I hope they turn this around, the Lab used to be something wonderful."

Yet they show know of these leadership attributes themselves. The director communicated very little with the staff throughout the pandemic but when he did it was almost always political. The pandemic has exposed the failure in leadership. They are giving staff denied religious accomodations a whopping 7 days after the denial to be fired.

Good mentoring as well.,"Culture at the lab varies greatly depending on your sector and group, and it's hard to get a sense for how you fit into your group's culture until you start working there . Also salary is a bit lower than at defense contractors or Silicon Valley companies; however, the interesting work and status as an academic (versus defense contractor) make up for it. Finally, seems like salary increases gradually taper off after entry-level years; maybe this is best as an entry-level job."

This is especially true in AOS. As a mid level, you are expected to lead on projects that can have no relevance to your background.

Sadly the leadership at APL if mandating vaccination and associated reporting. They have also slowly bought into the wokeness culture.

Overall, APL is a great place to work. Most of the time I had interesting work, and coworkers are generally great. The academic but meaningful nature of work is somewhat unique and something I really enjoyed. I would definitely recommend the lab. It's got helpful and smart people, interesting work, and treats employees with respect. They recently instituted a COVID vaccine mandate.","I wrote out a bunch, but do not let this deter you. Just listing out things I have noticed over the years. All jobs have pros and cons, and at APL, the pros far outweigh the cons. 

-Communication and transparency could use work, particularly with return to work policies. Sectors are setting policies independently, and policies are changed without informing lower level employees. Understand they are in uncharted territory but lack of communication is frustrating. Further, lab leadership was using bizarre reasons (stats about productivity and sponsor visits without providing actual numbers) to justify returning to work in-person full time. 
-Culture and policies can vary greatly by group (I had a good group so not complaining but worth being aware of). Can be annoying when you know people in other groups who have more flexibility than you despite doing similar work.
-APL is a gov contractor so you have to find work to cover you. Generally, this isn't a problem, but some projects will have sudden stops in work and some supervisors are more helpful in assisting staff in finding projects than others. --Matrix organization can be frustrating. Your supervisor determines your raise but may never have worked with you. 
-Lab places a lot of importance on technical skills, which is understandable, but soft skills (organization, management, budgeting) are undervalued. Sometimes someone who is phenomenal technically gets put in charge of a project, and the project is poorly run because they do not have good management skills. 
-There are other, smaller complaints - parking availability, kitchen/refrigerators for lunch storage and prep, area cost of living ($$$$), location (not a lot nearby), cafeteria could be better."
78,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Interesting Work with Smart People,2021-08-01,4.0,Associate Professional Staff,"You mostly get to choose your the work you're interested in.

In my role within the AOS sector, the contracts we were working were updating every 6 months to 1 year. In addition, I can work on several projects simultaneously.

Putting all this together, I am NEVER bored with what I am doing, and I am always learning.

I also find that with my group comprised mostly of seasoned PhDs, the tasks are targeted toward providing the highest impact possible, leaving the government sponsors with new avenues of R&D.

Lastly, I very much appreciate that management really tries to keep me working exactly 80 hours / 2 weeks through the use of comp time.",The splitting of time across projects and continual changing of projects does have negative effects. The pace of work at APL is slow. Projects tend to drag on a month or two past their deadlines or the money spent on a project is larger than initially budgeted.
79,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Great place,2021-08-15,5.0,Associate Engineer II,"Great place to innovate, and try different positions. Moving around is encouraged. Continuing education program is great. Facilities are great for the most part, especially if you work in REDD , many clubs and special interest groups create sense of community",Bureaucracy and politics between program management can mean that good ideas are sidelined for no reason. Charging time so specific budgets can feel limiting. Common to get spread thin across too many projects if you aren't selective over work you engage on.

82,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Difficult place for mid-career staff,2021-09-01,3.0,Associate Professional Staff II,"Great benefits. The health insurance is good, as is the retirement matching, and they'll pay your tuition for a masters.

I enjoyed the university-like feel with many clubs and employee groups, plus the maker space is amazing if you're into 3D printing, etc.

This is a great place to start a career. There's lots of opportunities to learn, lots of technical brown bags and training funds.

I feel that APL does make an effort towards diversity and inclusion. At least there are active organizations you can join, like Allies in the Workplace, African American Culture Club, Women in Technology, etc.

Work-life balance is pretty good and hours are flexible-ish. There's not huge pressure to work past your 80 hours per two weeks in my experience.","It's extremely difficult to get promoted from associate to senior unless you have a very proactive manager who's working to get you promoted. Unless you are fresh out of school, I would not recommend APL unless you get hired as senior staff.

Get ready to feel like you have to job search just to keep your job. Because of the nature of contract work, things are feast or famine. Scramble to find enough work to cover your timecard, or have more projects than any one person can reasonably handle. I have had colleagues have to take unpaid time off because there was simply no work for them. At least at consulting firms your time on the bench is paid!

Pay is so-so, probably typical for government contract type work. You can definitely get paid more in private industry especially for certain engineering fields.

As far as D&I, there is a lot of work to be done still, as women and people of color are still underrepresented especially the higher up you go. 

Finally, the fact that AOS insisted on bringing associate staff back to campus, despite the Delta surge, regardless of performance while WFH or family situation, was the final nail in the coffin to show where this organization's priorities are. Why on earth would I want to drive to another building so I can sit in front of a computer for 8 hours while wearing a mask when I can work from home instead?"

There are a few key centers of excellence (Intelligent Systems Center, Space, etc.) that are worth working for if you can get in.","No hiring strategy; lots of bad apples get hired and wreak havoc on top projects.

Certain people at the Branch and Group leadership level have too much power and will attempt to take control of projects from technical staff. These senior managers often push their own pet projects rather than the technology and practices the rest of the world uses.

While work-life balance is generally good, it can be difficult to focus at work as you may find yourself working on a half-dozen unrelated projects at once, each with its own team and project manager. This becomes unbearable if the project or program managers like to micromanage, which they often do.

The skills you develop at APL are not always transferrable to industry. It can be difficult to find a new job as APL's name and history suggest you're working as a professor or low-level researcher.

Most coworkers are very book smart (I often felt like the dumbest person in every room, which is an amazing growth opportunity), although some people who can’t pull their weight have long tenure
Lots of teams have industry experts who have decades of experience doing the same thing and they’re very good people to learn from 
Pay is okay for a local company, but no where near highest paying for software developers","Poor career growth opportunities from management. I had to switch teams to actually grow into a bigger project otherwise I would have been stuck maintaining an abandoned legacy code base forever.
Management is much better at being hands off for senior staff than helping new grads establish themselves. My managers were never direct with me and it was really annoying, but I wasn’t experienced enough at the time to call them out on it and directly pry for developmental feedback.
I remember being in new employee orientation three years after I joined (because there was never enough capacity), listening to Ralph Semmel tell us that salaries aren’t going up in the industry so they can’t offer raises. This was the same week I received an offer for 3X my APL salary to work in a tech hub. The point is not about money, it’s that management butters employees up and tells them they’re the greatest thing on earth when in reality there’s an entire class of higher performing workers who would never consider working there because it pays peanuts. It’s disingenuous, and part of the reason why the ratings for APL are so high on Glassdoor because everyone is drinking the koolaid."

241,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Cool projects, great people.",2020-03-05,5.0,GNC Engineer,People are happy to help you learn new concepts needed for your work. No shortage of cool problems to solve.,Location is in the middle of nowhere
242,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Great place to make a career!,2018-09-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Extremely innovative/exciting work across many different areas (defense, space, healthcare, robotics and autonomy, AI, materials science, etc.) that has a positive impact on the world.
- APL is a research center, so the majority of the work you'll be doing hasn't been done before. You will be challenged to think critically, which will help you grow both personally and professionally.
- Incredibly smart and passionate people allow for a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive environment.
- You are encouraged to work on the things you want to work on, and your supervisor would be happy to work with you in finding tasking that is a better match for your interests if you're unhappy in your current role.
- Many opportunities to earn internal funding if you have an innovative/relevant project you want to work on.
- Continuous learning is highly encouraged and supported. You can earn a graduate degree (in a field relevant to your role) at no cost to you. There are also many training and development (both technical and non-technical) courses regularly offered at the lab.
- Flexible work schedules.
- Great benefits, including the best retirement plan company match I've seen.
- Many clubs/organizations to become a part of as well as organized social events throughout the year.
- Overall: There are so many great opportunities at APL, so you will get out of it what you put into it.","- At times, typical red-tape found in all organizations in defense (however, I believe APL does the best job at mitigating these barriers)."

254,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Average pay - work/life balance a myth,2019-09-29,1.0,Systems Engineer,A lot of different opportunities exist. 403B (like a 401K but for educational institutions) is 2% base and 2-to-1 match up to 4% (total of 10% contribution).,"Not as cutting edge as other laboratories. Supports weapon development (potential moral issues). As a non-profit, pay is lower than in industry. Work-life balance advertised as a benefit, but more managers pressure you to do (unpaid) overtime and weekend work. Health plan is sub-par compared to industry (even though it's associated with one of the premier hospitals in the world). Poor employee support in HR and EEO. Management is out of touch with the individual employees. Parking rules not enforced; parking lot is a daily mess; difficult to find parking (sometimes I walk 3/4 mile from car to desk)."
255,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,overall good,2020-06-07,4.0,Senior Professional Staff,"constantly learning, challenging problems, good benefits",apl is located in the middle of nowhere
256,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Talented People, Exciting Projects",2016-02-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"APL is one of the rare few places that really cares about their employees, and is very selective to ensure that only top-notch people are hired into the organization.  Also, all the people in management positions are usually people who were in highly technical roles in the past.  They don't hire managers for the sake of managers.  This can lead to some less-skilled management structure, but there's value in the fact that the managers are highly technical and usually were in physics/coding roles in the same project in the past.

Also, their benefits are also pretty good.  Their 401(k) program (actually it's a 403(b)) is killer.","My biggest two complaints are:

(1) Very stingy they with PTO, which is thoroughly non-negotiable and starts at only three weeks for everyone. 
(2) Like most organizations they suffer from the problem that annual career growth and salary is capped and thus primarily tethered to where you started in the organization.  I worked hard for years trying to advance from Associate 1 to Associate 2 and get my pay onto a higher track, even with numerous recognitions in my work, and countless above-average reviews.  Then they hired a co-worker with less experience than me, hired right into Associate 2 with a higher salary.

The moral of the story is that the best way to advance in APL (and probably most other similar organizations), is to leave and come back.  It allows you to reset your trajectory within the system, and get a nice bump in your salary that could not have happened within the system."
257,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Great Experience TERRIBLE advancement,2019-10-01,3.0,Software Engineer,You can do things you don't get to do at most companies.  There may be an area of interest that is typically done by the time you join a team.  You can build that from the ground up here.  Changing roles isn't a bid deal either.  You get as much opportunity as you want.  You can do independent research and get internal funding.  Education assistance 18 credits a year (dollar doesn't matter).  Looks amazing on a resume.  Other companies will offer you jobs you never worked before at high pay just because you worked at apl.  It is tough to find smart talent and everyone at apl is smart.  No deadweight like most companies have.,"The it department is the worst I have ever seen.  Don't use linux as your operating system or they will tell you they don't support linux (although it's on their site that they do).  

It is nearly impossible to get promoted to senior level.  You have to be a tech lead, bring in your own grants or get a PhD.  In order to become a tech lead you have to be on a project for a few years but our group has short term projects so how do you get promoted?  You pretty much have to invent something or apply for internal grants and get them consistently.  Basically things you would make much more money from running your own business.  Good for entry level or senior people but horrible for people in the middle of their careers.  Get your experience and leave.  Not a long term job for the middle of your career.  I helped win a $50 million dollar contract in a competition and still have not gotten even a 1% raise in 3.5 years of working.   Received awards two years straight.  Stop giving me non-monetary awards and PAY ME.  That is why I am leaving."

263,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Dad is proud,2010-03-27,5.0,Crypto Engineer,"JHUAPL has perhaps the vastest collection of geeky projects available to work on collected into one campus. Walking from building to building through the habitrail tubes is a source of private amusement. Quality computer equipment provided upon arrival with a 3-year upgrade replacement policy and special requirements for non-standard hardware get handled promptly. No pay scales so no way to top out. Lots of odd little talks about techy/sciency subjects going on all the time that employees can go to (some are open to the public). Lots of educational opportunities that management encourages employees to take advantage of when not actively charging a to a project. And, finally, my dad, who toured the facility back in the late fifties or early sixties and was very impressed, is proud that I got a job there :-)","Bureaucracy and more bureaucracy. I guess this can be expected in a management heavy group of 4800 in a research organization.  This means more non-project related meetings then in normal companies.

The JHUAPL internal network is in the dark ages (the 1990s) - I have had to type my password over 30 times a day because of the lack of single sign-on and the multiple ""central"" repositories of information that cannot be searched easily or at all.

The amount of nanny type programs running on the Windows boxes noticeably hurt performance or deny the ability to perform ones job (hint: get in the ""bit9 developer""  group so you can install the software you need). Or, you can get a MacBook pro with a Cinema Display which is much less encumbered (I went with a Dell because of the ability to have multiple displays)."

 - The benefits are amazing. Fantastic medical, dental, etc. - if you have a family it might be one of the best. Retirement matching is unheard of. I may not get rich on annual salary but can retire a millionaire based on the match!
 - World class people in a diverse array of fields. You'd be hard pressed to find this many amazingly talented and smart people in one place working on a wide array of amazing things.
 - Service to the nation. APL provides ""Critical contributions to critical challenges facing the nation."" That alone motivates 99% of the work force to come in every day ready to rock and roll.
 - Flexibility - you can, to a reasonable degree, design your schedule. You can also move around the organization to different departments, technical areas, in/out of line mgmt, etc. with relative ease and really no negative impact (compared to other places I've worked).","- If you want to be compensated highly, with bonuses being often, this is not the place.
 - While APL is a trusted agent of the government we are also at the whim of things like Government Shutdowns, potential downturn in defense spending, etc.
 - The freedom and flexibility of the org, the very matrix structure of teams, can make it a challenge at times. Just as you can find new work you can also roll off of work you don't want to really do (provided you find another option) with very little stigma or downside."
