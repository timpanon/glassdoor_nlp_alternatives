1,Johnson & Johnson,Great place to be long term,2022-03-06,5.0,Finance Manager,"I've been here since college and consistently had great bosses, awesome benefits, and decent work-life balance. I believe in the pipeline long-term, the leadership has always been solid, strong financials, and the Credo values are evident in many of the decisions being made. People usually join and stay for a while. There has been great improvement in the DE&I areas (strong ERG support, lots of diverse leadership).","Getting raises is like pulling teeth. Bonus compensation can be impacted by your sector's overall performance (Pharma usually getting the best bonuses). Culture is extremely political so performance ratings many times seem unfair. Really difficult to rotate into the Pharma sector if you don't have prior experience. Long Term Incentive (stocks/RSUs) structure isn't great - if you're lucky enough to get them below the director level, 0% vest until year 4. Pension was fantastic when I joined but they've adjusted it significantly downward and there is the risk of further adjustments."

8,Johnson & Johnson,Huge Dosappointment,2022-03-19,2.0,Sr. Marketing Manager,If you are good at putting on shows (eg puppet) you will do well here.,"It’s all about kissing up and diversity.  White men need not apply, unless you are gay or a transexual.  Even if you stay with them for 15 years or more they will find a way to “eliminate your job” before you hit retirement age of 55 - when you get their pension.  If they force you out before 55 you get 60% of your pension.  Huge lawsuit waiting to happen here!

Also, they are very far behind in digital marketing.  Better to go with a company that is using big data so you can stay relevant!!!"

110,Johnson & Johnson,J&J Fails at Being Competitive Employer in Bay Area & Robotic Med Devices,2022-01-31,2.0,Project Manager,"- Work life balance is pretty great. PTO, Family Time, and Holidays add up to around 32 days off per year. Also Summer Fridays (9/80 schedule between Memorial Day and Labor Day) is a nice option.

- The technical engineering staff working at the Santa Clara site are top tier. I've never worried about the individual contributors on my teams not delivering on their work promises.

- The Robotic platform being worked on at the Santa Clara site is unique enough, and despite it's current challenges can be a viable product with market space available.","- When risks are being communicated as having been realized, management says we need to maintain the schedule and that the conversations should be taken offline. No subsequent conversations are had and schedule stays behind. Then teams get frustrated that other parts of the organization are falling behind.

- Favoritism within organization means that program priorities have been determined by who's the favorite, rather than by which organization is most at risk or on the critical path.

- Management keeps saying that site attrition is stable, despite extremely tenured engineering and management talent continually flocking away from the company for other local jobs.

- Johnson & Johnson has selected management for the Bay Area Robotics And Digital solutions (RAD) sites who are woefully uninterested in doing what it takes to attract and retain talent in the area.

- They offered a milestone based package for Bay Area employees which was impossible to attain, then told the teams it was our fault for not holding up to our end of the deal during. JnJ then turned around and said publicly that the delay is related to the pandemic and global chip shortage.

- I was part of the Verb Surgical acquisition, and the culture shift between the two organizations was tragic. Under Verb we leveraged our Google connections to replicate that culture (fast, collaborative, fun), under J&J we've slowed down and have regressed our culture to match the staleness of big Med Device.

- When J&J acquired Verb Surgical, they cancelled stock options of employees by stacking the Verb board with J&J executives. They have consistently proven they will always screw over the employees in pursuit of a few extra thousand dollars."

122,Johnson & Johnson,Don’t Buy The Hype,2022-01-20,2.0,"Manager, Analytics","The benefits are very good, including good health, insurance, a pension (although the formula keeps changing and it’s not as good as it used to be) and 401k with 6% match. Work\Life balance is entirely rile and manager dependent. Some roles are great and allow flexibility, others not so much. Same goes for people leaders. Before the announcement of the consumer sector spin off, there was a lot of rotational opportunities.","Where to begin….senior leadership doesn’t have a clue. They are so out of touch with employees it’s frightening. Open seating (no set seat, open focus rooms) is the worst concept of all time. Taking important calls from the parking lot or cafeteria is a common occurrence because there is no open space to meet. Most buildings face overcrowding. The new “JNJ Flex” work policy where there are 2 work from home days, one that is assigned to you and Friday is a complete joke. It’s not flexible at all and frankly it was a last ditch effort to keep up with other companies that were offer more flexibility. Don’t buy the hype. They say all Manager and Senior Manager positions are “eligible” for equity compensation, but that’s a lie. There’s almost always none left after covering all the directors and their guaranteed comp. Don’t be fooled, it’s not going to happen so don’t bank on it, even if you get an Exceed on your performance review. Any senior leader in the company worth a darn has left in the past few months and the spin out of consumer products is a disaster. Frankly, if you are thinking of join, don’t buy into the hype of a wonderful culture. It definitely was several years ago, but it’s gone down hill quickly. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a strong company that’s generally well regarded but it’s not quite what it seems."

To get your foot in the door, 8 times out of 10 (Not all the time, but pretty much) you’re going to need a referral that carries weight. Once you’re here you’ll be surrounded by the best in the business, but to expand you’ll need a healthy combo of being amazing at your job and being on the radar of the right people. JNJ is made up of over 250 subsidiary companies. If you’re willing to play the game (Not lose your integrity, but hustle), and you lean into a the JNJ Credo, your growth can be exponential. And if you ever decide to leave (Why would you and lose out on that sweet pension?) you’ll be able to go and work almost anywhere else and command top dollar. Very meaningful work with opportunities for stretch assignments and talent development program. Company provides up to 20k for surrogacy.","No real complaints. The 401(K) match could be higher, but given the pension I figure it comes out in the wash. There are some teams that lack serious diversity, which is likely a result of the “Relationships” culture, but the company has made recent commitments to addressing DEI."

Overall the mission and the credo is real - everyone can know they had a part in positively impacting over a billion people per day.","In Technology, there is either a 70% overlap in roles or 100% gap. Organizational management is atrocious. There is a constant feud between Business Unit IT and Shared-Services IT. I've been here for 11 years on both sides in 7 different roles, I promise you that previous assessment is not myopic. Huge amount of waste in the Tech Product Management lifecycle is extremely high. There is generally more people doing project management / coordination tasks on a project then there is people defining, designing, building, testing, deploying and supporting a product. I often have to go on ""status update"" tours (remember TPS reports from the movie ""Office Space"") every time something happens. Look this is a great company but the bloat is enormous. If you are someone looking for a pension after 40 years of working the same job 30-40 hours a week, this place is for you. After reaching middle management, it's extremely hard to move up further without spending the majority of the time in a political ruse.

Despite your job title, years of experience, or education, if you are a woman under the age of 35, you are automatically an executive assistant. It’s genuinely appalling to see leadership openly delegating responsibilities between women and men with the exact same title and the woman automatically is asked to take notes or order lunch every. single. time. The daily sexism is so pervasive that it’s just a normal part of life at JnJ. Senior leadership is a boys club that openly throws around inappropriate comments and won’t think twice about escorting female colleagues by placing a hand on the small of her back. It is even worse for LGBT+ employees who, despite all the corporate newsletters on diversity and inclusion, live in fear of being outed to leadership. Many folks who are out in their personal lives assume a heteronormative persona in the office under the strict, unspoken “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy of senior leaders for fear of being passed up for advancement. Attempting to take your concerns to HR will do nothing but put a target on your back. The senior leadership not only turns a blind eye, but actively rewards this toxic behavior in managers. It’s profoundly disappointing that an organization of this size with truly innovative tech cannot protect or retain its top talent due to business practices straight out of the 1950s."

The work you do is purposeful and value driven.

The vast majority of the employees are kind, well-intentioned, and highly qualified human beings.","At the end of the day, the company is a product of the people it hires and the people we hire reflect the values (good and bad) that are present in society. This means that along with moral and ethical people, we also hire people of questionable morals and ethics. If these people have the ""right relationships and connections"", these people will be protected from the consequences of legally and ethically questionable decision making and harassment of coworkers. Be judicious about which groups you join and who the hiring manager/supervisor is. You can go from a idyllic experience to a nightmarish one due to a change in manager and you will have no recourse."

This pushes a focus on training for existing employees and new roles for new hires coming in. 

Although your experience may vary depending on your team, I personally have found that all leaders are very open to new ideas and will push you for feedback based on your experiences. If you feel something can be done better - your feedback will be valued.

* Don’t expect any stock rewards unless you’re management.

* No investment in individuals – long term incentive plans are tied to impossible milestones

* Lots of talk about the Credo, little in action. 

* Upper management is in a different world and seems indifferent to the concerns of the rank and file. No transparency whatsoever. We ask many questions during our weekly calls, but few ever get straight answers. Some don’t even get a response, and answers are rarely written down or recorded so you have to rely on management to not change their opinion.

* Constant pressure to go into the office, even when you’ve stated your health concerns with COVID. You’re an essential employee if you’re R&D… better to be an engineer at a company where you can work at home."

CEO talks a big game on D&I but everything breaks down at management level. Middle management sucks! They had so many reorgs they are running on bare bones with both people and dollar resources. They have affinity bias to hire and advance those that look like them. Senior leadership is too busy to manage their middle management. HR only worries about saving company from lawsuits. Employees of color have no support or advancement opportunities. Company tried to listen to its black and brown employees recently but failed to take any action because they are afraid of reverse racism and lawsuits. I wont encourage anyone to join J&J at this time.

Many long tenured employees regurgitating the same ideas and can’t keep up with how the market is evolving in their sectors. The brand is tired and they are resistant to any meaningful change to bring it into this millennium. Diversity and inclusion efforts are disappointing and disingenuous.

If you don't know about J&J's commitment to The Credo, I suggest that you stop reading now and go research it. The Credo lives in everyone I have worked with and is the driving force for all decisions that are made in the company. 

Benefits, work-life balance, compensation, very intellectually stimulating work, and opportunities at every corner. If the density of your work is great and the quality outstanding (that doesn't mean if you work 50+ hours per week) you get to choose what you work on and can pivot to new projects very easy. There is opportunity to travel in the IT sector which gives you the ability to network, connect, and learn about all of the different business units; you get to see how your work in IT is impacting the lives of millions.","Some might see this as a con, and thus why I have included it in this section. 

No one is ever given anything in life and the same goes about promotional and advancement opportunities. If you are not willing to put in the leg-work to manage your goals and objectives,  educational opportunities, certifications, etc., then you may find it difficult to advance in the company. I see this as an opportunity to advance one's self starting skillset. Advocation and self-starting are critical attributes if you wish to advance to senior leaderships. 

As with many large enterprise companies, there are politics at play. A good understanding of psychology can help mitigate this."

Wash, rinse, repeat and you are on your way to the retirees winner's circle. Be sure not to rock the boat in your last 5 years of retirement and collect as many direct reports as possible because you will need to shave a few off every few years to make it look like you are being efficient.

J&J has a terrible company culture. Mediocrity and incompetence are rewarded. Leadership promotes based on who they like, zero evaluation of employee's skills. Lots of paper pushers because talented people are ""threats"" to the middle management who are extremely lazy. HR protects managers and directors while using buzzwords to make it sound like they are inclusive and care about talent. Most talented engineers leave early career if they can - once you reach a certain mid career ""level"", it is hard to leave and so you are basically stuck. J&J's acquisitions are a joke - they essentially botch every one of them by gutting the acquired company and bringing in their less talented and less competent management."

1245,Johnson & Johnson,Experience is based on the sector you are in,2019-10-06,2.0,Director,Compensation is good with annual bonus and long term incentives i.e. stock plans. Pension is rare in a public sector company and J&J offers one. There are some wonderful and talented people who are dedicated and passionate. Potential for some very good experiences but highly based on your manager and area of the organization. It can be a good company. Avoid the Medical Devices sector like the plague.,The CREDO is nothing more than some words carved in granite as most leadership ignores most of the tenants and act in direct contradiction of them. Employees are encouraged to speak up however it's window dressing as there most definitely will be ramifications for doing so. The culture in the Medical Devices sector is toxic and leadership is extremely poor. I can't speak for the Pharmaceutical or Consumer sectors however.  Leaders who implement failed strategy after failed strategy resulting in poor growth and reduced revenues just get shuffled around into different while they constantly cut lower level employees to compensate.

1484,Johnson & Johnson,Limited Growth and Opportunities,2019-09-08,2.0,Inventory Control Specialist,"Lots of training, good culture, benefits and work life balance.","Paygrade limits nearly every opportunity available.  Its extremely difficult to work your way up through the ranks; and it may be better to leave and come back since internal experience carries significantly less weight than external. For example to be considered for a position, your paygrade can't be more that one or two positions removed from the one your looking at; regardless of what you actually do and your actual experience. You would then need to also already be (titled) in that position, since they only ""hire the best"". Which in there eyes would be someone who already has the experience and title; again regardless of internal needs or considerations. Its not so different than many other companies in this way; to help ward against nepotism. But that and the paygrade ceilings hurts professional growth. I've had several rotational bosses in a positions I would be eligible for except for my paygrade.

Lastly their mergers and acquisitions are super hit and miss. If J&J buys your company it may be time to look elsewhere."
