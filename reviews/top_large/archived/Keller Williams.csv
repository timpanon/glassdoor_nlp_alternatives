Too much gossip about others, even customers. Toxic work environment. Too much work including leaderships work that is put off on you if they don’t want to do it. Not enough training. Leadership is always “too busy” to guide you if you need it. Exclusion of whose hired and whose not even if you are part of mgmt. If you don’t gossip about others and like drama then you are automatically a bad egg and you must go, regardless of how well you do your job.

You can have the best training, resources, management and plans in the world but if talking to strangers, asking people for anything (including their business), and/ or hearing your phone ring makes you physically ill there's not much that will change that. I actively worked against all of my innate traits and preferences to ""be good"" at real estate. I earnestly tried. Now I don't and as a result the majority of money I have made in RE has come from buying and selling my personal homes, the rest has come from referring out of town friends and family to other agents.

692,Keller Williams,Local KW needs major overhaul,2021-06-13,2.0,Real Estate Agent,"Company has a number of top producers and long time agents, and backed by the biggest international real estate brand, with access to quality training and systems that agents can make use of, if they choose.","1) Network Marketing Model that is so focused on having to be the biggest company with the most number of agents, regardless of the quality of the agents hired. 
2) High turnover of key leadership positions, and General Manager or Statewide manager that is only focused on her office in Santa Fe and could care less about Albuquerque. 
3) Agents are just numbers. It's hard to get support from the office staff and qualifying broker when needed because they are so busy putting out fires and answering questions for new agents. 
4) KW has good training programs as a company, but it's focus on training has made it a magnet for brand new agents, often lured in by the network marketing model and false hope that they will build a valuable downline. 
5) Office politics , favoritism, and in some cases, discrimination , are frequent practices due at least one of the local owners and more than one staff member. 
6) Businesses within the business -- Agents wanting to earn more money or have additional revenue streams can become business coaches, BOLD coaches, push mortgages, or form teams despite having little to no experience or qualifications to do so. They usually last 6 months or a year before onto something else. 
7) The company got too big too quick, lacks focus, and needs leadership that is established and reputable in the real estate industry. 
8) The Leadership Council is a joke. It's the same 10 agents year after year after year after year. They must have egos so big that they think the company will fail if they aren't at the center of it. Wrong.... if they think they are so valuable as leaders in the company, they should apply for one of the leadership positions next time there is an opening. 
9) They company still has some good agents , but should own the fact that they've lost a lot more good ones over the last 5 years than they've kept or gained. 
10) Quality matters more than quantity. So does integrity, honesty, professionalism."

They continue to add more features without concern or thought on if it will break, which it does most of the time. Sometimes causing you to loose all of your client information and progress. 

If you're looking to work internationally instead such as tech support, product manager etc, expect a far worse experience, EVER DAY! Management is terrible, smile in your face but throw you under the bus, completely lacking in leadership or human decency. Oh and don't even expect that if you speak to HR they will do anything, as a matter of fact they will just terminate you for complaining and say it was something else despite clear retaliation. They will also tell you to do one thing and then the next day yell at you for following their directive. Its just a mess and not worth it. If you're not looking to be a realtor go elsewhere, even McDonald's treats its employees better. Oh and there's no career opportunities, its all about favoritism and turn burn mentality.",Everything but glassdoor requires me to add more characters.

1222,Keller Williams,KW review,2020-11-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,At first I thought pros would be the training an technology but after a year I dont think thats the case anymore.,Im sure alot of people love KW. But over the year Ive learned a few things. Your checks wont be available for weeks after closing. Sales meetings are pointless and just a waste of time. Thier technology and apps are always crashing so clients dont use them. Office is very clicky to point noone really seems friendly. C.E. classes cost a butt ton of money when other local companies pay for it. Overall..KW isnt for new agents. Their contract has more pages for the profit share program than anything else. Office is depressing. And the team splits make no sense an not worth it. If your new id advise against hanging license at KW Greater Omaha. The suppport staff just isnt supportive. New agents are over looked an mishandled big time.
1223,Keller Williams,Brokerage is more about money than they are about helping,2020-12-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not too many I can think of at this point,"To preface this, Real estate agents get out what they put in, and i sold out to the real estate game while i was at KW. Everything has a cost, they are going to tax you at every chance they can. The classes and trainings that are held are done by current agents. I have been in trainings that I knew more than the agent holding the training, and ive been in real estate for 1 1/2 years. If you know nothing about real estate and want to wait for 3+ days for them to provide your check, give away 30% of your money every transaction you have, not hear back from management anytime you make a call, KW is the brokerage for you."

Tons of classes to take that really help you speak the language of real estate and know what you’re doing.,During the training program they take 50% of your commission and then 6% more for the franchise fee so it totals 56% gone which is a ton for a new agent to hand over after struggling to get those sales.

HR seems to have your back any time you ask for help and they really seem to care

-You're forced to go to 2 real estate conventions a year, share a hotel room with a randomly chosen coworker for one, use only their mode of transportation if you want transportation covered, and get a daily stipend of only $25. You'll be giving product demos.
-No support for learning at all- not even PTO for conventions where you've paid the registration and transportation or tech certs where you've paid for the training and course. If you want to get better, you have to do projects on your own time that won't benefit KWRI at all because KWRI doesn't implement many new projects and you're always overloaded with the existing projects. But if you don't do projects on your own time all night and weekend, you'll never go further in this industry because you'll be tied to KW's obsolete tech choices. You have no autonomy to implement anything else during your work hours and you'll end up learning bad coding practices if you rely only on KW.
-Your coworkers in IT/eng will primarily be overseas contractors, limiting time you have access to them
-Things used to change on a whim all the time. We're getting better at this, sometimes."

At the very minimum there should at least be a requirement to shadow for a day or take a ""welcome"" course. I was a brand new agent with no idea how to do ANYTHING. Dotloop is not an easy program to start with, I had no idea where to even find the real estate forms initially, etc. It was a lot of hype and false promises and I very quickly became disgusted by the obsessiveness to recruit.

1293,Keller Williams,"Models, Systems, Consistency, Culture and Support = Growth",2020-09-10,5.0,Team Leader,"When I became an agent - I found the training and support was available to set me up for success. When I became a Team Leader, yes, my One Thing is to attract agents to our Market Center and I also consult with my top 20%. The owners that buy the Market Centers, agree up front to share their profit with the Agents - that's Culture! KW as of August 2020 has profit shared over $1.7 Billion. We have the only End to End platform called Command to run the agent's business. Built by Agents for Agents. There are opportunities all around my agents, so they have options as they grow their business. We are diversified as we come from about 18 different countries and speak a dozen languages. Our agents do not have to compete with me or my broker. I love my job, my owner, my team and of course my agents!",I can't think of any. Some may think it's the Cost of Sales - I think of it as a Pro because it's fixed and our agents CAP then keeping 100% of their commission.

1299,Keller Williams,Get ready to give 46% commission away!,2020-09-19,3.0,REALTOR&Reg;,Great for brand new agents. Training for lead generation is great. Lots of resources (classes and videos) to help guide you.,"They don’t tell you how to actually do a transaction, only how to lead gen so you must hire a transaction coordinator ($400/transaction). If you’re not already best friends with a successful agent, you have to pay for help through coaching club which they STRONGLY encourage, which takes 10% of your commission then another 6% for KW royalty fees. Your 70/30 split turns into a 54/46 commission split!! You’re locked into coaching club for an entire year and caps at $9k/year. Definitely not worth it. Don’t forget to add in $400 for your transaction coordinator and $89 monthly KW fee. Once you have a couple of transactions under your belt, drop KW and go to a boutique broker than can give you closer to 100% commission. At KW you’re just paying for the name. At the end of the day, nobody cares which realty you’re with; only that you (the agent) is available and you do your job well, making sure your client is happy."

1404,Keller Williams,"Making Money in Real Estate is simple, but not easy",2020-04-01,5.0,Realtor,"In reading some of these reviews, I feel very fortunate to have the office and managing broker I have. They have high standards for administrative staff and accessibility, and invite constructive feedback whenever offered. The positivity and helpfulness oozing from the agents and staff make going to the office an experience that makes my day.

While I haven't applied myself as much as I should or could have from the many trainings I've taken, I've seen several agents go from fumbling newbies to grossing hundreds of thousands in a few short years. Each of them attest it to believing and applying the training and/or coaching they've received with the company. 

Something a lot of these other reviewers have to remember, or be taught, is that being a real estate agent means you are a small business owner. There is no regular salary or benefits. Your income relies solely on your ability to close deals, no one else. While each office is indeed different, the culture does reach pretty much everywhere and the million dollar producers will generally be helpful and answer questions you may have. Seek advice, show value and promise, don't wait for business to come to you, go find it.","Technology roll out has been very bumpy over the past 2 years. The features are phenomenal on paper, but have not been properly executed yet.  Launching it in bits and pieces before fully de-bugging each piece makes for a frustrating user experience, especially for non tech apt agents."

1550,Keller Williams,Problems with Splits and Cliques,2019-10-09,3.0,Agent,"Nice office, they do offer classes","The cliques here are pretty ridiculous. If you don't have the right designer gear, perfect highlights, luxury car, and haircut, don't expect to make friends or be included in things. Also, as a non-Christian, I felt uncomfortable sometimes. The whole impression of the agents I ran into there was that a lot of it was a facade. They're nice to you if they think that you fit in with them and/or they think they can get some kind of benefit from you (getting you to join their team) or even referrals if you decide to leave the business.

The splits are another problem. You have to pay 30% to the company, plus an additional 6% as a ""franchise fee"". The franchise fee is $3000 a year, and the cap is $15000, so that's $18k out of your pocket that goes to Keller WIlliams, IF you're able to cap and go to 100% after that, until the year starts over. On top of that, if you are struggling, they encourage you to go to classes that cost money."

You better be an extravert to a fault if you want any sort of acknowledgement in the group. You'll be silently expected to work when you're not at work, and you won't get paid for it or get a thank you. Turnover is very high. Think of this as a temporary job and you'll be fine.

The systems and models are present to follow to build a solid sales career.,Culture and energy can vary from market center to market center so it's not always a fit in every market.

1571,Keller Williams,Don’t waste your time with this office,2019-10-18,1.0,Real Estate Agent,Meetings provide free food weekly.,This office is like a revolving door. Serious lack of communication when it comes to asking questions.  They avoid you! Trying to get help as a new agent is slim to none. It’s all about money. They seem to rely on their classes rather than train you or provide any kind of advice. Going to one of the  agents who are successful is a threat to them as they want to be the best with no competition. When you get open houses it’s at the locations where there will be little to no traffic. I lost a deal because I wasn’t given the incorrect information when it came to looking properties.
1572,Keller Williams,Great place to work and grow.,2019-09-14,5.0,Agent,Training and the mentoring you get is awesome.,Cost of becoming a real estate agent is tough.

You have to keep  videos in the same format so creativity is pretty low. Also the pay wasn't't great for what was being demanded.

1582,Keller Williams,Extremely rewarding but difficult to start out as an individual,2019-09-05,5.0,Realtor,"Training is second to none, they preach mindset as much as they preach technical knowledge.
Excellent work culture, everyone is willing to help anyone
Once you ""cap"" you earn 100% of your commission","You're a commission only worker. There's no base salary, which is exactly how a sales job needs to be.
It's tough to start out and grow your database. It also requires a monetary investment in the licensing for yourself."
1583,Keller Williams,Don’t believe the hype!,2019-10-10,1.0,Realtor,Lots of training and technology (almost to the point of confusing).,"They only care about making a ridiculous amount of profits from their agents. By structuring itself as “a technology  company”, they do well at helping cut throat agents to make tons in commissions, but in reality, they are a giant pyramid scheme. Every sale made has a portion of those dollars trickled up 7 levels with the final level being the co-founder, CEO and chairman, Gary Keller. Their main goal is to bring on as many agents as possible with an unrealistic goal of EVERYONE doing the most sales in the local market. To this end, they have high turnover of non-paid brokers and lowly paid administrative staff. Definitely not the place to be for any trustworthy and respectable real estate agent."
1584,Keller Williams,"Cult, Brainwashing",2019-10-12,1.0,Agent,Some of the training was valuable.,"So many!  Very cult like atmosphere.  They heavily douse you in the Kool-Ade, and if you have the brains to question anything, or have an opinion...(disregarding the do not call list, meddling in personal lives of agents), then you aren't valuable.  So much mandatory training that you don't have time to actually try to sell anything.  Too much technology that you are expected to learn and use, even when it's flawed.  Playing favorites, and not allowing everyone to join a team if they need to (to gain experience).  I asked about it, and was told the teams weren't hiring, but then hired several new young agents who were in training classes with me.  A LOT more red tape and paperwork than other agencies.  So many fees that by the time we got to the closing table, my share was about 1/2 of what it is with my new company.  They act very egotistical, and as if they are better than everyone else.  They hate Zillow, but are trying to dominate the market just like Zillow is."
1585,Keller Williams,Hard work treated like trash,2019-09-20,2.0,Real Estate Manager,No Pros..... got off early which is good for work life balance.,Everything. You're basically treated like crap all day and doing dirty work.

Still a great plan for such a small employer.","If you thrive on negativity with no positive feedback this is the department (ISA) for you.   This department is not welcoming to new employees and their turn over has proven that.  The company's health insurance plan is expensive and has subpar coverage.  You are required to cold call people who are on the ""do-not-call"" registry - not just once, but several times.   There is a ton of arrogance in the management of this company; they believe they do everything perfectly and there is no room for improvement.  If you don't agree with everything they say, you are considered un-coachable.   The commission structure for an ISA for the work involved for that commission is extremely subpar.  Your commission is also dependent on someone else's sales abilities so you are basically a glorified appointment maker."

1621,Keller Williams,Great Training,2019-08-21,4.0,Real Estate Agent,I started working for Keller Williams right after passing the exam. I interviewed with a couple different companies but KW put an emphasis on training which was a huge incentive. I feel like most places will leave you to fend for yourself but KW offered a one week training session which I took advantage of and asked as many questions as possible. Real estate school can only teach you so much. I worked with a mentor for 4 transactions (he received a portion of my commission) and it was necessary and a huge help.,Unfortunately those training seminars did not happen on a regular basis.

There is an exodus of talented people running out the door.

All the talk is about about pivoting into a tech company, but no one really knows what that means and the “tech” being produced is flawed and there is no business or profit model behind it.

New Kelle App System is great tool.,"Strange cheerleading team meetings with several agents hogging the spotlight just to talk about how great they are, with thinly disguised belittling of their peers' (perceived) lack of ambition.  Seems to be no apparent oversight from management. Self-proclaimed strong value-system, with little day-to-day evidence, unless a camera/advertising is involved."

1732,Keller Williams,awful,2019-05-04,1.0,Realtor,ZERO. There are NO Pros to working here.,"No leads provided. Mandatory cold calling 3 hours a day with no regard to the Do Not Call List. Telemarketing/cold calls are NOT the only way to generate leads (what year is this!?) however they tell agents that they will fail if they don't spend 21 hours a week doing this. Absolutely NO support, expensive monthly fees (even though you do not get your own desk and the commission split is abysmal), expensive mandatory classes and books that are unhelpful,  HUGE pressure on agents to pay thousands of dollars for expensive motivational self help seminars and bogus""coaching"".  Terrible commission splits. Weird cult/EST vibe.  GOD is the first thing mentioned in the company mission statement. Religion should not have anything to do with a brokerage firm.  Feels more like a MLM/Pyramid/Ponzi than a real estate brokerage firm. Team leaders/Coaches are more focused on recruiting new agents than on fostering the growth of their agents. How can you receive any real training and  help if your coach is too busy trying to recruit agents all day every day while ""coaching"" 50 new agents? The answer is you can't. Too much emphasis on  ""having a positive mindset"" and other vague unhelpful mantras you would find in something like the book The Secret. Not enough emphasis on making sure the agents follow Real Estate Laws, know what they are doing and are prepared for listing presentations, showings,  contracts and any problems that may arise.  Major rip off."

My office, in particular, has a really positive culture and environment.","The business model of KW offices encourages agents to ""cap"" annually so our office has a few more expenses covered for agents to increase their business than other KW offices. In terms of this, our office is only willing to pay so much for their staff wages. So requesting a raise is nearly impossible, even top administrative management doesn't receive annual raises."

Great culture, respect for staff, friendly, hardworking, and extremely knowledgeable. All agents are willing to learn, and are very supportive.","The ownership at this company is a complete disaster. This corrupt group of people will use you to any extent they are able, and in the end, no matter the efforts on the employees end, it will not be sufficient. Greedy to no end, and they will always do whatever is necessary to save their profit, which means there is no return investments into the company, or in the growth of others. Be warned that the second you stand up for yourself during mistreatment, whether hazing, or other, the ownership will immediately label you as useless, and it will be the end of your positive, professional relationship. It is unfortunately impossible to ever outlive this label while being employed at the company. They are extremely unappreciative of even their best staff members, and needlessly aggressive towards people, at the drop of a hat. Favoritism is clearly shown for those that support the owner's egos, and they will do whatever they can to undermine you in your relationships with others. They are skilled in their manipulation, and it's shocking the extent they'll go, to make their stories believable to those who have yet to see their true colors."

KW believes in training their associates no matter how big or small they want their real estate business to be. Whether you are just starting out, or you want to grow a massive team, KW has the training for you! KW is also the industry leader for technology. KW Command is the best end-to-end sales platform for real estate agents. KW technology will help you save time, money, and help you stand out to the consumer. Lastly- Keller Williams culture is the mortar that holds the value together. KW believes in win-win or no deal, everyone succeeds together, and in results thru people.","Leads will not get handed to you on a silver platter, KW will teach you how to fish. You can make millions or you can make nothing, it's all up to what you put into it. It's not about working harder, it's about working smarter.

KW is not the cheapest brokerage you can pick, yet it has the most value for what you do pay. If paying the least amount of money is most important to you than this might not be the place for you. If MAKING the most amount of money possible is most important to you, then do your business a favor and talk to KW."

Educational opportunities.","No HR  or supervision to protect W2 employees/staff of the teams in KW.  I worked for three separate teams as their operations manager and all refused to pay overtime, stating it was my responsibility to not work more than 40 hours per week.

Again, because you are working for independent agents, they get to choose benefits. In my case, I was never offered any and have had to pay for my health insurance out of pocket.

Bonus structure is based on the agent's number of closings. If they sell several million-dollar listings and choose to take the rest of the year off because they reached their volume goal, you have to suffer the consequences as the employee."

They have a ton of training to help you get off the ground.,"Their training system is mostly geared towards those who are new to real estate and/or sales. So for someone with years of sales experience but new to real estate, there is a lot of redundant information. If you are already an experienced agent, you will find yourself with a good company to link up with especially if your expertise is CRE as their comp plan is very favorable.  Unfortunately, I fell in the middle with a decade of sales but no CRE and the training is mostly for residential."
1779,Keller Williams,"Good (but not ""the best"")",2019-03-12,3.0,Sales Agent,"Great friendliness and plentiful trainings during the day to sit in on. People are 'nice' to you, but unless you are a mega-agent you really have trouble pinning down any leadership to talk to you as a person/agent(kind of a pro and con).","Leaders are ALSO competing for same business you are, so... Training can eat up your time, but w/o training you can't excel - web based anytime training is a better option.  Because leaders are beating pavement, it can be hard to get quality one on one time. Mentorship model is better than training model in my opinion. Honestly, splits with KW are HUGE, especially if you join a team - how is an agent supposed to ""win"" and ""crush it"" when they are giving up 55% of their 3% to team while still having 33% taken out until the 21K cap/royalty is met. Do THAT math to see what I mean. Just not feasible unless you are a unicorn and get in on a unicorn opportunity with a unicorn lead. High office fees even if you are not benefiting from access to office, but you have to rent a cube in the office if you want an in office 'spot'."

They do have a support staff that will help you, but if you want any real coaching or mentorship they will make you pay for it someway.  They are a popular brand name, and you will have a lot of access to successful agents there and opportunities to potentially link up with them or join there teams.","They charge high desk fees.  Any real training or mentorship, beyond there basic sales training, they will make you pay for it.  They will give you no leads.  You can sign up for desk time, but I got one deal out of that in a year, and I was lucky to get that.  They will offer you little support.  It's all a numbers game, so the more agents they sign up to the brokerage, the more desk fees and money they're bringing in.  Knowing that 9/10 agents fail the first year, it's a revenue stream they created and they don't really care if you succeed or not.  My advice is go to work at a smaller company or a property management company where they can give you leads and you can learn the business and build your clientele, instead of learning how to make cold calls and practice cold call scripts for weeks on end.  Upper management does not care about you, you're just a statistic to them!"

Some numbers are wrong number or out of service.,"Worked here part time for 2 years, went to numerous training classes.  The classes after a while repeat the same info, it’s really just to get your spirits up when you’re a new agent.  It would be better if someone gave you real confidence and sat you down to show you how to fill out listing agreement, etc.  The mentor stated he would go on appointments to help you close deals but he was busy trying to help 50 other new agents, work his own stuff so even if you got someone interested for a listing appointment you were never sure of availability of mentor and his schedule.  What are you supposed to do tell the person you’ll call them back and check with Eddie.  He should have had his schedule in Dropbox or on share point with available slots. Worked at landmark in Bayside/ Flushing and it was so cliquey run by really fake women that would walk off when you needed help for cigarette breaks and go missing. I went to summer picnic once and asked to get in softball game, no one even said hello to me, didn’t let me play.  No one subbed out.  Huge favoritism with big teams in office.  If you are part time or new don’t waste your time, or $55/ month and they are so annoying with business cards and proofs.  This is there approach to get leads- network sphere of influence, call leads daily and door knock which in pretty sure is illegal in are now.  So mainly networking.

They claim to be the best trainers with this fantastic mentor program. Everyone gets the same mentors and they dont help you do anything, but they gladly take a huge chunk of your first couple commissions. They give you access to this online system that spams you all day with emails basically asking for you to give them more money. If you're a stay at home spouse who has access to unlimited amounts of money and you want to pretend like you have a real job this is great for you.

My experience with Keller Williams could be summed up as miserable. I came into the group I was with as an administrative assistant with zero experience in real estate. My team leader was a KW coach and spent the majority of her days do that and never properly trained me. When I would tell her at the end of every week how overwhelmed I was, she would consistently tell me that I’ll figure it out, rather than actually taking the time to help me. I would get twenty new things thrown at me every morning with in the first five minutes I walked through the door, then when I would ask a question about something she would snap at me and say that I should know how to do it. It is safe to say there was a large lack of disrespect. As far as salary, I am a college graduate with a bachelors degree and was not paid close to the minimum entry level salary. With the amount of crazy thrown at me, that salary was a slap in the face. It is safe to say I will never do business with Keller Williams in the future or recommend the company to anyone."

There are always classes going on. They want agents to brand themselves rather than just the KW brand.

If maps had said that one person giving the speech was their own and they don't endorse it then I would have stayed but maps never commented and I tried contacting them several times. I believe this is part of kws regular routine to tell people to charge their credit cards for their programs.

Therefore, they don't really act as team leaders as you would expect to have a go-to person. 
Fees are high as in any brokerage that works commission splits.

Once I joined, my “sponsor” was MIA and I received no training or leads from her.  They do offer lots of training, mostly KW specific though.  If you join a team or try to apprentice under a seasoned agent, make sure you have an agreement to be paid an hourly wage and a cut of their commission.   The “family reunions” and BOLD trainings are just another opportunity for corporate to line their pockets. As long as you are paying that monthly fee and paying for specialized coaching, etc., they are happy enough with you.  This is not a part-time job.

Straight forward commission structure.","Market Centers can become too big as they are constantly bringing in new agents. We have over 320 agents in my MC

Business model is a bit antiquated."
2264,Keller Williams,"Good Belief System, Bad Practices",2017-12-30,2.0,Director of First Impressions,"Good business model, many of the agents are nice to work with.",Leadership is non-existent. People at the managerial level treat other staff with a complete lack of respect.

2266,Keller Williams,Keller Williams Residential Real Estate Agent,2017-12-16,5.0,,"This is a great place to become a Keller Williams agent. The Keller Williams Los Angeles educational curriculum and training program, mentorship program, and special workshops taught by the staff and preferred partners are very helpful. And the office space is extremely modern, beautiful and expansive, located on the 29th floor with sweeping views of Los Angeles.","If you don’t like the hustle and bustle of the vibrant Downtown LA, then this real estate office will not be for you."
2267,Keller Williams,Agent,2017-12-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Agents have a lot of resources available to them. Access to coaches and classes which are especially helpful to those just getting started in real estate.,"Commission splits are tough starting out. A typical split that new agents will get is 70/30 which doesn't sound terrible. However, you also have to pay a 5% coaching fee and a 6% royalties fee for every transaction. So you actually give up an extra 11% of your GROSS commission until you cap out for the year. 

For example, say you get a lease commission for $1000.00. $300 goes to the broker, $50 for coaching, $60 for royalties. So of the original $1000 you are left with $590 and you still have to pay taxes on it. Keep in mind, every broker is different and there are plenty of people that are wildly successful under this system. Just be prepared when you start, have money in savings, or have side gigs lined up. Real Estate is an all or nothing game. Good luck!"

Then in the ignite class which is 2 hours they skip over important material and just have you sit there and listen to people talk, meanwhile the lesson is not taught how it should. So while you are in these classes your technology is still not set up because you don’t receive the proper emails. It’s a mess. Then they tell you to take BOLD which is a TOTAL waste of money, please don’t take this. This is a joke. Basically they tell you to go door knock, call FSBO’s for $800. Then to top it all off when you do have your first deal and you are all excited and you CALL the person who is supposed to help and they DON’T answer, WOW, that’s when you realize, WHAT AM I DOING IN THIS PLACE.

She is focused solely on building her name and company in this city and thinks it’s in her best interest to constantly have turnover because to her that means “people with new ideas”. Really it just means  “people who don’t know me yet and will adore me for a while.” Until they get sick of how she runs the place. Employees are salaried and it’s the unspoken rule that you stay well past 5 every day, even if your schedule is 8-5. I was stared at every time I left at 5:15, 5:20...

As an agent you have the freedom to be as successful as you want to be and the opportunity to learn as much as you want about the business.  I love the ideas the leaders have come up with and implemented for the company as a whole.  When management is available they are very helpful.  Experienced agents have been the best help.  For a big office the system is quite efficient.,"The company is so largely focused on recruitment and growth i think it misses connecting with the day to day people right in front of them.

Long work hours are required if you want to make a decent salary.  Top producers have to work much more than the average. Very strong accountability and self-training is required.

to begin with training is provided yet its not hands on & i personally have learned more from personal research than from going to training 
next, the commission split is 70/30. there are plenty other company's that can offer something more competetive, on top of that expect to pay about 90$ a month for mls, o&e insurance, fmls , etc. that doesnt even include an office space. you have to pay extra for that. all in all its fine if you have a developed business however as a new agent you will find it extremely difficult and stressful trying to be successful."

Helpful things were hard to find or locate. National KW leaders were proactive in coming up with new and better technology - but it sometimes took forever to roll out to the small time agents. 

Training available, but much of it was online and not necessarily current. Trainings offered at my brokerage were repetitive and once you've learned the topic - not useful. I offered suggestions for training at my brokerage that went ignored. 

Perhaps it depends on the brokerage you go to, but we never had a central person that you could go or call at any time for help in understanding basic concepts or for useful advice. The Team Leader's job was recruitment and keeping the top agents happy. 

The splits are OK if you are already successful, but for those starting out, don't expect to make much money.  You are paying for the brand."

They had the receptionist training us on how to use their database of contracts/forms and how to create our company website/profile. I was never told who is who in the office, so I struggled to know where to turn with various concerns or questions.  Way too many agents for a small office, so it was very easy to get lost in the crowd and feel like just a number. If you're a seasoned agent and like to work on your own, this office may be a good fit for you. I would not recommend this office to any newly licensed brokers. We all know we learn nothing about actually practicing real estate in real estate school.

But certainly not as a full time employee. I worked at a franchise location for 2+ years, got married and became pregnant. I was about two months away from my due date so I spoke to the brand new ""team leader""  about taking off for my maternity leave. She agreed and told me we woud have a meeting the next day. The next day I go into her office for our meeting, for what I think is going to be about my leave, and she fires me. Two months before i was due I get fired. Fired from a company whose core values are "" God, Family then business"", which is all a lie. So naturally I file for unemployment. Shortly after I start receiving unemployment, I get a letter in the mail stating that Keller Williams was appealing my unemployment and that I was to show up a court date, that happened to be very near to when my baby was due.  Sure enough, my child was born the day before the court date. I was able to get released from the hospital early and make it to the hearing, the day after having a baby!!  And now almost 7 years later of dealing with this awful company.  I am still dealing with the aftermath of unemployment. Because God forbid the company had kept me as an employee and pay me any maternity leave. So I will leave my long review with this... their core values of ""God, family then business"" are all lies."

They kept my card number on file once after running it once to pay one of their rip off fees, and yet they continue to bill me. I have called and emailed and they never respond, which leaves me with no other choice but to have my bank step in to dispute the unauthorized payments. If you are considering becoming an agent, or are an existing team member, check your bank account with a fine-toothed comb. They are scammers!"
2506,Keller Williams,Training But It Will Cost You,2017-03-09,3.0,Real Estate Agent,"If you want a culture that thrives on continual education and training then KW is a great place for you. 

Open door policy 
Flexible Schedule - You are an independent contractor you choose when to work and when to play.","Franchise - each office is run independently with a set of base guidelines and business rules that must be met to carry the KW branding. This allows for each office to be run differently and may not provide the same services as others that carry the KW branding. 
Training is unorganized and not geared towards someone who has never done the job before. 
COSTLY Fee- Unlike competition there is a fee for everything literally everything and its seen as a small fee $100 here $100 there. If you want to work in the office and in an actual work-space there is a fee for it. 
Advance Training- is highly pushed and again can range into the $1000's 
You get recruited and provided entry level training and then thrown to the wind and just told to lead generate, even if you have not a clue how to do that. 
Commission splits are high you must donate $20,000 to the company before you get your full commission, some competitors are much lower. 
Providing constructive feedback to upper management is seen as a negative and not well received.
DISC Personality Testing - the test is used for every position you attempt to apply for, even if you are already an agent with them and want to join a team, its a test that can be flawed and manipulated by the test taker yet is used in 99% of all decisions. 
Follow Up & Communication - Communication varies and follow up from other agents is either non-existent or not timely.
Transferring and Office Affiliation - Once you sign an agreement with one office it is highly frowned upon you switching to another KW office, I found the KW office 5 mins from me to be more convenient yet when I asked what the process would be to move there, my request basically landed on deaf ears."

2522,Keller Williams,Headquarters - IT Department Needs a Major Overhaul,2017-06-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Has great training for new realtor's.  Many current/former cheerleaders/theater people that are just waiting for the opportunity to cheer you on for doing your intended job.,"Potential new employees need to know things before working at KWRI Headquarters.    

This company claims to be about having a good God/Family/Life  balance, yet behind the scenes they have purposely created a ""fear mentality"".  Management wants employees to work in fear of losing their job, so they have done as much as possible to create this unhealthy environment.  Do not ever forget this, upper management is about money, and they will throw anyone under the bus to attain it.
 
This is a right to work state, and management is serious about that.  It is a CYA environment.  This is true for all departments.  Get everything in writing or be prepared to get thrown under the bus by management.  In the IT department, this ""thrown under the bus"" mentality is seen with the CIO (Chief Innovation Officer), and trickles down.  The CIO has even taken credit for ideas by other people and received a company ""brick of value"" in one of the monthly company staff meetings.

Do not get caught up during the hiring period that a low salary will be offset by the end of year bonus.  It is not worth it, so make sure you get a fair market salary, and don't except less.  Bonus is talked about as an offset to below market salary, but then top management discuss it as a gift.  A gift can be taken away at any time.  Don't fall for the bonus/gift trap, get a fair market salary.  If you take a below market salary, you will stay below while employeed at KWRI.  There is a yearly merit raise, which is up to 3% of your salary.  A manager gets 3-4% for each employee, then distributes it on how the manager sees fit.  If your manager likes you, good, if the manager does not like you, good luck.  The only way to get a larger raise is to get a level raise (which is 10% or less), which again is up to the manager, so previous sentence applies again.

In December, a certain woman picks a day to hand out what upper management calls a ""gift"", but are really bonus checks.  It is literally a song, and possibly a dance, show.  Your suppose to show how grateful you are, even though you earn the bonus.  And the person handing out the checks will decide what day the bonus will be handed out.  It is at their whim.  This gift is not worth what it takes to earn it, and each year we are reminded that it can be taken away."

Freedom with regards to hours, attire and making your office personal.","Too many to list.  The company culture promoted does NOT fall in line with an MCA's reality.  The realtors are obnoxious, rude and at times verbally abusive.  Our Team Leader would not help teammates. You could have three people at your desk, the receptionist out to lunch, two phone lines ringing and the UPS man needing a signature and the TM would walk away saying ""That's not my job.""  Guess what - it's all our jobs since we are the office staff.  You are on your own.  You can get training, but the realtors will pitch a fit and lie about not getting their checks on time because you weren't there to crank it out the minute they think you got the check from the title company. (Maybe it came, maybe it didn't. Doesn't matter to them - only that they ""think"" it's there.)  Not sure how you're supposed to train off-site and cut checks at the same time on-site, but that's what they expect.  You will be offered 3 weeks+ vacation/time-off, but be unable to use it.  If you figure out a way to get a day or two off, be prepared for being yelled at when you get back.  I was asked to do things I felt were dishonest.  Too many of the realtors at our MC were brand new.  There was a constant flow of disgruntled ones who weren't told upfront about the copious fees they owe.  What you see on walls promoted about culture and are told during the interview process does NOT match reality.  I was on at least 4+ hours of mandatory phone calls each week, required to back up our receptionist and other duties not related to finance - more than 25-30% of my week and still expected to do a full's week of my finance duties.  The conference calls are a total waste of time if you aren't a profitable MC.  The culture promotes using the same words over and over again until you want to throw up.  The word ""leverage"" is banned from my home.  Overall - the worst job I've ever had.  Had high expectations based on the interview process.  Feel lied to."

   BOLD training that emphasizes calling everyone you know, then cold-calling

They offer constant training for the infrastructure and base of your Company as an independent sales agent.,"Fees are a bit high, however I do not believe that they could offer the platform and technology without the current fee structure."
2767,Keller Williams,It's a greedy cult!,2016-10-06,1.0,,"As an agent, if you join in with a great team leader, it could be a good experience, lots of friends to be made. People are nice. Benefits at headquarters are excellent. In the field, no benefits. Your an independent contractor.","Everything about the company is a ""profit center"". How much can they suck out of the agents? Charge them for this and that and yes, the training and the coaching...it's going to cost you....$1000 a month! And what do the coaches do? Tell you to door knock, know your scripts. It's all so old school. It's all boils down to how much money can be sucked from the agents. And the other big goal is recruit, recruit, recruit. The Team Leaders, who consider themselves the CEOs of their office, are considered only ""recruiters"" at corporate. The top dogs are pulling in a half million a year, or more. The agents? Well, the turnover rate with agents is astronomical because most don't make enough to live.. Lastly, they say ""Christian values"" and what I've seen and learned, if they need to say it, it's probably not so."
2768,Keller Williams,Broker,2016-09-06,5.0,Real Estate Agent,Fantastic place to work and people are honest,hpusing market is very competitive

2770,Keller Williams,"Dont drink the Juice, not for new agents",2016-10-02,1.0,Real Estate Agent,"I don't know, I have not  experienced any pro. I feel they use Agents to promote their own Keller Williams Brand plus they charge agents to work for them so the more agents they have the more money they make.","This place is not for new agents, Keller Williams
recommends you to attend a series of free trainings, with the pretense you will become a better agent. However these trainings are previews of Paid trainings!! Again with the same excuse that it will help you

Not to mention that after every free training, they bring a third party vendor that tries to sell you something, again with the excuse that it will help you be a better agent. 

They charge you 89 dollars a month, just to work
for them and you get no leads no clients nothing. You are 100% on your own, plus 25 cents per
color print out copy. Finally the split is 36% of your commission for them 64% for you, until you Cap. This makes no sense cause, Keller Williams has nothing to do with you getting any sales or leads.  

Any Broker will hire an agent for free because its a Commission only job with no benefits, and perhaps even give you leads and a better split. Don't fall
in this place cause you will go broke buying their trainings and products and third party recommended products before you make any sales."

You are responsible for finding all your own clients and closing deals so if you aren't (politely) aggressive when it comes to sales, you won't find the success you might otherwise be able to.

The monthly fees are relatively cheap compared to other brokers. Everybody wants to see each other succeed. Awesome splits and profit sharing!,The only con that I've experienced is that in today's market everybody stays extremely busy so SOMETIMES the leader you are wanting to run a question by in the office will be busy but it's easy to find somebody else to answer you question if you can't wait.

2858,Keller Williams,Associate Broker,2016-06-13,5.0,Associate Broker,"Worked at Keller Williams Memorial in Houston, Texas under Michael Bossart, a most dynamic leader. If you are considering a career in Real Estate I would certainly choose his office. If you do not live in that state Keller Williams is the most dynamic, progressive company one could work for. Their leadership is outstanding, they are innovative and their training is first class. Plus their commission structure is the best.",I really don't have any cons about the company.

If you feel like a 60/40ish split is good and fair, by all means ignore my cons, but if that's an issue you should really check other places as some only have a 10% or even less split and cheaper monthly fee's.. training might not be that great but they don't rip you off.

Almost forgot, they have this referral program where if you can get an agent to sign up with KW they will give you a very small percentage a month of that person's sells for the life of that person's duration with the company, the more people you refer the bigger your monthly bonus check is (to me it's reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme to me)."

2891,Keller Williams,Phony people! Nearly all of them,2016-05-14,2.0,Real Estate Broker,"Excellent business building systems which, if applied correctly will work to build a successful business in any industry.","Company is filled with and tends to attract completely phony, two faced people who use everyone around them while under the pretense they care deeply for them.  Lots of smile in your face, talk behind your back little cliques. 98% are very low production and low quality agents who speak the language and try to mimic the top few agents in the company. Picture a child walking around in adults big shoes and hat pretending to be grown up. This is the environment of being around agents at kw. The recruiting concept looks good from the outside but in reality causes people to mislead others to want to join the company by highlighting the upsides and covering up all of the major down sides."
2892,Keller Williams,Associate Broker,2016-05-16,4.0,Associate Broker,"KW offered excellent training and was always willing to strive to stay current with the latest and greatest as far as technology and assistance with growing your business for their brokers.  They are a company that believes in the team system and they encourage you to build a team.  They have 2 big national education conferences every year, Mega Camp, and Family Reunion.  Both are fantastic and you get an opportunity to hear how the high producing and successful agents are having success.  Some of the speakers aren't even KW agents which I thought was very broad thinking and inclusive of the company.  You do get a sense of belonging to a family there which I really liked...a real estate sorority and fraternity if you will.  They give back to the community, and hold several events to raise money and build brand recognition and employee culture.  I would recommend KW to any new agent wanting to learn the business and get excellent training.  Almost all of the agents are willing to help and are very open about sharing their success strategies with you.  You also can earn additional money by recruiting more agents to join KW, and many people receive a residual income from just recruiting.","The only reason I decided to make move to another brokerage after being there for 5 years was that I was interested in making more money.  I got tired of paying franchise fees, royalty fees, and addl. insurance that I was required to get.  I am one of those type of agents that does not like being on a team, and I was not interested in growing a team either.  I""ve already been a licensed agent for over 12 years, so I felt I wasn't so new that I needed the training.  Already having a successful career, I felt that I didn't need the brand name either, and that it wasn't worth 35% of my paycheck.  I did end up going to a brokerage that that takes much less of a split, and as a business decision, it was the right thing for me to do.  It afforded me the opportunity to expand my business by advertising more with the money I was saving from the commission split.  I would go back to KW, if they considered changing their commission structure, but by the end of the 6 years, and $130K+ paid to KW, I felt like it was time to make myself some money, and not the KW big wigs. The culture has also suffered because the company has had difficulty getting agents to participate and engage in KW culture events.  There is also a sense of separation between the two offices there instead of a feeling of inclusiveness.  Many times the offices would not include one another in events and/or training."

They'll say anything to get you to join the office but don't stand by much of it.  I've seen management and staff use a different set of rules for those ""in the circle"" and another for those who are not.

There was a good emphasis on learning, continuing your education and growth as a person and agent with free courses, classes and groups coming together continually. There were no additional brokerage fees, as I've heard some other brokerages charge, unless u wanted one of the private offices.
For anyone just starting out, or looking to make a move in real estate, I highly recommend finding a Keller Williams office. The one I worked at was Keller Williams Realty SW in St. Louis, Mo.","There weren't any! Unless you don't like being a part of very togetherness type people..

Bob Baker as well as the other trainers are so informative and have a passion that is  contagious. Thank you Keller Williams","There are no cons for this company.

Every individual does a lot to keep this company going at the rate it is. There are at least a few people who probably do the work of two or three, by themselves.

The reason I was so interested in KW was their extensive and truly excellent training.,"Unfortunately, EVERYTHING at KW costs a great deal of money. Their monthly fees and everything else costs more than the average realtor can make in a year. It broke me. The biggest problem with this company is their MLM approach. They recruit like mad, leaving little to go around. Really? Advertising for Brokers on Craigslist?."
3162,Keller Williams,sales agent,2015-08-25,2.0,Real Estate Broker Associate Sales Agent,I have been an agent there since 2007.  It is a good place to work.,You get out of it what you put in.

3165,Keller Williams,Too Expensive and Too Many Better Choices,2015-08-15,3.0,Realtor,"The office is beautiful (but you pay for that with the terrible splits) and the people are nice and friendly.  Really the people are the best thing. However, working with nice, friendly people only goes so far and it doesn't pay the bills which is why so many people are leaving!","One of the most expensive brokers you can work for. Sure there is a lot of training but the most useful training, and any kind of real one on one assistance, costs extra. The splits are terrible - 60/40 when more progressive brokers with better technology and free leads are giving you 80/20. Free support, especially technical support, is almost non-existent. Keller Williams is all about recruiting and training and that's how they make a lot of their money. Once you're in, they turn their attention to getting more people in and selling you on all their expensive additional training. If you want to be in real estate to actually sell real estate, there are so many better choices.  If you do get in, be careful as it is nearly a cult and there will be people who show a whole different side if you ever try to leave."
3166,Keller Williams,Great Culture - Intense Training,2015-08-17,4.0,Realtor,"There's a real culture of sharing at KW. There are a lot of agents so it's easy to book open houses when you need one. There are a lot of things to love at KW. Company enthusiasm, encourages success, uplifting and supportive, constant classes on a rotating schedule as well as new classes and information, the staff is always working hard to improve the offerings. Offers Ignite Training to get an agent started in business. Strong Christian environment.","It's very much a sink or swim environment. There is no mentoring or hand holding. There is coaching done by 1 person who serves ALL the incoming agents. There is a compliance director who is available to answer questions. If you are lucky enough to hook up with a veteran agent who is willing to take you under their wing, DO IT! Heavy emphasis on growth spreads resources a little thin. You absolutely must go ask for/find/figure out what you need in order to succeed. Very aggressive sales culture. This is an expensive brokerage to be a part of, but if you are a go getter or you work with a team it might be worth it. Strong Christian environment."

KW is Agent-centric, meaning they are passionate about helping their agents succeed at high levels, and in return the company grows to new levels of success. It's been a dream of an organization to be a part of.","The cons of the job are related to starting off as basically a new business owner when first starting real estate.

3197,Keller Williams,Great Real Estate Company,2015-07-20,4.0,Realtor,Keller Williams offers great Profit sharing opportunities that no other real estate company offers.  They also offer one of the best splits with the agents. at 70/30 which after you pay in so much you cap and get to keep the rest of your checks.,If you are a brand new agent then Keller Williams is probably not the best fit for you.  They have decent training but it does not really compare to a lot of the other companies and how they train their new agents.
3198,Keller Williams,Agent-The Woodlands & Magnolia,2015-08-12,1.0,,Lots of information and extensive intranet,"Nickel & dime you to death with their fees. They give NOTHING for free. You even get charged $150 for your training binder which they do not tell you until you're in the office to sign the agreement. If I'd known how bad the training was, I would have chosen another brokerage. Might as well stay home and read the binder but they make you go to the classes to qualify for property time. 

Also, they take a percentage of your sales the first year right off the top for their so-called Coach whether you use her or not (she spends most of her time talking about how great she is and is impossible to get an appointment with). They even charge you to use their signs. Been there awhile and still can't figure out what exactly they are giving for all the fees they charge. There is a fee to belong to the Profit Share group ($25 per month), which creates the atmosphere of an MLM. 

Overall, a very greedy organization set up as almost a pyramid scheme."

3217,Keller Williams,IT Dept - Franchise Headquarters,2015-06-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"In most instances, you're given a great deal of autonomy and empowerment to accomplish your goals. Rapid growth has led to extraordinary opportunities for employees on all levels ... the current HR director was first hired as the lobby receptionist, for example. Upward mobility is a very real possibility for those who have ambition, ability, perseverance and enough self-awareness to navigate the politics.

There is an annual profit share bonus that generally pays out in the 20+% of your annual salary range at the end of the year. This is touted as a ""gift"", yet is factored into every salary negotiation (i.e., you'll basically be expected to accept a salary less than your actual worth with the expectation this bonus will make up for it at the end of the year, which it generally does).","The cult of personality reigns supreme at KW International. Department goals and objectives are regularly derailed by one manufactured crisis after another, more often than not the result of some well-connected person in the field calling in favors or making complaints. 

Staffing levels are almost comically insufficient to maintain our current technology offerings, and in no semblance of reality are they adequate to meet the stated goals of the organization moving forward. ""Work/Life Balance"" is a line they sell to the agents and franchise owners - expect to work 50-60 hour weeks, or see your annual reviews suffer. Participation in the constant events being hosted is mandatory: Two yearly conventions (one of which you must share a hotel room with a co-worker  for a week) as well as the constant events being held in Austin will entail a constant flood of requests for mandatory ""volunteers"" to participate. You will be clearing food off of tables, holding up signs, directing people to busses, holding microphones for attendees (and being derided publicly by the speaker if they think you aren't hustling enough) and other menial tasks regularly throughout the year. 

Leadership works on a ""chaos by design"" principle, which is basically a cover for ""making it up as we go"". Your priorities and focus will be in a constant state of change, partly due to lack of planning, partly due to what's ""hot"" at the moment (again, VIPs calling in favors), and partly due to an overloaded IT infrastructure that the organization has long since outgrown yet cannot be replaced due to lack of resources. 

If you crave working endless hours on largely undocumented 2008-era technologies that are constantly falling over dead, this is the place for you."
3218,Keller Williams,Agent,2015-07-07,3.0,Real Estate Agent,"Lots of training, tech tools, convenient office locations. Great for Super Top Producing Teams",Office politics. Team Leaders change 3x year - no one discusses why.  Little support for struggling agents.

After you ""CAP"", you get to keep 100% of your commission typically after the company earns somewhere between $20K and $45K
Competitive Splits pre ""Capping""","Individual offices can have dreadful management and cronyism
Some of the Managing Brokers are a bit too focused on spending as little time as possible advising their agents when legal issues crop up. Additionally, they utter the words "" Your client needs to hire an attorney"" a bit too often
There is a constant  & intense pressure on team leader to recruit any warm body. They will often focus on Quantity over Quality. In a booming market we end up with people who shouldn't be in sales. 
Some team leaders will try and ""steal"" people you have recommended so you don't get the downline, they do. This is highly  unethical.
Favoritism: The Team Leaders and Managing Brokers make money in their downline for folks they brought in. They therefore will provide incoming sales leads only to people in their downline.

Not enough leadership to help new realtors, even though the company sells itself on training."
3327,Keller Williams,20 Year Top Producer  Switched to KW and Loves it!,2014-12-27,5.0,Realtor,"After reading about the diverse interview experiences here it brings one thing to mind - they are as diverse as the people who interviewed them - and they sound like experiences you could have walking into ANY real estate company.  If you're newly licensed you want to feel listened to and have the interview be about you and all you can bring to that office.  But the reality is, EVERY broker wants you to sign with them - YOU are the commodity and they are trying to show you how their company is different and better than the next.  So look beyond that and start thinking in terms of who you are going to pick not who is going to pick you..  That being said, I was evaluating my options for a couple years - every company was a lateral move - until I learned about Keller Williams opening in my area.  I researched the company and got to know the people running this market center. I respected both.  Not only that, but HAND DOWN no other company offers anything close to the training Keller Williams does for either a new or seasoned agent to expand their business.  I was with another large franchise for 19 years and never heard one hour of the pragmatic, direct, 'hears how to do it' training KW offers regularly.  As for the pyramid 'scheme' - yes, they have an incentive program for bringing in other agents that can pay you dividends or life.  Smart people, because like I said, EVERY broker wants more agents.  That was the last consideration on my list.  If you're serious about selling real estate, don't worry about it - it's there, great, but focus on selling and getting all the raining you can.  The commission structure is amazing - and consistent around the country.   They can afford to offer the dividends for bringing in new agents because they run lean offices - and have a transparent, 'open book' policy for their market centers.  The broker owner is only allowed to keep a percentage of the center's profit.  Believe me - THAT is huge too - unheard of in most businesses. They also have a great website that puts your listings out across the internet to over 350 sites. I am as pleased as I hoped to be with my switch to KW.  Great people, great company that understands what agents really need to grow their business.","Everything can be a double-edged sword.  The company's 'putting agents first' policy means all of your advertising has YOUR contact information on it, not the companies - so your efforts come right back to you.  And they give you a greater share of the commission than most companies.  But that means you take on more of your own expenses - the initial outlay for signs, headshots, business cards, etc... as well as your on-going advertising expenses.  You have to plan for that."
