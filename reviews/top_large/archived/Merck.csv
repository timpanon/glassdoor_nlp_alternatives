There’s a lot of layers and stakeholders. Which makes for a conservative and risk-averse environment. That doesn’t mean that risk is intolerable — you just better have everything figured out before you move everything along with you. Poor ideas and poorly substantive work will be crushed before novel ideas ever take off. That said, the right ears will give novel ideals some serious wings. Currently, Merck is feeling out it’s positions in a lot of high value areas due to the changes experienced by the industry post-COVID.

It was discouraging to see great colleagues’ talent go unused and their drive to impact patients be neglected. Conversations in the labs rarely touched on scientific topics as people bided their time before the commute home, meetings focused on box-checking exercises to fulfill year-end goals, and managers closed their office doors to read the news and trade stocks. Over the course of 2018-2021, many experienced colleagues departed the company, leaving those content with the status quo and ensconcing a culture of indifference."

Phony reasons why publications are pushed back (Merck' agenda for postdocs: patent first, then publish... How's that supposed to work?)
Was part of a department where the majority of employees were laid off or managed out of the company (department was eventually closed). Hence, terrible atmosphere within the department.
Basically no one in the lab to work you in or support you.
After months of work and once you have great data, supervisor takes data and runs off to the boss to present work as his/her own.
More than 90% of postdocs from my year eventually left the company.

It also gives you a better perspective on the root-causes of health system inefficacies. It helps make better decisions for your career.","- Greedy, closed-mind, and suffocating research environment.

- UNETHICAL RESEARCH PRACTICES: they hire postdocs on the promise that the postdoc research is ""pre-proprietary"", meaning postdocs can publish their work (given that this is literally called a postdoc program, basically you whether care about publishing and accept half the salary of an employee and do more work than others, or you just go for the full salary and chill at Merck when postdocs do the research and you put your name on the paper because you can), however when results are obtained they will bake all sorts of distorted and lousy justifications why they won't allow you to publish your work. In my case I developed a mathematical model for protein aggregation based on the level-set formalism, even though there is literally not a single data point involved that was proprietary to Merck (all existing in published papers) my manager blocked me from publishing it on the grounds that this model belongs to Merck! When I quit from the miserable postdoc program with this guy, he is trying to publish my model with other ""co-authors"" and without me! This is called ""Ghost-writing"" and is unethical in academic systems. Yes I had written a draft for the paper too, and that's what they are stealing by putting their names on it. 

2- Lack of computational resources: their so-called ""HPC"" cluster is composed of ~7 GPUs, remember that in computational chemistry this is what a research lab in a typical University has in it's possession. At Merck, that's all they got!

3- Lack of computational scientists: what I learned was Merck is simply filled and governed by experimentalists. A director once was saying how they don't see computational work to contribute, but just a PR gesture for the outsiders."

Leaders leaving left and right all because they would rather cut people than reduvce costs in other ways.

1024,Merck,"Great Company, Challenging Market",2019-10-17,3.0,Senior Sales Professional,Merck is an excellent company with quality leadership.,"However, this industry and company has changed dramatically.  If you want to impact healthcare this is a great place to do it but understand there are significant challenges now that didn't exist just a few years ago: 
1. R&D is harder and more expensive, 
2. the public and most levels of government generally do not understand the complexity of healthcare at all and mostly think by simply passing a single piece of legislation all of healthcare's issues will be resolved (targeting pharmaceuticals), 
3. access to providers is 4x harder than it was 10 years ago, and 
4. the med-legal red tape just keeps getting deeper.  

Bottom line: this industry just went from ""easy / moderate"" to ""stressful"".  This industry is about to shrink a little in headcount and become a little leaner and more efficient.  The political climate may adversely impact the industry.  Hopefully not."

The people you need to help you with work or career development are often busy themselves. The result is that nobody seems to care about you or their jobs. My department was very specialized and so after a few years I felt I was stagnating, not learning anything new about the bigger picture. My coworkers are not super friendly.

It really is a special company culture at Merck, extremely professional but also collegial and collaborative. I only left for personal reasons and I would love to go back some day.","Almost all the commercial positions are headquartered in Kenilworth, NJ or Upper Gwynedd, PA I wish there were more commercial opportunities in other locations such as Boston or San Francisco. There are locations in these cities but mostly R&D or field positions. Some young or more diverse candidates are promoted too quickly(year or less) based on ""advocates"" and who they know but haven't worked with,  rather than actually being qualified for the role or for actually producing results.

This unfortunately results in many people who have not learned new skills and seem to be unmotivated to change themselves or their workstreams, which resulted in industry best-practices not being followed. It honestly felt like people at Merck operated in a bubble that was 15 years behind in digital marketing (saying this even taking into consideration legal pharma issues).

I found it was nearly impossible to move anything forward in an environment where there is so much bureaucracy, hierarchy, politics, and sensitivity. Co-workers often seemed to justify their jobs by strangle-holding their workstreams instead of collaborating openly and without ego.

It often feels like everyone is trying as hard as possible to not do anything, but still trying to appear as if they are doing something. The feeling of obfuscation is overwhelming.

The physical building culture is also not ideal - in an era where many offices are going remote, the Merck UG campus building remains something straight out of Office Space."
1062,Merck,Merck Sales Rep,2019-07-30,4.0,Chronic Care Representative,"Good job, freedom, a lot of perks and benefits.","Entry level salary is low for NYC.  Bonuses are good on paper, but get taxed at 50%"
1063,Merck,7 Years at Merck,2019-07-13,3.0,Senior Engineer,"A lot of opportunity -  I'm a chemical engineer in manufacturing. I've been fortunate enough to work on 5 unique processes in 7 years (both locally and internationally), and learn from some very bright people. 

Competitive salaries and  benefits, retirement retirement benefit specifically is better than competitive. The 401k would be decent on its own, and there is a pension on top of it.

Work-life balance is great in some departments

Ethical culture. Focus on serving patients (at least in manufacturing - I'm not in the rooms where they decide what we're going to charge for our products).","VERY VERY bureaucratic. Not sure why senior management thinks that the solution to every problem is  to create a new system with a complex approval process. And this bureaucratic culture is not just related to regulatory compliance (where bureaucracy is a given) . In at least one case there is a business approval process you need to follow before you are allowed to move on and then follow the compliance approval process (which includes another business approval). The bureaucracy permeates every aspect of live at Merck. 

A very conservative company. The first , second, and third instincts are to do it the way we've always done it. I don't think Merck is a place to go if you want to trail blaze. In most aspects of science and technology, Merck is 5-10 years behind. For example we just figured out monoclonal antibodies a few years ago (while everyone else was adopting them in the 90's).

Very silo-ed company. Different organizations are evaluated against very different criteria. Different departments all have their own agendas. It makes forming truly collaborative and cross functional teams difficult.

Work-life balance is not always great. I listed this as a pro too as it very's by department. I've had 4 distinct rolls at the company.  2 were predominantly low stress with roughly 40hr work weeks. The other 2 were much worse. Under 50hrs was a good week, 60+ was frequent. Pressure from management can become intense, and when projects are managed badly the first thing to get sacrificed is always the private lives and well being of those at the bottom of the org structure. The sacrifice is not always rewarded either.  

There is a bit of perverse incentive in the way the company handles it's best employees. When you are identified as an ambitions and talented employee you are usually sent off to work on projects that have fallen behind - the idea being you can ride over the hill on a white horse and save the project. The problem is that those projects usually fall behind because they have bad management and bad cultures (i.e. not because of problems one person can step in fix no matter how talented they are), or just because they're ""behind"" goals that were never realistic in the first place. Being sent off to those projects is not exactly a reward worth working hard for.

Top down decision making, thus decision makers are out of touch with the the actual consequences of their decision (a problem that I'm sure most large companies have) 

Health benefits are a little below average"

Merck is new to oncology and the middle managers don't understand the complexity of oncology trials. I was assigned to so many sites and different protocols, that it was hard to keep up, even if with working 60-80  hours a week. I worried about the quality of the research, as systems were very old and the way of conducting the research was old as well. Sites I took over from other CRAs had huge data backlog. Instead of managing the sites and doing quality research, I was reviewing data from the past months and was resolving old issues. I brought this to the attention of my manager, and what bothered me the most was indifference. The supervisor of the managers had the same attitude and during the calls was more concerned about keeping the agenda than answering questions from the CRAs. This is the company where the CRAs were treated with the least respect. I left the company in less than a year. Quality of the research was my main concern."

1690,Merck,Sorry to say I once worked there....,2016-11-18,1.0,Senior Scientist,The company portrays that they have great benefits.  However once you looking into each of their benefits you quickly realize they have these sneaky little policies to offset them.  Take for instance they offer life insurance but it ends when you turn 65.  Than their Long term disability plan is a welfare funded plan so anything you collect on LTD you have to pay the company back entirely for the amount.  They have gotten working women awards but I have no idea how as 400 female employees have a class action lawsuit for discriminating and not paying them the same as their male peers.  Their benefits appear to be good but look into each and you will quickly find that they are some of the worst out there.  A very sneaky and unethical company.

In addition, being a manager at Merck means absolutely nothing, which is definitely not the norm - usually, going somewhere and being a manager has a certain power and responsibility with it, but at Merck it just means you're expected to work 16 hours/day, and whatever weekend you're needed, and be grateful.

Diversity in color only and not in new or innovative ideas.  Company actions does not match it's mission statement.  This is a busy-work organization that will spend millions on an idea for different process managements to then dump them in less than a year.  Promotions are usually done by ""pass the trash"", meaning the people no one wants in their organizations get promoted just to get rid of them from their department.  The results of this are having the worst quality people with the least to offer being the company ""leaders"".  I watched them fire their best and most productive people year after year.  If you had high sales achievement, you could bet you would be the next person fired...I mean only if you were not a protected class. Protected class=unethical actions allowed, but I guess that's true in all companies.  It got to the point at Merck if you were still employed there it meant you were incompetent.

Flexible schedule for unexpected life events (depending on your supervisor).  Mine is good.
Job Security.  Plenty of work and more coming.  Seems to be very stable right now (2016).
Very good group of worker is the Quality Department.  Good people.
New department leadership that seem to have things moving in the right direction.
Positive outlook on future opportunities and movement within Merck-Wilson.  Not right now though.
The year end bonus is very consistent as long as you don't get in the bottom range of the peers for the year end review.  You know what you will get for the most part.","At this time, there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement within Merck-Wilson.  It's looking better but not there.  Often management will hire from outside when there are capable and qualified internal candidates.

Medical benefits have taken a huge decline over the last 2 years.  The employee cost continues to rise as well as deductibles while the benefits and coverage are much less.

Prescription drug coverage also have declined over the past several years.  Same as above.

Year end raises are typically around 2% at best for employee that meet expectations.  Some will get up to 4.5% if they are top performers but that is a very few number of people.

The year end bonus is consistent as stated above, but even if you have a very good year the individual contributor effect on the bonus is small.  Meaning that you will receive the close to your median bonus no matter how you perform.  Unless you are a top performer.  That seems to make a substantial difference.  Note that top performers are very few.

The end of year review is on a bell curve.  Meaning that if there are 2 top performers in your level, then there have to be 2 bottom performers (even if the 2 put in the bottom did a good job).  This makes no sense to me and demoralizes the workforce to a point.

In the past, Merck wanted to be head and shoulders above the other companies in the area as far as pay and benefits.  Now they seem happy with status quo and have reduced benefits and target salaries to be in the 50th percentile.   

There is a tremendous workload for the number of employees in the Quality department.  It is often very difficult to get it all done in a day or work week.  This could be looked at as job security or not..  Note that this has gotten better over the last year.

Addition to above note.  Note that many of the employees are salaried and work unpaid overtime to get the work complete.  Note that this is still an issue but it has also gotten much better.  Two years ago it was out of hand."

There is no indication the company values its scientists considering how much ""belt tightening"" they've done . 

Constant reorganization and layoff leads to uncertainty and low morale. 

Generally a poor place to try to establish a career. The only value Merck really has to workers is their name on our resume when you search for a new job."
2102,Merck,So Much Potential...,2015-08-17,1.0,Quality Specialist,"Merck is such a massive beast of a company with many brilliant minds. They offer competitive pay, but recently that comes with a price. The folk at the West  Point site characteristics range, but most are very professional even within the union. If you are at the manager-director level there are many areas for career advancement/lateral movement.","As I mentioned Merck is a massive beast, when it comes to communication or changes you are met with stubborn heads. There is a direct disconnection between what occurs on the shop floor and the directing level (some areas managerial level). Unless there is a FDA or a post inspection observation, there is a low change of change being implemented; and if it is implemented it's a painfully long poorly communicated process. 
Due to lay offs the work environment has become pretty aggressive within the past 2-3 years. 
Not much opportunity for forward career growth
Most Worker come in, do their time and leave; very little unity or outside work inclusion. I've been told, in the past this was very different. People would be so close to their coworkers they'd be at each others weddings. 
When I first started at Merck, the work flexibility was second to none. When it snowed my manager would recommend to work from home. Only one year later that changed dramatically, as I was so overwhelmed with work, I would miss family events, planned events on late week days, and even Dr appointments purposely scheduled very late in the day. If you have no children and are just breaking into the biotech world this is great place to gain experience, skills and networking."
2103,Merck,Fantastic work culture,2015-07-13,5.0,Group Leader & Principal Scientist,My colleagues in the Discovery & Non Clinical Development group were nothing short of stellar.

You can expect someone will try to throw you under the bus if something goes awry.  You can also expect  that you will not get compensated when you inherit a role (or 2) from someone who got laid off.  

There is minimum support on projects/tests because everyone else is inundated with other projects.  As a result, obtaining results/answers/responses are delayed and the work hours are long and intense."

2307,Merck,"West Point, PA.  Toxic work atmosphere",2015-02-12,2.0,Technical Engineer,"Large site, many good people and opportunities.","At the time I was there, before the most recent cutbacks, there was an undercurrent of poor attitude.  Never encountered an atmosphere of disrespect and a lack of willingness to assist a new employee.  Honestly felt there was something wrong on the second day of orientation.  The attitude and treatment of the people was a real eye opener.  I would imagine it has gotten worse with the recent cutbacks.

It had been a sterling company growing up in the area.  The quote ""All that glitters is not gold"" rings true."
2308,Merck,"Great company, but there is room for improvement",2015-02-13,4.0,Director,"Excellent colleagues who are hard-working, professional and ethical;  Good work-life balance; Compensation is quite good;  Benefits (pension, 401K, medical, etc.) are quite good as well.  Very inclusive of people with different backgrounds, interests, preferences.","Functional expertise and experience is the name of the game.  Partly due to senior leadership changes and downsizing, when hiring for mid-level and up positions, if you don't have a lot of experience in the function, they won't even consider you.  Cross-functional knowledge and leadership skills are not valued.  This makes getting assignments and promotions in anything but the functional area you start in very, very difficult."

IT is establishing multiple ""technology hubs"" overseas, hiring new employees there, and firing them here.  This is separate from the off-shoring to third party vendors. Nothing but constant cutbacks year by year.  Annual merit increases fall well below the annual cost of living increases as well.  If you are an IT/quality assurance professional, AVOID Merck."

The insurance benefits are also terrific.","There is a lack in managerial organization and ease of advancement.  There is a gaping disconnect between the goals and regulations mandated by upper management and the information given to employees in order to reach these goals.  There is also a severe lack of employee morale, and management has not yet found a way to show employees appropriate appreciation, nor purge the department of its exasperated attitude.

There is also clear evidence to show that, at least within this department, that advancement is nearly impossible.  I have colleagues 10+ years my senior who are still doing the same job I am, or worse yet, used to have more clout and responsibility and now are back doing their entry level jobs."
